<p>Since you are getting a unknown error, there is something going wrong with I/O. My guess is the db underneath has troubles handling the amout of data. May try to split up in batches with a maximum of 10k each.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A transaction can fail for reasons not tied to a particular IDBRequest. For example due to IO errors when committing the transaction, or due to running into a quota limit where the implementation can't tie exceeding the quota to a partcular request. In this case the implementation MUST run the steps for aborting a transaction using the transaction as transaction and the appropriate error type as error. For example if quota was exceeded then QuotaExceededError should be used as error, and if an IO error happened, UnknownError should be used as error. </p>

<p>you can find this in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#transaction-concept" rel="nofollow">specs</a></p>

<p>An other possibility, do you have any indexes defined on the objectstore? Because for every index you have, that index needs to be maintained with every insert. </p>
