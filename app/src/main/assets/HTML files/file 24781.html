<p>I think a for-loop would over-complicate things. You could instead write a few statements to translate between <code>screen space</code> and <code>board space</code>. </p>

<p>Say your screen space is <code>800px</code> by <code>600px</code> and you have a <code>10 x 10</code> game board represented by a 2-dimensional array: <code>board[10][10]</code>. Let's also say that you start drawing the board at a <code>10px</code> offset from <code>0,0</code> and your board is <code>500px</code> wide. In this case you know how much screen space each cell on your board occupies:</p>

<pre><code>int boardScreenWidth = 500;
int cellWidth = boardScreenWidth / boardWidth;
           // = 500px / 10 
           // = 50px
</code></pre>

<p>Start by ignoring clicks that don't touch the board:</p>

<pre><code>int boardStartX = 10; 
if (mouseX &lt; boardStartX || mouseX &gt;= boardStartX + boardScreenWidth)
  return; // The user clicked somewhere to the left or right of the board
</code></pre>

<p>Then, if the click was on the board, you will need to adjust the mouse position based on the board's offset from 0 (so that clicking at <code>x=10px</code> is like clicking at <code>x=0</code> in terms of the board's position). With this information it becomes easy to translate an x-coordinate in screen space to an index in <code>board</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int mouseX = 320; // user clicked at x=320
mouseX = mouseX - boardStartX; // adjust based on board's position
int boardX = mouseX / cellWidth;
        // = 310 / 50
        // = 6
</code></pre>

<p>You could find <code>boardY</code> similarly and then access the cell that was clicked at <code>board[boardX][boardY]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To get screen coordinates from an index in your <code>board</code>, use the same logic above but solve for <code>mouseX</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int boardX = (mouseX - boardStartX) / cellWidth;
// ==&gt; boardX * cellWidth = mouseX - boardStartX
// ==&gt; (boardX * cellWidth) + boardStartX = mouseX
// or...
int screenX = boardStartX + (boardX * cellWidth);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is the edge of the cell. The entire cell will span from <code>screenX</code> to <code>screenX + cellWidth</code>. The center of the cell is at <code>screenX + cellWidth / 2</code></p>
