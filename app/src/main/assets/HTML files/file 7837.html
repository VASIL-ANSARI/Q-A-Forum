<p>Try <code>string row = ds.Tables[0].Rows[0].ToString()</code></p>

<p>If you want to display something more custom I'd advise</p>

<pre><code>DataRow row = ds.Tables[0].Rows[0];

string summary = "Field1 = " + row["Field1"] + "; Field2 = "+ row["Field2"]; //etc
</code></pre>

<p>I would also ask myself why I have a variable in memory containing 37k rows and if that's the only way to achieve what I need.</p>
