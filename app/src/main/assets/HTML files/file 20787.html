<p>Yes indeed, the application Exceptions and HTTP Response error codes are two different things. </p>

<p>You can adapt the code like below, so that you have access to the <code>requestUri</code>.
I guess you can find the content type based on it. I know its crude but I don't think we have alternate solution:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = "/404", method = RequestMethod.GET)
@ResponseBody
public ResponseEntity&lt;ErrorResponse&gt; error404(HttpServletRequest request) {

    ErrorResponse errorBody = new ErrorResponse(404, "Resource Not Found!");

    String requestUri = request.getRequestURI();

    return new ResponseEntity&lt;ErrorResponse&gt;(errorBody, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
}
</code></pre>

<p>From the example I presume your application is REST service, then probably you could refer to <a href="http://www.stormpath.com/blog/spring-mvc-rest-exception-handling-best-practices-part-2" rel="nofollow">this link on how 404 is handled</a> in a REST full service.</p>
