<p>the best is to alter your table and set utf8 for your needed columns instead of everytime converting them</p>

<pre><code>    ALTER TABLE t MODIFY old_text CHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8;
    ALTER TABLE t MODIFY rev_timestamp CHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8;
    ALTER TABLE t MODIFY rev_user_text CHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8;
</code></pre>

<p>and then select them normal.</p>

<pre><code>select old_text  as text, rev_timestamp  as ts, rev_user_text as user 
from revision;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>note:</strong> about char(50) change it to your needs.</p>
