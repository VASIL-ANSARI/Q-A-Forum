<p>Yes and no, it's actually listed on their roadmap as:
<a href="http://tools.android.com/roadmap" rel="nofollow">Better refactoring support</a></p>

<p>Believe it or not, the refactoring/renaming support has actually gotten better over the last couple of weeks. Until very recently, it was still making mistakes when replacing class names and package names in the Manifest file (whenever some Activity file name was being refactored/renamed). But lately, I haven't been getting these errors, and I'm very happy that this isn't a manual step I have to do anymore.  </p>

<p>You can also check out their bug tracker at:
