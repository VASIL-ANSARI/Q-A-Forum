<p>I haven't tried SMS with PHP but my guess is that it is the same as writing TCP socket servers...the reason you app requires a refresh is because after sending the SMS the PHP script reaches its exit point. Try wrapping the connection code in an infinite while loop that only breaks if an error occurs or on any special event...don't forget to set the execution timeout to 0 with set_time_limit(0) at the first line of the page.</p>
