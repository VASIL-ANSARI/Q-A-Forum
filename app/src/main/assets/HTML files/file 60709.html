  <p>After digging a little bit, I find that it is simply a difference of
  the two different builds of Bluebird. The unminified build emits
  warnings, but the minified build does not. Is there a reason for this?</p>

<p>This is done because the unminified version is considered the "debug" version of the library that developers will use when writing and doing initial testing and is easier to step through with a debugger.  It is designed to be verbose with warnings to tell a developer when they might have done something wrong.</p>

<p>The minified version is like the "production" version of the library that is optimized for space and there's generally no point in having the production version of your app emit warnings to the user's console.</p>

<p>In the C/C++ world, this is analogous to a debug version of a DLL and an optimized version of a DLL.  The debug version would contain things like <code>ASSERT()</code> to inform a developer if something was not as it should be, the optimized version would not.</p>
