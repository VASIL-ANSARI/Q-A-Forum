<p>After having a bit of a look at the source, it seems you'll have to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.event._dpCache[$('.date-pick')[0]._dpId]._applyRenderCallbacks()
</code></pre>

<p>or possibly this:</p>

<pre><code>$.event._dpCache[$('.date-pick')[0]._dpId]._rerenderCalendar()
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$.event._dpCache[$('.date-pick')[0]._dpId]</code> part is used to get the first internal DatePicker object matching the css <code>'.date-pick'</code>, which is needed to access the internal <code>_applyRenderCallbacks</code> and <code>_rerenderCalendar</code> functions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this does access the internal structure of the plugin, so it is possible it might break when new versions are released, however I couldn't find any publicly accessible way to refresh the calendar.</p>
