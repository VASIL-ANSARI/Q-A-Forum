<p>When you build OpenSSL on Windows with Visual Studio, the symbols file for the library is named <code>lib.pdb</code>, and it's located in the <code>tmp32</code> directory, so you might need to manually copy it into the <code>out32</code> directory.</p>

<p>This was true for the Win32 configuration as of version 1.0.0g; it's possible that that's changed since then, and it's possible it might be different for Win64.</p>
