<p>I found that the fact the pixel buffer object was referenced to the CUDA code was irrelevant. It was simple enough to simply make a    glReadPixels(0,0,DIM,DIM,GL_RBGA,GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,&amp;bucketofdata) call. The trouble I had which I still have not completely answered to myself is why the above call would fail if bucketofdata is initialised using malloc and only works if it is declared as GLubyte bucketofdata[DIM*DIM*sizeof(uchar4)]. </p>
