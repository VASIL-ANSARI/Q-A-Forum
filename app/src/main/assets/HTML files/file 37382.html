<p>Why is your "initialization" cycle jumps over 4 string pointers at each iteration</p>

<pre><code>for(i=0;i&lt;records;i=i+4)
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>This cycle will initialize only <code>records / 4</code> elements in the <code>db</code> array. I.e. the final value of <code>j</code> will tell you how many elements in <code>db</code> have meaningful <code>student_ID</code> values. (And which will be only <code>1</code>, since as Alef noted in his answer, you reset the value of <code>j</code> on each iteration of "initialization" cycle).</p>

<p>Later you print <code>STUDENTS</code> elements. <code>STUDENTS</code> and  the final value of <code>j</code> are unrelated. What if <code>STUDENTS</code> is greater than <code>j</code>? Expectedly, you will print complete garbage from uninitialized elements of <code>db</code>.</p>
