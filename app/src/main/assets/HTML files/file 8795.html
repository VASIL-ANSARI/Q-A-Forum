<p>See if this solve your problem,</p>

<pre><code>[UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:NO];

<p><strong>Another way:</strong><br>
You can save the previous slider value, and when you change the slider, get the difference between the previous and current slider values, and using that difference calculate the new transformation relative to the previous transformation. For example, if the previous slider value is 0.01 and the current slider value is 0.02, the difference is 0.01 so add 4.0 to the tx and add -10 to ty.</p>
