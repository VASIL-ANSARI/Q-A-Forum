<p>I'm not sure if my experience helps but at least it provides a reference.
My environment is a linux x86 PC (linux 2.6) + eclipse 3.2 + j2se 1.4.2_09
I downloaded javatv 1.0 / 1.1 source codes of reference implementation from sun.</p>

<p>You can create a project in eclipse where imports all source codes.
Please fix all possible errors (if any). Usually if there are some, just comment them.</p>

<p>Finally, please export the project as a jar file.</p>

<p>You can then create another project and configure the build path, click "import external jars" to import the generated javatv jar.
Now you can create your own xlet by creating a java file which implements javax.tv.Xlet.xlet interface in the same project.</p>

<p>To execute the xlet, you need to implement main method and create
an instance of SIEmulator (assume myemulator). And then you can call
myemulator.putResidentXlet() and fill name / path of the xlet in.
Finally please go to the output folder (which contains the compiled class file of the source codes, usually folder "bin"), type
"java -Djava.class.path="path of the javatv jar" class_containing_main_method </p>

<p>Note that the xlet executed is NOT in a service context. If you wish to run in a service context, you either need to modify codes in com.sun.tv.XletManager.java to fill a service context object for the xlet or put the xlet's info in javatv's SI source, an xml file. Default is "JavaTVSampleFile01.xml". The usage please refer to javatv's documents.</p>
