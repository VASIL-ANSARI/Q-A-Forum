<p>The IInvokeProvider interface is part of the System.Windows.Automation family of namespaces also referred to as <strong>WUIA (Windows User Interface Automation)</strong>. WUIA is meant to support accessibility clients (screen readers and the like) to support for example blind users. The <strong>IInvokeProvider.Invoke() method is invoking the default action</strong> on the implementing UI element. In your case the default action on a button is the click event.</p>

<p>You will have to invoke Mouse events using a different interface.</p>
