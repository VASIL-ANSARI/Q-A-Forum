<p>Do you want to change your Email signature in O365 ? AFAIK, REST API doesn't support that . You could try to use EWS Managed API to add an email signature to an email for use with Exchange server, it includes Exchange Online as part of Office 365.Please click <a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/office/Exchange-2013-Add-da090bce" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details and demo.
Hope it helps.</p>
