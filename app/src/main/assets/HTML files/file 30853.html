<p>The way I would suggest to achieve what are you trying to do is to register to listen for the CONTROL_ACTIVE_POWER_SAVE_MODE_STATUS_CHANGED_INTENT.  When you receive that it will tell you the current status of the active power save mode.  Save this to a member variable in your extension and check that to disable/enable the back key.</p>
