<p>Looks like you're working in "root" (localhost?), where absolute links are fine, but when the site gets set up at your school's server, then absolute links point to the school's domain instead of the subdirectory where your project is.</p>

<p>What you need is using <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag in combination with relative links. Note that it may mess up your css/js/images, so you'd need to update all paths to be relative (not starting with <code>/</code>). Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;base href="http://example.com/"/&gt;
[...]
&lt;a href="dir/page.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The link above would point to <code>http://example.com/dir/page.html</code>. Basically, setting an URL in <code>base</code> tag sets what is the "root" of your website, and all relative links will respect it. You can store the value of <code>base</code> in your site's config and echo it in the template, so when your site is set up on another server you'd update the config file and all links/images/css/etc would work.</p>
