<p>There is no discrepancy in total number of instance methods of Ruby <code>Float</code> class (of same version). The number may vary based on Ruby version, but no two same Ruby versions will have different instance methods.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have seen the count of Float instance methods as 201</p>

<p>What you are seeing is the total number of instance methods of Extended Float class. The extension is done by Rails.</p>

<p>For example, in Rubymonk terminal, instance methods list of Float class shows <code>duplicable?</code> in their list, which is obviously is not an instance method of Float class. It's implemented in <code>ActiveSupport</code> by extending the core <code>Object</code> class and is deprecated after Rails 3.2.13.</p>
