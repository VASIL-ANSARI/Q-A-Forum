<p>The image is a binary data. You can't display it directly in your page. You have to have an IMG tag in your page with its <strong>src</strong> attribute set to another method in your struts action which retrieves the image id (appended at the end of the image url in src property), fetches the given image and sends it to the client using an appropriate mime/type. So the sequence would be as follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>You fetch your data (company information) from data base</li>
<li>Implement a method which given a company name (id is preferred if you have), that loads the company image from DB and writes it down to the response output stream with an appropriate mime-type (something like the one mentioned by @Guillaume) </li>
<li>Generate an appropriate <strong>img</strong> element on your result page (the page which displays company information) and set is src property to the url of the action developed in step 2. Make sure you pass company name (or id) as a query string parameter</li>
</ol>
