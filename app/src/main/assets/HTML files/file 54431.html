<p>You can monitory GPU memory with the command  <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface" rel="nofollow">nvidia-smi</a></p>

<p>It looks like your GPU does not support the later versions of CUDA required to run tensorflow. You can check <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus" rel="nofollow">CUDA-Enabled GeForce Products</a></p>

<p>From your output it looks like tensorflow is smart enough to not use the GPU, so either your model / batch size is too big for your RAM or you have a memory leak.</p>

<p>Try running running session with log_device_placement=True to see what tensorflow is doing step by step, while running 'top' to monitor memory?  </p>

<pre><code>    with tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True)) as sess:
