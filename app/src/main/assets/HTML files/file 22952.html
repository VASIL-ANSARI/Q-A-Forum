<p>Have you tried editing the value in <code>dfs-runtime.properties</code>?  I don't think the timeout can be context-specific, but you should be able to change it for the client as a whole.</p>

<p>"Please see the <em>Server runtime startup settings</em> section of the Deployment guide.</p>

<p>The following list describes the precedence that <code>dfs-runtime.properties</code> files take depending on their location:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>local-dfsâruntime.properties</code> file in the local classpath</li>
<li>runtime properties file specified with <code>âDdfs.runtime.properties.file</code></li>
<li><code>dfsâruntime.properties</code> packaged with <code>emcâdfsârt.jar</code></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, settings in the <code>local-dfsâruntime.propertie</code>s file on the local classpath will take precedence of identical settings in the <code>dfsâruntime.properties</code> file that is located in <code>emcâdfsârt.jar</code> or the one specified with the <code>âD</code> parameter. The DFS application must be restarted after any changes to the configuration. As a best practice, use the provided configuration file that is deployed in the <code>emcâdfsârt.jar</code> file for your base settings and use an external file to override settings that you specifically wish to change."</p>
