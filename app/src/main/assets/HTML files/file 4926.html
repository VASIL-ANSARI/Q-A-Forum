<p>Two major problems here. </p>

<p>1). The output of a request like this is completely arbitrary and not even guaranteed. It's the server's concern.</p>

<p>2). Regex is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">not a suitable means</a> for parsing HTML or any similar structure because it is not a regular grammar. Your best bet assuming you have any kind of reliability in your response at all is to rely on something like the <a href="http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">HtmlAgilityPack</a> to enforce a rigourous XHTML document (may not be required if you're lucky) and read that as an XML document with XPath queries to pull out the content you're interested in.</p>
