<p>The static method that executes is based on the static type, not the instance type:</p>

<p><code>Outers.Inner1 in=new Outers.Inner2();</code></p>

<p>So when you call this line, the static type is <code>Outers.Inner1</code> and therefore it calls the display method that's part of this class, which calls itself repeatedly (causing the <code>StackOverflowError</code>.)</p>
