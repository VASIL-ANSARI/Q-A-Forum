<p>You can only use colums that are in your <code>FROM</code> clause. So, your query should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TSR.Merchant_id, SD.denomination, SUM (SD.no_of_cards)
  FROM sales_details SD
  JOIN sales_header TSR on SD.invoice_od = TSR.invoice_id
 WHERE entered_by = (
                  (SELECT account_code
                     FROM bk_dsr_account_codes
                    WHERE user_name = 'C'
                      AND PASSWORD = 'D'
                      AND mobile_no = '8994035090213391259'))
           AND entered_date BETWEEN (TO_DATE ('2013/04/01', 'yyyy/mm/dd')
                                    )
                                AND (TO_DATE ('2013/06/30', 'yyyy/mm/dd')
                                    )
GROUP BY SD.denomination
</code></pre>
