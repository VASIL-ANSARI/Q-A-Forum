<p>Wide character strings are composed of multi-byte characters, whereas the normal C string is a char* - a sequence of byte-wide characters. Wchars are not the same thing as unicode on all platforms, though unicode representations are typically based on wchar_t</p>

<p>I've seen wchars used in embedded systems like phones, where you want filenames with special characters but don't necessarily want to support all the glory and complexity of unicode.</p>

<p>Typical usage would be converting a 2-byte based string to a regular C string, and vica versa</p>
