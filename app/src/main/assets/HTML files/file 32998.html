<p><strong>Long</strong>: All the requests you send to the Drive server are only executed if the provided authentication token is valid and it allows the action to be performed. To put an authentication token in the request you need to obtain it first. This can be done through the <strong>OAuth2</strong> flow only. And the OAuth2 authentication implementation by Google requires your app to be registered so that a token can be issued to that app. To register and identify your app you need the <strong>SHA1</strong> of the certificate the app was signed with.</p>
