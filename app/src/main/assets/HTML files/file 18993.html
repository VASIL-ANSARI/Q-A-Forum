<p>If I understand the problem correctly, you don't surf through the List, and that's why you're trying to detect collision with only one element. Try:</p>

<pre><code>while (woodSprites.hasNext()) {
    if (bombSprite.collidesWith(woodSprites)) {
        Log.e("Frame", "Collision");
        removeFace(woodSprites);
    }
}
</code></pre>
