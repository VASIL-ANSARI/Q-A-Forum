<p>There is no strict technical reason, but it is quite idiomatic to keep the code outside functions as short as possible. Specifically, putting the code into the module scope would turn the variables <code>grammar</code>, <code>opts</code> and <code>args</code> into global public variables, even though they are only required inside the main code. Furthermore, using a dedicated <code>main</code> function simplifies unit-testing this function.</p>
