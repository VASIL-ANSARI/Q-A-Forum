<p>No this is not possible - user can only change their language in the settings.</p>

<p>However you can give the user an "English" keyboard if you choose (or ask them their preference) </p>

<p>you do this using: UIKeyboardTypeASCIICapable</p>

<p>You can change keyboard directly on the keyboard by pressing "globe icon" on the bottom row. </p>

<p>First, you have to enable those language for input in Settings. Then pressing the globe button on the keyboard would toggle between those languages.</p>
