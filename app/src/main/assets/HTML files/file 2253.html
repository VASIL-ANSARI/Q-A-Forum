<p>According to a <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/typekit/topics/use_far_future_expires_headers_for_better_caching" rel="nofollow"><strong>posting on their getsatisfaction.com account</strong></a>, they have at least some caching in place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing to note is that although the fonts are served with an Expires header, they're also served with an Etag. The browser is required to make a request after 5 minutes, but will normally use the Etag to generate a 304 (Not Modified) response - meaning, the fonts aren't actually downloaded again.</p>

<p>can you check what happens using Firebug?</p>
