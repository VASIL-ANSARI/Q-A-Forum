<p>It's the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686615%28VS.85%29.aspx">CoCreateInstance()</a> function.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is convenient to use
  CoCreateInstance when you need to
  create only a single instance of an
  object on the local machine. If you
  are creating an instance on remote
  computer, call CoCreateInstanceEx.
  When you are creating multiple
  instances, it is more efficient to
  obtain a pointer to the class object's
  IClassFactory interface and use its
  methods as needed. In the latter case,
  you should use the CoGetClassObject
  function.</p>

<p>You'll need to #include &lt;Objbase.h&gt; and you'll need to link to ole32.lib</p>
