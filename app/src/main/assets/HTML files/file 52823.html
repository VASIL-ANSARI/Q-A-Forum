<p>i had the same problem a few days ago. This is because the new support library have new changes for the RecyclerView and the most important for your case is the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RecyclerView.LayoutManager no longer ignores some RecyclerView.LayoutParams settings, such as MATCH_PARENT in the scroll direction.</p>
  
  <p>Note: These lifted restrictions may cause unexpected behavior in your layouts. Make sure you specify the correct layout parameters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you should review your .xml in order to use the correctly height and width that before was ignoring it.</p>

<p>You can see more of the changes in this new version of the library <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/es/tools/support-library/index.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>
