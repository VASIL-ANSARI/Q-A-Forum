<p>In your query - perhaps add the Include method:</p>

<pre><code>var super = mh.Supermarkets.Include("City1")
</code></pre>

<p>Because EF doens't know it has to get data from the "City" table. If the query uses a field from the City table, you don't have to include <code>Include("City")</code> - EF can then detect that you need data from the table, thus it automaticly loads the City table</p>
