<p>Most probably it's a good idea to write while reading/parsing to save memory</p>

<pre><code>with open('out.csv', 'wb') as outfile:
  with open(ctlLst[-1], 'rb') as csvfile:
    csvReader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    csvWriter = csv.writer(outfile)
    csvReader.next()
    for row in csvReader:
      row[6] = int(row[6]) # assumed as int
       if row[6] &gt; counter:
         row[6] -= counter
      outfile.writerow(row)
</code></pre>
