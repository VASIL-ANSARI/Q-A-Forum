<p>If you want to have the ability to communicate with your subprocess its best to use <code>subprocess.popen</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen</a></p>

<p>This way you can create a stdin and stout to communicate with the process. As shown in the link above you simply add them to the popen argument:</p>

<pre><code>subprocess.Popen(args, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
</code></pre>

<p>There is also <code>popen.communicate(input= 'your input')</code>.</p>

<p>That will wait for the command to finish. </p>
