<p>I would suggest removing your empty view from the current layout file, and move it into its own dedicated layout file. Then inflate this new layout in your class when you want to use it as an empty view. The end result would be something like this (not compiled, coding from memory):</p>

<pre><code>final View v = LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.empty_view, null); 
mListview.setEmptyView(v);
</code></pre>

<p>or maybe</p>

<pre><code>final View v = LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.empty_view, mListview, false); 
mListview.setEmptyView(v);
</code></pre>
