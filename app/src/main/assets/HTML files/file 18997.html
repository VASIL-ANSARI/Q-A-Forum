<p>I'll answer my own question so that anyone searching can find it useful. The basic point to understand is that there is no way to compile all the files seperately and then group them into java packages(If there are elements that need to go to same java packages). So, the only way left is to isolate all the types that are causing the problem (as I explained, there are multiple definitions for some types) and do custom binding for them(I used external binding with a *-bindings.xml file). Be careful with enums as they were causing most of the problems(type, naming and so I had to custom map all values for each enum)</p>

<p>Lesson learnt: If your XSD files are shit, you will have hard time binding them</p>
