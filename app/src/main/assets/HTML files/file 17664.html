<p>If this is in an activity class then just use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#findViewById%28int%29" rel="nofollow">findViewById(int id)</a>. If the method returns null then you can assume that the footer has not been added.</p>

<p>If this is a fragment class, then you can store the View that you return in your onCreateView() method as a data member of your fragment class.  Then it works the same way, except you will call findViewById() on the View that you saved.</p>

<pre><code>LinearLayout footer = (LinearLayout) findViewById(footerId);
if (footer == null)
{
    //add the footer
}
else
{
    //Update the footer
}
</code></pre>
