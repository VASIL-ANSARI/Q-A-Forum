<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.uploadfile.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.Net.WebClient.UploadFile</a>() can upload a file to a URL.</p>

<p>If you wanted to either upload multiple files, or to have other non-file parameters in the request, see the accepted answer to this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/566462/upload-files-with-httpwebrequest-multipart-form-data">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/566462/upload-files-with-httpwebrequest-multipart-form-data</a></p>

<p>That said, a better solution would be to refactor ImageUp() into 2 methods - the first extracts the files from the HttpRequest, and the second acts on those files. The second method is then usable without a HttpContext, such as in a console app or unit test.</p>
