<p>You can delete all rows that aren't the latest timestamp using the example below. I added the windowed function <code>row_number()</code> as an example.</p>

<pre><code>delete from &lt;table&gt;
where rowid in
   (
select rwid
from (  select rowid as rwid
        , row_number() over(partition by first_nm,last_nm order by ts desc) as rown
        from &lt;table&gt;
     ) sub
where sub.rown&gt;1
   );
</code></pre>
