<p>First of all, you should refactor your code and separate that graph plotting method in it's separate class and then you shouldn't face this situation.</p>

<p>In your case, you can have a <code>Form1</code> instance in your <code>Form2</code> and using that instance call the method like</p>

<pre><code>Public class Form2 : Form
{
  public Form1 frm1 = null;
  public Form2(Form1 frm)
  {
    this.frm1 = frm;
  }

 protected void btn_click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  frm1.Plottingmethod();
}
} 
</code></pre>
