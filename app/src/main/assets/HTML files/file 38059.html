<p>They are used differently in the formula as you can read <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.allclose.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the following equation is element-wise True, then allclose returns True.</p>
  
  <p>absolute(a - b) &lt;= (atol + rtol * absolute(b))</p>
  
  <p>The above equation is not symmetric in a and b, so that allclose(a, b) might be different from allclose(b, a) in some rare cases.</p>
