<p>Because you are reusing the same <code>img</code> object in each loop, you keep adding more and more event listeners to it each time through the loop and thus when it loads, it doesn't just call your loop once, but N times.</p>

<p>Probably what you want to do is to move the adding of the event listener to outside the loop so it is only added once.</p>

<p>You will have to test this code carefully in whatever older browsers you want to support because a few years ago, I found some reliability issues with triggering <code>load</code> events more than one time on the same <code>img</code> object.</p>

<p>Also, you have references in your code to both <code>_imageURL</code> and <code>imageURL</code>.  Are those supposed to be different?</p>
