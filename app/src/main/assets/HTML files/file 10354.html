<p>I would switch your implementation from <code>Thread</code> to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/system.componentmodel.backgroundworker.aspx" rel="nofollow">the BackgroundWorker class</a>, it supports cancellation (i.e. stopping the thread), progress report and has an event for when the thread is done (<code>RunWorkerCompleted</code> event)</p>
