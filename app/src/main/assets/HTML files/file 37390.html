<p>Taking a look at the project <a href="https://github.com/stephanrauh/agoncal-petstore-JSE7-ajax/blob/master/pom.xml" rel="nofollow">Here the POM Maven</a>, if not let anything escape, these main technologies are being used in this project in question: </p>

<ul>
<li>EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) </li>
<li>JPA (Java Persistence API) </li>
<li>JSF (Java Server Faces) </li>
<li>Angular (Framework) and AJAX </li>
<li>Arquillian (for integral tests) </li>
<li>Junit (for unit test) </li>
</ul>

<p>Running on the GlassFish server.</p>

<p>The j2ee specification 6 <a href="http://www.sws.bfh.ch/~fischli/courses/eadj/ejb/doc/javaee_platform-6_0-fr-spec.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> says you can use dependencies, then code is in the standard. If your question was if this project could work with original / native dependencies of J2ee, then I would answer no, you would have the dependencies for this project to be compiled.</p>
