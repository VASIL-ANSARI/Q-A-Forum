<p>Bit shifting is very easy in any arbitrary number of bits. Just remember to shift the overflow bits to the next element. Thats all. Below is a shift left 3 bit example</p>

<pre><code>unsigned __int64 i1, i2, i3, o1, o2, o3; // {o3, o2, o1} = {i3, i2, i1} &lt;&lt; 3;

o3 = i3 &lt;&lt; 3 | i2 &gt;&gt; (32 - 3);
o2 = i2 &lt;&lt; 3 | i1 &gt;&gt; (32 - 3);
o1 = i1 &lt;&lt; 3;
</code></pre>

<p>Similar for shift right</p>

<h1>Edit:</h1>

<p>It seems that you're using base 10<sup>9</sup> for your large number, so binary shifting does not apply here. "Shifting" left/right N digits in a base B is equivalent to multiplying the number by B<sup>N</sup> and B<sup>-N</sup> respectively. You have only one solution, that's multiplying the number by 2<sup>591</sup>. If you want to shift like binary, use a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23840565/arbitrary-precision-numbersgmp-class">base that is a power of 2</a> like base 2<sup>32</sup></p>
