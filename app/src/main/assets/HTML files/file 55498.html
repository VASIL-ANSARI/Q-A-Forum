<p>Since there's no source code you're calling that function, I cannot find the exact reason of stuttering. I guess you want to change the grids in 'real-time' with user interaction.<br></p>

<p>I think you should avoid redrawing the entire grid while user is dragging.<br>
Instead, you can translate, scale or rotate(if you need) the previous Bitmap as you wish.<br></p>

<p>Of course the result image will sometimes not in a good quality, but you can recreate the whole grid bitmap when the user stops interacting.<br>
By this way you can achieve 'real-time-like' grid creating effect.</p>
