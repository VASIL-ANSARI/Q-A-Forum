<p>You want the latest date entry? Order it descending (latest date first) and limit the resultset to 1.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT date FROM table ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 1 ;
</code></pre>

<p>In case you really meant that you've got several dates in one date field and even text also, then you need to change your database schema to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>uid | startDate | endDate | bookID</p>
</blockquote>
