<p>the best way would probably be to add this class info when you create your <code>&lt;rects&gt;</code>.  But if for whatever reason your setup doesn't allow you to, then you should have an array with the same number of elements as the number of <code>&lt;rects&gt;</code> that you have.  <code>.data()</code> acts on all elements in an array, and each of those <code>&lt;rects&gt;</code> (in your case) inherits the information contained within each of the elements in the array:

<p>Right now, when you execute your second code block, you are only updating to 2 <code>&lt;rects&gt;</code> because your array only contains 2 objects.  What you could do then is create another array that has the total 100 elements, each with the class that you want :)</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any other questions!</p>
