<p>K I finally had to combine the following</p>

<p>[UIColor colorWithRed:(247/255.0) green:(247/255.0) blue:(247/255.0) alpha:1];</p>

<p>for the uiview colour than had to put in another uiview that i added as a subview to the original view with small height so that it looks like a border and gave it colour dark gray and alpha 0.4f. One thing to note here is that the border can also be created using layer but that by default doens't take care of orientation changes.</p>

<p>As for height width just gave the height width as per the superviews bounds to which this custom navigation bar is to be attached.</p>
