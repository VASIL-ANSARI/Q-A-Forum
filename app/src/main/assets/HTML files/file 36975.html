<p>We had problems with using project's module name prefixes for entity classes in the data model. Instead we have added @objc(ClassName) for generated classes for NSManagedObjects.</p>

<pre><code>@objc(Book)
class Book: NSManagedObject {

    @NSManaged var ...

}
</code></pre>

<p>You might try to remove the prefixes and add @objc(ClassName) if it does not solve your problem.</p>
