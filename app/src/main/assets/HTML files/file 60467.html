<p>You can do this a number of ways, but I think a <code>not between</code> would work best:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [SequenceID], [AppointmentDate]
FROM [dbo].[AmsAppointment]
where
  AppointmentDate &gt;= '2017-01-01' and
  AppointmentDate not between '2016-10-01' and '2017-12-31'
</code></pre>

<p>And maybe your example just that, but in your scenario, since the ranges overlap, this really translates to:</p>

<pre><code> AppointmentDate &gt;= '2017-12-31'
</code></pre>
