<p>When you say:</p>

<pre><code>Model.where(archived: false)
</code></pre>

<p>you're looking for documents in MongoDB the <code>archived</code> field is exactly <code>false</code>. If you just added your <code>archived</code> field then none of the documents in your database will have that field (and no, the <code>:default</code> doesn't matter) so there won't be any with <code>archived: false</code>.  You're probably better off looking for documents where <code>archived</code> is not <code>true</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Model.where(:archived.ne =&gt; true).each(&amp;:archive!)
</code></pre>

<p>You might want to add a validation on <code>archived</code> to ensure that it is always <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> and that every document has that field.</p>
