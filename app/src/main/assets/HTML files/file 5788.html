<p>Since the bottom example works as expected and besides the url string the example looks the same the problem should be with getting the url string. The problem is also that the code looks the same but it is quite hard to see. I would refactor the code to something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSObject *urlObject = [[promoList objectAtIndex:promoIndex] objectForKey:@"image"];
NSString *urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", urlObject];
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:urlString];
NSData *imageData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url];
UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithData:imageData];

[[detailViewController detailImage] setImage:image];
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can debug the statement properly and make sure that you get what you expect after each step. </p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>To remove newline and tabs you can:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", urlObject];
urlString = [urlString stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet]];
</code></pre>

<p>If urlObject already is a string, which it should be, then you can do:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *urlString = [urlObject stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet]];
</code></pre>

<p>which would make it a bit cleaner.</p>
