<p>You should be able to do it by using an additional <code>SELECT</code>, assuming that a single row is returned:</p>

<pre><code>string query2 = @"
    UPDATE dbo.ExampleDB
    SET OrderID = (OrderID - 1)
    WHERE OrderID &gt; (
        SELECT OrderID FROM dbo.ExampleDB WHERE ID = @ID
    )";
</code></pre>
