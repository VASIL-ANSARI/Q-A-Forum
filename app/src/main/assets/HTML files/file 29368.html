<p>Looks like qTip uses a global variable named <code>tooltip</code> which may occasionally cause issues in IE8 (perhaps just in strict-mode).  Declaring <code>window.tooltip = null</code> at the top of my JS file that uses qTip resolved this issue for me, and more clearly indicates that the variable exists.</p>
