<p>Variadic functions (that is, functions which take a variable number of arguments indicated by the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) parameter) have weak typing in C.  Except in the case of certain special functions like <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, the compiler makes no effort to verify that you're passing the correct types of arguments to them.</p>

<p>In your case, the function is expecting a <code>double</code> parameter, but you're trying to pass in an <code>int</code>.  The compiler does not do any promotion here from <code>int</code> to <code>double</code>, so undefined behavior results.  You need to always pass in a <code>double</code> value here, either as an explicit <code>double</code> constant value such as <code>1.0</code>, or perform the conversion using a typecast.</p>
