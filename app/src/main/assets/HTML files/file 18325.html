<p>You are missing the spring-web.jar library, or it's not in the proper location for tomcat to see it. The libraries should go under /WEB-INF/lib/ in your webapp or in a global lib directory. See: <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html" rel="nofollow">http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html</a> all the locations from where tomcat is loading libraries.</p>
