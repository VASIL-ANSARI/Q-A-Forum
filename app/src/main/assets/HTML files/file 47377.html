<p>Firstly <code>text-justify</code> has long since been drooped from support </p>

<p>You need to think about how text formatting work's. When you use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> you are committing a single line break ending that text string. So there is no additional space to justify to because that is where it end's.</p>

<p>The same happens for <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> wrapping them all in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> will not work because you are telling it to stop there imagine how screwy a three word sentence would look justified to <code>500px</code></p>

<p>The only way you are going to do it is by setting a fixed <code>width</code> and try to get it as close as possible to what you want like in the example below.</p>

<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>#where_we_are_factoid {
  font-size: 22px;
  font-weight: 200;
  width: 220px; 
  float: right;
}
#where_we_are_factoid p {
  text-align: justify;
}
#where_we_are_factoid span {
  font-size: 39px;
  font-weight: 600;
}</code></pre>
<pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;div id="where_we_are_factoid"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate Learning
Centers are located on
&lt;span&gt;3 continents,&lt;/span&gt;
in 4 countries and 27 states&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>alternatively you could use multiple <code>span class</code>and pad the hell out of it to get it all lined up the way you want.</p>
