<p>Here's a recursive way of computing R:</p>

<pre><code>def florec(x, y):
    if x &gt; y:
        return florec(x-y, y)
    return x
</code></pre>

<p>(Note it only works for positive floats.)</p>

<p>I don't know if this addresses your recursion issues. Maybe this use case is not best suited to illustrate recursion.</p>
