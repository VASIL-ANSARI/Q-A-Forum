<p>Make sure you have the correct version of the XDEBUG dll to match your Apache/PHP installation.</p>

<p>If you have PHP installed as an Apache module you need the Thread Safe XDEBUG dll. If you have PHP installed as CGI/FastCGI then you want the Non Thread Safe XDEBUG dll.</p>

<p>Its a good idea to use the <a href="http://xdebug.org/wizard.php" rel="nofollow">XDEBUG Wizard</a></p>

<p>That will tell you exactly what to modify in your <code>php.ini</code> and which dll you should download.</p>

<p>Beware of old tutorials, they may suggest using the old and now defunct <code>zend_extension_ts=</code> when you should use <code>zend_extension=</code></p>

<p>Also on windows systems use the unix forward slash and not the dos backslash in the path to the XDEBUG dll like so :-</p>

<pre><code>zend_extension="C:/server/php/ext/php_xdebug-2.3.3-5.6-vc11-x86_64.dll"
</code></pre>
