<p>You can just use CSS and set the width of the div to a specific amount.  When the text gets to big to fit the width of the DIV tag it will just wrap.</p>

<p>To adjust the font size you'll have to get crazy with javascript.  Personally I would just set a height to the DIV tag as well and set the CSS overflow-y to auto, which will cause the div to scroll once there is to much text to fit the DIV tag dimensions</p>
