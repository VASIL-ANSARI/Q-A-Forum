<p>I agree with the other poster. It doesn't look like your image is corrupted. Rather, it looks like you're leaving the front view partly visible. As a test, try changing the revealAlpha to .5. That way, one swipe with your finger will set the opacity on the front layer to 50%, and a second swipe will set it to 0%. It will be easier to tell what's going on.</p>
