<p>These statements:</p>

<pre><code>a * 100 == b ;
b % 100 == c ;
c + a == d ;
</code></pre>

<p>are a series of comparisons. <code>==</code> is the equality comparison operator, while <code>=</code> is the assignment operator. Also, <code>%</code> is the modulus operator, and can only be used for integral operands. Perhaps you meant something more like</p>

<pre><code>b = (float) ((int) (a * 100) % 100); /* fraction */
c = (float) ((int) a % 100) / 100.0; /* mantissa */
d = b + c;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is not necessarily good style, but should work.</p>
