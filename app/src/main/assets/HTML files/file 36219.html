<p>As I see it is not SOAP specific, you just want a java method to convert one exception to another. So it means that a bean methods should be wrapped into an exception converter. So, just use AOP to wrap around the bean and do custom exception processing by <code>@AfterThrowing</code> or something similar.</p>
