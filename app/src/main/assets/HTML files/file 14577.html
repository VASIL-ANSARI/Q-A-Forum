<p>I would insert either a PlaceHolder or a Literal control into you page and insert the html controls/text on PageLoad or PageRender.</p>

<p>If you use the Placeholder control you can create the content using the HTML controls in System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.</p>

<p>By using the Placeholder control, you could also write a custom WebControl that you could re-use in other locations within your site. This could then be added to the placeholder control at runtime.</p>

<p>For a liteal, you can just append the control div HTML as text.</p>
