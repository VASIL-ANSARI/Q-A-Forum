<p>Most probably - classpath in your manifest file is badly configured, and points to a wrong location ending in jasperreports classes not being found. That problem is common enough (for example - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/250166/noclassdeffounderror-while-trying-to-run-my-jar-with-java-exe-jar-whats-wron">NoClassDefFoundError while trying to run my jar with java.exe -jar...what&#39;s wrong?</a>) and suprisingly has no simple fix. My guess is that your manifest.mf contains relative paths in classpath, and you tried running the jar from a different location. Or that your build process does not include manifest with filled in classpath at all.</p>

<p>One conceptually simple way of dealing with that would be building your jar along with dependencies - using Maven with <a href="http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/</a> or <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/" rel="nofollow">http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/</a>. That can skyrocket the size of your jar, and can be problematic when dealing with non-open software, but will ensure that your jar will run on any machine that has Java installed.</p>
