<p>First of all you're mixing up the terms "method" and "function". A method is a class member function (static or not), which is what <code>myFunction</code> is. The functions <code>meMethod1</code> and <code>myMethod2</code> are <em>not</em> methods, they are non-member functions, or "free" functions.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you want the functions <code>myMethod1</code> and <code>myMethod2</code> to be calable only from within the <code>MyStaticClass.cpp</code> source file, then I recommend you put them into its own anonymous <code>namespace</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include "MyStaticClass.h"

// An anonymous namespace
namespace
{
    /**
     *i want to write the doc of this function but in the header
     */
    void myMethod1(){
        //do something 1
    }

    /**
     *i want to write the doc of this function but in the header
     */
    void myMethod2(){ 
        // do something 2
    }
}

void MyStaticClass::myFunction(){
    myMethod1();
    myMethod2();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, if you have a class with only <code>static</code> member function ("methods") and no member variables, then it's no different from a <code>namespace</code>. So in your case your header file might look like</p>

<pre><code>#pragma once

namespace MyStaticClass
{
    /**
     * i can write the doc here :D 
     */
    void myFunction();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The source file doesn't have to change from what I show above.</p>
