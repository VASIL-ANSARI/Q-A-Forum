<p>There is no way to express that in CSS. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The status text inherits its appearance from the global style sheet and does not know font size, family, line height, or anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not quite correct. <em>Because</em> text in your status <code>div</code> inherits its values for <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>, etc. via the cascade, it "knows" these and will style itself accordingly. The problem is that CSS doesn't offer a way of using these values for calculations. They are only implicitly considered when declaring new properties.</p>

<p>The only way to achieve exactly what you want is via JavaScript. I made a fiddle <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/kkoala/RXQuy/">here</a> using some jQuery. In my example, a simple <code>body</code> declaration acts as the ancestor. Run it with different <code>font-size</code> and <code>line-height</code> values in the body CSS.</p>

<p>In practice, I would combine this with your method as a fallback for scenarios where</p>

<ol>
<li>JavaScript is disabled</li>
<li>the relevant ancestor's <code>line-height</code> is given as a percentage value (descendants inherit the <em>calculated</em> value) <em>and</em> you decide to change your status <code>font-size</code>. <strong>Example:</strong> The ancestor's <code>font-size</code> is <code>16px</code> and its <code>line-height</code> is <code>120%</code> (~ 19px). Now, if you decide your status needs more attention and declare <code>.progressStatus {font-size: 24px;}</code>, it will inherit the calculated <code>line-height</code> (still 19px). So you'd have a line-height smaller than the text size. Explicitly declaring a <code>line-height</code> as in your "half-solution" prevents that case from occuring.</li>
</ol>
