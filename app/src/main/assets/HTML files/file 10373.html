<p>put your persistence.xml in the META-INF directory of your war file. Also, put a copy in your lib directory and the classes directory. </p>

<p>I am using eclipselink at work, using a standalone jar package that contains my entity classes, a MET-INF directory with the persistence.xml and it works fine.</p>

<p>Probably you need to make a jar file containing the entity classes, plus a MET-INF/persistence.xml, and add this jar file to your lib directory, alongside the eclipselink.jar.</p>

<p>The other thing to check is the RESOURCE-LOCAL, you should use this if you are using JPA in a web-app, with no entity beans components, or in a standalone application.</p>
