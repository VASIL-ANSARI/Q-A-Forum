<p>Why on earth do you expect <code>readlink</code> to work in MSYS? Where did you even get whatever <code>readlink.exe</code> is being invoked, (if that is what is being executed)? There is no <code>readlink</code> command in a <em>standard</em> MSYS installation. Perhaps you discovered it in MinGW.org's <code>msys-coreutils-ext</code> package? If this is the case, you should note the comment within the description of that package, (as seen via MinGW.org's <code>mingw-get</code> installer):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The msys-coreutils-bin subpackage contains those applications that were historically part of the standard MSYS installation. The associated msys-coreutils-ext subpackage contains the rest of the coreutils applications that have been (nominally) ported to MSYS -- usually these are less often used, and are not guaranteed to work: e.g. 'su.exe', 'chroot.exe' and 'mkfifo.exe' are known to be broken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and, it seems that we may add <code>readlink.exe</code> to that list of "known to be broken" applications.</p>

<p>It may also be worth noting that <code>readlink</code> is <strong>not</strong> among the list of supporting tools, which a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Utilities-in-Makefiles" rel="nofollow">GNU Coding Standards</a> conforming application is permitted to invoke from either its <code>configure</code> script, or its <code>makefile</code>. Thus, there is little incentive for the MinGW.org developers, (who maintain MSYS), to address the issue of making <code>readlink.exe</code> work, (although patches from an independent developer, with such an incentive, would be welcomed).</p>

<p>As a final qualification, and as one comment on the question notes, <code>ln -s</code> creates <strong>copies</strong> of files; it does <strong>not</strong> create symbolic links. How could it? MSYS itself dates from an era when <strong>windows</strong> didn't support symbolic links ... indeed, even today its support for them is flaky.  At the time when MSYS was published, either copying the files, or creating NTFS <strong>hard</strong> links, was the best compromise MSYS could offer, in the situation where a script invoked <code>ln -s</code>. Consequently, it would become incumbent upon any developer submitting patches to make <code>readlink.exe</code> work, to also address the issue of updating <code>ln.exe</code>, such that it could create the symbolic links, (in an OS version dependent fashion), which <code>readlink.exe</code> would then read.</p>

<p>I'm sorry if this isn't the answer you hoped for, but unless someone devotes some effort into updating MSYS, so that it can make use of the (unreliable) symbolic link feature in more recent windows versions, then you need to find a different approach; current MSYS does not support symbolic links, even if the underlying OS now does.</p>
