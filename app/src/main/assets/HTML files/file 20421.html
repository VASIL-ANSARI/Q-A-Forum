<p>I believe you are looking for something similar to this using regex.</p>

<p>Note in the regex <code>"%%.*$"</code>, matches everything from <code>%%</code> to end of line. Per your requirement, as shown in this example, multiple instances of the your pattern won't be considered as the first pattern would be replaced till the eol.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; st="""new in Python (and almost in programming).

I have a file with some lines, for example

...

dr=%%dr

mkl=%%mkl

...

I want to replace the %%dr and %%mkl with zeroes in order to have, for example

..."""
&gt;&gt;&gt; lines = (re.sub("%%.*$","0",line) for line in st.splitlines())
&gt;&gt;&gt; print '\n'.join(lines)
new in Python (and almost in programming).

I have a file with some lines, for example

...

dr=0

mkl=0

...

I want to replace the 0

...
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
