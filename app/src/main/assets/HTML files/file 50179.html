<p>Replace <code>public abstract class book</code> with <code>public static abstract class book</code></p>

<p>And replace <code>public final class album extends book</code> with <code>public final static class album extends book</code></p>

<p>That should work. Adding <code>static</code> modifier allows you to instantiate an inner class without having an instance of the enclosing class. You have the book class as an inner class, that's why you need the <code>static</code> modifier.</p>

<p>If you also want to instantiate <code>bd</code> class, you should also put <code>static</code> for it.</p>
