<p>No, there isn't.</p>

<p>You can make the base class property <code>virtual</code>, then override it to throw an exception in the setter, but there's no way to give a compile-time error.  After all, there is nothing you do at compile time to prevent</p>

<pre><code>(elmo.Manager as Employee).Manager = new Manager();
</code></pre>

<p>However, you can write </p>

<pre><code>public class ManagerEmployee : Emp {     
    public new ManagerEmployee Manager { 
        get { return base.Manager; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this won't prevent casting.</p>
