<p>I ran a test similar to your setup. I noticed that the XML gets truncated at 64,514 characters. This is really close to a magic number of 2^16 = 65,536. I'm guessing that you're hitting a data cap somewhere. You can try limiting you query to a <code>TOP 50000</code> or so and do it in batches.</p>
