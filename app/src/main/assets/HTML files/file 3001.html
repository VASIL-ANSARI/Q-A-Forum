<p>I think most Mac developers would recommend that you run your own version of ruby instead of the system version that shipped with the Mac. This will give you more control over versioning and avoid environment issues like the one you are experiencing.</p>

<p>This is amazingly easy to do using the <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/" rel="nofollow">Ruby Version Manager</a>. You can install multiple versions of ruby (1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.1) and switch between them with ease. As a side-effect of using rvm, you no longer will have to use sudo to install gems.</p>
