<p>A basic way to start is to create 3 projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>A DAL project</li>
<li>A BLL project</li>
<li>A UI project (your MVC app)</li>
</ul>

<p>In your DAL project you should create a <code>repository</code>-class. What this class does is execute a query on the database and transform the DataTable into your model.</p>

<p>Your BLL project should have a <code>service</code>-class. This class has a reference to the DAL and calls the method to obtain the list of objects you need (DAL handles DB-code). In this class you can apply logic. 
NOTE: At the moment you don't seem to have any real logic in your app. That's OK, your service can just return the list from the DAL immediately. It will provide you with a place where you can add logic safely later, without affecting the data access code.</p>

<p>In the UI, your controller will call the service and pass the result to the view, which is then in charge of rendering the result.</p>

<p>This is a basic starting point. You could go further with this and completely make it loosely coupled. At the moment you still have a hard dependency from UI => BLL => DAL.</p>

<p>I recently wrote an article on how you can make sure you don't create hard dependencies:
