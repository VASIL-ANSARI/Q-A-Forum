<p>Your switch them method has a problem.
It will switch <code>array1</code> and <code>array2</code> (the two arguments).
But it will not switch <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> from the main method.</p>

<p>Tell your teacher that you cannot really switch them in Java, as Java has no pointers (passing by reference). There's no way your switch method can really make <code>first</code> point to <code>second</code> and <code>second</code> point to <code>first</code> (you can only simulate this behavior - see e.g. the answer from Elliott Frisch or option two in my answer).</p>

<p>1) One option is to make <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> class variables.
But if you make them class variables this is not what is wanted,
as your method will not be reusable.
Here is what I am talking about.</p>

<pre><code>public class Ch8Scratch {
    private static int[] first = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    private static int[] second = new int[] { 6, 7, 8 };

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println();
        for (int number : first) {
            System.out.print(number + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();
        for (int number : second) {
            System.out.print(number + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();

        switchThem();

        System.out.println();
        for (int number : first) {
            System.out.print(number + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();
        for (int number : second) {
            System.out.print(number + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void switchThem() {
        int[] temp = first;
        first = second;
        second = temp;
    }

}

<p>2) Probably the simplest option is to represent them as array of arrays. And then follow this kind of pattern. This way you're switching <code>first[0]</code> with <code>second[0]</code>. So technically it is still not doing switching of two 1D arrays. But it is as closest as it could be in Java.</p>

<pre><code>public class Ch8Scratch {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[][] first = new int[][] { new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }};
        int[][] second = new int[][] { new int[] {6, 7, 8 }};


        System.out.println();
        for (int number : first[0]) {
            System.out.print(number + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();
        for (int number : second[0]) {
            System.out.print(number + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();

        switchThem(first, second);

        System.out.println();
        for (int number : first[0]) {
            System.out.print(number + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();
        for (int number : second[0]) {
            System.out.print(number + "\t");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void switchThem(int[][] arr1, int[][] arr2) {
        int[] temp = arr1[0];
        arr1[0] = arr2[0];
        arr2[0] = temp;
    }

}
