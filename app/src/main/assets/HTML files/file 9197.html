<p>I have an app that does something pretty similar to that. Mine doesn't allow writing to the database, but I don't see why it would be hard. </p>

<p>I have a dataset that I import into a SQLite database, copy it into the apps directory, put the DB filename into a constant and it seems to work really well. </p>

<p>I change the SQLite filename each time I put it in there (MyDB62020111.sqlite -> MyDB62020112.sqlite) just to make sure that I avoid a problem where it thinks that the file is already in the NSDocumentDirectory and not update it.</p>
