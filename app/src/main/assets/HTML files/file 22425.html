<p>Touch and drag is a series of events.  First you have a down, then you have 1 or more moves, then you have an up.  You detect a starting point on the down, then the drag occurs on the moves.  THe drag stops on an up.</p>

<p>To do a 2 finger drag, only pay attention to drags if MotionEvent.getPointerCount() ==2.  </p>
