<p>in addition to <code>getText()</code>, for <code>JTextField</code> some prefer the <code>getDocument()</code> method.

This <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/documentlistener.html" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> will get you started, if you have trouble implementing you can come back with a more specfic question and some code :)</p>
