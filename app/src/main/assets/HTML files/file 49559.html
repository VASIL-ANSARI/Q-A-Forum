<p>So one thing we noticed, as has been pointed out by @Quoid is that error in regards to easyResponsiveTabs which is there the first time but like the slider works after the first refresh, so too does that error disappear.</p>

<p>I think it's most likely due to the fact you have included to jQuery libraries. In your head you have included 'jquery-1.11.1.min.js' and then later on you've included 'lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js' which has jquery version v2.1.4.</p>
