<p>A long time has passed since this question was asked, however I ran into the same problem and have managed to work out where Niels is coming from on this one.</p>

<p>I think we both ran into the problem because we both followed the popular tutorial on phing and dbdeploy by Dave Marshall here: <a href="http://davedevelopment.co.uk/2008/04/14/how-to-simple-database-migrations-with-phing-and-dbdeploy.html" rel="nofollow">http://davedevelopment.co.uk/2008/04/14/how-to-simple-database-migrations-with-phing-and-dbdeploy.html</a></p>

<p>In his example sql delat file he includes --// at the top which, if replaced with a comment in /* .... */ format instead, avoids this problem!</p>

<p>So I would say this is a bug in the tutorial, which is 8 years old now.  Dave notes at the top of the tutorial that about 4 years ago he moved onto a different method, so it is kind of understandable that there is now a bug in the tutorial!  I will submit a comment requesting an update though, because his page is a top ranking search result when searching for the topic so it would be good if we can save people the same problem we've had!</p>

<p>It is a shame phing didn't give a more detailed error report in the form of the SQL exception - there's an idea for a contribution to the dbdeploy script!</p>
