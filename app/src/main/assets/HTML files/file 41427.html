<p>myList.getItemAtPosition(position) gets you the "Object" that represents the row at that position. Simply put, that is defined by your CursorAdapter. This is actually a Cursor object and should be casted as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor myCursor = (Cursor) myList.getItemAtPosition(position);
</code></pre>

<p>You then have to get the String from the correct position in the Cursor (which <strong>should</strong> be in whatever order you put it into the adapter):</p>

<pre><code>String myDesiredString = myCursor.getString(cursorPos);
</code></pre>

<p>where cursorPos is an integer that represents the position you wish to get.</p>

<p>As a side note, I personally prefer using my own adapter which extends BaseAdapter so that I have more control over the data and can even make the adapter itself return the data [such as defining a method like <code>public String getEventName(int position)</code>]. However, the simplest solution for this context is what I described above.</p>
