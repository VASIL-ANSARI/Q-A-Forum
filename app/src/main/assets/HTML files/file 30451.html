<p>The right-hand side of the assignment is processed first, so an instance of <code>MyClass</code> is created. But then you reassign the name <code>MyClass</code> to that instance. When you execute</p>

<pre><code>new_class = MyClass()
</code></pre>

<p>you should get an error about <code>MyClass</code> not being callable, since that name now refers to an instance of the original class, not the class itself.</p>
