<p>This isn't ASP.NET, this is HTML.  It might be served to the client by an ASP.NET server-side application, but that makes no difference to the client.</p>

<p>As far as HTML goes, your paths are broken.  In both cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>C:\Users\fortress\Desktop\AppointmentApp.swf</li>
<li>~/Styles/Images/AppointmentApp.swf</li>
</ul>

<p>In the first case you're referencing a file system path.  This wouldn't work on any client computer which doesn't have that file.  If the file is on the web server then no client will be able to access the web server's <code>C:</code> drive.  In the second case you're using a server-side relative path with a <code>~</code>, and no client will be able to make sense of that.</p>

<p>When the page renders, the path needs to reference the file from the <em>client's</em> perspective.  Something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>/Styles/Images/AppointmentApp.swf</li>
</ul>

<p>Or perhaps:</p>

<ul>
<li>../../Styles/Images/AppointmentApp.swf</li>
</ul>

<p>Or whatever the path is from the rendered page to the SWF file.</p>

<p>I'm not <em>100%</em> sure if this works well for <code>object</code>/<code>embed</code> tags, but you <em>might</em> be able to use the <code>~</code> path reference if you make the tag a server-side control.  That should just be as easy as adding <code>runat="server"</code> to the tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;embed runat="server" src="~/Styles/Images/AppointmentApp.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This would indicate to the ASP.NET application that the control needs some server-side processing before it's rendered to the client, and that processing would include evaluating relative paths.</p>
