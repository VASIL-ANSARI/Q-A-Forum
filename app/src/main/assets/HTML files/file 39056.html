<p>This was a bug that has now been fixed in <a href="https://github.com/maartenba/MvcSiteMapProvider/releases/tag/v4.6.13" rel="nofollow">v4.6.13</a>.</p>

<p>If you are using an earlier version, you can add an invisible dummy node to your SiteMap that your user accessibility to, which will override this behavior.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mvcSiteMapNode title="Home" controller="Home" action="Index"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Level 1 --&gt;
    &lt;mvcSiteMapNode title="About" controller="Home" action="About"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Level 2 --&gt;
        &lt;mvcSiteMapNode title="About Me" controller="Home" action="AboutMe"/&gt;
        &lt;mvcSiteMapNode title="About You" controller="Home" action="AboutYou" /&gt;
        &lt;mvcSiteMapNode title="Dummy Node" url="/dummy-url?id=1" visibility="!*" 
            visibilityProvider="MvcSiteMapProvider.FilteredSiteMapNodeVisibilityProvider, MvcSiteMapProvider" /&gt;
    &lt;/mvcSiteMapNode&gt;
    &lt;mvcSiteMapNode title="Contact" controller="Home" action="Contact"/&gt;
&lt;/mvcSiteMapNode&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The URL doesn't actually have to exist, you just need to specify it to override the routing behavior of the dummy node. If you need to do this in more than one place, you will need more than one dummy URL, though (since URLs must be unique) - for that I suggest incrementing the "id" query string parameter or changing the URL in some other way.</p>

<p>Note that you only need to specify the visibilityProvider explicitly if it isn't already configured as your default visibility provider.</p>

<p>What you stated about invisibility is incorrect - invisible nodes are not removed from the SiteMap API, only inaccessible nodes are. So if you have at least 1 invisible node there, the menu won't switch to being based on the root node when the user doesn't have access to any of the other configured nodes.</p>
