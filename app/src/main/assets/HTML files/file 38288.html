<p>I think, you can add an enum field to your table of sentences for types (noun and verb) or add a model for types if sentence may has both of types.</p>

<p>After that you can select nouns and verbs separately and make a hash like <code>{ nouns: array_of_nouns, verbs: array_of_verbs }</code> and send it to your JavaScript, where you can search in two separate arrays.</p>

<p>Also you can use hashes instead of arrays and group sentences by first letter to speed search up. For example if you have 'nouns' <code>r</code>, <code>react</code>, <code>ruby</code>, <code>ruby-on-rails</code> and <code>javascript</code>, your <code>hash_of_nouns</code> would be like <code>{ 'j' =&gt; [ 'javascript' ], 'r' =&gt; ['ruby', 'react', 'ruby-on-rails', 'r'] }</code>. After first character, entered by user, you can take array, and search in it. It will be much more faster with lots of data than simple <code>array_of_nouns</code>.</p>
