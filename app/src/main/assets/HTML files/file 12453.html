<p>try turning on error reporting. on the top of your script add this line of code</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php error_reporting(E_ALL ^E_NOTICE); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>if that still doesn't work try echoing something at different parts of the script to see where it fails. You either have a parse error or a fatal error somewhere in your script.</p>

<p>are you using output buffering anywhere?</p>
