<p>If <code>fCount</code> were to be 0 then your loop would not execute and you'll not hit any of the return statements.</p>

<p>Some condensing and improved indentation makes it clear:</p>

<pre><code>    int fCount = Directory.GetFiles(path, "*.xml", SearchOption.AllDirectories).Length;
    for(int i = 0;i&lt;fCount;i++){

        ...

        if(txtFirstName.Text == loginAcc.firstName &amp;&amp; txtLastName.Text == loginAcc.lastName){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
        return false;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Possibly in the "real world" fCount can never be 0, however compiler/runtime won't know this.</p>
