<p>About components being <em>heavy weight</em>: AWT components are meant, that use the operating system widgets. You use swing JComponents, J*. Swing components are called <em>light weight</em> as they do all drawing and event handling emulated, in one large native window.</p>

<p>The JPanel should be larger than the JScrollPane, so a "view port" may be scrolled. Have the <em>preferred sizes</em> set correctly.</p>

<p>In general I would have thought that every JTextPane would be in its own JScrollPane.</p>

<p>Also JScrollPane functions a bit differently.</p>

<pre><code>scrollPane = new JScrollPane(panel);
</code></pre>
