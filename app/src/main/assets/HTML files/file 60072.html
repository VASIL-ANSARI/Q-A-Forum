<p>The item you have added does not belong to a <code>Group</code>, and so is added to the default group.</p>

<p>By defining a list of groups for your <code>ListView</code>, you can control what group each item comes under.</p>

<p>You can modify these values in the Form Builder or in code.  Try setting your <code>ListViewItem</code>'s <code>Group</code> property.</p>
