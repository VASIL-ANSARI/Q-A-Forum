<p>This looks like <code>if (m_data_in)</code></p>

<pre><code>mov    0x8(%rdi),%rdx
test   %rdx,%rdx
test   %rdx,%rdx
jne    0x8cc843 
jmpq   0x8cc9cb 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I don't quite know where <code>0x8cc843</code> and <code>0x8cc9cb</code> are located in your code, so can't really follow the code further. There is still not enough code &amp; information to say exactly what is going on in the original question. I'm happy to fill in more of this answer if more information is provided.</p>
