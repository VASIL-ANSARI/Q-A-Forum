<p>The C <code>a-&gt;b</code> operator evaluates to <code>(*a).b</code>. So your line actually evaluates to something like <code>***(table+i).data</code>, which is obviously incorrect.</p>

<p>It also may help to group with parentheses so it's clear whether the line evaluates to <code>(***(table+i)).data</code> or <code>***((table+i).data)</code>. Based on the error message you get, it's probably the latter.</p>

<p>And then you can use the array syntax to clean it up more.</p>

<p>All put together, you can simplify the line to <code>table[i]-&gt;data</code>.</p>

<p>So why did your debugging session indicate otherwise? Because **(table+i) is the actual <em>struct</em> itself. To use <code>-&gt;</code>, you need a pointer to the struct.</p>

<p>Also, a little tip. You casted your malloc() calls. Generally, programmers avoid this for several reasons. There are several posts on this, but one of the best ones can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1565496/specifically-whats-dangerous-about-casting-the-result-of-malloc">here</a>.</p>
