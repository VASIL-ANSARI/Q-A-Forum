<p>First of all, have you downloaded a version of XE which supports UNICODE?  Not all of them do.  Check out the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/xe/htdocs/102xewinsoft.html" rel="nofollow" title="Express Edition for Microsoft Windows">XE Download page</a>.</p>

<p>OTN has a white paper on Unicode in the database.  It's a few years old now, but it still covers the ground.  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/globalization/pdf/TWP_AppDev_Unicode_10gR2.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="Oracle database Unicode support (warning: PDF)">Read it now.</a>  If you need detailed information regarding  implementation read the <a href="http://download-west.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14225/toc.htm" rel="nofollow" title="Oracle 10g Database Globalization Support Guide">Oracle Globalization Reference</a>. </p>

<p>Finally, no overview of Unicode would be complete without a link to Joel's article <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html" rel="nofollow">"The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)"</a>.  </p>
