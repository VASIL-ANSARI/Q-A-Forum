<p>I did not go through all of the code, but there are some basic flaws in the classes you posted:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a new instance of <code>b</code> is the same as creating an empty <code>JPanel</code>. Of course you see nothing as the panel is empty. Populate the panel first and then add it.</li>
<li>Having a separate <code>Thread</code> populating the <code>b</code> panel is a violation of the Swing threading rules. You should only access/modify/... Swing components on the Event Dispatch Thread. Consult the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html" rel="nofollow">Swing concurrency guide</a> for more information</li>
<li>Having a <code>Thread.sleep</code> on the EDT will block your UI. Never ever do that. If you want to have some sort of animation, use the <code>javax.swing.Timer</code> class instead. This class is designed to update your UI periodically.</li>
<li>Do not override the <code>paint</code> method, rather override the <code>paintComponent</code> method, and do not forget to call <code>super</code></li>
</ul>
