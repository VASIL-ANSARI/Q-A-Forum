<p>All of you elements are either positioned absolutely or floated, that won't compute a height for the parent. Try setting a min-height on some of your elements or atleast on the container.</p>

<p>Give me a moment and I'll try to set up a jsfiddle with a solution :)</p>

<p>!!! See lazychio's answer, its what you're looking for.</p>
