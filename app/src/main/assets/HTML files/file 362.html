<p>@Matt David,</p>

<p>Please read documentation and take a look at the code samples for Microsoft <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF">CompositeWPF</a> (aka Prism). It's a project created specifically to teach how to deal with MVP/MVC architecture in test-driven manner. Their sample application contains unit tests for presenters\controllers and very cool acceptance tests for UI (they use <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/white">White framework</a> to simulate user actions)</p>
