<p>It looks like the problem is <em>copyTo</em> method. From the doc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method copies the matrix data to another matrix. Before copying the data, the method invokes</p>
  
  <p>m.create(this->size(), this->type());</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like it overrides your setup of <em>foreground</em>. You need to find another way to copy bits to get alpha channel.</p>
