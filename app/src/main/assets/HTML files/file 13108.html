<p>The title in the Market is not the same title as on the phone. You can set the title in the Market as you wish. </p>

<p>Go to the developers console, click on your app, then in the details area you can set your title.</p>

<p>The title on the phone is of course set in the AndroidManifest.xml in the application tag</p>
