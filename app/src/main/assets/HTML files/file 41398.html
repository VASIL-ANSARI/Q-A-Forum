<p>Accordingly to <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> document there is no such thing like '<em>Library</em> project' or '<em>Application</em> project'. There is 'Android project', which contains <em>modules</em>, and these can be <em>application</em> modules, <em>library</em> modules, <em>test</em> modules and so on.<br>
I suggest you start with the project which consists of one library module. If later you'll find out that you need to add some tests, you'll add test module to this project. The same goes for the sample app which you'll someday (maybe) add to your library.<br>
But, if for some reason you want to create plain library module, w/o any project, you can go with these three steps you described in your answer. I'm afraid there is no built-in support for creation of modules without underlying Android project.</p>
