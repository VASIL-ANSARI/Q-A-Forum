<p>Well I don't know if the comparison is valid.. </p>

<p>ResX is a storage format for storing resources in XML. It gets compiled to a binary form (.resources) with the resgen tool before it gets embedded (if so specified) into the assembly.</p>

<p>Satellite assembly is a diff/delta of your main assembly resources and your localized resources. So if you have a Strings.resx with 100 strings in MainAssembly.dll of which 10 change in French Canadian Culture, you should have a MainAssembly.resources.dll (satellite assembly) containing just those 10 strings  in the fr-CA subdirectory of the DLL folder.
When you query for a string resource using a ResourceManager, it takes into account current culture. If fr-CA, it will first look for the string in the satellite assembly in the fr-CA folder, if not found it will fall back to the resources in the DLL itself and return that. The mechanism is to search for it in the following order always.</p>

<pre><code>  - [fr-CA subfolder]\MyAssembly.resources.dll 
  - [fr subfolder]\MyAssembly.resources.dll 
  - DLL itself
</code></pre>
