<p>If you are you are working with a Button control then try to attach event with "Click" event.</p>

<p>Please note that Button control internally consider and handles PointerPressed, MouseLeftButtonDown, MouseLeftButtonUp and raise Click event. Generally Button control wont allow PointerPressed, MouseLeftButtonDown, MouseLeftButtonUp event to bubble up and fire.</p>
