<p>I could only suggest you go through these steps, as I had some issues as well with the new Facebook SDK as well, but after double checking all their setup process again I managed to make it all work properly :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you have your app created and listed at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps/" rel="nofollow" title="Apps list">Facebook 
Applications</a></p></li>
<li><p>If that's the case, then make sure your bundle id is added at the Facebook Developers page for that app and it also matches with the one you have inside your project</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the app is either public, or the account you are trying to log in with is listed in the roles page for your Facebook application at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps/APPID/roles/" rel="nofollow">https://developers.facebook.com/apps/APPID/roles/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you implement the <code>FBSDKLoginButtonDelegate</code> if you're using the native Facebook login button and also the delegate methods, load its class in the delegate and setting its permissions, <strong>OR</strong> properly implement <code>FBSDKLoginManager</code>, which I see it's your case.</p></li>
<li><p>What I had problems with, but I see that you did not skipped, is having all the juicy stuff implemented in the <code>Application Delegate</code>, which I skipped, since I jumped directly at the Login implementation tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p>Also critical are the three (3) values you need to add in your <code>Info.plist</code> with the Facebook App ID, Facebook Display Scheme and URL Schemes, but I can see that you already covered that as well.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suggest going again through my first three steps I mentioned. Those (or just one) seem to be the root of your problem. Or not.</p>
