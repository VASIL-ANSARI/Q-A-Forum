<p>Sure, you can use CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries" rel="nofollow">media queries</a> for this type of thing:</p>

<pre><code>/* Portrait */
@media screen and (orientation:portrait) {
    /* Portrait styles */
}
/* Landscape */
@media screen and (orientation:landscape) {
    /* Landscape styles */
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>A media query consists of a media type and at least one expression
  that limits the style sheets' scope by using media features, such as
  width, height, and color. Media queries, added in CSS3, let the
  presentation of content be tailored to a specific range of output
  devices without having to change the content itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can extend media queries to be fairly specific if you want to extend and target desktop vs mobile devices etc..</p>

<p>Alternatively- using JS you could simply do:</p>

<pre><code>var orientation = null;
window.onresize = function (event) {
    orientation = parseInt(window.innerHeight / window.innerWidth) !== 0 ? 'portrait' : 'landscape';
    /* logic for if orientation == portrait etc goes here */
};
</code></pre>
