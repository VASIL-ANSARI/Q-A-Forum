<p>Function <code>printlist</code> is correct. As for your problem then it means that <code>l</code> is equal to <code>NULL</code>.
You should analyze your code where you add new nodes to the list.</p>

<p>There are many questions about linked list here. So you can see many realizations of the single linked kist. For example today I already answered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27363991/trouble-while-modifying-a-pointer-within-a-c-function/27364230#27364230">similar question</a></p>

<p>EDIT: After you showed other code of your list then I can point out that already function <code>add_top</code> is wrong. It should look like</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct node * Node;

void add_top( Node *l, int x )
{
    Node newHead = malloc( sizeof( struct node ) );
    newHead-&gt;x = x;
    newHead-&gt;next = *l;
    *l = newHead;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly function <code>add_bot</code> is wrong. Try update it yourself.</p>

<p>In main you have to substitute these statements</p>

<pre><code>Node l = malloc(sizeof(Node));
l = NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>for</p>

<pre><code>Node l = NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise you have a senseless memory leak.</p>

<p>And the condition in the while loop is wrong. </p>

<p>Instead of</p>

<pre><code>while (keep &amp;&amp; scanf("%d", &amp;x))
</code></pre>

<p>there should be</p>

<pre><code>while (keep &amp;&amp; scanf("%d", &amp;x) == 1 )
</code></pre>
