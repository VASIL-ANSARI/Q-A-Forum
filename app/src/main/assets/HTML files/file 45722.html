<p>You write, "I end up with an error", but it is very difficult for anyone to answer your question if you don't tell us what the error is!</p>

<p>In this particular case I think I know the problem. In Python, all field names must be quoted. The proper syntax is:</p>

<pre><code>doc = yield db.student.find_one({ "$or": [{"academy": name}, {"sports": name}]})
</code></pre>
