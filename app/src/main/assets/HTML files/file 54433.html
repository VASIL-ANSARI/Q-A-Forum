<p>what the hell are you doing? the fileInputStream is practically useless ! you read the bytes into the byte array vidBytes, but never actually use it anywhere, videoView doesn't require you to open an input stream, all videoView requires is the path to the file and the videoView code takes care of opening the stream and loading the data efficiently.</p>

<p>Also why are you writing the same Byte array that you read just few statements ago not modify it and write it back to the SAME FILE!? What are you trying to accomplish here?</p>

<p>P.S This is all you need to do to play the mp4 file in the videoview</p>

<pre><code>tempFile = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+ "/" +"temp.mp4");
videoPlayer.setVideoPath(tempFile.getAbsolutePath());
Toast.makeText(this,tempFile.getPath(),Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
videoPlayer.start();
</code></pre>
