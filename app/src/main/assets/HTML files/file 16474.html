<p>This seems a bit closer to a more comfortable feeling UI experience:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $('.grid li').hover(function(){

        $('.grid-hover').stop();
        $('.grid-hover').fadeOut(500);
        $('.grid-hover', this).fadeIn(500);

    }, function(){

        $('.grid-hover', this).fadeOut(500);

    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>Not perfect.. to be sure. The on hover jquery event is tricky to get right; especially with animations. Have to carefully follow the logic and timings of things. I'd play around with the <code>.stop()</code> jQuery function, which stops animations on elements; as well as the <code>setTimeout()</code> JavaScript function.</p>
