<p>It doesn't work because the <code>ctrl+0</code> key combination is interpreted by the browser first and than sent to the event loop.
If you trigger it programmatic, it will go directly to the event loop.</p>

<p>In css there is a <code>zoom</code> property.</p>

<p>What you could probably do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a method described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1713771/how-to-detect-page-zoom-level-in-all-modern-browsers">here</a>, to detect the browser zoom level</li>
<li>set the <code>zoom</code> property to compensate for the browser zoom.</li>
</ul>

<p>This way if the user has zoom 120%, you set from css <code>zoom</code> 80%.</p>

<hr>

<p>Anyway, I advice against it because 99% of the time, the user wants/needs to zoom.</p>

<p>What it is better, would be to make your website look good even when zoomed, by using <code>em</code> units, percent values and maybe <code>media-queryes</code></p>
