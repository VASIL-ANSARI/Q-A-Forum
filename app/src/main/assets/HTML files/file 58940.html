<p>Assuming you're interested in a C# sample, maybe this can help: <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/CSharp/intelligence-SpeechToText" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/CSharp/intelligence-SpeechToText</a>. It is a sample speech-to-text bot, which uses the Bing Speech API. The bot reads the audio file that the user uploaded, and then converts it into text. Obviously, you can leverage the same code to run speech-to-text for non-bot applications. </p>
