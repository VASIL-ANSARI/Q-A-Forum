<p>I realized that I didn't assign a value to <code>joblinetype</code> in the event that it is not "Billable", so the webservice was unable to Parse the blank string </p>

<pre><code>Job_Line_Type = (PurchLines.Job_Line_Type) (Enum.Parse(typeof (PurchLines.Job_Line_Type), joblinetype)),
</code></pre>
