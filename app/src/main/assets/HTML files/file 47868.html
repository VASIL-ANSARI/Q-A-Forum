<p>The Railsy way of including javascript is to use:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag( 'your_script' ) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>More docs here: <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper/javascript_include_tag" rel="nofollow">http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper/javascript_include_tag</a></p>

<p>application.js is just a list of files that will be precompiled with the asset pipeline, so you can include the scripts there as well, but if you just want to add a script to a particular view, this is the way to go.</p>
