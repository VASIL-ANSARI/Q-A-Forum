<p>By design, table names and column names cannot be parameterized. But you can still concatenate it on the string and wrapping it with backquotes as the first level of defense against sql injection.</p>

<pre><code>    $stmt = $mysqli -&gt; prepare("SHOW COLUMNS FROM `" . $tableName . "`");
    $stmt -&gt; execute();
</code></pre>
