<p>Because <code>$out['error']</code> is an array, <code>echo</code>ing it will output <code>Array</code>, as you noticed. To output it as a string you'll need to convert it first; one option to do so is using <code>implode</code>. I'd suggest using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> as the 'glue' so that each error will show on a different line.</p>

<p>So,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name="file" type="file" size="20" /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;?php echo implode('&lt;br&gt;', $out['error']) ;?&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;input name="submit" type="submit" value="Upload" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, perhaps a better solution would be to store the error as a string (<code>$out['error'] = 'There was an error'</code> rather than <code>$out['error'][] = 'There was an error'</code>) and using a proper control structure to ensure that once an error is found the validation check ends and the form with the error message is output.</p>

<p>For the control structure you could do:</p>

<pre><code>if ($first_check)
{
    $out['error'] = 'First error message';
}

elseif ($second_check)
{
    $out['error'] = 'Second error message';
}

else
{
    $out['success'] = 'Success message';
}
</code></pre>
