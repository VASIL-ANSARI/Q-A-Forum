<p>Now that you have a usable python dictionary you have to write it to xml. </p>

<p>What does your xml format look like? Python provides some tools in the standard library for writing/working with xml. <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/xml.dom.minidom.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/library/xml.dom.minidom.html</a></p>

<p>Writing will require some effort because python doesn't know the structure of your xml document.  A little google research can go a long way.</p>
