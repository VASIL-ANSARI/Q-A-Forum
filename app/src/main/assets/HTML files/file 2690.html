<pre><code>and Price between @minprice and @maxprice
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: To cover what @paxdiablo is suggesting, although I have no idea why a house would have anything besides a price...</p>

<pre><code>and (minprice between @minprice and @maxprice 
or maxprice between @minprice and @maxprice
or @minprice between minprice and maxprice)
</code></pre>
