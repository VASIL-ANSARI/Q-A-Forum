<li><p>On compatibility side, not all the web applications and dependencies are 64 bit ready. Start from 32 bit on IIS help avoid lots of trouble at the very beginning. If your application happens to be 64 bit ready, you can start from 64 bit. Otherwise, you are stuck.</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft does not have good tools to debug 64 bit issues for non-advanced developers yet (in 2008 that was true, and it is true even today). Even if you are an IIS geek, debugging 32 bit worker process is much simpler than debugging the 64 bit one.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The migration to 64 bit will finally finish (thinking about the 16 to 32 bit migration in 1990s).</p>

<p>I don't believe that you should stick to "Microsoft recommends 32 bit" or "Steve Scholfield said that". All should depend on your own application, and your unique environment. Those conclusions were drawn for other scenarios, which may not even apply a bit to your case.</p>

<p><strong>Edited:</strong> In fact Microsoft's guys explain the performance gain of using 32 bit better in this VS related blog post,</p>
