  <p>(for obvious reasons, the data should be retrieved only if the user
  tap on the refresh button, and the connection should not be created

<p>If you only want to sync the data in response to the user tapping a button, then create a method </p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)syncData;
</code></pre>

<p>and in Interface builder connect the touchUpInside event of the button to the syncData method.</p>
