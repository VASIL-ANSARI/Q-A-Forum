<p>I think one of your biggest problems is naming things. A class called Viewviewerimage (view-viewer-image?) makes no sense. Also pay attention to CamelCasing and naming_your_files correctly.</p>

<p>When I try running your example code it seems to be working, so I guess you might have some confusing filenames here or there. When debugging your objects, you can always use <code>.inspect</code> to show them in the view. If you put <code>&lt;%= @Viewviewerimage.inspect %&gt;</code> in your view that corresponds to your controller you should see the model.</p>

<p>In your scenario make sure your controller goes into:</p>

<p><code>app/controllers/viewviewerimage_controller.rb</code></p>

<p>and that you have a route:</p>

<p><code>resources :viewviewerimage</code></p>

<p>I suggest renaming the lot at least to something like <code>class ViewViewerImage</code>, putting it in a file named <code>view_viewer_image.rb</code>, same goes for the controller.</p>
