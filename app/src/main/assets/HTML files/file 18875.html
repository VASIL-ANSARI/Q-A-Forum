<p>hm.. Actually, it seems ok for me.. this is exactly what system() is for - to execute a line under current shell. Does that embedded linux's shell support >> operator? Have you tried it manually in the terminal?</p>

<p>Another thought is that your application may be run under some other user account and that account <em>could</em> have some weird configuration, like having some csh or ksh instead of bash (or viceversa, depending on what you like). Check what user actually owns the process and check the /etc/passwd for the shell setup.</p>

<p>Also, there is small possibility that the user account that the app runs under simply does not have rights to write to /tmp :) be sure to check that too</p>

<p>Also... there is small possibility that on yours 'embedded linux' simply has the system() implemented in a simplistic way, that just invokes the application with given parameters and skips all other shell-wise operators. This could have been done to save on resources, as system() might be though to be rarely used, or just though to be "too heavy" by your linux designers.. it depends on the distro.. If you tell us which one it is, then people with more knowledge will probably be able to say if this is the case.</p>
