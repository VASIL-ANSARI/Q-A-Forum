<p>You don't really need a POJO for this. Just create your view model with the bindable property you need. <code>ObservableInt</code> does everything for you and is handled as if it was an <code>int</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class Pressure {
    public final ObservableInt value = new ObservableInt();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your layout you then only need to set <code>binding:textValue="@={pressure.value}"</code>. Using <code>android:text</code> would be possible too, but not too good, because setting an <code>int</code> to it should stay the default behavior.</p>

<pre><code>@BindingAdapter("textValue")
public static void bindIntegerInText(TextView text, int value) {
    text.setText(String.valueOf(value));
    // Set the cursor to the end of the text
    text.setSelection(text.getText().length());
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use the validation for the text color, you'd have to use an observable expression there as well. In you case it gets evaluated exactly once at the beginning, because the databinding doesn't know anything about the value underlying your validation.</p>

<p>You could add an <code>ObservableBoolean isValid</code> to <code>Pressure</code> and update its value anytime the <code>value</code> changes. For this you can register your own <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/databinding/Observable.OnPropertyChangedCallback.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Observable.OnPropertyChangedCallback</code></a> to <code>value</code> and set <code>isValid</code> in there.</p>
