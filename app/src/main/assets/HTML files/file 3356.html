<p>You may be getting some conflicts because of the way you're resolving keypresses every frame and switching between the lists. It may be a bit cleaner to have a boolean for each of the keys you plan to press (such as right arrow, left arrow...etc). When a key is pressed, set the corresponding boolean to true, then when it's released, set it to false. This is a pretty common way to deal with keyboard control in video games</p>
