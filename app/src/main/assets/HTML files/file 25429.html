<p>One way of doing this that doesn't require a lastpaid date:</p>

<pre><code>select 
firstdate
,frequency
from sampledata
WHERE
CASE   WHEN frequency = 'week' THEN DATEDIFF(DD,firstdate,getdate()) % 7
        WHEN frequency = 'fortnight' THEN DATEDIFF(DD,firstdate,getdate()) % 14
        WHEN frequency = 'month' AND Day(firstdate) = Day(getdate()) THEN 0
        WHEN frequency = 'year' AND Day(firstdate) = Day(getdate())
                                AND Month(firstdate) = Month(getdate()) THEN 0
END = 0
</code></pre>
