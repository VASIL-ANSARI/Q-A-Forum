<p>@yeyo has answer this question in the question's comments IMO but did not provide a timely answer. So I will summarize:</p>

<p><strong>You can not <code>splice()</code> from a socket to a buffer with âzero-copyâ.</strong> </p>

<hr>

<p>The reason you can't use <code>splice()</code> is because <code>splice()</code> "<a href="http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/splice.html" rel="nofollow">requires either the source or destination to be a pipe</a>". In other words when the source is a socket then the destination must be a pipe because of the API's restrictions ('either the source or destination or both must be a pipe').</p>

<hr>

<p>That answers the yes or no question but not the "why". </p>

<p>I still had questions about the "why" or specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Why does splice() require the source or destination to be a pipe?" </li>
<li>and</li>
<li>"Why can't I splice directly from a socket to user memory?"</li>
</ul>

<p>Linus Torvalds answers those questions directly in the link and his answer seems clear and concise to me (if not with a little studying of what he writes): <a href="http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/splice.html" rel="nofollow">http://yarchive.net/comp/linux/splice.html</a> </p>
