<p>Seems to be an issue with the type of encoding that the emulator supports, if you install ffmpeg, if your on a mac by running these commands:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew install ffmpeg 
</code></pre>

<p>then process your video file with:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -c:a aac -strict -2 -b:a 128k output.mp4 
</code></pre>

<p>and try to play the output it wont show that error but it will be a blank video (just a black screen). So I think the issue is just getting the right encoding, have tried some different encodings but all seems to just show a black screen. </p>

<p>Will do some more digging but for the time being it seems to be just the emulator does not support your encoding.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Ok so I got the videoplay working, I processed the video with:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i SampleVideo_1080x720_1mb.mp4 -codec:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -preset slow -b:v 250k -maxrate 250k -bufsize 500k -vf scale=-1:360 -threads 0 -codec:a aac -strict -2 -b:a 96k output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>Check this <a href="https://www.virag.si/2012/01/web-video-encoding-tutorial-with-ffmpeg-0-9/" rel="nofollow">site</a> for the ffmpeg parameters.
I setup my <code>VideoView</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class Activity1 : Activity
    {
        VideoView videoView;
        protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)
        {
            base.OnCreate (bundle);

            // Set our view from the "main" layout resource
            SetContentView (Resource.Layout.Main);
            videoView = FindViewById&lt;VideoView&gt; (Resource.Id.SampleVideoView);
            videoView.SetMediaController(new MediaController(this));
            videoView.SetVideoPath ($"android.resource://{PackageName}/{Resource.Raw.output}");
            videoView.RequestFocus ();
            videoView.Start ();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work on the Xamarin Android Player but only for API versions 16(JellyBean) and 19(Kitkat). 21 (lollipop) just doesn't load the video.</p>

<p>Then I downloaded the <a href="https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download" rel="nofollow">GenyMotion</a> Emulator (need to create an account but its free for personal use) to check if it was the Xamarin Player or not. It works on all (16,17,18,19,20 + 22) apart from 21(lollipop). looks like something is wrong with the emulators for 21, I did all my testing on nexus 4 emulators. So if you want tot est video playback I would try to avoid emulators with API 21.</p>
