<p>If your collection of files is not large, then the easiest way to convert to HTML is to use Microsoft Word's save as HTML feature.  If the goal is to produce HTML output, regardless of the cleanliness of the output, that's the way to go.</p>

<p>You can also use a recorded macro to get MS Word to convert large numbers of files.</p>

<p>Edit: Answering comments</p>

<p>I mean use Microsoft Word to open the file (using File, Open), then using File, Save As and choosing "Web Page" as the type.  As for the macro, you can use <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/record-or-run-a-macro-HA010099769.aspx" rel="nofollow">this Microsoft reference for macros</a>.</p>
