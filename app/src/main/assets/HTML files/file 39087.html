<p>Yes, this is correct. When they are first observed they will not have their value set. You should then get a subsequence event emitted on the signal with the initial value.</p>

<p>If you don't want the first value, just skip it!</p>

<pre><code>RACSignal *skipped = [RACObserve(self.tableVM, tableDataVO) skip:1];
</code></pre>
