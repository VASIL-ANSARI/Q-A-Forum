<p>Solr has (and Sunspot supports) a concept called "multiselect facets", which is what you need here. Essentially you can tell Solr to ignore a condition (or multiple conditions) just for the purposes of calculating a certain facet. So what you'd want to do here is:</p>

<pre><code>Sunspot.search(MyModel) do
  facet_restriction = with(:facet_id, params[:facet_id])
  facet(:facet_id, :exclude =&gt; facet_restriction)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
