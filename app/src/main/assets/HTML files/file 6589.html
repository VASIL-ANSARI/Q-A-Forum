<p>You can't use the calls asynchronously like this, the callbacks run <em>later</em> after your calling function has long since returned.  Instead, what you need to do is call the function that needs the data as part of the (or the entire) callback, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function ajaxCall(url, callback) {
  $.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: url,
    success: callback
  });
}

function fooBar() {
    ajaxCall('some/url', function (data) {
        functionThatNeedsData(data);
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's just an example to show what's going on, in practice it could just be:</p>

<pre><code>function fooBar() {
  $.get('some/url', functionThatNeedsData);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This just calls your <code>functionThatNeedsData</code> which gets the data from the request as the first argument...so as soon as the server responds with data, you're passing it on where it needs to do and doing the rest of your work with that data.</p>
