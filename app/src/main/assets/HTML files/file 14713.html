<p>It's a quote issue. You're wrapping your query in single quotes which conflicts with the single quotes you  use in the <code>GROUP_CONCAT</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>$result = mysql_query(
"SELECT * , GROUP_CONCAT(phonenr
SEPARATOR  ', ' ) 
FROM employee AS e JOIN phonenr AS p ON p.ssn = e.ssn GROUP BY e.ssn");
</code></pre>
