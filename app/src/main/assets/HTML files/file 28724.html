<p>After spending quite a bit of time on this, I came up with a solution, this could probably be written a little better, such as putting a condition on $upload->receive() to do something on failure, but this works for now. I am using the Zend_File_Transfer class as trying to fool the form into accepting the file transfer through a file element just did not work I think because of the php file upload security in place etc.  <br>
<br>    $upload = new Zend_File_Transfer();
<br>    $upload->addValidator('MimeType', false, array('image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/gif', 'video/mpeg', 'video/mp4'));
<br>    //$upload->addValidator('Size', false, 200000);
<br>    $upload->setDestination(APPLICATION_PATH . "/../public/media/tmp");
<br>    $upload->receive();
<br>    $filename = $upload->getFileName();
<br>    $mimeType = $upload->getMimeType();</p>
