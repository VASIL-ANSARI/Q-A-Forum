<p>The key is to realise that you will have to provide your own driving loopâI have provided a simple demo below. I was lazy and used a Queue object to provide a FIFO, I haven't used python for a significant project for a while.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

import Queue

def foo():
    print('Constructing foo')
    yield
    print('Running in foo')
    yield
    print('Explicit context switch to foo again')

def bar():
    print('Constructing bar')
    yield
    print('Explicit context to bar')
    yield
    print('Implicit context switch back to bar')

def trampoline(taskq):
    while not taskq.empty():
        task = taskq.get()
        try:
            task.next()
            taskq.put(task)
        except StopIteration:
            pass

tasks = Queue.Queue()
tasks.put(foo())
tasks.put(bar())

trampoline(tasks)

print('Finished')
</code></pre>

<p>And when run:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./coroutines.py 
Constructing foo
Constructing bar
Running in foo
Explicit context to bar
Explicit context switch to foo again
Implicit context switch back to bar
Finished
</code></pre>
