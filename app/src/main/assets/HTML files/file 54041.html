<p>It seems like you're either letting unit testing into your integration/functional tests, or you're worried about testing other things besides a certain unit.</p>

<p>If you're unit testing <code>Thing</code> then you should be mocking the parts that you're not testing. But if you're testing how <code>Thing</code> integrates with other things (such as the DB) then you should be testing your actual <code>Thing</code>, not a mocked up one.</p>

<p>Also, this is where dependency injection makes a lot of sense, because you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Thing:
    def __init__(self, db, dangerous_thing):
        self.db = db
        self.dangerous_thing = dangerous_thing

    #....

    def charlie(self):
        foxtrot = self.dangerous_thing.do_it()
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can pass in a mock for the <code>dangerous_thing</code> while you're testing <code>Thing</code> out so you don't have to worry about <em>really</em> doing the <code>dangerous_thing</code>.</p>
