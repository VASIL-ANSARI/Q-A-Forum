<p>Please be more specific about the steps you already took to achieve LDAP login. Did you implement the methods documented in <a href="https://git.typo3.org/Packages/TYPO3.LDAP.git/blob/HEAD:/Documentation/Index.rst" rel="nofollow">https://git.typo3.org/Packages/TYPO3.LDAP.git/blob/HEAD:/Documentation/Index.rst</a>? Does the login form work, does the submit of the form return anything?</p>

<p>You might first check your LDAP log on the LDAP server if it gets any request at all. The information provided by the LDAP log helps you to spot the problem easily; may it be problems with encryption or something else.</p>
