<p>You're on the right track. <code>GROUP BY</code> the group, but instead of counting the group id, try instead doing a <code>SUM</code> on tasks that are incomplete, like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT g.id, g.name,
SUM(IF(t.status = 0, 1, 0)) incomplete_tasks
FROM task_groups g
LEFT JOIN tasks t ON (t.group_id = g.id)
GROUP BY g.id ASC
HAVING incomplete_tasks &gt; 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Omit the <code>HAVING</code> clause if you want to list <em>all</em> task groups.</p>

<p><em>Note: I didn't see the purpose of <code>g.status</code> in your query, and <code>status</code> wasn't listed as a column in the <code>groups</code> table so I've left it out of my example.</em></p>
