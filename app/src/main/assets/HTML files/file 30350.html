<p>As a base64 encoded string only can contain three characters that needs URI encoding, you can just replace those three:</p>

<pre><code>string text128Enc = text128.Replace("+", "%2b").Replace("/", "%2f").Replace("=", "%3d");
</code></pre>

<p>I tested this on a base64 tring created from 100 MB of data, and it takes about one second to encode that string.</p>
