<p>I see there are two similar variables: one is <strong>ForEntity</strong> (possibly a class property property?) and the second being <strong>forEntity</strong> (method parameter). Is that a typo?</p>

<p>Either way, given that the <em>Where</em> method is enumerated lazily I would assume that one of the lambda parameters in 
<code>(c =&gt; c.C3Entity == ForEntity.TypeID &amp;&amp; c.C3EntityRecordID == ForEntity.ID)</code>
is null. Try adding null-checks for every parameter and/or property to avoid exceptions.</p>
