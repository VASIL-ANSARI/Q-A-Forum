<p>In your client, you are not starting Qt's event loop. You should allocate an application object and either call exec_ on it and handle the debug_msg calls via timers or you should pump the event loop using QCoreApplication.processEvents().</p>

<p>Another option is to use flush():</p>

<p><a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qabstractsocket.html#flush" rel="nofollow">http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qabstractsocket.html#flush</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>bool QAbstractSocket::flush ()</code></p>
  
  <p>This function writes as much as possible from the internal write
  buffer to the underlying network socket, without blocking. If any data
  was written, this function returns true; otherwise false is returned.</p>
  
  <p>Call this function if you need QAbstractSocket to start sending
  buffered data immediately. The number of bytes successfully written
  depends on the operating system. In most cases, you do not need to
  call this function, because QAbstractSocket will start sending data
  automatically once control goes back to the event loop. In the absence
  of an event loop, call waitForBytesWritten() instead.</p>
