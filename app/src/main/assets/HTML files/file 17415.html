<p>Running Chris' code against the built in stencil ("TIMELN_M.VSS") and template on Visio 2010 I found it worked perfectly.  If you run it against the built in stencil with a blank document, however, the Description and Date shape data field are not displayed.  The visibility of these two fields depend on a User cell ("User.visTLShowProps") in the <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/visio/archive/2005/05/18/47514.aspx" rel="nofollow">Document ShapeSheet</a> that either gets added by the addon or is added when one of the masters is dropped.</p>

<p>The standard template contains two <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa201790%28v=office.10%29.aspx#851" rel="nofollow">persistent events</a> that call functionality in the addon for DocumentCreated and DocumentOpened and, again, either these add a couple of other User cells that are used to toggle the value of the above on and off, or they exist in the template.  In any case, these are not added to the Document ShapeSheet if you're not using the original template.</p>

<p>This means that you need to toggle the value yourself.  For example (a quick VBA example):</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub SetTlShowProps(ByRef vDoc As Visio.Document)
If (Not vDoc Is Nothing) Then
    Dim docShp As Visio.Shape
    Set docShp = vDoc.DocumentSheet
    If (docShp.CellExistsU("User.visTLShowProps", 0)) Then
        docShp.CellsU("User.visTLShowProps").FormulaU = 1
    End If
End If
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Or, of course you could add those 'push' cells into you're own document template in the ShapeSheet:</p>

<pre><code>User.visTLShowPropsOn = SETF(GetRef(User.visTLShowProps),1)

User.visTLShowPropsOff = SETF(GetRef(User.visTLShowProps),0)
</code></pre>

<p>A final point if this doesn't solve your problem is, are you using a different or derived stencil ("Timeline Shapes.vss")?</p>
