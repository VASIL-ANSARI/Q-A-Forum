<p>Who produces the text <code>Welcome !!!</code>? Maybe the other side doesn't close the stream.</p>

<p>In any case, your code is very ineffective. You are creating many String objects, one per each character read. If you are reading text from stream, you'd better use something like:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
String line;
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
    sb.append(line);
}
br.close(); // and catch exception
</code></pre>
