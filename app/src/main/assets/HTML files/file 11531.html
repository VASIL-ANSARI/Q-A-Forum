<p>It really depends of your IIS Website configuration.</p>

<p>By default it will use the application pool's identity if you disabled the anonymous access. But if you configure your application with <code>Impersonation=true</code>, then it will use your user's identity as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xh507fc5.aspx" rel="nofollow">described</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The configuration illustrated in the example enables the entire application to run using the contoso\Jane identity, regardless of the identity of the request. This type of impersonation can be delegated to another computer. That is, if you specify the user name and password for the impersonated user, you can connect to another computer on the network and request resources, such as files or access to <strong>SQL Server</strong>, using integrated security. If you enable impersonation and do not specify a domain account as the identity, you will not be able to connect to another computer on the network unless your IIS application is configured to use Basic authentication.</p>
