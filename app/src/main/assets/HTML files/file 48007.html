<p>I ran into the same problem, however with <code>svn</code>.  I found that by installing El Capitan, Xcode was "uninstalled".  I reinstalled Xcode from the App Store and then reinstalled Xcode Command Line Tools via Terminal with</p>

<pre><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre>

<p>After installation, my <code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin</code> directory reappeared and <code>svn</code> started working again.</p>
