<p>Might work if you design Operation as List. If you need to take measure that there will always be just one Operation for the User of the class then Hide this List Property to the normal user and publish a Operation Property also with [XmlIgnore] set.</p>

<p>Maybe XmlElement fits better to your need than XmlArrayItem.</p>

<pre><code>public class Resource
{
    [XmlArrayItem("Create", typeof(Create))]
    [XmlArrayItem("Delete", typeof(Delete))]    
    public List&lt;Operation&gt; {get; set;}
}
</code></pre>
