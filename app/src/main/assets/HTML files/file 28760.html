<p>i'm guessing in your tasks your doing this</p>

<pre><code>from celery.utils.log import get_task_logger
logger = get_task_logger(__name__)
</code></pre>

<p>if your doing that then your logger name will be the module name, so if your task is in a tasks.py file in an app called MyApp your logger will be named 'MyApp.tasks' and you'd have to create the logger 'MyApp.tasks' in your settings. </p>

<p>You can just put a different string in place of __name__ for all of the tasks to log to same logger if you have them all over place. ie: 'celery.task'</p>

<p>oh and make sure your worker loglevel is to what you want it to be</p>
