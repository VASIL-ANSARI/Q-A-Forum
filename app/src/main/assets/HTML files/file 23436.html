<p>As you have two inputs with the same name, only one of them will ever be set to the server.</p>

<p>If you want them to use the same name you're going to need to use POST and two forms, which would require two separate submit buttons but go to the same page. This way you can submit the desired form  based on the filter.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="yourpage.php" method="post"&gt;
      &lt;input type="hidden" name="search_value" value="members"/&gt;
       ... member stuff
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Filter Members"/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;form action="yourpage.php" method="post"&gt;
      &lt;input type="hidden" name="search_value" value="event"/&gt;
       ... event stuff
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Filter Events"/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could use an input type of a radio button, as that supports having the same name as only one value can be selected at once.</p>

<pre><code>Event: &lt;input type="radio" name="search_type" value="event"/&gt;
Members: &lt;input type="radio" name="search_type" value="members"/&gt; 



// Then in PHP $_POST["search_type"] will hold the selected value.
</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to stick with GET, you could use JavaScript to set the value of a single hidden element before the user clicks the link.</p>
