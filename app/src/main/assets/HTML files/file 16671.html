<p>I encountered this same problem.  It doesn't have anything to do with the connection string, and we'll assume that it is correct.  What I found is that critical files from the Oracle client were missing.  Once I added them, then I stopped getting this error.  I have narrowed it down to the following minimum number of files.  More files may be required for advanced functionality, but these are the minimum you should have in your installation.  I am using the <em>OracleClient  11.2.0.3.0</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Oracle.DataAccess.dll</strong>  <em>(Main reference assembly)</em></li>
<li><strong>OraOps11w.dll</strong></li>
<li><strong>oci.dll</strong></li>
<li><strong>oraociei11.dll</strong> <em>(Ths was the main DLL that fixed the Open() exception error)</em></li>
</ul>
