<p>The error you're seeing occurs at query parsing time, i.e. nothing has been executed yet. At that time, the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/9fa69bd663206c0d7800d866acd7afe40bb6d9ce/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/functionscore/fieldvaluefactor/FieldValueFactorFunctionParser.java" rel="nofollow"><code>FieldValueFactorFunctionParser</code></a> builds the <code>filter_value_factor</code> function to be executed later, but it notices that the <code>views</code> field doesn't exist in the mapping type. </p>

<p>Note that the filter has not been executed yet, just like the <code>filter_value_factor</code> function, it has only been parsed by <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/9fa69bd663206c0d7800d866acd7afe40bb6d9ce/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/index/query/functionscore/FunctionScoreQueryParser.java#L217" rel="nofollow"><code>FunctionScoreQueryParser</code></a>.</p>

<p>I'm wondering why you can't simply add a field in your mapping type, it's  as easy as running this</p>

<pre><code>curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/blog/_mapping/page' -d '{
    "page" : {
        "properties" : {
            "views" : {"type" : "integer"}
        }
    }
}'
</code></pre>

<p>If this is REALLY not an option, another possibility would be to use <code>script_score</code> instead, like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "query": {
    "function_score": {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "author-title": "developer"
        }
      },
      "functions": [
        {
          "filter": {
            "range": {
              "views": {
                "from": 1
              }
            }
          }, 
          "script_score": {
            "script": "_score * doc.views.value"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
