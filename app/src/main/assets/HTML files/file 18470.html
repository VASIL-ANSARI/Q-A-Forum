<p>If you want to get the rows one after the other, you can do this :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(FieldID) AS "CountA" FROM table WHERE Rezervovany = 0 AND Prodany = 0
union
SELECT COUNT(FieldID) AS "CountB" FROM table WHERE Rezervovany = 1 AND Prodany = 0
union
SELECT COUNT(FieldID) AS "CountC" FROM table WHERE Prodany = 1
</code></pre>
