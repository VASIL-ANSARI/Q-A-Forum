<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29" rel="nofollow">Cohesion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29" rel="nofollow">Coupling</a> are 2 important concept in order make a good OO design you are trying.</strong> </p>

<p>Cohesion should be more concerning to you because that's what will drive the decision on how to organize the data.</p>

<p>Key questions you need to ask yourself are like (<em>since you haven't provided all the data so you need to think and ask yourself</em>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Are these fields related to each other</li>
<li>Do these fields possibly define the state of an object</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on what the type of fields and their purpose, you may choose to make classes or keep them in single class.</p>

<p>Looking at the same code you have provided, you have made everything static and fields doesn't look like defining state of an object or class, so probably keeping them in one class looks fine but one thing you can do is divide the data in 2 classes, make one more class like <code>ApplicationConstants</code> and put all constants like <code>static final String M_READY_INTENT = "com.intent.action.M_READY"</code> in that class.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've considered just creating a local instance in my MainActivity and
  simply interfacing MainActivity to get access to the DataObject, but
  I'm not sure that passing an interface everywhere is the correct
  option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have made everything static so why you even want to create an object of your <code>DataObject</code> class, just access all the fields using static getter and setter methods. </p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Updated based on OP's edit.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I don't all your fields of the DataObject class and their purpose, so below design is based on information provided</em></p>

<p>Looks like you need to have 3 different classes to maintain the state of what you call Foo, Bar and Cat.</p>

<p>So, keep this <code>DataObject</code> class as your super class and have fields in it which doesn't require a unique state, so:</p>

<pre><code>public class DataObject {
  public static final String M_READY_INTENT = "com.intent.action.M_READY"
  // Code for informing the rest of the application when certain data has become available. Could be static ...
  //Anything else which is not unique and is not dependent on Foo, Cat or Bar...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then create your 3 new classes which will hold the state, sample <code>FooDataObject</code></p>

<pre><code>public class FooDataObject extends DataObject {
     public jsonRawFoo;
      public HashMap&lt;String, Foo&gt; catFoos = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
      public String session;
      public boolean optFoo;
      public boolean dataState = false;
      //Etc... more methods and getter/setter ...
}


public class BarDataObject extends DataObject {
     public jsonRawBar;
      public HashMap&lt;String, Foo&gt; catBars = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
      public String session;
      public boolean optBar;
      public boolean dataState = false;
      //Etc... more methods and getter/setter ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, basically anything which is global state will end up as a field in <code>DataObject</code>, and anything which is specific state will end up as a field in <code>FooDataObject</code> or <code>CatDataObject</code> or <code>BarDataObject</code>.</p>
