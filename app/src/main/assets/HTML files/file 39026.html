<p>You have to render the management form in your template. The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/formsets/#understanding-the-managementform">docs</a> explain why and how; some selected quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This form is used by the formset to manage the collection of forms contained in the formset. If you donât provide this management data, an exception will be raised[.]</p>
  
  <p>The management form is available as an attribute of the formset itself. When rendering a formset in a template, you can include all the management data by rendering {{ my_formset.management_form }} (substituting the name of your formset as appropriate).</p>
