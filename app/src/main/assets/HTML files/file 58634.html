<p>The only possible way for finding more lines in b.txt than the number of string written is that some of the strings in <code>y</code> actually contain new lines.</p>

<p>Here is a small example</p>

<pre><code>l = [ 'a', 'b\nc']
print len(l)
with open('tst.txt', 'wb') as fd:
    for i in l:
        print &gt;&gt; fd, i
</code></pre>

<p>This little code will print 2 because list l contains 2 elements, but the resulting file will contain 3 lines:</p>

<pre><code>a
b
c
</code></pre>
