<p>The following should do the trick: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM member inner join mmship
   ON member.member_Id = mmship.member_Id
   INNER JOIN mshipstatus
   ON mshipstatus.mshipstatus_Id = mmship.mshipstatus_Id
WHERE mshipstatus.mshipstatusname = 'prospective'
   AND MONTH(mmship.mmshipstart_date) = MONTH(GETDATE())
</code></pre>

<p>(you can change the getdate() with another date).</p>
