<p><strong>DONT EVER DO THIS</strong>... else you'll surely reject by <em>Apple</em>, I don't know what problem you're facing after user change different language from your app, because I'd worked on this kind of app before (which supports multiple language and user may able to change it while current running of the app). I don't have idea with <em>Swift</em> but in <em>ObjectiveC</em> it works perfect.</p>

<p>From Documentation, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1561/_index.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1561/_index.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warning: Do not call the exit function. Applications calling exit will appear to the user to have crashed, rather than performing a graceful termination and animating back to the Home screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NOT RECOMMENDED</strong> but still, you can ask user to Restart their app whenever they changed the language with proper message like, " needs to restart to take effect of language change, [please save your any on going work] and close and again open the app to see the effect, thanks !"</p>

<p>Here, the words inside &lt;...> should be your app name, and [...] need to show if you're making an app that needs to save user information before exit?.</p>
