<p>NSKeyedArchiver/Unarchiver should encode and decode NSArrays and NSDictionaries with no problem. If your packet class you've created implements the NSCoding protocol, you need to explicitly call <code>[encodeObject:</code><em><code>myNsArray</code></em><code>forKey:@"stringsArray"]</code> in your <code>-encodeWithCoder:</code> method (assuming that <em>myNsArray</em> is the name of the instance variable in your packet object you want to encode).  But then the archiver and NSArray should take care of the rest of it. If you're doing this, it would be helpful to hear more about the layout of your classes and who's calling who when encoding/decoding.</p>
