<p>I've experienced this before - not with jQuery but with YUI. I believe the <code>.val()</code> method is prone to returning the value <strong>before</strong> the change event has propagated - whereas accessing the underlying DOM element's value directly should work. So instead of:</p>

<pre><code>var plantid = $('.drpplants').val();
</code></pre>

<p>You'd have something like:</p>

<pre><code>var plantid = $('.drpplants').get(0).value;
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to correct that second syntax - I'm not sure that's the best way of accessing the underlying DOM node in jQuery...</p>
