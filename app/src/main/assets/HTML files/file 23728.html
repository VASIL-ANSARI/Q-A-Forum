<p>Even such <em>professional</em> tools like <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" rel="nofollow">Process Explorer</a> are working will a poll mechanism (can be configured through View - Update Speed).</p>

<p>So i would say there exists no such mechanism and all you can do is regularly retrieve the list of all running process and compare it with the list you retrieved beforehand. </p>
