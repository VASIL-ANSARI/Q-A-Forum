<p>This means you want some event(s) to stop bubbling (up) the control hierarchy. 
All you should usually need to do is marked the event as handled (the event instance you get in your event handler):</p>

<pre><code>e.Handled = true;
</code></pre>

<p>In your case should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>private void _browser_TouchDown(object sender, TouchEventArgs e)
{ 
    //...
    e.Handled = true;
    //...
}
</code></pre>
