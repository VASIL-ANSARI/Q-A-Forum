<p>Based on your description, it sounds as though you are using inline SQL to write the records to the database. If this is the case, then the correct approach is to format the DateTime in a standard way.</p>

<p>For SQL Server, the standard format is</p>

<pre><code>theDate.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.000")
</code></pre>

<p>However, it is strongly recommended to use parameterized SQL instead of inline SQL if possible (there are situations where it is not practical or possible). In this case, the parameters will handle the formatting of the date correctly so you don't have to worry about it.</p>
