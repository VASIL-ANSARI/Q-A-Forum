<p>I have seen this problem with my code whenver there is some really complex computations going on in the UI thread. If you have implemented flood fill in the UI thread, the computations are causing 99% CPU usage due to which other applications and services are not getting thier share of the CPU. As a result, android will try to kill your app inorder to restore the integrity of the System. As a simple solution, try to offload your computations to a AsyncTask or a thread.</p>
