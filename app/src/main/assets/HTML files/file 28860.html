<p>After much experimentation, the answer to this seems to be that the salesforce developer's guide is inaccurate and the 'hmtl-' prefix is not supported by the <code>&lt;apex:inputField&gt;</code> component.  I can add it without a problem to an <code>&lt;apex:outputPanel&gt;</code> component.  Don't understand why this should be so and the whole point to using these attributes is to locate data in a relevant place and avoid complex jquery selects to find the data relative to the location at which it is required.</p>
