<p>Here are couple of suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>do you need all those buttons loading up at once?</li>
<li>do you (over)use transparencies in your images?</li>
<li>are the images the exact size required? Stretching (resizing) takes time to compute</li>
<li>do you perform any operation that is blocking the main thread?</li>
</ul>
