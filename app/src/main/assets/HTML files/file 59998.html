<p>To attack your immediate problems ... NLP (natural language processing) generally processing the input with a lexicon (vocabulary), not string search.  One popular tactic is to give each word or word family an index number, often simply the word's position (line number) in a dictionary file.  The initial reading simply identifies each word; fancier applications also break down word families, so that "were" gets coded as "is / plural / past tense".</p>

<p>Regardless, you store your sentence as a string of word indices, such that "This is batman" might appear as [27086, 8334, 522]  (FYI: I'm making up the index numbers).  Now, when you test for the word "hi", you'll search for word 7930, and there's no conflict at all with 8334.</p>

<p>For the larger problem, see the comments we've given: NLP is a large field.</p>
