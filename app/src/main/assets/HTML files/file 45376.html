<p>In v0.6.1 this seems to be a bit of buggy behavior related to that functionality. Because you do not enclose your text in a block-level element dompdf does not appear to be able to track it for flow to the next page (a first guess at the issue). The fix seems to be to wrap that text in a block-level element.</p>

<p>The code sample you provided doesn't seem amenable to fixing the issue, but you want to try aiming for is something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class='c2'&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;DRAWING AND DOCUMENT DELIVERY:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Drawing and Engineering documents to be submitted starting in 2-3 weeks after receipt of order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Welding and NDE procedures and related shall be submitted 2-3 weeks after receipt of order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Drawings and Engineering documents shall be returned to HWE 7 working days after submission.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
