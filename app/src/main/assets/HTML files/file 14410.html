<p>Open up the "Modules" window while you are debugging and take a look at the "Path" column - does the path given for you assembly match an assembly which you <strong>know</strong> matches the source code?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET</a> normally puts copies of assemblies in the "Temporary ASP.NET Files" folder and so it may well be that you need to clear this out too.</p>

<p>Note that you can also untick the "Require source files to exactly match the original version" which will allow you to debug as long as the source code isn't <em>that</em> far out. However, it's probably a better idea that you fix the underlying problem (the assemblies don't match the source) instead.</p>
