<p>There is no need to put that burden on PHP when MySQL has built-in functionality for that already. You should take a look at MySQL's <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_datediff" rel="nofollow"><code>DATEDIFF()</code></a> function:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>DATEDIFF()</code> returns <code>expr1</code> â <code>expr2</code> expressed as a value in days from one date to the other. <code>expr1</code> and <code>expr2</code> are date or date-and-time expressions. Only the date parts of the values are used in the calculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of two dates that'd give a 7-day difference could be:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select datediff('2011-06-18','2011-06-25');
+-------------------------------------+
| datediff('2011-06-18','2011-06-25') |
+-------------------------------------+
|                                  -7 | 
+-------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the first date occured -7 days after the first date; that's 7 days <em>before</em>. If you let the two arguments switch place, the result would be a positive 7.</p>
