<p>You need to put hashes around it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM table1 a 
JOIN table2 b ON a.id=b.id 
WHERE a.#url.variable# LIKE '%test%'
</code></pre>

<p>You can't use a cfqueryparam in this case so I'd also ensure that URL.variable has been escaped of any SQL injection characters before using it in your query.</p>
