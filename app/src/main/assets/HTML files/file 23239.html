<p>There's a difference, copying the properties between two prototypes doesn't make them "connected" to each other, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>$.extend(Lion.prototype, Animal.prototype);

// add one more method to the prototype
Animal.prototype.test = function() {
  alert('test');
};

var x = new Lion();
x.test(); // TypeError: Object &lt;Lion&gt; has no method 'test'
</code></pre>

<p>You wouldn't have this if you use <code>new Animal()</code> as the prototype for <code>Lion</code>, as demonstrated <a href="http://jsbin.com/ibacen/1/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
