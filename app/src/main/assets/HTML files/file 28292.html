<p>Your calculations are correct. The only thing might be - sometimes it's important whether it's O(g(n^2)) or O(g(<strong>99</strong>*n^2)).
The multiplier becomes not-so-important on large-scaled N values, but at small scales - a constant factor of 99x times the iterations (when not optimized by compiler) might be important.</p>
