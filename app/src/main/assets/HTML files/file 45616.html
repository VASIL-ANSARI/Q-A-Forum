<p>If your file that youre reading is encoded in utf8 then your code will work fine. If its not then you can convert it to utf8 by using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/libiconv/documentation/libiconv-1.13/iconv.1.html" rel="nofollow">GNU iconv</a> and then run your code. That should work.</p>

<p>Edit: When you want to write the data in utf-8 you have to wrap the FileOutputStream in an OutputStreamWriter and pass the encoding when creating it. </p>
