<p>Have you thought about configuring a Private Memory Limit or Virtual Memory Limit on your .NET AppPool? How about recycling the AppPool after a particular number of requests have been made (eg. over 9000)? It sounds like, since you're running the code so many times, it might be hitting some sort of memory limit within the Common Language Runtime (CLR).</p>
