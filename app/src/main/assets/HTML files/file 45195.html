<p>Yes, a linking table for flight bookings seems appropriate, with primary keys from the two tables in the many to many relationship. You probably also want other information pertaining to the specific booking in this table, such as number of seats reserved, date reservation was placed, credit card used, discount coupon applied, etc. </p>

<p>You would add rows to this table when a customer books a flight.
You would read rows from this table when showing a customer's bookings or to determine number of seats left on a flight (something like: <code>availableSeats = Flight.NumberOfSeats - bookings.Where(b =&gt; b.FlightId == Flight.FlightId).Select(b =&gt; b.NumberOfSeats).Sum();</code>).
You would update rows in this table when a customer wants to modify / cancel a booking, or when a flight is cancelled.</p>
