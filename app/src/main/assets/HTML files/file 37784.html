<p>Looks to me like your query and syntax are confused by the >, &lt;, <code>MAX()</code>, and <code>MIN()</code> functions.  You are dealing, as far as I can tell, with negative numbers, and expecting the largest absolute value: so -500 is a bigger bid than -400.  However, telling SQL to handle MAX and MIN is looking for the real value of the column, and in mathematical terms -400 is bigger than -500.</p>

<p>Try replacing your <code>MAX()</code> with <code>MIN()</code>, and the other way around.  Alternatively, try using the <code>ABS()</code> function to get the absolute value of the data (e.g., <code>MAX(ABS(Bid))</code></p>
