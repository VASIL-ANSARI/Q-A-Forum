<p>You can use the <code>modeline</code> feature for this. Modelines allow you to set certain options from within a comment in the first/last few lines of your file.</p>

<p>This makes it a great place to set parameters for coding guidelines, folding. Some options cannot be set for security reasons. See <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#modeline">the documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Put this at the top or bottom of the file:</p>

<pre><code>/* vim: setlocal ft=cpp: */
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: More details, prompted by the comments :) :</p>

<p>It will only work if modeline is enabled. In normal circumstances it should be by default. To make sure it is enabled, or to change the size of the area it is detected in, set the <code>modeline</code> option in your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>set modeline=5
</code></pre>

<p>will make sure the line like the one quoted above will be detected in the first five or the last five lines of each file.</p>

<p>Inside the modeline, <code>setlocal</code> means to set options for the buffer the file is loaded in. The <code>ft</code> option, also known as <code>filetype</code>, is what determines the syntax highlighting language. The value <code>cpp</code> is the one that is used by C++ files.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Without the modeline, with a bit more work, if you can identify a magic pattern:</p>

<pre><code>au BufRead * if search('MagicPattern', 'nw') | setlocal ft=cpp | endif
</code></pre>

<p>Meaning: Every time you open a file, check if <code>"MagicPattern"</code> is in there. If it is, treat it as C++. The pattern argument is in vim dialect of regular expressions; check <code>help pattern</code> for details.</p>
