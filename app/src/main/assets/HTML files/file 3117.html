<p>IF you happen to use ASP.Net / ASP.Net MVC, I would say the best place to do this would be via a custom HTTP Module by handling the AuthenticateRequest method &amp; continuing with the request only if the request has been authenticated. There are tons of excellent articles online for this code.</p>

<p>Also - have a look at the Roles &amp; Memberships of ASP.Net - it is pretty good &amp; generally satisfies most requirements or you are always free to extend it. Again - tons of articles on custom membership providers...</p>

<p>unless I am missing something - HTH.</p>
