<p>Have you tried running <code>activate.bat</code>?</p>

<p>Also, I think that setting PYTHONPATH should work, but you'd have to insert new path at the beggining, and it should be path to directory containing django instalation, not to django itself:</p>

<pre><code>set PYTHONPATH=C:\path\to\env\Lib\site-packages\;%PYTHONPATH%
</code></pre>
