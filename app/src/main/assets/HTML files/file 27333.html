<p>Changed my project/build.gradle file to look like this. (Removed the <code>compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.0'</code> bit).</p>

<pre><code>dependencies {
  compile project(':vpi')
  compile 'com.actionbarsherlock:actionbarsherlock:4.4.0@aar'
  compile 'org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2'
  compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar')
}
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to make <code>gradle DebugAssemble</code> work. I did run <code>gradle clean DebugAssemble</code> too, not sure if that had anything to do with this working.</p>

<p>Also had to add a <code>local.properties</code> file to the project root which contained.</p>

<pre><code>sdk.dir=/Applications/Android Studio.app/sdk
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this, importing the settings.gradle file from Android Studio worked.</p>
