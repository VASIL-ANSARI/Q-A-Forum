<p>What sql engine are you using? </p>

<p>At a theoretical level you are looking for reverse result of an intersect <a href="http://www.essentialsql.com/learn-to-use-union-intersect-and-except-clauses/" rel="nofollow">http://www.essentialsql.com/learn-to-use-union-intersect-and-except-clauses/</a>.</p>

<p>This will be a complicated query. You may have to do 
 1. sql for left outer join,
 2. sql for a right outer join 
 3. and do union of the two result sets.</p>

<p>HTH..</p>
