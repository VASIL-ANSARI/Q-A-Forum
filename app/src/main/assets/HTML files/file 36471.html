<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Watch out for some instances of <code>UIScrollView</code> inside your page that has 0 size (width/height).</p>

<p>I think I figured this out. </p>

<p>As part of my complex view there was a <code>UIScrollView</code> (let's call it <code>SV1</code>) and at some point I needed to hide it. To hide that scrollview I set its frame to the CGRectZero. </p>

<p>During leaving the page the superview (<code>V2</code>) of that zero-ed scrollview was being removed from its superview and for some reason that was causing the crash (I verified that by trying to remove V2 manually during <code>viewWillDisappear</code> and I was able to get exact same crash. </p>

<p>To fix it - instead of assigning CGRectZero to the scrollview SV1, I simply removed it from superview V2 at that time (when I needed to hide it). This solve my problem. Hopefully it will help somebody else.</p>
