<p>You need to remove the constraint from that view highlighted in yellow to the top of the view in IB, and delete all the code, there's no need for it. If the system won't let you delete that constraint, it's because that view has no intrinsic size, so you need to give it a fixed height first, then delete the top constraint.</p>

<p>I think the reason your view disappeared, is because those 2 constraints were set up in IB on a 4" screen, and the simulator is using a 3.5" screen, so to maintain those constraints, the only thing that can change is the view's height, which probably got set to zero or below.</p>
