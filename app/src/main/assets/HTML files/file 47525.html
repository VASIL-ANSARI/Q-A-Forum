<p><strong>Update:</strong> This solution, though <em>seemingly</em> correct, doesn't work as intended (it seemed it was at first though). For reasons best explained in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/864651/nmott">nmott</a>'s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31932687/2184155">answer</a> below. Will leave it here for posterity.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was able to get this working using <code>container_commands</code> via the <code>.ebextensions</code> directory config files. Learn <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html#customize-containers-format-container_commands" rel="nofollow">more about container commands</a> here. And I quote ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The commands in <code>container_commands</code> are processed in alphabetical
  order by name. They run after the application and web server have been
  set up and the application version file has been extracted, but before
  the application version is deployed. They also have access to
  environment variables such as your AWS security credentials.
  Additionally, you can use leader_only. One instance is chosen to be
  the leader in an Auto Scaling group. If the leader_only value is set
  to true, the command runs only on the instance that is marked as the
  leader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, applying that knowledge ... the <code>container_commands.config</code> will be ...</p>

<pre><code># .ebextensions/container_commands.config
container_commands:
  01_migrate_db:
    command: docker exec `docker ps -l -q -f 'status=running'` rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
    leader_only: true
    ignoreErrors: false
  02_seed_db:
    command: docker exec `docker ps -l -q -f 'status=running'` rake db:seed RAILS_ENV=production
    leader_only: true
    ignoreErrors: false
</code></pre>

<p>That runs the migrations first and then seeds the database. We use <code>docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER_ID COMMAND [ARG...]</code> which runs the appended <code>COMMAND [ARG...]</code> in the context of the existing container (not the host). And we get <code>CONTAINER_ID</code> by running <code>docker ps -q</code>.</p>
