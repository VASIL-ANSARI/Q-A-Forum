<p>I don't use LightTable, but if you can tell it to use the python executable in the virtualenv's <code>bin</code> directory, that should work.  That's how virtualenv works.  The python executable traverses up through the virtualenv's directory structure until it finds a <code>lib</code> dir with the appropriate content.</p>
