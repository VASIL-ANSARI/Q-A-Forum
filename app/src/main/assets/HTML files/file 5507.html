<p>You'd have to use JavaScript to set the value of the textbox, but this obviously wouldn't be posted back to the server or otherwise persisted until your page was eventually submitted.</p>

<p>Let's assume you're using jQuery for your JavaScript library.  The following example seeks out all checkboxes and when any are clicked, the textbox will be updated with the ID values of all currently-checked inputs.</p>

<pre><code>$('input:checkbox').click(function(){
    var result = $(':checkbox:checked').map(function() {
      return this.id;
    }).get().join(',');

    $('#myTextControl').val(result);
});
</code></pre>
