<p>My guess is that you're calling <code>Date_to_MilliSeconds(22, 10, 2010, 19, 49)</code>. Your code explicitly uses UTC, so it's going to treat whatever you pass it in as UTC.</p>

<p>Just like your <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4275823/problem-while-fetching-milliseconds-from-date">previous question</a> (which makes me tempted to close this as a duplicate) it's unclear what you're really trying to do.</p>

<p>If you want to provide a local time to your method, you need to specify a local time zone. If you need to use a local time in the user's time zone, try setting the time zone to <code>TimeZone.getDefault()</code> - although I'd expect that to be the default anyway. If you want to provide a UTC time to your method, you need to specify a UTC time zone (as you are here).</p>

<p>What are you <em>really</em> trying to do?</p>
