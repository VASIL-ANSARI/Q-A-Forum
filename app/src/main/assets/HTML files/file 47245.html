<p>As far as I know best option for running multiple animations on a view is using PropertyValuesHolder which you can use it simply by .animate() method on the view</p>

<pre><code>theView.animate().setDuration(100).rotation(34).translationX(100).start();
</code></pre>

<p>the advantage is not just simplicity, its optimization affects of performance too. </p>
