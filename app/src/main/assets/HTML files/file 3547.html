<p>Symfony used to (and probably still does) <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/05-Configuring-Symfony#chapter_05_sub_using_scriptable_configuration" rel="nofollow">allow PHP in it's configuration YML files</a> but I'm not sure about the fixtures files.  However, for what it sounds like you're trying to do PHP in the YML file won't be necessary, you just need to create a script that writes a giant YML file once.</p>

<p>To generate your fixtures I would suggest creating one row in each of the tables you have defined and then dumping that data into a fixtures file to give a template for your data.  Then use that fixtures template for your PHP script, replacing your test values with generated data in a loop.</p>
