<p>Actually I don't understand what do you ask. I see a sort of a test, whereas in case of inconsistency the test is supposed to generate an "integer division by zero" exception or whatever applicable to the specific platform. A really perverted idea IMHO.</p>

<p>So, why doesn't compiler "notice" the division by zero? AFAIK it doesn't have to. Strictly speaking it may generated the code that does just this. Yes, this would generate a processor exception (interrupt) at run-time, so what? If this is the author's intent - I don't see a problem here, at least from compiler's point of view.</p>

<p>Are you trying to say that the compiler behaves inconsistently, sometimes allowing this to compile?</p>
