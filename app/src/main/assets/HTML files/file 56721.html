<p>use <code>.children().hide()</code> on your selector - if it's the only td on the page you could use </p>

<p><code>$('td').children().hide()</code></p>

<p>if it's a more complicated page you'll need to build a selector for that td, but once you have it you can use .children().hide() to hide everything within it but leave it on the page</p>
