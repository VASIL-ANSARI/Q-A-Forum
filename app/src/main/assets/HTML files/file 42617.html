<p>I fear that's not really possible. There's no way to set the <code>$this</code> context in your view to the model. You could convert the model into an array with <code>toArray()</code> but that would include the related model and you would have to access it with <code>$user['name']</code>.</p>

<p>I personally would just declare the user variable explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>$training = Training::find(1);
return view('training/single', ['training' =&gt; $training, 'user' =&gt; $training-&gt;user]);
</code></pre>
