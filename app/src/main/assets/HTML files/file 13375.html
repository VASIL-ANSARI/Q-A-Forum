<p>I know this isn't really a direct answer to your question, but I'd like to say that I recommend you go with Urban Airship for your push needs.</p>

<p>I definitely understand the desire to "comparison shop," but UA is proven and is a defacto leader in the space. With something as mission critical as push notifications, the safe money is with the biggest and most stable offering available.</p>
