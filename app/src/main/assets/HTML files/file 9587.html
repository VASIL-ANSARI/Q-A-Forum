<p>I'm not sure on how to get the included javascript code, nor why you would need this, but how about going the other direction?</p>

<p>Instead of having a script tag, make a XHR call to the file and eval its contents + keep its contents as a variable also. </p>

<p>**Disclaimer: I cannot see why you would need this, nor would I actually suggest you use this method, but it's a work-around. </p>
