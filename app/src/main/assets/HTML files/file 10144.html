<p>You probably need to use the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingSite.html#singleSubDirectory" rel="nofollow"><code>_setCookiePath</code></a> option. </p>

<p>In particular, if your app is at <code>http://packages.python.org/myProject/</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>add <code>_gaq.push(['_setCookiePath', '/myProject/']);</code> into your snippet, right before <code>_gaq.push(['_trackPageViews']);</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>Also, under the "new" (as of 10/2011) analytics interface, I think you have to change the web property's default url to read <code>http://packages.python.org/myProject/</code>, not just the domain name. </p></li>
<li><p>Note the trailing <code>/</code> after <code>myProject</code> in the above steps.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There does currently seem to be a bug with the new interface, it showed the tracker as "not enabled" for me, but when I did all the above and switched back to the "old" interface, it showed the tracker as active, and I seem to be getting data when people check my library's python manual.</p>
