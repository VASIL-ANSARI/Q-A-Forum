<p>I believe the issue is that this:</p>

<pre><code>SevenSegmentLed sevenSegmentLed();
</code></pre>

<p>Is interpreted as a function declaration and not an initialization. Note that you can't have this problem with c# because you have the <code>new</code> keyword disambiguating for you so this particular problem is avoided.</p>

<p>To fix you can do 2 things:</p>

<p>Use the c++ uniform initialization syntax (introduced in newer c++ standard to avoid exactly your issue):</p>

<pre><code>SevenSegmentLed sevenSegmentLed{};
</code></pre>

<p>Or use the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>SevenSegmentLed sevenSegmentLed;
</code></pre>

<p>The main benefit of the uniform syntax is that it's uniform. So for example if you have a constructor that takes an integer you can write it like this:</p>

<pre><code>SevenSegmentLed sevenSegmentLed{1};
</code></pre>

<p>Generally speaking the uniform initialization syntax is preferable, when I was writing the c++ guideline at my work (mostly c# and php guys) I decided to go with this as it's the most clear and unambiguous.</p>
