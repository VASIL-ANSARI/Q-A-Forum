<p>If you don't need to worry about what type of product but how many products where delivered on a certain date, you could have an 2D array where the key is the name of the city and the value is an array of dates:</p>

<pre><code>// key = City, Value = {date1, date2, ... ,dateN}
$deliveredProducts = array
    (
        "city1" =&gt; array("date1", "date2", "date1"),
        "city2" =&gt; array("date2", "date3", "date2")
    );

//To get the number of products delivered to city1 on date1:
$tally = array_count_values($deliveredProducts["city1"]);
$count = $tally["date1"];
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
