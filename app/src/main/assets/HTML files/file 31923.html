<p>When you get an error, take that opportunity to read the docs. In this case, the docs for <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php" rel="nofollow">set_time_limit()</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This function has no effect when PHP is running in safe mode. There is no workaround other than turning off safe mode or changing the time limit in the php.ini. </p>
