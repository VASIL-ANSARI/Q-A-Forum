<p>You can always make default routing to a 404 page by correctly defining routes in your <code>routes.php</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>$routes['article/(:any)'] = 'articles/view_articles/$1';

$routes['(:any)'] = 'main/e404';
</code></pre>

<p>As stated by CodeIgniter user guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Routes will run in the order they are defined. Higher routes will always take precedence over lower ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can basically define all you want to be seen at the beginning of the file and block everything else on the last line.</p>

<p>As for your main(can be any other) controller's 404 method - </p>

<pre><code>function e404() {
    show_404();
}
</code></pre>
