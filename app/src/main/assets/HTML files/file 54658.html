<p>If you are not using root, then you can only use the Android APIs. Here is a list for example for the display: <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display.html</a>
I don't see anything there for the Ambient Display mode or Always-On. </p>

<p>Samsung provides APIs also for the features of it's phones here: <a href="http://developer.samsung.com/galaxy" rel="nofollow">http://developer.samsung.com/galaxy</a> Here I can find the Look API that has something close to what you want, but for Edge.</p>
