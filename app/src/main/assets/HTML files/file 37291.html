<p>The same question <a href="https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/628" rel="nofollow">was answered in the plugin's github issues forum</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a FULL PAGE plugin.
  There's no such option</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not an option the plugin offers. 
If you want to do it, you would need to do it by yourself. Probably by overwriting the <code>height</code> property of the sections and slides after the plugin is rendered (on the <code>afterRender</code> callback) and after it gets resized (<code>afterResize</code>).</p>

<p>You can try it with by adding CSS styles as well, by adding things like:</p>

<pre><code>#section1,
#section1 .fp-slide,
#section1 .fp-tableCell{
    height: auto !important;
}
</code></pre>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>Now fullpage.js provides a way to create smaller sections than the viewport (or even bigger ones when using <code>autoScrolling:false</code> or <code>scrollBar:true</code>.</p>

<p>Adding the class <code>fp-auto-height</code> on each section will do it as stated <a href="https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#creating-smaller-sections" rel="nofollow">in the documentation</a>. </p>
