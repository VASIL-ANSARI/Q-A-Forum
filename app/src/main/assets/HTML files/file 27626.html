<p>MergeField is not use for textbox or any other HTML control, If you see the API documentation <a href="https://secure.echosign.com/public/docs/EchoSignDocumentService16" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can see there is no method for providing editable fields, so I think its not possible, Secondly you can contact their support for this point, as Adobe echo Sign is in building stage.</p>

<p>How flexible are you in choice of the API vendors?I suggests you to use some other API</p>
