<p>The PDF should be saved at 1x resolution, Xcode will take that file and rasterize it generating the @1x, @2x and @3x bitmap versions for you.</p>

<p>In your case 3 PNGs with the following dimensions will be generated from your PDF:</p>

<ul>
<li>icon.png (54x40px)</li>
<li>icon@2x.png (108x80px)</li>
<li>icon@3x.png (162x120px)</li>
</ul>

<p>From the screenshot you've posted it doesn't appear that the UIImageView in the cell has a size that matches the icon, therefore you get the blur. It's important to understand that the vector image won't be used as such, but will be always rasterized.</p>

<p>Try to save the PDF with the resolution of the UIImageView (100x82px as per your comment) and check again the result.</p>
