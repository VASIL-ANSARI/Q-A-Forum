<p>I guess the goal was to make a short cut class of UIControl with factoring away the most common touch event <code>UIControlEventTouchUpInside</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@interface MiniButton : UIControl

-(void)addTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action;
-(void)removeTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action;
-(void)_callAllTargets;

@end

@implementation MiniButton
-(void)addTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action
{
    [self addTarget:target action:action forControlEvents: UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
}

-(void)removeTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action{
    [self removeTarget:target action:action forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
}

-(void) _callAllTargets
{
     [self sendActionsForControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Another option could have been, that he wanted you to extend UIButton. But as UIButton is a so-called class cluster (comparable with a factory), it should not be extended by sub-classing but can be extended by creating a category on UIControl, the parent class of UIButton. Now any instance of any button is extended, no matter what subclass is returned. </p>

<hr>

<p>I think he wanted you to show some knowledge about the fact, that actually UIButton and it real classes are just a small layer on top of UIControl. UIButton has only the reposibility of showing the button's label, image,â¦ . all other things reside in UIControl and it ancestors. </p>
