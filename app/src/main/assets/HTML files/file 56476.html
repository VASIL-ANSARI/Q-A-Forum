<p>This is likely due to the terminal you're using, not the console itself. (Which terminal are you using...?) Try running <code>$ irb</code> and seeing if you're getting the same issue.</p>

<p>I had the same issue a while back, and momentarily fixed it by changing the irb config output mode, but it still tended to break elsewhere. I recommend using ConEmu to permanently squash the annoyance.</p>
