<p>Because if the integral part of the float value is not representable in the new type, the conversion is undefined behavior.</p>

<p>In your case, <code>SHRT_MAX</code> is probably 32767 and so the integral part of <code>65696.0F</code> is then not representable in a <code>short</code> object.</p>
