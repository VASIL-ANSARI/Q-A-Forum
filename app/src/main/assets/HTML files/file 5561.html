<p>you just need to call <code>draggable()</code> on the items that are in your tree.  Your existing code does this already for all items having the class <code>drag</code>.</p>

<p>From your code ('custom.js'):</p>

<pre><code>//Make element draggable
$(".drag").draggable( ... );
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't affect the items in your tree, because they don't have the class <code>drag</code>.  An easy fix would be to simply add the class <code>drag</code> to your tree items. Alternately, you could specifically select your tree items somehow, and then apply draggable to that selection.  </p>
