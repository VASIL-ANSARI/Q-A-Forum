<p>It looks like your server is missing the SimpleXML PHP extension. If you can install packages on this server (either via command line or some other means), look for a package called <code>php-simplexml</code> or <code>php-xml</code>. You will have solved the problem when you see the <code>SimpleXML</code> extension on your phpinfo page, or in the command line output of <code>php -m</code>.</p>

<p>As a side note, I don't think exposing your phpinfo and especially ioncube loader pages is a good idea, especially if your application will be running on this same server. I suggest restricting access to those pages as soon as possible.</p>
