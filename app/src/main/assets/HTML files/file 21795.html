<p>You have shot yourself in the foot because you are ignoring the Java naming conventions.</p>

<p>Variable names should start with a lowercase letter.  Thus:</p>

<pre><code>package textrpg;

public class File {
    static String file;

    public static void setFile(String fileLocation) {
        file = fileLocation;
    }

    public static String getFile(){
        return file;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The java compiler doesn't care about this ... but your foot shot happened because you declared a field called <code>File</code> in a class called <code>File</code>, and Java's rules for disambiguating the name collision came up with a strange answer.</p>

<p>(If you included the compiler error message, it would be easier to explain ...)</p>

<hr>

<p>There are a couple of other problems with this class:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The is very non-OO code.  You have a static field and static methods for getting and setting it.  This kind of thing is a bit "icky" ... and will lead to problems if you need to reuse the code in another context, or implement unit tests, etcetera.</p></li>
<li><p>You are using the same name as a well-known standard class (<code>java.io.File</code>).  This could lead to problems later on if some other class in your application needs to use both <code>java.io.File</code> and <code>textrpg.File</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You are also ignoring the convention about how to form a package name that is designed to avoid package name collisions.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Before you write more code, I strongly recommend that you read the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html" rel="nofollow">Sun Java Coding Conventions</a>.  And unless you have a <em>really really</em> good reason not to, follow them.  ("I couldn't be bothered" is NOT a good reason, IMO.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Ah.  So the compilation error is in this:</p>

<pre><code>PrintWriter save = new PrintWriter(File.getFile());
</code></pre>

<p>and it is saying that it can't find a method called <code>getFile()</code> in <code>File</code>.</p>

<p>Without seeing the rest of that class, I can't be sure.  However, I <em>suspect</em> that you are importing <code>java.io.*</code> ... and THAT means that the <code>File</code> in the code snippet will be referring to <code>java.io.File</code> ... which doesn't have a <code>getFile()</code> method!</p>
