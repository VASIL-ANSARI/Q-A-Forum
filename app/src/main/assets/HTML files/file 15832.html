<p>This isn't something you would do with PHP, but rather with a client-side technology like <a href="http://jqueryui.com/home" rel="nofollow">jQueryUI</a>. I would suggest you look into the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/" rel="nofollow"><code>$.datepicker()</code></a> plugin. This plugin will do what you're asking right out of the box with a single line of JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>$("#mydate").datepicker();
</code></pre>

<p>Which will result in the following:</p>

<p>There are a great deal of options and configurations that you can take advantage of to really customize the data the user can select, as well as how the user interacts with the widget in general.</p>
