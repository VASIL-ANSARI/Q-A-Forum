<p>First off, I wouldn't just copy the 3rd party headers over to your project directory. Just keep them in their own own folder and add that folder to the additional include directories.</p>

<p>Second, if the header is in the same place as the source file, the <code>include</code> should work as-is. So I don't think that's it (assuming you got the capitalization right). I think you're actually looking at a different source file than the one you have in that directory. (you can tell this is the case by hovering over the file's tab in Visual Studio and checking the path or opening the source file you think you included the file in). I'm 99% sure you're compiling the wrong cpp file.</p>
