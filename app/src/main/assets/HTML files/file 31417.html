<p>You must pass objects as method arguments. What functionality are you trying to accomplish by passing arbitrary non-defined names? You could always pass them as a string and then use the string to use the text inside the method.</p>

<p>ex. </p>

<pre><code>def self.methodname(arg1, arg2)
  arg1 = arg2
end

Class.methodname("greeting","hello")
</code></pre>

<p>would set the variable greeting equal to <code>'hello'</code></p>
