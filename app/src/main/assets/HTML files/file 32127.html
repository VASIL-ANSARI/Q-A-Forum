<p>I found that on the html page you can do:</p>

<p>$row_exp=mysql_fetch_array($resource);</p>

<p>print_r($row_exp);</p>

<p>by funky tables I just meant the little things broken into aligned boxes with dashed borders</p>

<p>phpmyAdmin does this BUT the html page solution above, using print_r does not, so only good for basic use. I'm sure someone knows the full code to show it in tabular layout on a web page...</p>
