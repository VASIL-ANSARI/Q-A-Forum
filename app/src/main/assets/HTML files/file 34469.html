<p>id attribute is meant to be unique. Try giving a common class to all forms instead of an id and then on submit serialize all these forms using the common class.</p>

<p>If you run <code>$('form').serialize()</code> on a page with multiple forms, it will correctly serialize all the forms into one string.</p>

<p>To include forms with some perticular class, use <code>$('.myforms').serialize();</code></p>
