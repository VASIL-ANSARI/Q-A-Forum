<p>Using an enum avoids using an <code>int</code>, not <code>final</code>.  Using a dedicated enum provides type safety, so you can have clearer method signatures and avoid bugs.  <code>final</code> is used to prevent changing a value once set, and is a generally good practice regardless of the variable's type.</p>

<p>In this case however I'm not sure what value an enum gives you.  <code>NUM_NANOSECONDS_IN_MILLISECOND</code> doesn't seem like it should be a dedicated type, and as @BoristheSpider suggests, you shouldn't need this field at all. Perhaps your associate was suggesting using an enum for the unit (e.g. <code>NANOSECOND</code>, <code>MILLISECOND</code>, etc) rather than storing ratios like this.  In that case, the existing <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html" rel="nofollow"><code>TimeUnit</code></a> enum is definitely your friend.</p>
