  <p>maybe the NPAPI plugin is interpreting it maybe as a float instead of an int or vice versa</p>

<p>In the NPAPI you can get numbers passed to the plugin as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/NPVariant" rel="nofollow"><code>int32_t</code> or <code>double</code></a> - it's completely unspecified which type you get.</p>

<p>Interpreting the argument as <code>0</code> is a typical symptom of not converting the number type when needed, so this is in all likelyhood an issue with the wrapping plugin.<br>
They should convert to the required number type <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14662724/168225">depending on the variants <code>type</code></a>.</p>
