<p>I'm afraid this isn't a comprehensive answer because I don't fully understand the reasons why, but when I ran into the same issue this workaround allowed me to just get on with things and stop scratching my head:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go into Web.config and comment out the line containing the <code>DatabaseInitializerForType</code> key (shortcut: place your cursor on the line then ctrl-K and ctrl-C).</li>
<li>Build the project (ctrl-shift-B)</li>
<li>Add your controller scaffolding as normal.</li>
<li>Uncomment the initializer key in Web.config (ctrl-K, ctrl-U).</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, it's a bit of a random-stab-in-the-dark approach, but I'll leave it here in case it helps anyone else googling the same issue!</p>
