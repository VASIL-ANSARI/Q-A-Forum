<p>The problem has been solved by some tryings.</p>

<p>Since I installed under my /.~local path, it should be noticed that [include],[bin] and [lib] should all point to the local version by modifying the bashrc.</p>

<p>I just change the lib path while the other 2 paths remained unchanged, which point to the cluster's opencv version 2.4.9.(Mine is 2.4.11)</p>
