  <p>What if I change a property of o4This? Will the property of o4All also
  be changed indirectly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>, it will be changed. Because now, both <code>o4All</code> and <code>o4This</code> are referring to the same instance. You did this by the following assignment: -</p>

<pre><code>Test.o4All = this.o4This;
</code></pre>

<p>In the above assignment, you are not creating a copy of the instance referred to by <code>o4This</code>, rather, you are just copying the value of <code>o4This</code> in the <code>o4All</code> reference. Now, since <code>o4This</code> value is a reference to some <code>instance</code>. So, <code>o4All</code> now have reference to the same instance as that of <code>o4This</code>. And hence, any change you make to the <code>instance</code> using a reference, will be reflected in the other reference too.</p>
