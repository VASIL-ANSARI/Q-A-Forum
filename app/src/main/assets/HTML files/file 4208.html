<p>The old problem. Here's the solution:
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/example-maximum-column-group-row.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/example-maximum-column-group-row.html</a></p>

<p>In your case:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT q.id, qa.id as answerid, title, qa.message 
FROM questions q
JOIN questions_answers qa ON q.id = qa.idquestion
LEFT JOIN questions_answers qa2 ON qa.idquestion = qa2.idquestion AND qa.date &lt; qa2.date
WHERE qa2.idquestion IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>(The idea is to split the problem in two operations: One join from questions to answers and then use the methods from the MySQL article.)</p>
