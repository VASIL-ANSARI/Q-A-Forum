<p>You need to provide a path relative to your package, thus it should work if done like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>var dest = App.GetResourceStream(new Uri(@"StartUpViewModels/" + destination, UriKind.Relative));
</code></pre>

<p>Remember also to check if your resource file added to package has <em>Build Action</em> set to <em>Content</em>, otherwise if it's set to <em>None</em>, your file won't be added.</p>
