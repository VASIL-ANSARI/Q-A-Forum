<blockquote>
  <p>Unchecked exceptions are exceptions
  that do not need to be declared in a
  throws clause. They extend
  RuntimeException. An unchecked
  exception indicates an unexpected
  problem that is probably due to a bug
  in the code.</p>

<p>Since <code>DataAccessException</code> is a <code>RuntimeException</code>, you might want to check what is the real cause of the exception and fix it instead of catching it and retry the operation.</p>
