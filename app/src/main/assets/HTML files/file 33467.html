<p>This is normal behaviour.</p>

<p><code>$_GET</code> is populated with data from the URL's query string (which is taken from the request's headers).</p>

<p><code>$_POST</code> is populated with data from the request's body.</p>

<p>If you want to read data from the URL's query string, use <code>$_GET</code>.</p>
