<p>Depends on your needs but perhaps it is sufficient to alter the launchmode of your activity in manifest:</p>

<pre><code>android:launchMode="singleTask"
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, "singleTask" and "singleInstance" activities can only begin a task. They are always at the root of the activity stack. Moreover, the device can hold only one instance of the activity at a time â only one such task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would prevent onCreate being called before onDestroy. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Another possible solution would be to manually check if there are other processes running your application in e.g. onCreate:</p>

<pre><code>    ActivityManager activityManager = (ActivityManager) this
            .getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);
    List&lt;RunningAppProcessInfo&gt; procInfos = activityManager
            .getRunningAppProcesses();
    int counter = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; procInfos.size(); i++) {
        if (procInfos.get(i).processName.equals(this.getPackageName())) {
            counter++;
        }
        if (counter &gt; 1) {
            // send broadcast to make other activities call finish() or the like
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Hesitated with posting this answer as it feels abit hackish but since no other proposals have been posted until now you might as well give it a try.</p>

<p>I used it for a different scenario where the phone would sometimes start my app twice after boot. With this code I could prevent the second start to complete by simply calling finish.</p>
