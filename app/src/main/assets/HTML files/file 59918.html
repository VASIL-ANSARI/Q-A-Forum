<p>Well, according to <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource" rel="nofollow">AngularJS docs for $resouce</a>, $resource is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A factory which creates a resource object that lets you interact with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" rel="nofollow">RESTful</a> server-side data sources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words is a shortcut for RESTful services operations. The code bellow creates an interface with an API endpoint to make REST operations more easy to do.
Once you have this:</p>

<pre><code>var User = $resource('/user/:userId', {userId:'@id'});
</code></pre>

<p>Is much easier to do this:</p>

<pre><code>User.get({userId:123}, function(user) {
  user.abc = true;
  user.$save();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Because RESTful is a standard, and <code>$resource</code> is the Angular's implementation of the consumption of API's in this standard. On his internals, is made an assynchronous request with the propper headers and method according to the operation you conigured and choosed.</p>
