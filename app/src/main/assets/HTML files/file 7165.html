<p>You don't show what self/self.model is in there. Normally it'd be a class name. </p>

<p>So if you have a model User</p>

<pre><code>field = 'id'
field_val = 3
qry = Session.query(User).filter(getattr(User, field) == field_val)
</code></pre>

<p>should work out fine. </p>

<p>You're not using getattr from an instance (self), but from the class itself. </p>
