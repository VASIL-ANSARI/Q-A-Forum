<p>You have to get a reference to your EditText</p>

<p>Something like this should work:</p>

<pre><code>EditText et = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText1);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can get the text from your EditText like this: </p>

<pre><code>String str = et.getText().toString();
</code></pre>

<p>then you can call your validate method</p>

<pre><code>if(checkEmail(str)){
  //email is valid
}
</code></pre>

<p>However based on the question you are asking and the manner in which you've asked it I can tell that you would probably benefit greatly from going back and studying plain java before you dive into android. And that once you've got java syntax down, you should really start with the examples and tutorials on the official Android Developer website, it covers a lot of the basics that you seem to be having trouble understanding.</p>

<p>And one last aside, "editText1" is not a very good name for your EditText, it doesn't explain anything about the object. Your code will be easier to work with if you strive to use more descriptive names for objects, perhaps "emailText" might be a better choice?</p>
