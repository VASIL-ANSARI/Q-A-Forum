<p>It's not clear whether you're trying to end up with a <code>date</code> object or a <code>datetime</code> object, as Python doesn't have the concept of a "timezone aware date".</p>

<p>To get a <code>date</code> object corresponding to the current time in the current time zone, you'd use:</p>

<pre><code>from django.utils.timezone import localtime, now

localtime(now()).date()
</code></pre>

<p>That is: you're getting the current timezone-aware <code>datetime</code> in UTC; you're converting it to the local time zone (i.e. <code>TIME_ZONE</code>); and then taking the date from that.</p>

<p>If you want to get a <code>datetime</code> object corresponding to 00:00:00 on the current date in the current time zone, you'd use:</p>

<pre><code>localtime(now()).replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
</code></pre>

<p>Based on this and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27308951/how-can-i-remove-the-timezone-offset-from-datetime-in-python">your other question</a>, I think you're getting confused by the Delorean package. I suggest sticking with Django's and Python's datetime functionality.</p>
