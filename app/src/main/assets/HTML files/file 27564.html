<p>The answer is that you will need to store and maintain a count field. You can use Cloud Code to keep the number updated.</p>

<p>Read the help documentation on <a href="https://parse.com/docs/cloud_code_guide#functions-aftersave" rel="nofollow">Cloud Code - Performing Actions After a Save</a>, as it covers maintaining a count like you would need to.</p>

<p>Once you have that in place you will have a field you can sort on.</p>
