<p>I don't think you'll get exactly what you're wanting here, you can't create new columns for each patient the way you're thinking of.</p>

<p>You can however get a row for every condition that each patient has and include their name and id for each row. Then use your prepossessing language to detect when the ID is the same and list all conditions under that name in the format you're looking for. To do that you need a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>. Here's a great link to visualize what these can do for you:</p>

<p>With what you're looking to do the statement will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.ID
       , CONCAT(p.FirstName, " ", p.LastName) AS PatientName 
       , t.TreatmentName
FROM   patients p
       LEFT JOIN treatment_type t ON p.ID = t.PatientID;
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/913599/1" rel="nofollow">Here's an sqlfiddle to show that</a>. The tables are named exactly like yours so you'll need to adjust them to fit your database. If you're just making this database you should really think about developing some kind of consistent naming convention, yours seem a bit scattered at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: As per carlosh12's comment on OP, you CAN do this kind of thing with a pivot table, but I'm not sure it's what you'd need for this situation. It's much faster and easier to just do it outside SQL as detailed here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong> Sorry, forgot to link to my SQLfiddle. It's there now. <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/913599/3" rel="nofollow">Here is an edit</a> where I included an ORDER BY statement to answer your comment.</p>
