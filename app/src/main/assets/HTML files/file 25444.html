<p><strong>Automapper</strong> uses reflection extensively, and there is no reason not to use it to set private setters. </p>

<p>Actually, until your question I didn't know that it works.</p>

<p>If we look at unit tests we can found the fact that private setters are set automatically. Please see <a href="https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/blob/develop/src/UnitTests/Bug/AutoMapperInheritanceProblemDemo.cs" rel="nofollow"><code>PrivateSetterInParentWorks</code></a>.</p>

<p>Note, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7277108/access-to-private-method-using-reflection-in-c-silverlight-applications">Silverlight doesn't support setting private fields through reflection</a>. So, the feature doesn't work with it.</p>
