<p>I assume you have some sort of "_id" value associated with each set of values, so you know which document in your collection to update? Let's call that "product_id". You can update individual documents like:</p>

<pre><code>for product, product_id in data:
    hdd.update({'_id': product_id},
               {'$set': {'Speed': products['Speed'],
                         'capacity': products['capacity'],
                         'format': products['format']}})
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument to update is a query that specifies which document to match, the second is a set of <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/" rel="nofollow">update operations</a>.</p>

<p>If you're on MongoDB 2.6 or later and the latest PyMongo, use a bulk update:</p>

<pre><code>bulk = hdd.initialize_ordered_bulk_op()
for product, product_id in data:
    hdd.find({'_id': product_id}).update({'$set': {'Speed': products['Speed'],
                                                   'capacity': products['capacity'],
                                                   'format': products['format']}})
bulk.execute()
</code></pre>

<p>The operations are buffered on the client, then they're all sent to the server and executed at once when you call "execute()". <a href="http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/examples/bulk.html" rel="nofollow">Bulk update operations</a> with PyMongo and MongoDB 2.6+ require fewer round trips to the server than traditional updates.</p>
