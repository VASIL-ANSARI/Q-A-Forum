<p>Have a look <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/qa/qa2004/qa1158.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In short, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>glFinish() has the same effect as glFlush(), with the addition that glFinish() will block until all commands submitted have been executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another <a href="http://anomtech.uuuq.com/glFlushFinish.php" rel="nofollow">article </a> describes other differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Swap functions (used in double-buffered applications) automatically flush the commands, so no need to call <code>glFlush</code></li>
<li><code>glFinish</code> forces OpenGL to perform outstanding commands, which is a bad idea (e.g. with VSync)</li>
</ul>

<p>To sum up, this means that you don't even need these functions when using double buffering, except if your swap-buffers implementation doesn't automatically flush the commands.</p>
