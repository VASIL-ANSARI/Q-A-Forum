<p>It's a real target.  </p>

<p>Phony targets are not detected automatically by the make system - they must be identified by you, using the <code>.PHONY</code> target.</p>

<p>Sensible phony targets include <code>all</code> and <code>clean</code> - these don't correspond to real files, but to <em>actions</em> you want the makefile to do.  Here's how to explain this to make:</p>

<pre><code>.PHONY: all clean install test
</code></pre>

<p>Directories are legitimate targets of makefile rules.  You should not make these phony.</p>

<pre><code>mydir:
     mkdir mydir
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The .PHONY target is of course, phony.</p>
