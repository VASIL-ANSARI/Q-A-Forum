<p>Since SQL Server 2005 you can apply windowing functions like <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code> to a set (or a subset, often called a partition but not to be confused with table partitioning). I believe what you are looking for is the following:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  StatusId, Status, DisplayColor, IsOpen, DivisionId, 
  SortOrder = ROW_NUMBER() OVER 
    (PARTITION BY DivisionId ORDER BY IsOpen DESC, StatusId)
FROM dbo.TV_Statuses AS s
ORDER BY DivisionId, IsOpen DESC;
</code></pre>
