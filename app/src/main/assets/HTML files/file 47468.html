<p>The recommendation it usually to bundle the jar with the IS package that uses it so it is easier for doing deployment as a self-contained unit that migrates together with its dependencies.</p>

<p>So, putting it in <code>packages/(package name)/code/jars</code> should suffice to have it available for calling from within the Java services of that IS package.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to make the jar available to all Java services across the IS, <code>packages/(package name)/code/jars/static</code> is a good place to put it.</p>

<p>See here an interesting wiki page describing the <a href="http://techcommunity.softwareag.com/pwiki/-/wiki/Main/webMethods+Integration+Server+Class-Loading" rel="nofollow">webMethods Integration Server Class-Loading</a> mechanism and the several places in the order they are searched for jars, classes, and libs.</p>
