<p>I think you were missing the quotes only when entering the the question here, right? </p>

<p><code>gulp.dest()</code> expects a folder to copy all the files in the stream, so you cannot use a single file name here (As the error says: "mkdir failed"). See: <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#gulpdestpath-options" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#gulpdestpath-options</a></p>

<p>When you do your <code>gulp.src()</code> you can set a base path to build the relative path from and so gulp can copy your single file to the given output folder. See: <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#optionsbase" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#optionsbase</a></p>

<p>As you also want to rename the file, you need something like gulp-rename: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename</a></p>
