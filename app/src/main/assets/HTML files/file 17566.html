<p>There are a couple ways you could do this: if you want to use javascript exclusively, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Store the associated values in a javascript object</p>

<p><code>var capitals = {AL:"Montgomery",AK:"uhhh..alaska's capital",...};</code></p>

<p>and then your function might look like this:</p>

<p><code>function GetCapitalFor(abbr){
    alert(capitals[abbr]);
}</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use a third party library</p>

<p>I don't know of one in particular, but I'm sure one exists.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you are also working with a server, you could store the pairs in a database and then run the function on the server (probably using AJAX). Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type:"POST",
    data: {abbreviation: abbr}, //where abbr is the user's input (MAKE SURE TO SANITIZE)
    success: function(result)
    { alert(result);}
});
</code></pre>

<p>and on the server side, you'll query a database table for the abbreviation.</p>

<p>For something as trivial as this though, I'd probably just go with option 1.</p>
