<p>(If I understand your question correctly) Using <code>matplotlib</code> you can do</p>

<pre><code> import matplotlib as p

 # and after your loop has completed

 p.pyplot.plot(range(0, N1), ui, 'o-')
 p.pyplot.show()
</code></pre>

<p>to get a simple plot of your data <code>u</code> against <code>range(0, N1)</code>. </p>

<p>I don't know what you expect <code>ui</code> to be <code>ui[:]= u</code> is an odd thing to be doing - it sets a copy of <code>ui</code>  to <code>u</code> but you don't retain the copy of <code>ui</code> that <code>ui[:]</code> is producing. </p>

<p><em>Hint: think about <code>ui[:]</code> as being the same as <code>list(ui)</code></em></p>
