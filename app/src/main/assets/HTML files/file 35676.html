<p>Short answer is no - Java is single inheritance, so a class can not extend multiple classes. This is generally an indication that you should rethink your design. Without knowing specifics, it's hard to tell, but if Subclass1 and Subclass2 are similar, is there an abstract class you could create that extends JPanel, and then Subclass1 and Subclass2 could each extend that abstract class?</p>
