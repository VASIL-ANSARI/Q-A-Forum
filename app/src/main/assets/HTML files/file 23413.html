<p>There's really like 7 questions in there. But I understand the main question to be updating or sending data to a <code>FragmentActivity</code> associated with a <code>ViewPager</code> from some other class. I don't know this other classes relationship to the <code>FragmentActivity</code> or <code>ViewPager</code> but there are 2 ways I know of that could handle updating or transfering information the way you want</p>

<p>(1) an <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html" rel="nofollow">interface</a></p>

<p>If the class you're referring to is another <code>Fragment</code> and loaded in the same <code>ViewPager</code> the way you would update the data (or call a method) in another <code>Fragment</code> or <code>FragmentActivity</code> is with an interface. You can scroll to the bottom of that link for some sample code but basicly you create a bridge between the <code>Fragment</code> and the activity that contains the <code>ViewPager</code> (i.e. the fragment's host activity). You then create a "listener" that looks for some change in the <code>Fragment</code>, upon which it passes some information to the hoast activity. The host activity then calls a public method within the second <code>Fragment</code> you need to update. Only tricky part here is to remember to initialize your interface "listener"within your <code>Fragment</code>'s <code>onAttach</code> method or it won't work. </p>

<p>(2) an intent</p>

<p>If  you're dealing with two seperate activities just use an <code>Intent</code>. Pass an intent to the <code>FragmentActivity</code> you're looking for and override <code>onNewIntent(Intent i)</code> to perform whatever function you want within the recieving class. </p>

<p>Hope that helps - I'd need more specificy to answer futher because there's a lot of sub-questions in there. </p>
