<p>Sounds like you managed to get two installations of Apache, which is wrong.</p>

<p>The right approach would've been to just run <code>yum install php</code>, which automatically configures Apache to handle PHP files.</p>

<p>To fix this, just remove your 'new' installation of Apache (not the old one), then install PHP via <code>yum</code>.</p>
