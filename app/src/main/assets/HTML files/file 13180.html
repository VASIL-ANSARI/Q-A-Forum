<p>Maybe my answer is a little bit off topic, as it's not using core-plot, but did you look at the "AccelerometerGraph" sample app provided with Xcode?
It provides a nice plot which is dynamically updated while new accelerometer events are registered. The great of this sample is the way CoreAnimation has been used to "speed-up" Quartz2D. And you get all of this using system framework only and no third party code (apart your adaptation of Apple's one).</p>
