<p>A common issue that I have seen in my limited experience is that a hard-to-detect bug might originate in the fragment layout xml file.  If there are, for example, any "circular references" (easy to do with a RelativeLayout) your app might run but will crash when you open the fragment that uses that xml. This kind of crash isn't really specified in the Logcat, it would point you to a line of code in your fragment that doesn't actually have a problem.  The reason that line of code created a logcat error might be from a mistake in your layout xml file.</p>
