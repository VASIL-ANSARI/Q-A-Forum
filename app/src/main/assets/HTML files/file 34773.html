<p>You don't have a compiler or you haven't configured CodeBlocks with a compiler.To fix it:<br>
Download and Install a C/C++  compiler for your OS and configure CodeBlocks to use it. Or if you are using Windows you can also download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/13.12/Windows/codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup.exe" rel="nofollow">this</a> CodeBlocks setup which already includes MinGW compiler.</p>
