<p>I did a search and found an answer in a comment here on SO</p>

<p>When you use model events (<code>public static function boot()</code>), PHPUnit does not register the events and they go ignored.  Now it remains to be answered as to whether this is PHPUnit's fault or Laravel's fault, but hopefully it is something that will be addressed in future releases.</p>

<p>To overcome the issue, you need to manually call the <code>boot()</code> method in your unit test, and you can do it in the <code>setUp()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public function setUp(){
    parent::setUp();
    Artisan::call('migrate');
    $this-&gt;seed();
    $this-&gt;model=new User;
    User::boot();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps anyone using Laravel and working on unit testing.</p>
