<p>format the date in the SQL to month, i.e. <code>'Ym'</code> and make an aggregate over this.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
sum(field1) as sfield1, sum(field2) as sfield2, date_format(date, '%Y%m') as dateaggregate 
FROM AdWords_Reporting WHERE CampaignID IN('CAMP008', 'CAMP011', 'CAMP044') 
AND AveragePosition != '0' AND YEAR(date) = YEAR(NOW()) AND MONTH(date) = MONTH(NOW()) 
Group by dateaggregate 
ORDER BY Date ASC"
</code></pre>

<p>(this is not tested SQL, just a hint!)</p>

<p>Result: aggregated values per month. This can be easily altered to any time frame like year, month, week, quarter etc.</p>

<p>Besides: "date" is a reserved word in SQL and naming column like this is not a good idea.</p>
