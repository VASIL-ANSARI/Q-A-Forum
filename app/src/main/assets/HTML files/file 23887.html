<p>You are trying to get the length of <code>ee</code> before you have added the radio buttons (which is why the length is 0).</p>

<p>Calling the alert after you have added the radio buttons gives the correct length:</p>

<pre><code>addradiobutton(arr);
alert(ee.length);
console.log(ee.length);
</code></pre>
