<p>You are passing the values wrong. This is effectively what you are doing:</p>

<p><code>_gaq.push(["a,b,c"]);</code></p>

<p>That is an array with a single element.</p>

<p>This is what it should look like:</p>

<p><code>_gaq.push(["a","b","c"]);</code></p>

<p>This is an array with multiple elements.</p>

<p>So basically you need to do </p>

<pre><code>params = [t1,t2,t3];
_gaq.push(params);
</code></pre>

<p>or just put them directly in:</p>

<pre><code>_gaq.push([t1,t2,t3]);
</code></pre>
