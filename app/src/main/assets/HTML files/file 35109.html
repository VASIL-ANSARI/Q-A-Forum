<p>There is <em>no way</em> for your app to schedule <em>itself</em> to run if its closed (i.e. terminated)</p>

<p>If its in the background it still cannot schedule itself to run <em>on a fixed interval</em>, but it can run at in response to certain external events and at the discretion of the OS.</p>

<p>You could post multiple local notifications before the app closes and then <em>if</em> the user clicks on one then your app would run. But posting a notification to the user every 5 minutes would be an absolutely appallingly bad thing to do and would probably result in the app being rejected from the app store.</p>

<p>There are certain options such as local notifications and push notifications and background fetch if you have a <em>low</em> frequency, which is not regular but irregular. But 5 minutes is short a time period so its totally out of the question to have any solution at all.</p>

<p>In summary there is:
a) Absolutely no way of scheduling something in the background in a <em>regular</em> manner (all the alternative are irregular: local push depends on user input, remote push depends on delivery time of the notification; background fetch depends upon when the OS decides it will execute your app, etc. etc. 
b) Scheduling something irregularly on a <em>frequent</em> basis is simply not possible</p>
