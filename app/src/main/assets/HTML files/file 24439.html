<p>You need to instantiate a Parent object. However, this doesn't mean you actually have to load a Parent record from the database. If you can use session.Load to instantiate the Parent object then, provided you have lazy loading enabled for your entities, this does nothing more than create a proxy object which holds the Id.</p>

<pre><code>var c = new Child() {
  name = "Foo",
  parent = session.Load&lt;Parent&gt;(parentId)
};

session.Save(c);
</code></pre>
