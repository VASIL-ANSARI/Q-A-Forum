<p>I dont think, as per your scenario, it is possible to create the objects of these types. The reason being you have embedded the call to the stored procedure and creation of the object in the same method and intermingled them.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to remove the call to the stored procedure from that method to another method, execute that stored proc to a datatable and pass that datatable to this method. In this way you will have your <code>TypeCode</code> with you in advance and then you can use factory pattern to create objects of required type.</p>

<p>Also in this way you can also reduce your dependency on reflection and hence your code might be a little better performance wise.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
