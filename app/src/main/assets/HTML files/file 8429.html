<p>Since you are not pushing this view controller onto a UINavigationController, setting newForm.navigationItem.title won't do the trick.</p>

<p>It looks like you are pushing a modal view controller that contains it's own navigation bar.  In that case, you'll probably need to create your own reference to it and tie the bar in the xib to it.</p>

<p>In IFDNewFormViewController.h create an instance variable</p>

<pre><code>    UINavigationBar *customNavBar;
</code></pre>

<p>and an outlet property</p>

<pre><code>    @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet *UINavigationBar customNavBar;
</code></pre>

<p>In IFDNewFormViewController.m:</p>

<pre><code>    @synthesize customNavBar;
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to release it in dealloc and set to nil in viewDidUnload.</p>

<p>When editing the xib, right click on your navigation bar then click and drag the open circle next to "New Referencing Outlet" up to the file's owner and select customNavBar.  That way the property will contain the bar from your xib after it is loaded.</p>

<p>When you init your IFDNewFormViewController, be sure to use the following:</p>

<pre><code>    IFDNewFormViewController *newForm = [[IFDNewFormViewController] alloc] initWithNibName:@"whatever-the-file-name-is" bundle:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>Or the data in the xib won't even be used.</p>
