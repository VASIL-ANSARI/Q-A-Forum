<p>You need to iterate through object's members manually, as GetString() only works on string members, while document["a"] is an Object. You need to iterate through that object's members using MemberIterator variable. I had no practice in C* for more than 15 years, so I can only give a general idea of how it should work:</p>

<pre><code>for (MemberIterator m = document["a"].MemberBegin(); m != document["a"].MemberEnd(); ++m) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; m.name &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; (m.IsNumber()?m.GetNumber():m.GetString()) &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you might want to look at Accept() method, it seems to return a JSON string of an object you give it.</p>
