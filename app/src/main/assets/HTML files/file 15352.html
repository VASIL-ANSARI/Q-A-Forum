<p>It has something to do with the fact that when you just use window.open("name"), it doesn't have the params to set up the address bar and menu bars and all that. So it opens in a new window <em>without</em> those things. It wouldnt be able to do that in a new tab, since obviously it would need the same UI settings as the current window.</p>

<p>Basically, the "desired" behavior from google would be to open in a new tab. But if it doesn't have enough info to do that, it does the next best thing and opens a new window.</p>
