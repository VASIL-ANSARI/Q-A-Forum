<p>After playing with this in Firebug, if you add a z-index attribute greater than 1004 to your default div, id of "SERVICE03_DLG", then it will work. I'd give it something extremely high, like 5000, just to be sure.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what it is in the themeroller CSS that causes this. They've probably changed or neglected the position attribute of the target div that it turns into a dialog.</p>
