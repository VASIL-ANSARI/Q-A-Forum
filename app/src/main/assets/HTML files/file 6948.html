<p>Per the HIG you might want to consider using an action sheet for this (see Alerts, Action Sheets, and Modal Views in the HIG) and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIActionSheet_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIActionSheet_Class/Reference/Reference.html</a></p>

<p>and, to answer the 'does this make sense' question:  it does make sense to have UIAlertViews come from views, but depending on your app, you might want to use inheritance to manage the code organization for when/where the alertview is presented. YMMV.</p>
