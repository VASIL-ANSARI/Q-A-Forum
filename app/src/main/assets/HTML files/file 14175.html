<p>I would register your application with ITC to make sure the name is not in use first, but all app URL's follow this format:</p>

<pre><code>itms://itunes.com/apps/appname
</code></pre>

<p>You call it with a handy-dandy openURL command like:</p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"itms://itunes.com/apps/appname"]];
</code></pre>

<p>Replace "appname" with the specific name of your app in ITC (not the bundle identifier or any other means of identification).</p>
