<p>Your custom <code>socialIntegration</code> class has a bug in it. It only returns a <code>SLComposeViewController</code> if Facebook is available on the device. If it isn't, it returns nothing.</p>

<p>However, you don't test for this when you actually call it:</p>

<pre><code>SLComposeViewController * faceSheet=[self.socialIntegration showFacebook:@"text" andImage:nil andLink:@"link" andView:self];
        dispatch_sync(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            //[self netConnectionTrue:cell Connected:answer];
            //[tempAlertView show];
            [self presentViewController:faceSheet animated:YES completion:NO];

        });
</code></pre>

<p>...you're not checking to see if <code>faceSheet</code> is nil. So if there's no Facebook account you call <code>presentViewController</code> with a nil object, which triggers the error you're seeing.</p>

<p>The reason you are seeing this on iOS 7 is your linked FB accounts probably got reset, but it was probably a source of crashes for your users on iOS 6 as well.</p>
