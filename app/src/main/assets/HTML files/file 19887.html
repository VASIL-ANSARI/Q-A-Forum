<p>No, I really dont think so. Clearing it through settings is the only possible way.</p>

<p>The <code>centralManager</code> delegate has callbacks for both failed and successfully connected peripheral, so I would listen to them to check if user cancelled or not: <code>didConnectPeripheral</code> and <code>didFailToConnectPeripheral</code></p>
