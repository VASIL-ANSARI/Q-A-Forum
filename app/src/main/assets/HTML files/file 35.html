<p>If I'm reading this properly, you're starting work items on bunch of threads but you're concerned that the threads are completing out of order, and, would prefer to wait until each thread completes in the order they were started ? </p>

<p>If this is the case then I'm not sure why you're creating a thread per work item. Maybe you could expand?</p>

<p>If you did need to wait for a thread to complete the you could just do:</p>

<pre><code>t.Join();
</code></pre>
