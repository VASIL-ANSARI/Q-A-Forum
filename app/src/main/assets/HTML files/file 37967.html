<p>Renaming table is not enough, you need to rename <code>app/models/foo.rb</code> to <code>app/models/bar.rb</code> and also change the class name inside this file from <code>class Foo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base</code> to <code>class Bar &lt; ActiveRecordBase</code>. Also scan for any usage of constant <code>Foo</code>.</p>
