<p>This is automatically handled by iOS. When a notification is sent to an app, it will display the banner notification as you are looking for. In app delegate you can register notifications and handle.</p>

<pre><code>UILocalNotification *notification = [[UILocalNotification alloc] init];
NSDate *fireDate = [[NSDate alloc] initWithTimeInterval:5 sinceDate:[NSDate date]];
[notification setFireDate:fireDate];
[notification setSoundName:UILocalNotificationDefaultSoundName];

NSTimeZone *timeZone = [NSTimeZone localTimeZone];
[notification setTimeZone:timeZone];
[notification setAlertBody:@"You have a new notification!"];

[[UIApplication sharedApplication] scheduleLocalNotification:notification];
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new notification and fire it after 5 seconds. If the application is in the foreground, nothing will happen (unless handled in the app delegate). But if you background the application (such as shutting off the screen), you will receive a banner notification and hear the default notification sound.</p>
