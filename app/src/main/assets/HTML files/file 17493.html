<p>The "hello" hasn't been flushed to disk yet (it's still sitting in your computer's memory) so the <code>.read()</code> is probably reading what used to be on the disk block just allocated to the file, or the memory buffer allocated for the file. The behavior is weird but it's easily avoided by flushing the file.</p>

<pre><code>f.flush()
</code></pre>

<p>You'll also want to tell the file to go back to the beginning so you can read the "hello" out of it. (Otherwise, you're already at the end of the file when you start reading.)</p>

<pre><code>f.seek(0)
</code></pre>
