<blockquote>
  <p>The Core Bluetooth framework provides the classes needed for your iOS
  and Mac apps to communicate with devices that are equipped with
  Bluetooth low energy wireless technology. For example, your app can
  discover, explore, and interact with low energy peripheral devices,
  such as heart rate monitors and digital thermostats.</p>
