<p>I would think a much easier path would be to create a model for the Zencart customer object using the in-built ORM module in Kohana. Although all this depends on what your current Kohana script does. Can you post the code for your Kohana script, or at least provide an overview of it's functionality?</p>

<p>Porting a Zencart module to Kohana would be a better option because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kohana is a much better framework than the mess that is Zencart.</li>
<li>You can release that ported code to the community to allow other developers to take advantage of it (and improve your code).</li>
</ol>
