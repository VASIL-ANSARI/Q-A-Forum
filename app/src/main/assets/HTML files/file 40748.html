<p>If you want to include NULL values you should use LEFT or RIGHT join like this:</p>

<pre><code>... from table1 as B RIGHT JOIN table2 as C ON (B.col5 = C.col02)
</code></pre>

<p><br>
If RIGHT join isn't supported on some platforms (thanks to @user3608814, see comments) use LEFT join and change order of tables:</p>

<pre><code>... from table2 as C LEFT JOIN table1 as B ON (C.col02 = B.col5)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br>If this doesn't help (when as you have written there is no data in <code>table2</code> but you still need results) you should <strong>reorganize</strong> your data scheme:<br>
Add explicit foreign key to <code>table2</code> that links it to <code>table1</code>. Let it be <code>table2.extID</code> column. Then it's possible to query like this:</p>

<pre><code>... from table1 as B LEFT JOIN table2 as C ON (B._ID = C.extID)
</code></pre>
