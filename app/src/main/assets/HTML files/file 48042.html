<p>You can write your own extension to the ImagesPipeline so I would suggest to do this and implement the solution as you wish.</p>

<p>You can start with counting the exported images and create a new sub-folder to download to after each 1000 (or as you set up) and then zip it or for example after creating a new folder spawn a new process which creates an archive of the older folder's contents.</p>

<p>You can read more about extending the pipelines in the <a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#module-scrapy.pipelines.files" rel="nofollow">docs</a>.</p>
