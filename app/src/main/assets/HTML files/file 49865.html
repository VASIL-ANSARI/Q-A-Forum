<p>I've run in to this issue a few time when I've added seeders either in a new project or to an existing project where I want to add some data to test.</p>

<p>Both jedrzej.kurylo and Alex were on the right track, <code>composer dump-autoload</code> which will regenerate your autoload files and include the seeder(s) you've just added.</p>
