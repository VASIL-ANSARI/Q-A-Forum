<p>looks like you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>movies = tmdb.Movies(title,limit=True)
#if you want to deal with Movie objects
for movieresult in movies:
    #do something with the Movie result (here I'm just printing it)
    print movieresult

#if you want to deal with raw result (not wrapped with a Movie object)
for result in movies.iter_results():
    #do something with the raw result
    print result
</code></pre>

<p><code>tmdb.Movies(title, limit=True)</code> creates a <code>Movies</code> object. Since the <code>__iter__</code> method is defined you can use <code>for movie in moviesobject</code> to go through the results in the <code>Movies</code> object. You could also get a list of <code>Movie</code> objects by using <code>movielist = list(movies)</code>. </p>
