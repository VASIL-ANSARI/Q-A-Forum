<p>I think that design isn't quite correct. The first URL path is correct. But to add a dog to a specific treat, the URL should be</p>

<pre><code>/dogs = GET retrieves all dogs, POST create a new dog
/dogs/{dogId} = GET retrieves one specific dog, POST updates the entity, DELETE deletes the entity
/dogs/{dogId}/treats = GET retrieves all treats, POST to add a new treat
/dogs/{dogId}/treats/{threatId} = POST/DELETE updates/deletes an entity
</code></pre>
