<p>With prepared statement you can use only limited subset of queries. Create user not included.</p>

<p>You can try INSERT into <code>mysql.user</code> table, something like </p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO `mysql`.`user` (Host,User,Password)VALUES(?,?,password(?));
</code></pre>

<p>Besides, with users created dynamically you are doing something wrong</p>
