<p>You can't treat a socket as a serial line. A socket can only send and receive data (data stream for TCP, packets for UDP). If you would need a facility to control the serial line on the SOC you would need to build an appropriate control protocol over the socket, i.e. either use another socket for control like FTP does or use in-band control and distinguish between controlling and data like HTTP does. And of course both sides of the connection have to understand this protocol.</p>
