<p>This is a problem I ran into as well.  I have Windows Server 2012 64 bit and python 32 bit.  What I ended up doing is letting pip solve everything.
I have pip 1.6.dev1.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>pip install --upgrade paramiko</p>

<p>*if you get this error during upgrade: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'rollback', do:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>pip uninstall pycrypto and enter (y)</p></li>
<li><p>pip install pycrypto</p></li>
<li><p>pip install ecdsa</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, just try to run that first command, and follow the tracebacks to resolve whatever dependency is missing.  This worked for me.</p>

<p>I saved my session in txt if you need it for reference.</p>
