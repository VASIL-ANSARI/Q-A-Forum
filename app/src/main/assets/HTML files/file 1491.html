<p>If you want to access an instance variable in your mailer template then in your mailer model add</p>

<pre><code>@body[:user] = user_object
</code></pre>

<p>The above would create an instance variable @user that can be accessed in your view. You should be able to access user object in your mailer view by doing</p>

<pre><code>@user
</code></pre>

<p>The docs <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html">here</a> have examples of alternative ways if you are using multiple formats (text/html).</p>
