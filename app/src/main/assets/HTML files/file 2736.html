<p>This is a bit of a longshot (particularly if you're seeing the problem in your development environment where there shouldn't be a lot of competition for these threads), but you may be running out of thread pool threads and/or getting deadlocked waiting for them to become available.</p>

<p>You can check by inserting something like the following in your page, perhaps right after queuing the delegate:</p>

<pre><code>int workerThreads;
int maxWorkerThreads;
int completionPortThreads;
int maxCompletionPortThreads;

ThreadPool.GetAvailableThreads(out workerThreads, out completionPortThreads);
ThreadPool.GetMaxThreads(out maxWorkerThreads, out maxCompletionPortThreads);

System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(string.Format("There are {0} of {1} worker threads available.\r\n", workerThreads, maxWorkerThreads));
</code></pre>

<p>Are you using the <code>ThreadPool</code> elsewhere in the page?</p>
