<p>The java API does offer the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html"><code>java.util.Scanner</code></a>class which will allow you to scan across an input file. </p>

<p>Depending on how you intend to use this, however, this might not be the best idea. Is the file very large? Are you searching only one file or are you trying to keep a database of many files and search for files within that? In that case, you might want to use a more fleshed out engine such as <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html">lucene</a>.</p>
