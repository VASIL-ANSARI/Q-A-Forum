<p>In first look at thi segment of your code:</p>

<pre><code>if (lastPosition.Y &lt; destinationPosition.Y)
{
    north = true;
    south = false;
    east = false;
    west = false;
}

if (destinationRectangle.Y &gt; lastPosition.Y)
{
    north = false;
    south = true;
    east = false;
    west = false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The (lastPosition.Y &lt; destinationPosition.Y) and the (destinationRectangle.Y > lastPosition.Y)
is same conditions, so your will have south = true in both situations.</p>

<p>Second, why are you using four boolean variables? Instead use one variable with four possible states. Enums is good for this:</p>

<pre><code>enum Direction
{
    None = 0, // default
    North = 1,
    South = 2,
    East = 3,
    West = 4
}
</code></pre>

<p>And instead of four boolean use one Direction variable. Less variables is less troubles.</p>

<p>And last.
I'm not understand properly how are you moving your sprites? I mean how are you detect direction before changing coords?
In my opinion it should by like that:</p>

<ol>
<li>In Update() detect in what direction you need to move and change Direction varialbe and basing on it change and update sprite state.</li>
<li>In Draw() anly draw sprite in current state.</li>
</ol>
