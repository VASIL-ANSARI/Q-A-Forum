<p>If your Java application runs on machine that is on the Internet, it already has a DNS service available and it already has at least one IP visible by other machines in your LAN. Use Java code similar to what I wrote below to get the IP address.</p>

<pre><code>import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class Ip {
  public static void main ( String[] args ) throws IOException {
    String hostname = args[0];

    try {
      InetAddress ipaddress = InetAddress.getByName(hostname);
      System.out.println("IP address: " + ipaddress.getHostAddress());
    } catch ( UnknownHostException e ) {
      System.out.println("Could not find IP address for: " + hostname);
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>PS. if the IP of machine on which you run your Java server application is changing (it is running on a home machine and ISP assigns dynamic IP), then use a free service like <a href="http://www.dyndns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dyndns.com</a> or similar. In this case it gets little bit complicated, because you have to inform your dynamic DNS of IP change. Some routers have this feature built-in, some do not. In this case you have to make sure dynamicDNS is informed. There are bunch of scripts available on the Internet that do this for you (typically for Linux / UNIX), and there are some freeware tools for Windows. I never did this on Windows, but I did it with Linux and it works nicely.</p>
