<p>I think a good approach to this is to have your menu items "justify" to fill the width of your container, regardless of font size, letter-spacing, etc., rather than trying to manipulate the items to fill the space. Every browser renders text a little differently, so it's very difficult to get a consistent look. This solution works really well:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6879467/how-do-i-justify-a-horizontal-list">How do I justify a horizontal list?</a></p>
