<p>I think you make some local vs global space error. I don't see so fast where exactly you go wrong, but all your position and direction calculations seem to be in the local system of the <code>tilesContainer</code>. Are you consistent in your local vs global coordinate system handling?</p>

<p>For example you add your <code>arrowHelper</code> to the <code>scene</code> instead of to the <code>tilesContainer</code>. It could be that the <code>tilesContainer</code> has some <code>rotation</code> set and because of this the arrows are pointing in another direction then you expected.</p>

<p>What happens for example if you add the arrows to the <code>tilesContainer</code> instead?</p>
