<p>Your request suppose to be some thing very simple in Android. Just use selector for that task. You can read about it in the official <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/button.html#Style" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Reading about <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Resources.Theme.html" rel="nofollow">themes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This class holds the current attribute values for a particular theme.
  In other words, a Theme is a set of values for resource attributes;
  these are used in conjunction with TypedArray to resolve the final
  value for an attribute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So theme is a set of values, so you can't changed set of values according to set of values. After reading the definition even the question itself sounds weird.</p>
