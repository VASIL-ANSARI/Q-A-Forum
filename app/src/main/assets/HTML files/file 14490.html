<p>Strings in the console are symbolized by wrapping them in quotes. By that fact, we can assume that <code>i</code> is a string. Convert it to an integer and it will no longer be a string and no longer have those quotes.</p>

<pre><code>endFlowArray.push(+i);
</code></pre>

<p>Your "numbers" in <code>flowEnd</code> and <code>dateFlow</code> are actually strings, not numbers.</p>
