<p>You need to number records from 1 to N (where N is last), <br>
and then sum first 10 and the rest based on these numbers.<br><br>
The easiest way to do it is to use <code>wor_number</code> analytic function, see the documentation for details: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions137.htm" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions137.htm</a>
<br><br>
Your query migh look like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SUM( column_to_sum ) sum_of_all,
       SUM( CASE WHEN nbr BETWEEN 1 AND 10 THEN column_to_sum END ) as top_10,
       SUM( column_to_sum )
       - 
       SUM( CASE WHEN nbr BETWEEN 1 AND 10 THEN column_to_sum END ) difference
FROM (
     SELECT column_to_sum,
            row_number() OVER 
                 (ORDER BY expression_to_order_rows_from_top_to_bottom) nbr
     FROM table
)
</code></pre>
