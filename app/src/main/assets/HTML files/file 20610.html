<p>This seems to be an issue with Firebug not with Firefox per se. My guess is that <code>Function</code> in Firebug lives in a different scope then <code>Function</code> in your page. (since unlike the other browsers Firebug is an extension , not a built in browser tool)</p>

<p>In fact if instead of Firebug you use the built in Firefox console (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console#Opening_the_Web_Console" rel="nofollow">Ctrl+Shift+K</a>), your code works perfectly fine.</p>

<p>This excerpt may be interesting</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Firebug is detached from Firefox, open in a new or separate
  window, the new window has its own scope. In that scope, a few Firebug
  script tags compile to create a connection back to the original
  browser.xul window. Most important, chrome.js is unique to each top
  level window, but the Firebug object used by the detached window is
  the object of the parent browser.xul.</p>
