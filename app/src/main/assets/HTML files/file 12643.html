<p>You should have a wizard somewhere to add a new "ATlObject" that mean create a ne class instantiable via COM. With this you can split your function in different classes. Supposing you have an ATLproject, when adding a new class this wizard should appear:

<p>By creating a new ATL simple object you have another class with exported function in the classical COM way. If you want you can always export a function with dllexport, but in this case you cannot use COM to interface with your component. You can even call function exported with the dll ( ocx ) the regular way by using the strategy:</p>

<pre><code>Private Declare Function MyFuncName Lib "yourocx.ocx" ([.. parameters]) As [Return type]
</code></pre>

<p>but it is probably not the way to go in your case.</p>
