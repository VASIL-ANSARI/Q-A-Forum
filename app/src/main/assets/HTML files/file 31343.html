<p>That is no line where it would be shown what the error is and why it is getting thrown. Since there is no line of code to read, it would be hard for me too to get to the root of the error. </p>

<p>General talking, this exception is thrown when you're trying to reference a null value or when the object type is not what was being expected at the stage. It might be an error in the dependencies that you're working on or the Assembly files that you're having for this application to work.</p>

<p>Is the page empty? What is the code in there that might be throwing this error?</p>
