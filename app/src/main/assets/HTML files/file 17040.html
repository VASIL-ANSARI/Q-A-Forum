<p>Start off by linking to DataTables.Net, Allan has done an amazing job with this plugin. </p>

<p>I've been using this plugin for about one year. When I first attempted to implement it in C# and .NET with server side processing, ajax and webservices, there was little documentation and no working examples so I decided to put one together.</p>

<p>The source code provided is of a Visual Studio 2012 (tested in Ultimate 2012 and Pro 2012) website project. I threw this together as a simple working example in hopes of helping someone else out there trying to put something like this together. It's something I wish I had a year ago.</p>

<p>The database mdf is included in the App_Data folder. I am currently running an instance of MS SQL Server Express 2012.</p>

<p>Required install SQL Server Express 2012 or other standard or better full version installs of MS SQL Server. Tested on Standard 2008 R2 and 2012 Express.</p>
