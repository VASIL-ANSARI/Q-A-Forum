<p>You can reset the file pointer by calling <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek"><code>seek()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>file.seek(0)
</code></pre>

<p>will do it.  You need that line after your first <code>readlines()</code>.  Note that <code>file</code> has to support random access for the above to work.</p>
