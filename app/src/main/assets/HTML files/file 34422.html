<p>Your question as I understand it: you want to test to see if the user name and password you have used is valid. </p>

<p>You need to know two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>What the subsequent page looks like in event of a successful login.</li>
<li>What the subsequent page looks like in event of an unsuccessful login.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, use this:</p>

<pre><code>Document document = Jsoup.connect(targetURL)
    .cookie("JSESSIONID", cookie)
    .get();
</code></pre>

<p>This is going to take some investigation on your part. You need to inspect the two different pages and find a single element that exists in one or both of them that will allow you to distinguish between a successful login and a failed login.</p>

<p>For example, if you're lucky, you might be able to compare the titles of the document like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (document.title().contains("Login Successful or whatever")){
    // DO SOMETHING
} else if (document.title().contains("Login Unsuccessful or something else")){
    // DO SOMETHING ELSE
};
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, that's if you're lucky. Otherwise you're going to have to go investigate and examine the respective html pages and figure out a convenient element to use to test the two pages for. </p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
