<p>You mean like how StackOverflow has a URL for this question?</p>

<pre><code>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12662640/how-to-make-form-that-creates-a-new-url-in-a-website
</code></pre>

<p>All it takes is a simple .htaccess file, something like:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule /questions/([0-9]+).*$ /question.php?id=$1
</code></pre>

<p>The whole "how-to-make..." thing is just the name of the question. I'm not entirely sure why many sites put that in the URL, possibly for SEO purposes, but it will automatically be filled in if you leave it out so I'm assuming it's optional.</p>
