<p>ServiceStack includes an enhanced version of Funq (e.g. with AutoWiring support) that's self-contained in the core <code>ServiceStack.dll</code>. </p>

<p>Unfortunately at this time the <code>ServiceStack.dll</code> is contained in the <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/ServiceStack">ServiceStack NuGet package</a> which brings in other ServiceStack server dependencies. You can build it from src or cherry pick from the NuGet package just the dlls you need, i.e:</p>

<ul>
<li>ServiceStack.dll</li>
<li>ServiceStack.Common.dll</li>
<li>ServiceStack.Interfaces.dll </li>
<li>ServiceStack.Text.dll</li>
</ul>
