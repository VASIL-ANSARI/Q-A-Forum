<p>You are probably better off using Reachability, as it is the standard class for handling questions of connectivity. I recommend Tony Million's implementation that is a drop-in replacement (upgrade). It can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability</a></p>

<p>A short example of how to use it, from the documentation:</p>

<pre><code>// Allocate a reachability object
Reachability* reach = [Reachability reachabilityWithHostname:@"www.google.com"];

// Set the blocks
reach.reachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach)
{
    // keep in mind this is called on a background thread
    // and if you are updating the UI it needs to happen
    // on the main thread, like this:

    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
      NSLog(@"REACHABLE!");
      //Do the things you need to do with Parse here
    });
};

reach.unreachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach)
{
    NSLog(@"UNREACHABLE!");
    //Wuh woh. Fire off an alert letting the user know there's no connection.
};

// Start the notifier, which will cause the reachability object to retain itself!
[reach startNotifier];
</code></pre>
