<p>You do not <strong>declare</strong> variable with <code>global</code>. You just make it available within you method or function body even it was set (or using your terminology "declared") outside of it. So there's no way to have the variable unless it is declared. And there's no way to do that without running the PHP code (<em>simplification</em>, but it does not matter here). And code is not coming from nowhere, hence the need of <code>include</code> or <code>require</code> of said code that sets variable.</p>

<p>You may try to use <code>php.ini</code>'s <code>auto_include_file</code> to have your variables auto-included, but still, the PHP code needs to be used for that.</p>

<p>But you generally doing it wrong. move all global variables into class, set autoloader and access i.e. statically. The code will be much cleaner.</p>
