<p>ok, the thing is that jcropper will look for 'POST' values to detect where to do cropping (x, y, height and width). In order to provide them you have to send them encoded like
'somestring_x', 'somestring_y', 'somestring_h' and 'somestring_w'.</p>

<p>In this case 'somestring' is exactly what you put in the <code>getCoordsFromPost</code> method: in your case <code>"idOrAttributeName"</code>.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the sourcecode on <a href="https://github.com/digitick/yii-jcrop/blob/master/EJCropper.php" rel="nofollow">github</a> it will be clear (it's indeed very simple).</p>
