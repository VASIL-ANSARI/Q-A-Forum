<p>It sounds like you want the C++ world of being able to override but not call; then no: you can't do that in C#. The <em>other way around</em> is fine, though - either don't mark it <code>virtual</code> in the first place, or mark it <code>sealed</code> if it is <em>already</em> <code>virtual</code>.</p>
