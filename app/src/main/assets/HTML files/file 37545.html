<p>You got it right to use Service. Do not use Timer, since it is extra thread you do not need. What you can do is to use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html" rel="nofollow">AlarmManager</a> to schedule your service intent to be launched every 15 seconds (interval). This will trigger interval time your service by calling onStartCommand in your service where you can do whatever you need by reading (if need) intent from parameters of onStartCommand.</p>
