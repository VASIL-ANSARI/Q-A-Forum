<p>You can pass as many args in the path as you want with POST params (you were trying to pass GET params):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>GET params are visible</strong> in the URL (example: <code>/users?is_admin=true</code> the <code>params[:is_admin]</code> is equal to <code>"true"</code> in this case)</li>
<li><strong>POST params are not visible</strong> in the URL (like when you click on "login" button after you've filled the username/password fields, for obvious security reasons you don't want to print the fields in the URL)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>In your case, you should pass the ids as POST params. How to send POST params in a request? Just ask <code>link_to</code> to use <code>POST</code> method instead of <code>GET</code>:</p>

<pre><code>link_to 'Click here!', rails_path(ids: large_array_of_ids), method: :post
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Another way to create a POST link:</p>

<pre><code># HAML code
= form_tag rails_path(ids: large_array_of_ids) do
  = submit_tag 'Click here!'

# ERB code
&lt;%= form_tag rails_path(ids: large_array_of_ids) do %&gt;
  &lt;%= submit_tag 'Click here!' %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>
