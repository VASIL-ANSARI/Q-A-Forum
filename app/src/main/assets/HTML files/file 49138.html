<p>I just downloaded the parse CLI on my Windows desktop to figure it out and I believe I've found your solution.</p>

<p>You need to open up a standard command line on windows and then navigate to where you have stored parse.exe. Once the command line is at the same directory as the exe, you will be able to run <code>parse new</code> and any of the other CLI commands.</p>

<p>For example, you could do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hit the Windows key (or start menu) and search "cmd" then hit enter to open the command line</li>
<li>Navigate to where <code>parse.exe</code> is located. If it's on your desktop, it could be something along the lines of <code>cd C:\Users\&lt;name&gt;\Desktop</code></li>
<li><code>parse help</code>, <code>parse new</code> and so on should now work from this directory</li>
</ul>

<p>The documentation feels a bit vague and could use some clarification for the Windows platform. Hope this helps!</p>
