<p>I think is related to the http  method you use for call. Probably you use a get method but you need a post method </p>

<p>You should have somethings like this </p>

<pre><code>array('label'=&gt;'Delete', 'url'=&gt;'#',
   'linkOptions'=&gt;array('submit'=&gt;array('event/delete','id'=&gt;$model-&gt;id),
  'confirm'=&gt;('Are you sure to delete this item?'), 
 'method' =&gt;'post')),
</code></pre>

<p>check if you have method  =  post </p>

<p>deleteAction  only allow deletion via POST request</p>
