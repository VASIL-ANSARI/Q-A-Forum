<p>For the look in the screenshot, I would just use a regular <code>UITabBarController</code>. To create the large, red button in the middle, just make a <code>UIButton</code> and add it above the <code>UITabBar</code>.</p>

<p>You can see some sample code in the <a href="https://github.com/boctor/idev-recipes/tree/master/RaisedCenterTabBar" rel="nofollow">open-source <code>RaisedCenterTabBar</code> project</a>, although I would use auto-layout instead of manual layout to position the button.</p>

<p>You won't be able to use a storyboard to add the button, but it'll still be a lot less work than reinventing or subclassing <code>UITabBarController</code>.</p>
