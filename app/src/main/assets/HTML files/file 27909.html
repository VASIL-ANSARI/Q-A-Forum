<p>There's a lot of issues you are raising up in one questions... but I suggest that you look at the object that's getting back from $reservation->invoice. You suggested that reservations and invoices are two separate but one-to-many related entities, so when you call <code>$reservation-&gt;invoices</code>, Laravel helps you out by returning a collection of invoice models, so you can iterate through them and update.  Also you might also want to look at how you can utilize the relationship method (<code>$reservation-&gt;invoices()</code>)</p>

<p>for your other question ... <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php" rel="nofollow">PHP Documentation is your friend</a> See: array_diff and array_intersect type functions</p>
