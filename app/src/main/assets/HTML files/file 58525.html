<p>Whether or not a local array is initialized has no bearing on whether or not it is stored on stack.  </p>

<p>If the implementation uses a stack, then the array will be on the stack, initialized or not.</p>

<p>From section 6.7.9 of the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf" rel="nofollow">C standard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>10</strong> If  an  object  that  has  automatic  storage  duration  is  not  initialized  explicitly,  its  value  is indeterminate.   If  an 
  object  that  has  static  or  thread  storage  duration  is  not 
  initialized explicitly, then: </p>
  
  <p>â  if it has pointer type, it is
  initialized to a null pointer;</p>
  
  <p>â  if it has arithmetic type, it is
  initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero;</p>
  
  <p>â  if it is an aggregate,
  every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules,
  and any padding is initialized to zero bits; </p>
  
  <p>â  if it is a union, the
  first named member is initialized (recursively) according to these
  rules, and any padding is initialized to zero bits;</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p><strong>21</strong> If there are fewer initializers in a brace-enclosed list than there
  are elements or members of an aggregate, or fewer characters in a
  string literal used to initialize an array of known size  than  there 
  are  elements  in  the  array,  <strong>the  remainder  of  the  aggregate 
  shall  be initialized implicitly the same as objects that have static
  storage duration</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if an initializer list has fewer elements than the array, the remaining elements are initialized the same as non local variables, i.e. set to 0.</p>
