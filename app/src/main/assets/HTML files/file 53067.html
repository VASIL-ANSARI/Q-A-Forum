<p><strong>Grav plugin or theme</strong></p>

<p>In order to support the correct installation folders for Grav plugins and themes,
you would need to add the <a href="https://github.com/composer/installers" rel="nofollow"><code>composer/installers</code></a> to the <code>require</code> section of your plugins. </p>

<p>Normally the plugins would land in the vendor folder, too - but, the Grav Installer tells Composer the correct position inside a Grav project, see
see <a href="https://github.com/composer/installers/blob/master/src/Composer/Installers/GravInstaller.php#L6" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/composer/installers/blob/master/src/Composer/Installers/GravInstaller.php#L6</a></p>

<p>So, when writing plugins or themes for grav each <code>composer.json</code> must indicate the <code>type</code> as <code>grav-plugin</code> or <code>grav-theme</code>, else Composer can't match the package to the installer.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "name": "your/some-grav-plugin",
    "type": "grav-plugin",
    "require": {
        "composer/installers": "^1.0.23"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Grav main project</strong></p>

<p>Now, in your main grav project's <code>composer.json</code>, just add the plugins.</p>

<p>Then run <code>composer install</code>. That means the package is fetched, the composer installer is fetched, based on the package type the matching installer is triggered and the grav installer drops the file into the correct folder....</p>

  <p>But how to do the same in Windows? </p>

<p>Uhm... Composer works cross-platform. Not a problem.</p>
