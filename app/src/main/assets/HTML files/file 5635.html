<p>Your problem isn't with the created_at method of the ActiveRecord object. 
I think what's spitting the error here is actually the <code>created_at</code> method being called on your <code>tweet</code> object.</p>

<p>See above - you use</p>

<pre><code>entry.text = tweet['text']
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>tweet</code> is a hash)... but then</p>

<pre><code>entry.created_at = Chromium(tweet.created_at)
</code></pre>

<p>complains that the Hash doesn't have a method called <code>created_at</code></p>

<pre><code> undefined method `created_at' for #&lt;Hash:0x1036af910&gt;
</code></pre>
