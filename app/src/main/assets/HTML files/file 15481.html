<p>No you don't need an <code>if</code> or <code>while</code> statement to introduce a new level of scope. Basically the <code>{</code> symbol opens a new scope level and <code>}</code> ends it. The usual scoping rules apply, for example, variables defined within this new block are undefined outside of, at the end of the block object destructors are run, and variables named the same as another in a scope level above will be shadowed.</p>

<p>A common use case is in <code>switch</code> statements. For example,</p>

<pre><code>switch (a)
{
    case 1:
    {
        int i;
    }
    case 2:
    {
        int i; //note reuse of variable with the same name as in case 1
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Without the <code>{</code> <code>}</code> in the case statements the compiler will complain about multiply defined identifiers.</p>
