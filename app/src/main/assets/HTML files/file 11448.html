<p>The libraries aren't JavaEE specific. For generating XML, StAX and JDOM are the most commonly used in my experience. StAX is part of the JDK. They also do XML parsing and validation.</p>

<p>A couple of tutorials: <a href="http://%5BStAX%5D%5B1%5D" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/07/20/introduction-to-stax.html#writing-xml" rel="nofollow">2</a></p>

<p>StAX uses an event based model (read the document and when you see element X do something) and unsuprisingly JDOM uses syntax similar to DOM (find element X.Y). JDOM loads the entire document tree into memory, which eats up memory but performs faster.</p>
