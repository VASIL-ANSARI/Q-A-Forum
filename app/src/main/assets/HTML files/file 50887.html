<p>There's no built-in method to detect cycles using reflection. However, reflection seems unnecessary here. </p>

<p>From what you're saying, it sounds like the objects in this graph are ones you're writing yourself. I assume that the objects in the graph each own their links to the other objects, and that the list of objects they link to is publicly available. Since they all descend from a common base class, this shouldn't be difficult to implement there, and you don't need to worry about all the various subclasses.</p>

<p>Assuming the linked objects are available on a public API defined on the base class, it would not be difficult to traverse the graph to look for cycles in the graph; I imagine there's multiple well-known algorithms for finding them (though I admit I haven't looked).</p>
