<p>Dismissing the navigation controller does not release it, assuming you have a strong reference to it (that would need to get nil'd). In the view controllers used by it, add a log message in the dealloc method, so you know they are getting dealloced (you can do this for any subclassed item). If needed you can create a simple UINavigation subclass for the sole purpose of adding a message in dealloc). You will find that one or more of these items are not getting dealloced, and then you need to figure out if they are retained by a property/ivar or because they still have a superview.</p>
