<p>In Java, everything besides POD is a reference. There's no specifying you want a reference, because that's all you get.</p>

<p>Not so much in C++. Everything defaults to value. If you want a <code>std::list</code> of reference types, then you'll need a compiler supporting C++11 std::reference_wrapper. You can then do:</p>

<p><code>std::list&lt;std::reference_wrapper&lt;Type&gt;&gt; t_list</code></p>

<p>To add to this list, you would need to use std::ref:</p>

<p><code>t_list.push_back(std::ref(myObj))</code></p>

<p>Now everything you add into this list will just be a std::reference_wrapper type. You could also store pointers instead by just doing:</p>

<p><code>std::list&lt;Type*&gt; tptr_list</code></p>

<p>Which may be easier, or the only option if you don't have a C++11 compliant compiler.</p>
