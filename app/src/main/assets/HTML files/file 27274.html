<p>If you mean get the Display screen resolutions.</p>

<p>This may be what you are after.</p>

<pre><code>NSScreen* thescreen;
id theScreens = [NSScreen screens];

for (thescreen in theScreens) {
  NSLog(@"%@x%@",  [NSNumber numberWithFloat:[thescreen frame].size.width],   [NSNumber numberWithFloat:[thescreen frame].size.height]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This example will give you the <strong>set</strong> resolutions of all displays</p>

<p>Have a look at apples <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSScreen_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">NSScreen</a></p>

<p>If this is not quite what you are after can you expand your question.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>UPDATE</strong>. in regard to comment from OP on wanting all possible display resolutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>This maybe what you are after and you will have to play with it to see if it is indeed returning the correct info. I was getting multiple results hence the filter. But if you play with it you should be able to thin it down.</p>

<p>The test project was using ARC and it forced the __bridges..
But again I am sure you will have time to code it all better.</p>

<p>My reference was  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/Quartz_Services_Ref/Reference/reference.html" rel="nofollow">Quartz Display Services Reference</a></p>

<pre><code>NSArray* theref  =  (__bridge NSArray *)(CGDisplayCopyAllDisplayModes ( CGMainDisplayID(), nil ));

NSMutableArray * rezes = [[NSMutableArray  alloc]init];

for (id aMode  in theref) {
  CGDisplayModeRef  thisMode = (__bridge CGDisplayModeRef)(aMode);
  size_t theWidth = CGDisplayModeGetWidth( thisMode );
  size_t theHeight = CGDisplayModeGetHeight( thisMode );
  NSString *theRez = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%zux%zu",theWidth,theHeight];

  if (![rezes containsObject:theRez]) {
    [rezes addObject:theRez];
  }
}

NSLog(@" display deatails = %@", rezes);
