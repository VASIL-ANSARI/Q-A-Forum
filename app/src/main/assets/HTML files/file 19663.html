<p>I think you have wrong this line :</p>

<pre><code> mp=MediaPlayer.create(ProjectisengActivity.this, R.raw.test);
</code></pre>

<p>You create new instance every time user clicks the button, so it's never playing and starts again. Put this line into <code>onCreate</code> rather than <code>go()</code></p>
