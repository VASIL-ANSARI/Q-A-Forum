<p>Let's look at the loop</p>

<pre><code>for( i = 7 ; i &lt; 6 ; i-- )
</code></pre>

<p><code>i</code> is initialized <code>7</code>, but you have the condition <code>i &lt; 6</code>, but <code>i</code> is <code>7</code>, and therefor, it does not satisfy the condition of the loop. So, the code does not even go through one iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>Maybe, you meant <code>i &gt; 6</code></p>
