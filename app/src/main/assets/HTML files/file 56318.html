<p>My suggestion is to read the binary file. If it's small enough you can read it all into memory in one go, otherwise I suggest you use the operating system to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file" rel="nofollow">map the file into memory</a> (or at least a "window" of it).</p>

<p>Then it's quite easy to find the 8-byte sequence separating the records. First simply search for <code>0x20</code>, and whenever that is found you see if it's the start of the whole separator sequence.</p>

<p>When you find the separator sequence you take the saved position of the previous separator, and the position of the newly found separator, and the data between is the data you want. Save the position of the newly found separator as the old position, and continue searching for the next separator.</p>
