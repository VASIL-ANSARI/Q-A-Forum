<p>There are a few possible ways to do this.</p>

<p>One would be</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
 ...
ORDER BY
  CASE 
    WHEN ISNUMERIC(value) = 1 THEN CONVERT(INT, value) 
    ELSE 9999999 -- or something huge
  END,
  value
</code></pre>

<p>the first part of the ORDER BY converts everything to an int (with a huge value for non-numerics, to sort last) then the last part takes care of alphabetics.</p>

<p>Note that the performance of this query is probably at least moderately ghastly on large amounts of data.</p>
