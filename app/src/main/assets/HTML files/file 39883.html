<p>The problem is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In JavaScript, functions enclose variables which were defined in a scope outside of their own in such a way that they have a "living" reference to the variable, not a snapshot of its value at any particular time.</p>

<p>Since 'c' or 'counter' is fully incremented before the method that uses 'c' is invoked, the value of 'c' is always the highest value achieved in the for loop. To solve the issue you need to capture the value of 'c' at the point in time your renderer function is created. This code illustrates the issue and how to capture the value to achieve your desired effect:</p>

<pre><code>var counter = 0;
var dayOfMonths = [];
var dayOfMonthCaptured = [];
 for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  var c = counter;
  console.log(c);
  dayOfMonths.push(function () { 
    var index = c;
    //since counter is incremented fully before this method is called, you get the last value
    console.log(index); 
  });
  //here we pass the current value of c to a new function and capture its current value
  dayOfMonthCaptured.push((function (index) {
      return function () { 
        console.log(index); 
      };
   })(c));
  counter++;
}
//this wonât work
for (day in dayOfMonths) {
  dayOfMonths[day]();
}
console.log("âââââââââ");
for (day in dayOfMonthCaptured) {
  dayOfMonthCaptured[day]();
}
</code></pre>
