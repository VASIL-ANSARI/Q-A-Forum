<p>You do not have to manually create a <strong>"More..."</strong> button. 
Simply add all of the View Controllers that you need to the Tab Bar Controller and it will handle the rest.</p>

<p>If you want to create then one of the solution is,</p>

<p>You could make your own <code>More</code> tab and then have it display a <code>navigation controller</code> and <code>table view</code> with the other options.  </p>

<p><strong>do it like following way:</strong></p>

<p>You can set the last bar button as a "More" button even when there are only 4 tabs. The initialization code for that tab bar item would be:</p>

<pre><code>self.tabBarItem = [[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTabBarSystemItem:UITabBarSystemItemMore tag:0];
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this will work perfectly..:) </p>
