<p>The original answer I gave you showed how to replace the Action. If you need to restore the default Action then it is probably easier to create a new InputMap and ActionMap entry for the Action. The <a href="http://tips4java.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/key-bindings/" rel="nofollow">Key Bindings</a> link I gave you shows how to do this.</p>

<p>Then when you need to restore the default Action you can use:</p>

<pre><code>textField.getInputMap().put(keystroke, "none");
</code></pre>

<p>This will cause the original InputMap to be search again.</p>

<p>Another approach it to save the Action before you update the ActionMap with the custom Action. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>Action original = textField.getActionMap().get(...);
</code></pre>

<p>Reread the <a href="http://tips4java.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/key-bindings/" rel="nofollow">Key Bindings</a> link to better understand the usage of the InputMap and ActionMap.</p>
