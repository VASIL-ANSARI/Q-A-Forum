<p>In general, there are two ways to handle the return values from a recursive algorithm. Either you can collect the return values from your recursive calls and combine them, or you can pass in an extra mutable argument which the recursive calls can modify. I think the latter is likely to be best in this situation, since dictionaries are easy to mutate in place but not especially easy to merge together:</p>

<pre><code>def game_lengths(node, result=None):
    if result is None:
        result = {}

    #... add a value to the result dict, handle base cases, etc.

    for child in node.children:
        game_lengths(child, result)

    return result
</code></pre>
