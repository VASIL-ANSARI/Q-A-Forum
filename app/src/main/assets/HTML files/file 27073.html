<p>I cases like this I usually skip the WSDL and create a client without it. That works with Savon v1 and v2. You have to set </p>

<pre><code>endpoint
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>namespace
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to set</p>

<pre><code>soap_action
</code></pre>

<p>explicitely. The documentation at <a href="http://savonrb.com" rel="nofollow">http://savonrb.com</a> explains what to do. In case you need further help let us know.</p>
