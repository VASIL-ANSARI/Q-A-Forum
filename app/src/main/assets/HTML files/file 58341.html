  <p>If an insertion occurs and results in a rehashing of the container, all iterators are invalidated. Otherwise iterators are not affected. <strong>References are not invalidated</strong>. </p>

  <p>Rehashing invalidates iterators, changes ordering between elements, and changes which buckets elements appear in, but <strong>does not invalidate pointers or references to elements</strong>.</p>
