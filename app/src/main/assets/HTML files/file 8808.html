<p>Every Android application has one Application (or subclass) in it, and you can ovverride the default to provide your own application-wide functionality. Simply subclass android.app.Application to add your additional functionality, and declare your Application in your manifest. In the manifest's &lt;application&gt; node, provide an android:name attribute equal to the full name of your override.</p>

<p>Once you've got that, giving it a static set of access methods is trivial.</p>
