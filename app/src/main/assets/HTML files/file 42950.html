<p>The alt should describe the image, so "InteOkej pÃ¥ Facebook" would be better than "img01" in this case. If the title+description isn't too long, just make this you alt tag.</p>

<p>An alternative is HTML5 microdata or maybe add this to a real H3 and P and hide them with CSS. You could then take these without using the data attributes (if you want to).</p>
