<p>First of all, %d is for a <code>int</code></p>

<p>So <code>%1.16lld</code> makes no sense, because %d is an integer</p>

<p>That typedef you do, is also unnecessary, use the type straight ahead, makes a much more readable code.</p>

<p>What you want to use is the type <code>double</code>, for calculating pi
and then using <code>%f</code> or <code>%1.16f</code>.</p>
