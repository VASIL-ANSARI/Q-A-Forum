<p>The <code>writeToURL:..</code> methods don't support the <code>FTP</code> protocol. You'll have to use other mechanisms to write the string content onto an ftp server. You can look at tools such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ios-ftp-server/" rel="nofollow"><code>ios-ftp-server</code></a> to handle such uploads. You can also look at this <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/SimpleFTPSample/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40009243-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2" rel="nofollow"><code>sample code</code></a> from Apple.</p>
