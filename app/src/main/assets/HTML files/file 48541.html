<p>I've actually never used Angular before but playing around with your code I think I have it working.  At least the list shows up and clicking on an item displays it's details.</p>

<p>Really the only change was to remove the "ng-repeat" tag in the detail view content div and then to fill the scope post data in the Detail Controller.</p>

<p>New Controller Code:</p>

<pre><code>starter.controller('DetailController', ['$scope', '$http', '$stateParams',
    function($scope, $http, $stateParams) {

    $http.get('data.json').success(function(data) {
        $scope.post = (data.posts[$stateParams.id-1]);
        $scope.id=$stateParams.id;
    });
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully this is what you were looking for or is at least helpful.</p>
