<p>The error you're getting means that one of the certificates (presumably the server's certificate) isn't trusted by your JavaMail client. Since you seem to be using STARTTLS, you're effectively using SSL/TLS.</p>

<p>You could perhaps try something like <code>mail.smtp.starttls.enable="false"</code> if you don't want to use SSL/TLS at all, although some SMTP servers will force you to use it (either SSL/TLS on connection or via STARTTLS) to proceed any further.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you change your mind and want/need to use SSL, make sure your trust store on the client side contains a trust anchor (CA certificate) that can be used to verify your server certificate. (Note that the <code>mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity</code> default to <code>false</code> is insecure, so you'd want to change that to <code>true</code>, and not use <code>mail.smtp.ssl.trust="*"</code>.)</p>
