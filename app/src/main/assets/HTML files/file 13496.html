<li><p>Make sure the function signatures are the same. <code>toolSource</code> isn't const in <code>DefendPropertyPhysical</code>. If the signatures don't match up, the c++ compiler will not assume that you made a mistake, it will just assume that you're declaring a new overload of that method. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Explicit_overrides_and_final" rel="nofollow">C++11's explicit override</a> helps with this.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure <code>DefendProperty::apply</code> is marked as <code>virtual</code> in the header.</p></li>
