<p>Looks like your sessions table is marked as crashed und should be repaired.</p>

<p>Since those are "only" session data rows, you could delete the table and create a new one with the same name and the following design:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS  `default_ci_sessions` (
session_id varchar(40) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
ip_address varchar(45) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
user_agent varchar(120) NOT NULL,
last_activity int(10) unsigned DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
user_data text NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (session_id),
KEY `last_activity_idx` (`last_activity`)
);
</code></pre>

<p>Structure is from <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/sessions.html" rel="nofollow">CodeIgniter Sessions doc</a>, which is also used in PyroCMS.</p>

<p>As to why it crashed: you would need to check the logs (Apache and/or MySQL) or check with your hoster/provider to get more information on this.</p>
