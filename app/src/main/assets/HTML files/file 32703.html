<p>I believe you cannot extend multiple selectors this way.</p>

<p>Try using this:</p>

<pre><code>@extend .btn;
@extend .btn-link;
</code></pre>

<p>Although that seems a little repetitive, but works fine in my codes.</p>

<p>EDIT: while reading through <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#multiple_extends" rel="nofollow">SASS_REFERENCE</a>, I found that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Multiple extends can also be written using a comma-separated list of selectors. For example, @extend .error, .attention is the same as @extend .error; @extend.attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did found it <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_CHANGELOG.html#3115" rel="nofollow">in the changelog</a> that this format was first introduced in version 3.1.15, so I suppose you are using an older version of SASS than that.</p>

<p>I strongly encourage you to upgrade to the latest version, as it has a lot of great features, just make sure your codes are not broken by an update, although most of the inconsistencies can be worked out rather easily.</p>
