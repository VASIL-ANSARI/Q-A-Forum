<p>The issue you describe is due to poor app design or a poor understanding of app architecture. If you need to refresh app data whenever the app becomes active you can simply call your update function off of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">UIApplicationDelegate</a> event (or register for a notification), specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>applicationDidBecomeActive:</p>
  
  <p>Tells the delegate that the application has become active.
  - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application Parameters</p>
  
  <p>application</p>

<pre><code>The singleton application instance.
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Discussion</p>
  
  <p>This method is called to let your application know that it moved from
  the inactive to active state. This can occur because your application
  was launched by the user or the system. Applications can also return
  to the active state if the user chooses to ignore an interruption
  (such as an incoming phone call or SMS message) that sent the
  application temporarily to the inactive state.</p>
  
  <p>You should use this method to restart any tasks that were paused (or
  not yet started) while the application was inactive. For example, you
  could use it to restart timers or throttle up OpenGL ES frame rates.
  If your application was previously in the background, you could also
  use it to refresh your applicationâs user interface.</p>
  
  <p>After calling this method, the application also posts a
  UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification notification to give
  interested objects a chance to respond to the transition. Availability</p>
