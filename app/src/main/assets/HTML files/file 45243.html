<p>This is because the time complexity of your algorithm is pretty much O(n^2). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" rel="nofollow">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> created a better algorithm that will prevent your browser from freezing. 
Here is one way of doing it:</p>

<pre><code>var exceptions = {
  2: 2,
  3: 3,
  5: 5,
  7: 7
}

var primeSieve = function (start, end) {
  var result = [];
  for (start; start &lt; end; start++) {
    if (start in exceptions) result.push(start);
    if (start &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; start % 2 !== 0 &amp;&amp; start % 3 !== 0 &amp;&amp; start % 5 !== 0 &amp;&amp; start % 7 !== 0) {
      result.push(start);
    }
  }
  return result;
};
</code></pre>

<p>You can obviously make this look prettier, but I just did it quickly so you can get the point. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions.</p>
