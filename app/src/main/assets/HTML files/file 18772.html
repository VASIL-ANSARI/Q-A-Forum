<p>I'll answer the question you didn't ask first ;) : how can this code be more pythonic?</p>

<p>Instead of </p>

<pre><code>ii = 0
NNCat = []
NNCatelogue = []
while ii &lt;= len(lines):

    NNCat = (ev_id[ii], nn1[ii], nn2[ii], nn3[ii], nn4[ii], nn5[ii], nn6[ii], nn7[ii], nn8[ii], nn9[ii], nn10[ii], nn11[ii])
    NNCatelogue.append(NNCat)
    ii = ii + 1
</code></pre>

<p>you should do</p>

<pre><code>NNCat = []
NNCatelogue = []
for ii, line in enumerate(lines):

    NNCat = (ev_id[ii], nn1[ii], nn2[ii], nn3[ii], nn4[ii], nn5[ii], nn6[ii],
             nn7[ii], nn8[ii], nn9[ii], nn10[ii], nn11[ii])
    NNCatelogue.append(NNCat)
</code></pre>

<p>During each pass <code>ii</code> will be incremented by one for you and <code>line</code> will be the current line.</p>

<p>As for your short lines, you have two choices</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a special value (such as <code>None</code>) to fill in when you don't have a real value</li>
<li>check the length of <code>nn1</code>, <code>nn2</code>, ..., <code>nn11</code> to see if they are large enough</li>
</ul>

<p>The second solution will be much more verbose, hard to maintain, and confusing.  I strongly recommend using <code>None</code> (or another special value you create yourself) as a placeholder when there is no data.</p>
