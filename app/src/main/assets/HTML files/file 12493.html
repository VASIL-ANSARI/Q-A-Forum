<p><code>ERROR</code> is <em>really</em> restrictive; I couldn't recommend that for production. <code>WARN</code> is the absolute least I'd have in production--you could miss a lot of very important information, particularly at startup.</p>

<p>IMO, <code>INFO</code> is more-typical, and most useful.</p>

<p><code>DEBUG</code> should rarely be used in a production environment; if you're relying on it I'd suggest that your logging was put in the code at the wrong level. <code>DEBUG</code> is for just that--debugging.</p>

<p>I've never restricted S2 to anything greater than <code>WARN</code>, but I tend to leave things at <code>INFO</code> level unless specifically trying to debug an issue. On production I also use a fast layout, again unless there's a particularly component that's being worked on.</p>
