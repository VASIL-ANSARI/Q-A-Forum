<p>You have to modify your rest controller and enable CORS.
I know two ways to implement that.</p>

<p>One way is to add the annotation @CrossOrigin in your Controller's method, here you have the official documentation: <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/" rel="nofollow">https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/</a></p>

<p>Another way is to add a filter and modify the request header. You have a perfect example here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/zeroows/80bbe076d15cb8a4f0ad" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/zeroows/80bbe076d15cb8a4f0ad</a></p>
