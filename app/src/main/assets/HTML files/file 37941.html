<pre><code>super(BoxLayout, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that you call super on BoxLayout, not for your ImagePicker class (the first argument should be the <em>current</em> class, not the parent). This messes up the binding that is normally created in the BoxLayout's <code>__init__</code> (probably this is simply not called any more, you get the BoxLayout parent's <code>__init__</code> instead), so the normal layout triggers are absent and the change of size etc do not affect the children.</p>

<p>I'm not completely sure of some of the details (in particular, I'm surprised that the layout for your root widget seems to work fine), but this seems to be the core of the problem.</p>
