<p>You can't. Use <code>if() ... else ...</code>.</p>

<p>The nearest thing available to what you want uses a GCC extension and is thus non-standard. You can define ranges in case statements instead of just a value:</p>

<pre><code>switch(foo)
{
    case 0 ... 20: // matches when foo is inclusively comprised within 0 and 20
         // do cool stuff
         break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, you can't use that to match <em>anything</em> under a certain value. It has to be in a precise range. <code>Switch</code>es can only be used to replace the comparison operator against a constant, and can't be used for anything more than that.</p>
