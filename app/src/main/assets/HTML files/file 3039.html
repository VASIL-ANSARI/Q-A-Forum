<p>If you're not a threading guru, I'd advise you to stick with known working classes. So yes, stick to the .NET semaphore class if it works for your task.</p>

<p>Don't micro-optimize your code unless you have a valid reason to do so (e.g. profiler results).</p>

<p>That said, if your code pattern is something like a producer-consumer pattern, there are <a href="http://www.albahari.com/threading/part4.aspx" rel="nofollow">efficient solutions using the Monitor class</a> which avoid the use of OS synchronization objects.</p>
