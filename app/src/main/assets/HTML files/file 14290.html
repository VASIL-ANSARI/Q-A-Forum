<p>I'm not sure it's possible even for a .net <code>Regex</code> (which is more powerful than the strictest definition of 'regular language') to do this; and anyway, unless you have a requirement to use only a <code>Regex</code>, there's nothing wrong (to my mind) with:</p>

<pre><code>bool IsValid(string input)
{
    var Ns = input.Count(c =&gt; c == 'N');
    var As = input.Count(c =&gt; c == 'A');
    // etc
    var E1s = Regex.Matches(input, "E1").Count
    // etc

    var maxDescriptorCount = (new[] { As, ... ,E1s, ... }).Max();

    var isValid = 
        ((Ns == 1) &amp;&amp; (maxDescriptorCount == 0))
        ||
        ((Ns == 0) &amp;&amp; (maxDescriptorCount == 1))
        ;

    return isValid;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is it the shortest code that solves the problem? No. Is it readable and maintainable? I think so.</p>

<p><sub>(You could write a utility method with the signature <code>int MaxN(params int[] numbers)</code> if you wanted)</sub></p>
