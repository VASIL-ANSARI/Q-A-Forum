<p>Here is one solution.</p>

<p>The serial port is receiving the data in its own thread, and you should read the incoming bytes in the data received handler.</p>

<p>I propose to read the data and add it to a thread-safe FIFO list in the data received handler and read the data from the list in the main thread.</p>

<p>See my solution in post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16335690/serial-port-reading-threads-or-something-better/16345503#16345503">Serial port reading + Threads or something better?</a></p>
