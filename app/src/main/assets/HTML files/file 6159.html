<p>This is probably more an objective C question than a word question.</p>

<p>Word DOCX files are essentially just ZIP archives that have a DOCX extension.</p>

<p>Save a DOCX file, give it a password, then rename the DOCX file as a ZIP, and you should be able to open it with any old zip manager, provided you have the password. I'm betting there are objective-c zip archive handling code snips out there somewhere.</p>

<p>As for the second question about reading the docx,</p>

<p>Well, once you have the zip opened and unencrypted, the zip is just that, a zip archive of a bunch of files. The files depict individual elements of the docx file.</p>

<p>You can get a start on the specs from the wikipedia article</p>

<p>But really, just rename a docx as zip, unzip it somewhere and this start poking around.</p>

<p>Most of the contents are XML files, that can be read in a variety of different ways (DOM, SAX, plain ol' line input, etc).</p>
