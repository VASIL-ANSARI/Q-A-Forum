<p>There are solutions in some cases, see UPnP: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#NAT_traversal" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#NAT_traversal</a></p>

<p>My home router allows this, basically, the NAT can be configured automatically by the proper request from the computer.</p>

<p>I would not count on this to provide a big improvement in your availability, because not that many routers both support that and have it enabled.</p>

<p>EDIT: @David suggested this SO question for a .NET library for UPnP: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/333079/is-there-a-upnp-library-for-net-c-or-vb-net">Is there a UPnP Library for .NET (C# or VB.NET)?</a></p>
