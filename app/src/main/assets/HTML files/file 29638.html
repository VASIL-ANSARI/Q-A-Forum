<p>I'd recommend this:</p>

<pre><code>map(lambda word: word.lower(), paragraph.split()).count("the")
</code></pre>

<p>Output: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; paragraph = "This is a day of national consecration. And I am certain that on this day my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency, I will address them with a can
dor and a decision which the present situation of our people impels. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly f
acing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we h
ave to fear is fear itself, nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of
 frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. And I am convinced that you will again give that support to leader
ship in these critical days."
&gt;&gt;&gt; map(lambda word: word.lower(), paragraph.split()).count("the")
7
</code></pre>

<p>Since my solution may look weird, here's a little explanation from left to right:</p>

<p><code>map(function, target)</code>: This applies the function to all elements of <code>target</code>, thus <code>target</code> must be a list or some other iterable. In this case, we're mapping a <code>lambda</code> function, which can be a little scary, so read below about that</p>

<p><code>.lower()</code>: Takes the lower case of whatever string its applied to, <code>word</code> in this case.  This is done to ensure that "the", "The", "THE", "ThE", and so on are all counted</p>

<p><code>.split()</code>: This splits a string (<code>paragraph</code>) into a list by the separator supplied in the parenthesis.  In the case of no separator (such as this one), a space is assumed to be the separator.  Note that sequential separators are lumped when the separator is left out.</p>

<p><code>.count(item)</code>: This counts the instances of <code>item</code> in the list its applied to.  Note that this is not the most efficient way to count things (gotta go regex if you about speed)</p>

<p><strong>The scary lambda function:</strong></p>

<p>lambda functions are not easy to explain or understand.  Its taken me quite a while to get a grip on what they are and when they're useful.  <a href="http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/lambda_tutorial/" rel="nofollow">I found this tutorial</a> to be rather helpful.  </p>

<p>My best attempt at a tl;dr is lambda functions are small, anonymous functions that can be used for convenience.  I know this is, at best, incomplete, but I think it should suffice for the scope of this question</p>
