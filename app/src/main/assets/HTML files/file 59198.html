<p>When creating your SqlBulkCopy instance, you're passing the connection string <code>externalConnectionString</code> and thus opening a new connection. That may be causing a deadlock issue with both connections trying to modify the same table.</p>

<p>Have you tried passing your existing connection <code>externalConnection</code> to the SqlBulkCopy constructor instead of the connection string?</p>
