<p>Well it seems that its a combination of problems. But I found solution.</p>

<p>Using the AgentString = <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.153.1 Safari/525.19</code></p>

<p>Most of the sites I needed worked. BBC IPlayer which seems to do some more checks returns an incompatible device. So I did a bit of a dirty hack for this site.</p>

<p><code>
if(url.contains("bbc.co.uk")){
  view.getSettings().setUserAgentString("Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 3.0.1; en-gb; MZ601 Build/H.6.1-38-1)  AppleWebKit/534.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/534.13");
}else{
  view.getSettings().setUserAgentString("Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.153.1 Safari/525.19");
}
view.loadUrl(url);</code></p>

<p>This worked for me, if anyone could shed more light on how some sites detect device that would be great as it seems to be more than <code>User-Agent</code>.</p>
