<p>Have you tried <code>ng-show="permission === true;"</code>? <code>ng-show</code>, to my understanding, is meant to evaluate whatever is inside the quotes. this would just explicitly state the evaluation. I've had experiences where just having a variable inside the quotes isn't an evaluation that <code>ng-show</code> recognizes for some odd reason.</p>
