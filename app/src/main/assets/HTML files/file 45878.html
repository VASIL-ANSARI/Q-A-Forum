<p>I don't know the exact reason for why it is not working but I would say if the clickonce can be deployed on a third party machine and on this same machine it is working with the clickonce generated from your machine and not working with the clickonce generated from another developer machine you have done the hardest part.</p>

<p>You need to track down the differences between your two developer machines. Good candidates are registry or certificate store.</p>

<p>So for me you have those options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test with other machines (generation and deploy) to see if it is working</li>
<li>Check if .csproj settings for clickonce are exactly the same</li>
<li>Try to install the certificate in your local store and then use
"Select from Store"</li>
<li>Check if the certificate chain is correct (root certificate installed, certificate installed in correct group, ..)</li>
<li>compare the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/171780" rel="nofollow">registries</a> on both dev machines (might be hard though if they are quite different)</li>
<li>compare the generated clickonce files with a file comparer especially the .manifest file (I already have tracked down errors this way)</li>
</ul>
