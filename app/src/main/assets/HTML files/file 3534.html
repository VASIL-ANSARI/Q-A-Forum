<p>Would be more interesting to see the code that actually could produce the error in your subject. PRINT is unlikely to generate such error.</p>

<p>Why are you using a PRINT in a trigger instead of a RAISERROR? What are you trying to achieve? </p>

<p>Btw, the reason why you don't get an error when you move the PRINT after the GO is that it is then no longer in the trigger definition</p>
