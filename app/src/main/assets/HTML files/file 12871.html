<p>From your description it appears that <code>PIL.resize()</code> is the dominant operation. That function is written in C and not in Python. Therefore, I doubt you can expect PyPy to make much of a difference to your script.</p>

<p>If you're looking to speed things up, you could consider parallelizing the loading and resizing of the image across multiple cores. I don't generally recommend using threads in Python, normally suggesting the <code>multiprocessing</code> module instead. However, for this particular task multiple threads might actually be a better fit.</p>
