<p>Ah, I got it. Spent a day looking for an answer, then, after asking the question, needed about 30 minutes to figure it out.</p>

<p>The answer is: <code>Types#memberType</code>:</p>

<pre><code>getTypes().memberType(
  classDecl.sym.type,                // this is the extending JCClassDecl
  varDecl.vartype.type.tsym          // this is the parameter JCVarDecl
)
</code></pre>

<p>Seeing as <code>javac</code> API is rather hard to grasp, I hope this will help someone.</p>
