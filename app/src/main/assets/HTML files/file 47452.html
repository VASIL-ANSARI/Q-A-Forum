<p>You really want to read up on Python <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="nofollow">virtual environments</a>, which allow you to create a "local" Python tree into which you can install your own packages and such without requiring root access.</p>

<p>For example, assuming that you have the <code>virtualenv</code> command available (you may need to install this first; it's available as a package for most major distributions), you can create a new virtual environment like this:</p>

<pre><code>virtualenv --system-site-packages myenv
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>--system-site-packages</code> option will make any packages in your system site-packages directory visible to this environment, as well as anything you install locally.  Then activate the environment:</p>

<pre><code>. myenv/bin/activate
</code></pre>

<p>And install stuff:</p>

<pre><code>pip install apackage
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NB</strong> For no good reason, <code>pydoc</code> will stop working for you in this configuration.  You can just drop a new <code>pydoc</code> script into <code>myenv/bin/pydoc</code> that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import pydoc
if __name__ == '__main__':
    pydoc.cli()
</code></pre>
