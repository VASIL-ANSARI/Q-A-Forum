<p>It probably happens because your controller instantiated as child of <code>UINavigationController</code> in view hierarchy. The <code>UINavigationController</code> does not query child controllers if they want to be rotated or not.</p>

<p>I had the same issue; I wanted to disable autorotation, so all hierarchy of particular <code>UINavigationController</code> is locked in Portrait. I ended with this class:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation FixedOrientationNavigationController

- (BOOL)shouldAutorotate {
    return NO;
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>which I put instead of UINavigationControllr class in Storyboard for hierarchies which I need to lock Portrait. Just this, I do not need to implement <code>shouldAutorotate</code> in each controller.</p>

<p>You may also check this link: <a href="http://grokin.gs/blog/2012/11/16/orientationrespectfulnavigationcontroller/" rel="nofollow">Orientation Respectful UINavigationController</a>, it tries to implement "orientation respectful" UINavigationController.
It works, but in some cases it leads to weird results, for example, when user rotate to Landscape and then go back to the controller which should only support Portrait.</p>
