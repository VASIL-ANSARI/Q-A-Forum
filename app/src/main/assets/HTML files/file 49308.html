<p>It seems like the digest cycle is stuck in a loop. Angular has a digest cycle where they watch models (whatever is on $scope) and apply changes to the views if the models change. If in a digest cycle you're executing some function that changes a value again, you're triggering another digest cycle which triggers that same function again, changes a value on the model and triggers an infinite loop of digest cycles.</p>

<p>That said, you might want to add the code for your customMarker directive for answers to be more precise.</p>
