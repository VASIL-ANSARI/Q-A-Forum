<p>RoboVM definitely supports the 4 inch screen. You just have to tell iOS that your app supports the larger screen. The way to do this is to provide a launch screen with the right name and dimensions. Put an image named <code>Default-568h@2x.png</code> with dimensions 640x1136 pixels in your <code>resources/</code> folder in your RoboVM project and iOS will let your app use the full screen.</p>
