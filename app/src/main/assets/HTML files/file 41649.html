<p>Per the <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-static-content" rel="nofollow">user guide</a>: if the resource is static you could try putting static content in one of the standard locations (e.g. <code>classpath:static/</code> or <code>classpath:public/</code>).</p>

<p>If you need it to be a template (not sure thymeleaf can handle that easily) then you would have to change the view resolver configuration, but my guess is that's not the problem.</p>
