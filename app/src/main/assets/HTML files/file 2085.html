<p>Yesterday Facebook was having issues with their API that may have prevented some queries from working. Try it again today and it might work.</p>

<p>Here is facebook's api status page where they report any ongoing issues with the API:

<p>If it's still not working for you then it's likely the fix that they deployed for yesterday's issue had a bug in it. Here is a similar bug that occured a while ago that sounds just like this one: <a href="http://bugs.developers.facebook.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1359" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.developers.facebook.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1359</a>. You should open a new bug on the facebook bug tracker if that's the case since that one is old and has already been closed.</p>
