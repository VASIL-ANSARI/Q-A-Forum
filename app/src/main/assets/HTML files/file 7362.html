<p>One option would be to drop the last comment off of the page at the same time that you're adding the new one to the top.  If you used some jQuery effects, you could make it look like the bottom comment was dropping off the page at the same time that the top comment was being added.  </p>

<p>That way when the user sees the old 10th comment at the top of page two, it will seem logical.</p>

<p>I agree with polarblau that this is better handled in the view.  To handle it in the controller you'd need to figure out a way to offset the finder by +1 which seems like it would be a LOT more effort.</p>
