<p>I didn't notice that the dispatch isn't completely executing. You're touching the button before the thread completes executing. Further, I don't think the data is being called correctly. There should be seperate calls for setting the data <em>then</em> reload the table. Alternatively you could start setting the table data right when you segue so when the user gets to the VC everything is prepared. However, I'm leaning towards this being a dispatch issue.</p>
