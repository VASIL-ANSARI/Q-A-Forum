<p>Grouping by <code>user</code>, <code>category</code> and <code>bank</code> and then applying the <code>SUM()</code> aggregate on cash should do the trick?</p>

<p><strong>Query</strong></p>

<pre><code> SELECT user AS user_gr, 
        category AS category_gr, 
        bank AS bank_gr, 
        SUM(cash) AS  cash_gr
   FROM test
GROUP BY user, category, bank;
</code></pre>
