<p>One image view is one image view.</p>

<p>If you want more than one, declare more than one.</p>

<p>If you have many similar image views, consider creating one array of many image views instead of a separate property for each one. </p>

<p>If you have all of the image views in a storyboard or .xib file, you can use an <em>outlet collection</em> instead of an outlet to store them. </p>
