<p>This kind of visit is called <strong>Breadth-first</strong> or <strong>Level Order</strong>. You can see additional infos <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_traversal" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Basically you</p>

<ul>
<li>first visit the current node</li>
<li>then all the children of that node</li>
<li>then all the children of every children and so on</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be achieved easily with a FIFO structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>push the root</li>
<li>until queue is empty</li>
<li>take first element, visit it, and push all its children to the end of the queue</li>
<li>repeat</li>
</ul>
