<p>You could try:</p>

<pre><code>if(preg_match('/^'.preg_quote($stringA).'.*/', $stringB){ do some stuff }
</code></pre>

<p>This will check if B starts with A regardless of string sizes.</p>

<p>EDIT: A good point was brought up. If you want to use preg_match on a string that may have regex special characters in it, use preg_quote($string) to make sure those are escaped before using the string in the regex.</p>
