  <p>XAML provides a more succinct and elegant definition of the user
  interface, and has a visual structure that better mimics the tree
  organisation of the visual elements on the page. XAML is also
  generally easier to maintain and modify than equivalent code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A declarative UI(XAML) is a better approach than doing the UI by code,
  for the following reasons:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>it's coincise, it's impersonal
   except few things, XAML looks the same for everyone. you can't say the same thing about code-behind C# coding</p></li>
  <li><p>it's more maintainable</p>
  
  <p>much more easier to read and modify than code</p></li>
  <li><p>it helps with a clear separation of concerns, between the UI and logic</p></li>
  <li><p>tooling friendly; unfortunately Xamarin Forms today still doesn't have a designer, but this is supposed to change</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I am NOT saying XAML is perfect. C# code is also good.</p>
