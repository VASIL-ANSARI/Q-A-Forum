<p>So it works for the first login/password, but not the second ? </p>

<p>Have you checked your textfile ? 
Isn't the problem related to the dot beside "Chezzy" (in you post!) ? </p>

<p>Try to add "Console.WriteLine" or use debugger to fix your code and see what happens it the loop.</p>

<p>Also, I think the inner " sr.ReadLine();" in the loop may cause unexpected "shifting" according to the textfile content, use it carefully...</p>
