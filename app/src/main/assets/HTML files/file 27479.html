<p>You can use the following SlickGrid methods:</p>

<pre><code>grid.setActiveCell(0,0);  // right before the for loop
</code></pre>

<p>Then inside your for loop, right at the top:</p>

<pre><code>grid.navigateRight();
</code></pre>

<p>That should bring each column into view as needed. But you should be aware that SlickGrid only renders visible columns and rows (plus some buffer) so it's not wise to trust DOM selectors for testing. Especially since SlickGrid will also reuse existing elements and simply replace the inner text when scrolling/paginating vertically and horizontally.</p>
