<p>Two possibilities.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The connect() call is in the middle of timing out, which takes around a minute depending on the platform. That basically means the target is inaccessible. You might want to review why that is. If you're not in control of what targets this code will connect to, you should put the channel into non-blocking mode, first, then connect, then register the channel for OP_CONNECT. If you go down this path, there is more to it, which I will add if requested.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a Selector running in a different thread, and it is presently blocked in select (), which will block you from calling register(). The solution in this case is to wakeup the selector before calling register(), and make sure the selector thread copes correctly with a zero return from select().</p></li>
