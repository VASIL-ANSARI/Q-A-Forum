<p>Truth is you cannot, however you can get the document of the JTextArea and then add a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/documentlistener.html" rel="nofollow">DocumentListener</a> to that:</p>

<pre><code>JTextArea text=new JTextArea(10,30);
text.getDocument().addDocumentListener(new DocumentListener() {
   @Override
   public void insertUpdate(DocumentEvent arg0) {
   // Handle text entry - just get the text when a newline character is found at the end of the text
   }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Basically what this does is it fires upon entry of any text in the JTextArea that you have created and thus you can check if the text that has been entered ends with a newline character, which will be the equivalent of the user inserting a command and hitting the Enter button. Then you can grab the text between this newline and the previous one (or the text you have in the text area, if it is only a single line so far) and use it the way you want.</p>
