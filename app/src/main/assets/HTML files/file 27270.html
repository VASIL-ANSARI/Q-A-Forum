<p>You're on the right track using model callbacks, however models don't have access to the <code>param</code> hash - its available to controllers.</p>

<p>The model already knows the value of it's own attributes, so you don't need to get them from params.  The controller I imagine is updating <code>feed_me</code>.</p>

<p>Also you shouldn't need to declare <code>feed_me</code> as an <code>attr_accessor</code> assuming it is backed by a database column.</p>

<p>You can change <code>before_save</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>def feed
  if self.feed_me
    self.hungry = false
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In your controller, I imagine you'd do something like:</p>

<pre><code>def update
  pet = Pet.find(params[:id])
  pet.feed_me = params[:feed_me]

  if pet.save
    redirect_to pet_path(pet)
  else
    flash[:notice] = 'Error saving pet'
    render :edit
  end
end
</code></pre>
