<blockquote>
  <p>The new Job(..) object will be stored at heap</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that all members of class <code>Job</code> will be stored there, so to answer your question, on the heap.</p>

<p>Note that the standard doesn't ever talk about the "heap", the appropriate term is the "free-store".</p>
