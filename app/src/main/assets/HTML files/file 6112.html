<p>I created this and made it forward a confirmation message to my email. From there I got the link, clicked it and it worked just perfectly!</p>

<pre><code>class LogSenderHandler(InboundMailHandler):
    def receive(self, mail_message):
        logging.info("Received a message from: " + mail_message.sender)
        sender_address = "sender@email.com"
        subject = "Processing message"
        user_address = 'my@email.com
        body = mail_message.original
        mail.send_mail(sender_address, user_address, subject, body)
</code></pre>
