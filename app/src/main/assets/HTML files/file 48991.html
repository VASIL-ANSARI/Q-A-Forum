<p>The issue has sorted itself out though I would like to post here what happened and all other scenarios I've encountered.</p>

<ol>
<li>After an app is published, the app's version on the web-play-store would be different then on the device and would be different between different devices.
This would sort itself out sometime between 20h-30h after the publish was approved. </li>
<li>Another reason for version inconsistency could be minSdkVersion, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26694108/what-is-the-difference-between-compilesdkversion-and-targetsdkversion">compileSdkVersion &amp; targetSdkVersion</a> which determins min &amp; max supported API version which translated to supported Android Versions. If you launched an app with minSdkVersion=16 and targetSdkVersion=compileSdkVersion=22 then it would not supported android 4.0.x (API ver 15, <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html" rel="nofollow">see reference</a>). Then if you publish an update but change targetSdkVersion=compileSdkVersion=21 then most devices would be updated and you'd see the expected version though you didn't support API Level 22 (Android 5.1) so from devices with that Android Version you'd see the older version on the Play Store.</li>
<li>Last thing to notice is 'Supported devices', under 'APK' on 'Google Play Console'. If a device was supported and a version update did not support it, you might see the older version on the store. i.e. Tablet support.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
