<p>When you have a mixed list and want to access members defined for the derived types, you have to cast to the derived type. </p>

<pre><code>((Circle)list[index]).Radius = 10; // alternately use is or as if you're unsure
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, by the virtue of simply <em>having</em> a mixed list, you're saying that you generally do not care about the differences between the derived types, you're content with using the base polymorphically. If you find yourself in a different position, you should perhaps rethink your strategy for storing or consuming these elements.</p>
