<p>The resource classes are request scoped by default, meaning a new one created for each request. In your case, since you want the db to persist, you need only a single instance for the entire application. If you register the resource class as an <em>instance</em>, that will make it a singleton. Or depending on what implementation you are using, you might be able to just annotate it with <code>@Singleton</code>.</p>
