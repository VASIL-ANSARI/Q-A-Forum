<p>As you can see by the <a href="https://github.com/jackdempsey/acts_as_commentable" rel="nofollow">acts_as_commentable</a> documentation,</p>

<p>Also make sure you have the migrations to create the database structure.</p>

<p>In your model:</p>

<pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_commentable
end
</code></pre>

<p>By your comment I see you are giving the first steps on Rails. You need to create the controller and views. In you controller you'll need to initialize the variables and call the respecting view.
My best advise for you, is before starting doing your own blog, take a look at <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book" rel="nofollow">this Rails tutorial</a>, which will cover most of the aspects you'll need.</p>
