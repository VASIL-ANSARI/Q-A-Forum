<p>One solution is to have the caller be responsible for calling <code>pack</code> or <code>grid</code> on the individual widgets. This requires that you save references to the widgets somehow, such as attributes of the object.  You do this already for some widgets, but not for others. You need to be consistent.</p>

<p>Do this by moving the calls to <code>pack()</code> from the functions and into your <code>__init__</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, master=None):
    Frame.__init__(self, master)
    self.pack()
    self.createWidgets()
    self.createAnotherWidget()

    self.QUIT.pack(...)
    self.hi_there.pack(...)
    self.title_label.pack(...)
    self.title_entry.pack(...)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you'll need to modify <code>createAnotherWidget</code> to save references to the widgets.</p>

<p>The point being, <em>creating</em> widgets and <em>laying out widgets on the screen</em> are two separate problems that should be solved separately. </p>

<hr>

<p>That being said, it's a bit unusual to have functions that create multiple widgets that are designed to be stitched together by some other function. </p>

<p>A more common pattern is for functions to create widgets that are related, and to manage the layout of the related widgets itself. That way the caller only has to worry about organizing the groups of widgets rather than a bunch of individual widgets.</p>

<p>For example, you might have one function that creates a toolbar. Another that creates the main area with scrollbars. Another function would create a footer. Another that creates a form with a bunch of label and entry widgets. Another one that creates a label/entry combination. And so on.</p>
