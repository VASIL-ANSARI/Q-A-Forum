<p><strong>No.</strong> </p>

<p><code>wget</code> is used for downloading the remote location as-is and does not act as a web browser, which parses the contained JavaScript.</p>

<p>Note that <code>wget</code> <em>does</em> follow header redirects (such as 301, for example).</p>

<p>I tried using <code>lynx -source</code> but sadly, this will result in a non-parsed web page as well. An <strong>alternative solution</strong> to this problem would be to write a script that downloads the page, then parses it and downloads possible references automatically, but I'll leave that up to you.</p>
