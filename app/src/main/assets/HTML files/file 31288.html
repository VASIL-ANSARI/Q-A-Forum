<p>Try following: </p>

<pre><code>if (temp.startsWith("#")){
  String[] splitted = temp.split("=");
  output += splitted[1] + "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation:
To process lines only starting with desired character use <code>String#startsWith</code> method. When you have string to extract values from, <code>String#split</code> will split given text with character you give as method argument. So in your case, text before <code>=</code> character will be in array at position <code>0</code>, text you want to print will be at position <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Also note, that if your file contains many lines starting with <code>#</code>, it should be wise not to concatenate strings together, but use <code>StringBuilder / StringBuffer</code> to add strings together.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
