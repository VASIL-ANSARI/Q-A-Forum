<p>In my experience it is far easier to just add an extra field to the users table called "status" which can be an enum with ("approved", "unapproved")</p>

<p>EDIT: Attempt at making it understandable:</p>

<p>First you have a table, which in essence will resemble this:</p>

<pre><code>+--+--------+--------+----------+
|id|username|password|status    |
+-------------------------------+
| 1|dennis  |ezpwlol |unapproved|
+-------------------------------+
| 2|otherguy|hardpw! |approved  |
+--+--------+--------+----------+
</code></pre>

<p>Then you will want to find out what users are unapproved, so you run a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users where status = 'unapproved';
</code></pre>

<p>The result from the above example will be:</p>

<pre><code>+--+--------+--------+----------+
|id|username|password|status    |
+-------------------------------+
| 1|dennis  |ezpwlol |unapproved|
+-------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Using PHP you can loop the result into a list with usernames and a button:</p>

<p>Dennis [ACCEPT] &lt;&lt;-- Button will lead to page or route and will pass the id of the user to accept.</p>

<p>On that page or route you will run an update query for that user:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE users SET status = 'approved' WHERE id = {THE ID PASSED TO THE PAGE};  
</code></pre>

<p>Now that user will have it's status set to approved, and thus not appear anymore in your unapproved list.</p>
