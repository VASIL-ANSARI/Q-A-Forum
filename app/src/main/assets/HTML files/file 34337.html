<p>Hmm... You could try another filter here - I would probably try <code>FILTER_VALIDATE_REGEXP</code>. Maybe something like:</p>

<pre><code>$mins = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'hour', FILTER_VALIDATE_REGEXP, ['options' =&gt; [
    'regexp' =&gt; '/\d{1,2}/']
]);
</code></pre>

<p>Just adding the regex <code>\d{1,2}</code> as an example here, clearly you might want to define something better here. Alternatively you could use <code>FILTER_CALLBACK</code> and define a callback inside which you can check if your value is an <code>int</code> and explicitly within your required numeric range.</p>
