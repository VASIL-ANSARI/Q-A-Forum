<p>The <code>combined</code> indicates a collection of bootstrap components merged into one file. The <code>min</code> indicates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)" rel="nofollow">minified file</a>, meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Minification (also minimisation or minimization), in computer
  programming languages and especially JavaScript, is the process of
  removing all unnecessary characters from source code without changing
  its functionality. These unnecessary characters usually include white
  space characters, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block
  delimiters, which are used to add readability to the code but are not
  required for it to execute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The minified combined version is most preferable for production deployment, as it minimizes the number of requests and bandwidth used, thus improving page load speed. During development you <strong>may</strong> find a use for non-minified non-combined files for debugging purposes, but that's unlikely. In general, the combined-min version is just fine.</p>
