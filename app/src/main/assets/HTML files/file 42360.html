<p>i think you could remove your log4j.properties out of the Util.war because it is application depended. instead you could use the ProjA.ear/APP-INF/classes and ProjB/APP-INF/classes folder for this.</p>

<p>see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12191794/what-difference-between-app-inf-and-web-inf-folders-in-javaee-applications">What difference between app-inf and web-inf folders in JavaEE applications?</a></p>

<p>Your Application Server is adding this folder automatically to the Class-Path. But be aware of parent first / child first class loading </p>

<p>see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18210389/java-ee-and-java-se-classloading/18210710#18210710">Java EE and Java SE classloading</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, In Java EE, a classloader first tries to load the class itself and then delegate the classloading of that class to its parent classloader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is depending on your Application Server.</p>
