<p>Probably, the only way to achieve what you want is to take the original element and reopen it. But passing it to 2nd popup's <code>close</code> callback won't give you anything, since it will never be called. <code>MagnificPopup</code> will not fire <code>open</code> event if popup is already opened, because there is actually only one instance of <code>Magnific Popup Object</code>. What you can do is to check if <code>currItem</code> is equal to 1st popup's item.</p>

<pre><code>var childOpened,
    parentItem,
    $parent = $('.ajax-popup-link');
$parent.magnificPopup({
    type: 'ajax',
    callbacks: {
        open: function () {
            // triggered only when 1st popup opens
            // save 1st popup's item
            parentItem = this.currItem;
            // will not register new callbacks even if we pass them
            $('.image-link').magnificPopup();
        },
        close: function () {
            // will be called twice, since we opened popup twice
            // do not move to `afterClose`. `currItem` is not available there
            childOpened = (this.currItem !== parentItem);
        },
        afterClose: function () {
            if (childOpened) {
                // should be in `afterClose` to avoid conflicts
                // with previous popup opening
                $parent.magnificPopup('open');
            }
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>
