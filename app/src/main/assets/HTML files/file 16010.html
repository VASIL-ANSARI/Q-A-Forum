<p>Profile your code, but you are probably doing too much IO. Make your <code>buffer</code> larger, it doesn't have to be the same size as the cipher block size. As for the actual encryption speed, it depends mostly on the CPU, so you can't really change that. You could try to use native code (OpenSSL, etc.) and see if that makes a difference. </p>
