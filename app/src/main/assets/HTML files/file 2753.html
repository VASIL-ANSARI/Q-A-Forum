<p>XML doesn't do Magic<br>
you can use XML or plain text <br>
to do that think what you whould have done working with files.<br>
you would use jave to write the data to a file <br>
then you can use c++ to read this file. <br></p>

<p>well the same is with socket <br>
XML isn't special. plain text can do the work <br>
XML only add structure<br></p>

<p>i wouldn't suggested to implement serialization by yourself for heavy tasks</p>

<p>you may consider using JNI/JNA
a better way is to use corba but that may be an overkill</p>
