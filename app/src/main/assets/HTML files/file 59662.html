<p>Reading through the documentation, there doesnt seem to be a current fix for real time. What is possible is reducing the batch time in the .bat file (Currently at 300 s ).</p>

<pre><code>  :loop
   start directory\screenshotwithemail.py   
   timeout /t 300 #Change this value
   goto loop
</code></pre>

<p>This might  make it computationally expensive, but make it close to real time.</p>
