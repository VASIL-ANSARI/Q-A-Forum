<p>I think what you're trying to ask here is how you can send the <code>textblock1.Text</code> (for example) value to the code behind.</p>

<p>By the looks of it, you're using Data Binding to bind the data, but you also have a <code>Button_Click</code> event. </p>

<p>Generally I use one or the other (unless i'm doing something complex), if you simply want to get the <code>Text</code> value form the <code>TextBlock</code>, then you can either do:</p>

<p><code>&lt;TextBlock Name="textBlockName" Text="{Binding ShortName}" Mode="TwoWay"&gt;</code></p>

<p>The <code>Mode="TwoWay" ensures that the value of the Text Block gets sent to and from the code-behind object, in this case called</code>ShortName<code>and to the</code>TextBlock.Text`.</p>

<p>The other method is to simply create a Button click event which you already seem to have. In the Button Click event, simply do the following:</p>

<p><code>string myString = textBlock1.Text;</code></p>

<p>As you can guess, that simply gets the string value that's within the <code>Text</code> property of the <code>textBlock</code> and puts it inside the <code>myString</code> object.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> - as an important note, you should try to elaborate as much as possible to ensure that people who are viewing your question understand and can help you.</p>
