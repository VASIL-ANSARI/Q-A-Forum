<p>Everytime a python file is executed the globals() dictionary is reset by the interpreter. So if you will try to do something like </p>

<pre><code>print globals().keys()
</code></pre>

<p>you can see that 'data' is not in globals. This dictionary gets updated as the program runs. So I don't think you can refer to the globals() of the IPython in the program.</p>

<p>check this <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/faq/programming.html#how-can-i-have-modules-that-mutually-import-each-other" rel="nofollow">link</a> ,according to it, globals are emptied.</p>
