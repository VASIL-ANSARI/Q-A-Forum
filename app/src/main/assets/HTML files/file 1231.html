<p>You have two options:</p>

<p>If you know that the super class belongs to a limited set, you can just call instanceof or use the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr139/java/lang/Class.html#isInstance%28java.lang.Object%29" rel="nofollow">Class.isInstance()</a> method.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can have a preprocessor to run on you code and create a data structure that is saved separately which holds your classes information. Probably even a custom <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/doclet/overview.html" rel="nofollow">doclet</a> can do it. The output can be a text or binary file that describes the structure:</p>

<pre><code> ClassA:SuperClass
 ClassB:AnotherSuperClass
 etc.
</code></pre>

<p>Notice you may have problem with the obfuscation in this way.</p>
