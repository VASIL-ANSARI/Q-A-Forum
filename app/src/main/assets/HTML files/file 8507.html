<p>Since I don't know the answer, I would do the following to figure out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install SysInternals <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645" rel="nofollow">Process Monitor</a> (<a href="http://live.sysinternals.com/procmon.exe" rel="nofollow">Direct download</a>).</li>
<li>Start Process Monitor, set the filter <code>Path</code> to your application's name.</li>
<li>Start your application.</li>
<li>Watch the locations inside Process Monitor.</li>
</ol>

<p>This helped me often in the past, maybe it could be something for you, too?</p>
