<p>Metaio is a fairly easy to use AR SDK available for both Android and iPhone that has 3D tracking capabilities:</p>

<p>The non-watermarked version that supports 3D tracking, however, is expensive. A free alternative (currently) is to use the Junaio browser that Metaio makes to provide a 3D tracking AR experience:</p>

<p>I have experience with both of them but I have not used the 3D tracking features yet so I am not sure if you could track an actual building, but from the demos things such as boxes and similar objects appear to be supported well.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
