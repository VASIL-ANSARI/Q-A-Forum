<p>According to the standard the move-from object will still be valid although its state is not guaranteed, so it seems that moving from <code>*this</code> would be perfectly valid. Whether it's confusing to users of your code is another question entirely.</p>

<p>All that said it sounds like your <em>real</em> intention is to link the destruction of the marshallar with the extraction of the data. Did you consider doing all the marshalling within a single expression and letting a temporary take care of things for you?</p>

<pre><code>class Marshaller
{
  public:
    Marshaller&amp; operator()(input_data data) { marshall(data); return *this; }
    DataType operator()() { return std::move(data_); }
  private:
    DataType data_;
}

DataType my_result = Marshaller()(data1)(data2)(data3)();
</code></pre>
