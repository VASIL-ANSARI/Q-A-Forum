<p>This "code" not can be compiled, because it still aren't a complete code. </p>

<p>This way you can write a test code, and you only will need add the headers files. For example: 
g++ -o bin/testVector src/testVector.cpp -I include/ 
And the program works without compiling anything else! The only detail is that headers files and cpp files must be in /include folder,  "VectorT.tpp" and VectorT.h, the headers and the implementation of templates.</p>
