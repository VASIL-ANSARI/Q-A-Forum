<p><code>getCities</code> is defined as an instance method, but you are calling it as a class method.</p>

<p>Either create an instance with something like <code>instance = Transpo::FT.new</code>, or change the definition of <code>getCities</code> to be <code>def self.getCities</code> to make it into a class method.</p>
