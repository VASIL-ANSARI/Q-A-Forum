<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>

<p>You are right about this. If you override the getter and setter then you need to @synthesize the property. I'll have to have a further look for why though.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you could just have the first method. However, the second method is there as a convenience and would normally contain code something like this...</p>

<pre><code>- (void)addCard:(Card *)card
{
    [self addCard:card atTop:YES];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the designated method would do something like...</p>

<pre><code>- (void)addCard:(Card *)card atTop:(BOOL)atTop
{
    if (atTop) {
        // something to add card to top.
    } else {
        // something to add card at bottom.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. it just routes the method call to the "designated" method but uses a default value for the BOOL.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong></p>

<p>The .h file is there as an interface file. It would be similar to a set of web services on a server. The class can do all sorts of stuff internally but it only needs to declare stuff in the .h interface file if something needs to access them externally.</p>

<p>For instance, you might have a class called <code>Car</code>. It might have a button called <code>accelerator</code> that would access an internal method and increase the speed. None of this needs to be exposed to external classes.</p>

<p>However, the same car might have a property called <code>colour</code> or a method called <code>addFuel</code>. These would need to be available externally so the user can see the colour and add fuel. These both need to go in the .h file.</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense.</p>
