  <p>My question is, can I have a setter function in the above line of code
  where it would automatically set Comments and Posts for the Like type?</p>

<p>I assume you are using T4 template or the classes that were generated by EF are <code>partial</code>then you can extend it by creating another partial class and a <code>wrapper property</code> for <code>Likes</code></p>

<pre><code>// Backing field
private ICollection&lt;Like&gt; _likesWrapper;
public ICollection&lt;Like&gt; LikesWrapper { 
get { 
  // Lazy loading
 if(_likes == null)
 { 
   // Just create a new list or load it from the database.
   _likes = new List&lt;Like&gt;(); 
 }
 return _likes; 
 }
set { 
 foreach(var val in value)
 {
   //Set the comment and posts
 }
 Likes = value;
} 
</code></pre>
