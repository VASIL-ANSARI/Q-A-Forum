<p>You can not forward declare a protocol that you are implementing. You need to <code>#import</code> <code>ImageScrollView.h</code> rather than declare <code>@protocol ImageScrollViewDelegate</code>. The reason it works is because the method exists in your implementation when it is called at runtime, and the reason for the warnings is because the compiler does not know what methods are in the protocol at compile time.</p>
