<p>You can accomplish this with a nested Select:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT
        TICKETS.TICKETID AS TICKET_NO,
        RECEIPTS.DATENEW AS DATENEW,
        PAYMENTS.TOTAL AS MONEY,
        CUSTOMERS.NAME AS CUSTOMER,
        PAYMENTS.PAYMENT AS PAYMENT
    FROM RECEIPTS
        LEFT JOIN TICKETS ON RECEIPTS.ID = TICKETS.ID
        LEFT JOIN PAYMENTS ON RECEIPTS.ID = PAYMENTS.RECEIPT
        LEFT JOIN CUSTOMERS ON TICKETS.CUSTOMER = CUSTOMERS.ID
    WHERE ?(QBF_FILTER)
    UNION SELECT
        ADJUSTMENTS.TICKET_NO AS TICKET_NO,
        ADJUSTMENTS.DATE AS DATENEW,
        ADJUSTMENTS.ADJUSTMENT_AMOUNT AS MONEY,
        ADJUSTMENTS.CUSTOMER_NAME AS CUSTOMER,
        ADJUSTMENTS.ADJUSTMENT_TYPE AS PAYMENT
    FROM ADJUSTMENTS
        LEFT JOIN CUSTOMERS ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ADJUSTMENTS.CUSTOMER_ID
        WHERE ?(QBF_FILTER)
    )
WHERE (yourDate between Date1 and Date2)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I guess it needs to be more like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT
        TICKETS.TICKETID AS TICKET_NO_REC,
        RECEIPTS.DATENEW AS DATENEW_REC,
        PAYMENTS.TOTAL AS MONEY_REC,
        CUSTOMERS.NAME AS CUSTOMER_REC,
        PAYMENTS.PAYMENT AS PAYMENT_REC
    FROM RECEIPTS
        LEFT JOIN TICKETS ON RECEIPTS.ID = TICKETS.ID
        LEFT JOIN PAYMENTS ON RECEIPTS.ID = PAYMENTS.RECEIPT
        LEFT JOIN CUSTOMERS ON TICKETS.CUSTOMER = CUSTOMERS.ID
    UNION SELECT
        ADJUSTMENTS.TICKET_NO AS TICKET_NO_ADJ,
        ADJUSTMENTS.DATE AS DATENEW_ADJ,
        ADJUSTMENTS.ADJUSTMENT_AMOUNT AS MONEY_ADJ,
        ADJUSTMENTS.CUSTOMER_NAME AS CUSTOMER_ADJ,
        ADJUSTMENTS.ADJUSTMENT_TYPE AS PAYMENT_ADJ
    FROM ADJUSTMENTS
        LEFT JOIN CUSTOMERS ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ADJUSTMENTS.CUSTOMER_ID
    )
WHERE ?(QBF_FILTER)
</code></pre>
