<p>You can write to the rails log with anything you like at any time you like within your own code. Details here:
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#the-logger" rel="nofollow">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#the-logger</a></p>

<p>eg you could put in the current set of data you've pulled out using the params, if that's what you want to log.</p>

<p>However, you can't print the response to the log until you have one... and AFAIK you only get one at the end of the process of rendering the response... no idea how you'd get access to some kind of partial response to print.</p>

<p>But perhaps your intent is based around an error somewhere... and you actually want to figure out where you are getting the error? If so... you can do that by logging along the way (including putting log statements into your views) and seeing where you get up to before the error occurs.</p>
