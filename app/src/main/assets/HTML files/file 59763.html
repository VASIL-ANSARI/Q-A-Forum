<p>I got the same issue with focus of UITabbarController before and I found the solution in Apple Support</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because UIViewController conforms to UIFocusEnvironment, custom view
  controllers in your app can override UIFocusEnvironment delegate
  methods to achieve custom focus behaviors. Custom view controllers
  can:</p>
  
  <p>Override the preferredFocusedView to specify where focus should start
  by default. Override shouldUpdateFocusInContext: to define where focus
  is allowed to move. Override
  didUpdateFocusInContext:withAnimationCoordinator: to respond to focus
  updates when they occur and update your appâs internal state. Your
  view controllers can also request that the focus engine reset focus to
  the current preferredFocusedView by callingsetNeedsFocusUpdate. Note
  that calling setNeedsFocusUpdate only has an effect if the view
  controller contains the currently focused view.</p>
