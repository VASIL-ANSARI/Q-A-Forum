<p>If you want to click the element Sendkeys sends keystrokes not mouse clicks. There is an attribute on a popup form called 'acceptbutton' on  which you can set to a button name and that button will be clicked when 'enter' is pressed.  Another attribute you might want to check is  'Enabled' on the button itself.  This is for visual studio forms applications.  I dont know what your doing with this driver stuff.</p>
