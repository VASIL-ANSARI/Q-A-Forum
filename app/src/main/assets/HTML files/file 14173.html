<p>UIAlertViewâs <code>-show</code> method creates its own window, overlaid on top of the appâs window, in which to display itself; as such, it isnât part of the appâs view hierarchy. To hide it, youâll need a reference to the alert view itself, maybe exposed as a property on your WebServiceObject.</p>
