<p>You should be using the ArrayList get method to access the element of an array.`       </p>

<pre><code>String name = items.get(0);          
String service = items.get(1);
</code></pre>

<p>It also looks like that you don't add anything to the ArrayLists in this code.</p>

<p>As for the second error, you are not allowed to write a double. Try converting the double to a String and then writing it.</p>

<pre><code>order.write(String.valueOf(baseTotal));
</code></pre>
