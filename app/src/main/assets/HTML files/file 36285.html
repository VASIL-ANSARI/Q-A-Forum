<p>You don't have a singleton you are creating one every two seconds.</p>

<p>I'd pass the context to the constructor, not the method:</p>

<pre><code>public class Wifi {

    private final WifiManager wifiManager;

    public Wifi(Context context){
        wifiManager = (WifiManager) context.getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE);
    }

    public void scanWifi(String APName, ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; accessPointMeanRSSArrayList, ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; accessPointRSSFrequencyArrayList) throws Exception {

        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; tempRSSArrayList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
        boolean AP_found = false;
</code></pre>

<p>Create from inside runnable like this:</p>

<pre><code>Wifi wifiObject = new Wifi(Activity.this);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Alternative:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class Wifi {

    private final WifiManager wifiManager;

    public Wifi(WifiManager wifiManager){
        this.wifiManager = wifiManager;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Create like this:</p>

<pre><code> Wifi wifiObject = new Wifi((WifiManager) getSystemService(Context.WIFI_SERVICE));
</code></pre>

<p>It's a matter or personal preference to an extent.</p>

<p>First option: <code>Context</code> is readily available in android. This method hides away the code you need to use to get to the wifi service making it simpler to remember how to use it.</p>

<p>The second option however has minimal dependencies (fewer <code>import</code> statements). If <code>context</code> was not so ubiquitous or I already had a reference to the wifi service ready to pass in I'd probably go for the second option. I'd also favour this option if there were multiple ways to get access to the <code>WifiManager</code>.</p>
