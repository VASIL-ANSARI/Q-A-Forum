<p>Most plausible reason is that some code has modified the underlying collection after you obtained your iterator.</p>

<p>Form <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" rel="nofollow">javadoc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iterators returned by this class's
  iterator and listIterator methods are
  fail-fast: if the list is structurally
  modified at any time after the
  iterator is created, in any way except
  through the iterator's own remove or
  add methods, the iterator will throw a
  ConcurrentModificationException. Thus,
  in the face of concurrent
  modification, the iterator fails
  quickly and cleanly, rather than
  risking arbitrary, non-deterministic
  behavior at an undetermined time in
  the future.</p>
