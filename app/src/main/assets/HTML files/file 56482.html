<p>Change <code>Goal_Difference</code> to this:</p>

<pre><code>        SUM(
      CASE
      WHEN t.TeamID = f.HomeTeamID THEN       
          CASE
          WHEN f.HomeScore IS NOT NULL THEN f.HomeScore - f.AwayScore
      -- Home Fixture
          END
      WHEN t.TeamID = f.AwayTeamID THEN 
          CASE
          WHEN f.AwayScore IS NOT NULL THEN f.AwayScore - f.HomeScore
      -- Away Fixture
          END
      END
    ) AS Goal_Difference
</code></pre>

<p>If you are summing before the <code>CASE</code> , you can't make it sum again in the <code>WHEN</code> , that becomes <code>sum(sum(..</code> which is not allowed. I assumed that's not what you intended, so I just removed the inner sum.</p>
