<p>You need to call <code>.ToList()</code> or <code>ToListAsync()</code> to get all the data at once otherwise it will get the data on the fly per record.</p>

<p>This is the problem with deferred execution VS immediate execution. When you don't materialize the list with <code>.Where(foo).ToList()</code> it loads each record whenever you try to access it therefore the 1000 DB calls.</p>

<p>edit: Please note that you are also using a navigational property that points to another object (my guess is that it's object mapped directly to a table ) so, when trying to get that object you also do additional DB calls. to avoid that do something like this :</p>

<pre><code>public partial class Company : IIdentifiable
    {
        public IEnumerable&lt;Employee&gt; ActiveEmployees
        {
            get
            {
               return Employees.Where(e =&gt; !e.User.AccountIsDisabled).Include(x=&gt;x.User).ToList();
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
