<p>It looks like you're trying to get all the links on one line in a way that looks nice. The easiest way to do that is with tables, or with modern browsers, the table display types. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>.menu { display: table-row; width: 100%; }
.menu &gt; div { display: table-cell; }
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to add an extra div around the menu with <code>display: table</code>.</p>

<p>This won't do exactly what the jQuery does; links with larger text will take up more space. This is arguably better behavior as long as the table stretching algorithm is working OK.</p>
