<p>Sphinx generates LaTeX files, and then uses LaTeX to generate the PDF. So yes, you can, but it typically involves learning LaTeX and changing the LaTeX macros. I did a quick search and couldn't find any place where the "Chapter" was defined, so it's probably defined in the Bjarne chapter heading style (which is the default), which means you need to find that definition and see of you can override it, or make a new definition.</p>

<p>LaTeX is <em>big</em>, so take a deep breath. But it's definitely possible. :)</p>
