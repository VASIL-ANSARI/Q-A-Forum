<p>There is no need to preserve the primary key position in the archiving table. Just make sure that when you copy to the archiving table you use INSERT <strong>IGNORE</strong> INTO... and you won't need to worry about duplicate entries into the archiving table. Then simply use a unique constraint on the column of the primary key in the archiving table. You should not have an auto-incrementing primary key on your archiving table.</p>
