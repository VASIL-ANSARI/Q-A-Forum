<p>I think this should do it:</p>

<pre><code>    SELECT          p1.EventID,
                    p1.PersonID,
                    p1.EventType,
                    p1.EventDate,
                    DATEDIFF(SECOND, p1.EventDate, p2.EventDate) AS SecondsDifference
    FROM            [Event] p1
    LEFT JOIN       [Event] p2  --Left join to self returning only closed door events
    ON              p2.PersonID = p1.PersonID
    AND             p2.EventType = 2 -- Closed Door
    AND             p1.EventID &lt; p2.EventID --We don't want to bring back events that happened before the next event
    WHERE           p2.EventID IS NOT NULL --We don't want to show any people that have not closed a door
</code></pre>
