<p>Having 2 databases is not a bad idea.  </p>

<p>I would approach this with the "foreign key" relationship between 2 tables concept.  When you insert all the contents from the  db1 record into db2, add a new "foreign key" field to db2 (db2_fkey) containing the "primary key" from the db1 record.  </p>

<p>This way you can read records on db2 and relate back to the record on db1 using db2_fkey.  You will be able to determine that the record has been cleared from db1.  Also you will be able to have more than 1 record on db2 with the same value in the db2_fkey field.  There's automatic processing in MySQL with a foreign key between 2 tables that you will have to code manually with this approach  (like deleting records from both tables).  But this relationship approach should answer your application questions.</p>
