<p>From the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/pricing" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Small datastore operations include calls to allocate datastore ids or
  keys-only queries, and these operations are free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, <code>get</code> operation is a regular read, not a small operation. Here is an example of a small operation:</p>

<pre><code>Query q = new Query("Photo").setKeysOnly();
</code></pre>

<p>When you run this query, it will result a bunch of small operations (depending on how many entities it finds).</p>
