<p>From your comment you have tried something else but I thought I would answer anyway.</p>

<p>As you found out the <code>nested set</code> model is superb at retrieving nodes and leafs fast and efficiently. However one <code>gotchya</code> is that you found that it is difficult to order the list after the insertion.</p>

<p>I have overcome this in the past by either a) ordering on the client side (difficult) and then caching or b) making sure I insert the node/leaf so it is automatically ordered (or even use up/down links so the admin  can order themselves AFTER the insert has happened.</p>

<p>I personally like option 2 and have never found it to be a problem.</p>
