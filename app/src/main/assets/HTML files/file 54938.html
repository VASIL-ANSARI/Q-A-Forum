<p>Azure Mobile Services does not return promises from table operations. You need to pass an options object that contains success and error callbacks, as described at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj554210.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj554210.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>I highly recommend that you take a look at the newer implementation of the product, Azure Mobile Apps - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-mobile-apps" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-mobile-apps</a>.
