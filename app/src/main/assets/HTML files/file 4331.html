<p>I suggest using the native <code>UIProgressView</code> for this.</p>

<p>To do that, use <code>UIWebViewDelegate</code> and implement <code>webViewDidStartLoad:</code> and <code>webViewDidFinishLoad:</code>.</p>

<p>I don't think it's possible to easily show an indicator about how much of resources have been loaded so far due to the fact that <code>UIWebView</code> is rather limited on iOS, you'd have to create some kind of smooth, timed animation.</p>

<p>If I was you, I'd go for <code>UIActivityIndicatorView</code> to display that "spinning circle" indicator while the page is loading.</p>
