<p>You may take a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.servercertificatevalidationcallback.aspx" rel="nofollow">ServerCertificateValidationCallback</a> property:</p>

<pre><code>ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = 
    (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) =&gt; true;
</code></pre>

<p>It represents a callback which is called by the runtime when it tries to validate an SSL certificate. By returning <code>true</code> you basically say that you don't care if the certificate is valid or not -> you always accept it. Of course having self signed certificates in production environment is not a good idea.</p>
