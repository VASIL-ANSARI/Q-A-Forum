<p>The <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/247257" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Support Page</a> explains exactly what you're trying to do. It is an outdated tutorial on "signcode.exe" which is similar but not equal to "signtool.exe".</p>

<p>If you want a simple solution, you may want to try signtool's wizard mode (execute <code>signtool signwizard</code>), e.g. explained <a href="https://www.ascertia.com/helpdesk/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=14" rel="nofollow">here</a>. But if command line execution is needed, check out the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa388170%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">examples on Microsoft's support page</a>.</p>
