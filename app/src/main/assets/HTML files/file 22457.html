<p>You can use Underscore.js <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#find" rel="nofollow">http://underscorejs.org/#find</a>
Looks through each value in the list, returning the first one that passes a truth test (iterator). The function returns as soon as it finds an acceptable element, and doesn't traverse the entire list.</p>

<pre><code>var even = _.find([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], function(num){ return num % 2 == 0; });
=&gt; 2
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can make the same with the array B elements and by code, make a join.</p>
