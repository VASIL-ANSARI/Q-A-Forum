<p>The first two (<code>'--'</code> and <code>'-'</code>) are linestyles not markers. Thats why they are rendered faster. </p>

<p>It doesn't make sense to plot ~400,000 markers. You wont be able to see all of them... However, what you could do is to only plot a subset of the points.
So add the line with all your data (even though you could probably also subsample that too) and then add a second "line" with only the markers.
for that you need an "x" vectors, which you can subsample too:</p>

<pre><code># define the number of markers you want
nrmarkers = 100

# define a x-vector
x = np.arange(len(series3))
# calculate the subsampling step size
subsample = int(len(series3) / nrmarkers)
# plot the line
plt.plot(x, series3, color='g', label='Label 3', lw=5)
# plot the markers (using every `subsample`-th data point)
plt.plot(x[::subsample], series3[::subsample], color='g', 
        lw=5, linestyle='', marker='*')

# similar procedure for series4 and series5
</code></pre>
