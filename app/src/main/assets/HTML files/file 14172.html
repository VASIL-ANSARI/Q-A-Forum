<p>COUNT is an aggregate function, so you can get all of the counts at once.  </p>

<p>I believe what you are looking for is </p>

<pre><code>$query = "SELECT category-id, COUNT(title) AS `total` FROM classifieds WHERE classified-id = 'category-cat' GROUP BY category-id";
$result = mysql_query($query);

while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){
  $num_items_in_category[$row['category-id']] = $row['total']; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you associative array with the count of records for each category-id</p>
