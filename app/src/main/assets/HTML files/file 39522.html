<p>First, I want to highlight that Identity Server supports for following two profiles.</p>

<ol>
<li>SAML2 SSO Web browser based profile. (SAML2 Assertions are used) More details from <a href="http://soasecurity.org/2014/04/30/open-source-saml2-sso-identity-provider/" rel="nofollow">here</a> </li>
<li>WS-Federation (Passive STS) profile. (SAML Assertion)</li>
</ol>

<p>Normally ASP.NET is by default supports for 2 profile.  Therefore you are integrating using Passive STS.  It seems to be, in your configuration, you have set the url to passive STS end point <code>https://localhost:9443/passivests</code>. If you are using SAML2 profile, Normally you need to set it to <code>https://localhost:9443/samlsso</code></p>

<p>Therefore the configuration that you have done in WSO2IS is not valid. They are related to SAML2 SSO profile. For passive STS you can find the configurations under  <code>WS-Federation (Passive) Configuration</code> </p>

<p>However there is a <a href="https://wso2.org/jira/browse/IDENTITY-2802" rel="nofollow">bug</a> in Passive STS that Identity Server does not add audience in to the SAML Assertion. </p>

<p>However, You can avoid the audience validation by setting web.config <code>&lt;audienceUris mode="Never" /&gt;</code></p>
