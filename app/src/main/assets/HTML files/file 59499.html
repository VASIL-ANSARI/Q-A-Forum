<p>You are using wrong resource in your xml. Probably you are trying to use color resource as a drawable (i.e. <code>@color/</code> instead of <code>@drawable/</code>.
If you can not reproduce it yourself, you can recheck your xml and replace any color usage with drawable one.
Also, it might be because you put your drawable in wrong folder (i.e. <code>drawable-v21</code> and trying to run application on API 19)
Thus, recheck your xml.</p>
