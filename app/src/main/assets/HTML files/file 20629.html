</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Added in API level 11</p>
  
  <p>Returns whether the device has an external storage device which is emulated. <strong><em>If true, the device does not have real external storage, and the directory returned by getExternalStorageDirectory() will be allocated using a portion of the internal storage system.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Certain system services, such as the package manager, use this to determine where to install an application.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emulated external storage may also be encrypted - see setStorageEncryption(android.content.ComponentName, boolean) for additional details.</p>
