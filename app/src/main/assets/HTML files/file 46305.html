<p>Bind all relevant UI States to some object (aka <code>ViewModel</code>) and serialize these states upon suspending.</p>

<p>The basic page template also includes methods like <code>SaveState</code> and <code>LoadState</code> including a serialized dictionary, where you can store those values.</p>

<p>Another option is to set the page's <code>NavigationCacheMode</code> to <code>Enabled</code> or <code>Required</code>. This will keep the page in memory until your app is terminated.</p>
