<p>I would suggest looking at <a href="http://mpxj.sf.net" rel="nofollow">MPXJ</a>. You could either use it on the server side as part of a Java or .Net application to process MPP files and pass back the contents to your mobile application, or you could use <a href="http://xmlvm.org" rel="nofollow">XMLVM</a> to convert the MPXJ libraries to C and use them directly on the device. RoboVM may also allow you to take a similar approach by converting MPXJ's Java bytecode into a native library... I haven't researched this in as much depth so I'm not sure of RoboVM's capabilities in this area.</p>
