<p>The API provides no facility to allow the calling app to pass any information to the document picker extension of the provider app. Furthermore, you can't explicitly specify which document picker (e.g. Dropbox/OneDrive/etc) you would like to open. So unfortunately, based on the published API docs and the Xcode betas so far, there is no way to do what you ask.</p>
