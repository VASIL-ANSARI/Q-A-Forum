<p>If your application has users in multiple time zones, you should always store your times in UTC (any timezone would work, but you should stick with the most common convention).</p>

<p>Let the user input in local time, but convert to UTC to store (and compare, and manipulate).  Then, convert back from UTC to display in each users' local time zone.</p>
