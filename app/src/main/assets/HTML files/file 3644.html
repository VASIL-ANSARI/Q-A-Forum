<p>Quoting the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc5.0/gc_tuning_5.html#0.0.0.%20Total%20Heap|outline" rel="nofollow">Total Heap Size</a> section of <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc5.0/gc_tuning_5.html" rel="nofollow">Tuning Garbage Collection with the 5.0 Java[tm] Virtual Machine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Total Heap</h3>
  
  <p>(...)</p>
  
  <p>By default, the virtual machine grows
  or shrinks the heap at each collection
  to try to keep the proportion of free
  space to live objects at each
  collection within a specific range.
  This target range is set as a
  percentage by the parameters
  <code>-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=&lt;minimum&gt;</code> and <code>-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=&lt;maximum&gt;</code>, and the total size is bounded below by
  <code>-Xms</code> and above by <code>-Xmx</code> . The default parameters for the 32-bit Solaris
  Operating System (SPARC Platform
  Edition) are shown in this table:</p>

<pre><code>-XX:MinHeapFreeRatio= 40
-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio= 70
-Xms          3670k
-Xmx          64m
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Default values of heap size parameters
  on 64-bit systems have been scaled up
  by approximately 30%. This increase is
  meant to compensate for the larger
  size of objects on a 64-bit system.</p>

<p>And in <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/gc/gc_tuning_6.html#par_gc.ergonomics.default_size" rel="nofollow">Default Heap Size</a> of <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/gc/gc_tuning_6.html" rel="nofollow">Java SE 6 HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning</a>, they write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Default Heap Size</h3>
  
  <p>If not otherwise set on the command line, the initial and maximum heap sizes are calculated based on the amount of memory on the machine. The proportion of memory to use for the heap is controlled by the command line options <code>DefaultInitialRAMFraction</code> and <code>DefaultMaxRAMFraction</code>, as shown in the table below. (In the table, memory represents the amount of memory on the machine.)</p>

<pre><code>                                             Formula  Default
initial heap size     memory / DefaultInitialRAMFraction          memory / 64
maximum heap size     MIN(memory / DefaultMaxRAMFraction, 1GB)    MIN(memory / 4, 1GB)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Note that the default maximum heap size will not exceed 1GB, regardless of how much memory is installed on the machine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yes, Java 6 has very different heap settings and the heap can grow to 1/4 of your RAM (or 1GB if you have more than 4GB) i.e. very likely much more than 64m nowadays.</p>
