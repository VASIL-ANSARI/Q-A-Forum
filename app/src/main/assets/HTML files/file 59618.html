<p>You cant get that variables since they are private.
For the question, if you do not want to get/set values, you don't need them. But the advantages of properties are calculations for all the time.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>get {
   return myString == null ? string.Empty : myString
}
set {
    !string.IsNullOrEmpty(value) ? value : ""
}
</code></pre>
