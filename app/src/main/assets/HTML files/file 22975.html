<p>From your question and comments I take it that you are implementing some kind of CI system (otherwise Xcode has excellent built-in support for this as I am sure you have seen). To have the static analyzer run when building from the command line, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6426572/start-clang-static-analyzer-with-xcodebuild">this question</a>.</p>

<p>To generate the report, you need to parse the standard output/error from clang (this is what Xcode does for you). You may want to try <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html" rel="nofollow">scan-build</a> (there is also a Jenkins plugin for this if you use Jenkins for CI).</p>
