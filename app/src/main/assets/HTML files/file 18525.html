<p>Yes. It's called <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/sort"><code>std::sort</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>sort</code> has an overload that takes a functor that defines the sort order as a third parameter. If you want decreasing order, then pass it <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/greater"><code>std::greater&lt;T&gt;()</code></a>, where <code>T</code> is your type.</p>
