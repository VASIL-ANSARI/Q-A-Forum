<p>The full explanation is given in the Apple developer document "File System Programming Guide":</p>

<p>In short, what the original poster called a shortcut is properly called a bookmark; it is created using methods in class NSURL (or CFURL functions). When written to disk, it is called an alias file, as in the old days of the Mac. Filesystem bookmarks/alias files have a similar function to symbolic links, but they are far from being the same thing.</p>

<p>Symbolic links</p>

<ul>
<li>are provided at the Unix filesystem level</li>
<li>contain no data other than a pathname</li>
<li>are fragile if the destination file is moved</li>
<li>require no application code to interpret, since the Unix kernel handles them</li>
</ul>

<p>Alias files</p>

<ul>
<li>are specific to OS X, implemented by the Core Foundation and Foundation frameworks</li>
<li>can be very large, especially when pointing to image data (on Mac as of OS X 10.7)</li>
<li>are self-repairing if the destination file is moved (within certain limits)</li>
<li>require the use of NSURL or CFURL routines to interpret</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to create a Unix symlink from your code, use the symlink system call.
