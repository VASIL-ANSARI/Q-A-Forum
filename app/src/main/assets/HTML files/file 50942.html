<p>This is known as "candy stripping" (and a few others) and prepareRenderer is a poor choice for implementing it (IMHO) as it potentially overrides any logic which the renderer might have otherwise been trying to convy (and I just don't like it :P). You could have a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25279727/java-abstracttablemodel-2-different-color-for-each-row/25279954#25279954">this alternative </a></p>

<p>I'm not a fan of using <code>PrepareRenderer</code>, it has the potential to override the prescribed logic of the cell renderer, which as a developer, would have me cursing you for screwing with me</p>

<p>Much of the functionality would actually be better suited to a custom cell renderer, but candy stripping is somewhat complex.</p>

<p>In your case, you NEED to call your custom methods from the <code>prepareRenderer</code> method, because no one else is going to do it for you</p>

<pre><code>public Component prepareRenderer(TableCellRenderer renderer, int row, int column){
    Component returnComp = super.prepareRenderer(renderer, row, column);
    prepareRowRenderer(returnComp, row);
    prepareColumnRenderer(returnComp, col);
    return returnComp;
}

protected void prepareRowRenderer(Component returnComp, int row) {
    Color alternateColor = new Color(241, 243, 247);
    Color whiteColor = Color.WHITE;
    if (!returnComp.getBackground().equals(getSelectionBackground())){
        Color bg = (row % 2 == 0 ? alternateColor : whiteColor);
        returnComp .setBackground(bg);
        bg = null;
    }
}


public Component prepareColumnRenderer(TableCellRenderer renderer, int columnIndex) {
    if(Double.parseDouble(getValueAt(rowIndex, 0).toString()) &gt; (Double.parseDouble(rollReq.getText())) &amp;&amp; columnIndex == 6) {
        component.setBackground(Color.RED);
    } else if(Double.parseDouble(getValueAt(rowIndex, 0).toString()) &gt; (Double.parseDouble(rollReq.getText())) &amp;&amp; columnIndex == 6){
        component.setBackground(Color.GREEN);
    }
    return component;
}
</code></pre>
