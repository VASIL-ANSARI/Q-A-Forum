<p>Your question is a nice illustration why people complain that jquery is too easy to adopt ;)</p>

<p>JSONP is not ajax. There are no success and failure callbacks. JSONP is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>put the parameters in the url</li>
<li>add &amp;jsoncallback=random2745273</li>
<li>create a global variable <code>random2745273</code> and put the callback reference in it</li>
<li>add <code>&lt;script src="theurlhere"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> to the <code>head</code> </li>
<li>that's all you can do.</li>
</ol>

<p>The server returns </p>

<pre><code>random2745273({somedata});
</code></pre>

<p>and that's how your callback is called.</p>

<p>If you want to report errors, then your server has to generate a correct code. You will not know what HTTP headers were sent.</p>

<p>And this is the only way you can communicate cross-domain with an api.
Sending cross-domain communicates is also possible with generating iframes, but it's hacky and rarely used.</p>

<p>[edit]</p>

<p>Ok, that got me thinking... I could use the iframe hack to wrap over the JSONP!</p>

<p>And as usual - I wasn't the first to have the idea (and I'm finally humble enough to google my ideas expecting it ;) )</p>

<p>Here it is: <a href="http://beebole.com/en/blog/general/sandbox-your-cross-domain-jsonp-to-improve-mashup-security/" rel="nofollow">http://beebole.com/en/blog/general/sandbox-your-cross-domain-jsonp-to-improve-mashup-security/</a></p>

<p>awesome </p>

<p>[edit2]</p>

<p>awww, I forgot... There's another one. </p>

<pre><code>window.postMessage
</code></pre>

<p>It already got implemented in some browsers. If you don't have to be compatible with most of the browsers, you can start using it now! :)</p>
