<p>Xamarin.IOS (Monotouch) includes built-in support for .Net powerful Task infrastructure including C# 5.0 async/await support. Personally I wouldn't bother with NSOperationQueue for stuff like this. I've included a sample below. That invokes a webservice which responds with a string url to the upload.</p>

<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>public async Task&lt;string&gt; UploadImageData(byte[] imageData)
{
  var clientHandler = new HttpClientHandler();

  using (var client = new HttpClient(clientHandler))
  {
    var content = new ByteArrayContent(imageData);
    var response = await client.PostAsync(new Uri("http://example.com/postImage"), content);
    return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
  }
}
</code></pre>
