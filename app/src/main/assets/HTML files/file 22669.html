<p>The ssh2 extension doesn't support notfication callbacks. I don't know if this is by design or just not implemented, but the extensions code is missing calls to functions like:</p>

<p>From (PHP-5.4.10) /ext/standard/ftp_fopen_wrapper.c, line 573:</p>

<pre><code>php_stream_notify_progress_init(context, 0, file_size);
</code></pre>

<p>A <strong>workaround</strong>, which I've not tested yet might be to use <code>ftps://</code> (FTP over ssl). It should fit your security needs and - as the code looks like - will support notifications as ftp. In detail, it uses the same urlwrapper as ftp.</p>
