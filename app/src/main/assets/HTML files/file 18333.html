<p>In android its quite simple to do that.</p>

<p>Please, take a look at this class</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager.html</a></p>

<p>especially at this method:</p>

<pre><code>  addProximityAlert(double, double, float, long, android.app.PendingIntent);
</code></pre>

<p>this is exactly what you need.</p>

<p>The android SDK docs are really well done. Take always a look there ! :D</p>
