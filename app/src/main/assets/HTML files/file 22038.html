<p>Don't post form to JSPs. Post the to servlets instead, and let the server analyze the parameters and forward to the appropriate JSP depending on which button has been clicked:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="/controllerServlet" method="post" name="f1"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="name"/&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" name="destination" value="next"/&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" name="destination" value="back"/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Using the above form (which BTW, is valid HTML), the servlet can use the value of the "destination" parameter. If it's "next", it should forward to <code>new3.jsp</code>. If it's <code>back</code>, it should forward to "new1.jsp". And if, for example, you want to redisplay the same page because the user didn't enter a valid value in the text field, it can do so.</p>

<p>That's the well-known MVC pattern. You should use it.</p>
