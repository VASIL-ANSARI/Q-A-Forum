<p>The same preparations for deployment are needed regardless of deployment strategy: blue-green, canary (see your other question, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23746038/canary-release-strategy-vs-blue-green/24015414">Canary release strategy vs. Blue/Green</a>, for a discussion of the differences) or upgrading a single server. A single client's browser-level view of a successful upgrade is the same: each request sees the old version, deployment happens, each request now sees the new version. Similarly, a single client's browser-level view of a failed upgrade and rollback is the same.</p>

<p>When I worked with a GWT app several years ago our strategy was to catch the exceptions that GWT throws when it encounters a new, incompatible version on the server and show the user a message asking them to refresh their browser. This article gives a little more detail: <a href="http://codebetter.com/kylebaley/2012/01/06/deploying-a-new-version-of-a-gwt-app-2/" rel="nofollow">http://codebetter.com/kylebaley/2012/01/06/deploying-a-new-version-of-a-gwt-app-2/</a> It also mentions that if you use Google App Engine you can use GAE's Channel API to detect that a new version of your app has been released and then ask the user to refresh. But again, whatever strategy you follow, it applies to any deployment process.</p>
