<p>Release the URL when you create the player.  I do this in my app and it functions fine.  No leaks, crashes, etc</p>

<pre><code>AVAudioPlayer *newPlayer =
        [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL: fileURL
                                               error: nil];
        [fileURL release];
</code></pre>

<p>And never, ever release objects that are contained by other objects.  That is their job, not yours.</p>

<p>Edit: If your url is still leaking, you need to look at what you're doing when you create it.  It should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSURL *fileURL = [[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath: [self path]];
</code></pre>

<p>Following the Cocoa rules of ownership, using an alloc method means you own it, so you release it.</p>
