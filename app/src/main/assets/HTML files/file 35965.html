<p>This is most likely coming from setting .NET 2.0 Subset. Your plugin may well be requiring features that aren't going to be there when you build using the subset. See this link and the below quote: <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ReducingFilesize.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ReducingFilesize.html</a></p>

<p>"To avoid wasted memory, Unity also supports the .NET 2.0 Subset API profile. This is very similar to the Mono âmonotouchâ profile, so many limitations of the âmonotouchâ profile also apply to Unityâs .NET 2.0 Subset profile. (More information on the limitations of the âmonotouchâ profile can be found here: <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/limitations/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/limitations/</a>). Many library routines that are not commonly needed in games are left out of this profile in order to save memory. However, this also means that code with dependencies on those routines will not work correctly. This option can be a useful optimization but you should check that existing code still works after it is applied."</p>

<p>From your question it seems that you have tried leaving it set to normal .NET 2.0 and it runs fine, so you will need to leave it with that setting, or remove any dependancies on the routines that aren't included in the subset.</p>
