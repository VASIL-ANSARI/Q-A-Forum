<p>Your URL is missing the action for create.  Change the URL to the following:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({ 
    url: "/orders/create", 
    ....
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is that your routing never reach the second one defined for Orders.  All url's starting with Orders will go to the Order controller and Index action.</p>

<pre><code>context.MapRoute( 
    "OrderList", 
    "Orders", 
    new { action = "Index", controller="Orders" } 
);
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You should use a general routing in this case:</p>

<pre><code>context.MapRoute( 
    "Order", 
    "Orders/{action}/{id}", 
    new { action = "Index", controller = "Orders", id="" } 
);
</code></pre>

<p>If the URL is '/Orders' then it will go to 'Index', but '/Orders/Create' will go to the 'Create' action in the controller.</p>
