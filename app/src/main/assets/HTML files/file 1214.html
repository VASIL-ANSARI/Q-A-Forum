<p>There are different factors that you need to take into account especially on a language like Java, Java runs on a virtual machine and garbage collection is handled by the Java Runtime, as there is considerable effort (I would imagine) from using the Java Invocation Interface to switch or execute the native method within the native library as there would have to be a means to allocate space on the stack, switch to native code, execute the native method, switch back to the Java virtual machine and perhaps somehow, the space on the stack was not freed up - that's what I would be inclined to think.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,
Best regards,
Tom.</p>
