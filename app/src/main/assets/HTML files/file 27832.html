<p>To get a list of the installed apps, <em>there is no dedicated API</em>. You can use the <a href="http://maniacdev.com/2012/11/open-source-ios-library-for-detecting-apps-installed-on-a-users-device" rel="nofollow">URL scheme trick</a> to detect whether an app is present but its enabled state in the notification center is not detectable in any way. However, based on the URL scheme app list, you can configure your peripheral for a subset of the installed applications and you can provide additional options for the user for other apps. (Though, I think most apps that come into consideration for you should have URL schemes.)</p>
