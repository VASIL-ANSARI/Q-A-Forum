<p>It's a bit difficult to debug without the table designs but from what I see in your query, there may be a few issues (again, depending on your table design).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your inner subquery does not have a Where Statement. Therefore, it
will bring all games in TRolls table, grouped by intGameID; It will
return multiple games; this is probably the issue as the "Game"
subquery is used in a SELECT statement, so it should return only one row; 
you may need to add a WHERE clause to your subquery, and
maybe another join, depending on your table structure and their
relationships. If you really need to get the score for each game
(meaning, you don't know the gameID yet) you need to do that in the
FROM statement (not in the select statement as you are) like this</p>

<p><code>SELECT
 TP.intPlayerID
,TP.strLastName + ', ' + TP.strFirstName AS strPlayerName
,TG.*
,TR.intGameID
,<strong>Game.Gamescore</strong>
FROM
     TPlayers AS TP
    ,TGames AS TG
    ,TRolls AS TR
    , (Select ... ... 
       ) As Game
WHERE ...</code></p></li>
<li><p>From your question I understand in a Game you have multiple Players.
You are filtering just "PlayerID = 21" so you are adding all the
scores from all games for that player - is that what you really want?
Or are you missing another condition to filter a specific game?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You mentioned you are not familiar with subqueries, so here's a quick rule of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li>If used in the Select Statement (like yours) a subquery can only
return one row. Always.</li>
<li>If used in the From Statement (like my example) it brings you a
virtual "temp table" with multiple rows, you enclose it in
parenthesis and use an Alias to identify it; then you join it with
other tables in your From Statement using its given Alias.</li>
<li><p>If used in the Where Statement it should return a boolean value (true
or false), and a common example of that would be verifying whether or
not an information exists somewhere, like this:</p>

<p><code> WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 'X' from .... Where ....)  </code></p></li>
</ul>
