<p>If the HTML structure is important to you, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">regex is the wrong approach</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise (if you can match the string anywhere as long as it's surrounded by <code>"</code>), you might want to try this:</p>

<pre><code>/one-two-three[^"]+?[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]
</code></pre>

<p><code>[\s\S]</code> basically mean <strong>any</strong> character. But you only want characters that are not <code>"</code>, because this marks the end of the path.</p>
