<p>Consider using Python's datetime or dateutil module. This will solve your problems with managing date and time. You will have to put the logic for the rest. As already pointed out your question is broad</p>

<p>You can study about datetime module here
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html</a></p>

<p>dateutil is an extension to datetime and you will have to install it separately.</p>

<p>These are few stackoverflow answers which helped me in getting started with date time."timedelta" from datetime module or "relativedelta" from dateutil module can help you add or subtract time information such as days or hours. </p>

<p>This will give you some insight between difference in 'datetime' and 'dateutil' module. You can select accordingly</p>
