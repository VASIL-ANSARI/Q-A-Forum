<p><code>file</code> is a pointer to a <code>File</code>, which means that any changes to what it points to, like</p>

<p></p>

<pre><code>file-&gt;doSomething(); // the caller will see this change
</code></pre>

<p>will be seen by the calling side, but if one overwrites the pointer, that not only the new value of the pointer not going to be seen by the caller, but any changes to the file after that will also not be observed, because it's a pointer to a different <code>File</code> now, and because the pointer itself is passed by value.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>file = new File(); // the caller will not see this change
file-&gt;doSomething(); // neither will it see this one
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>page</code> is a reference to a pointer to a <code>Page</code>. In other words, it behaves like a pointer, so</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>page-&gt;doSomething(); // the caller will see this change
</code></pre>

<p>is still observed by the caller. But now if you overwrite the pointer, the caller's pointer will also be changed, and hence all consecutive changes will also be seen:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp prettyprint-override"><code>page = new Page(); // caller also sees this change
page-&gt;doSomething(); // and this too
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the pointer itself is passed by reference, so any changes to the pointer itself are observed by the calling side.</p>

<p>(and yes, the way you place spaces does not matter, so the two ways you provided are identical)</p>
