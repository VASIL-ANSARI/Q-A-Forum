<p>A simpler way is to mark a node as 'deleted' in a list, and delete them in one go when necessary. All you need is modify your struct by adding an extra field (e.g. 'int deleted').</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>My wrong here, sorry!</p>

<p>If you want to delete a list from head to tail and tail to head, it's better that your list be doubly linked, i.e. every node must have two pointers with a 'next' pointing to the next node and a 'prev' pointing to the previous node. Otherwise it is not very efficient and convenient to traverse the list in both directions.</p>

<p>In addition, if we mark a node as 'deleted' but not really delete it. We can implement a 'clear list' method which clears the list node by node, not worrying that we might mess up with pointers, especially when the list is being used in the program.</p>
