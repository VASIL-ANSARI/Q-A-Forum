<p>It may be difficult once function has already started. Take a look at NSOperation - it will allow to structure your code in a more clear way and it supports cancelling, also note that you'll have to adjust your clustering function to be able to return in the middle if it was cancelled </p>

<p>NSOperation was exactly what I was looking for. Inside the for-loop I can have a check to see if the operation has been canceled each loop, and I can start a new operation easily. Thanks a lot! </p>
