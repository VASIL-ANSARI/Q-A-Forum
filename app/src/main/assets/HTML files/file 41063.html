<p>Regexs aren't good parsing things that require state. 
You could, probably, come up with something that works in some limited scenarios, but not a good regex that could handle a generic case. </p>

<p>You are better off just parsing your string explicitly. Basically, scan the characters one-by-one, and:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if the char is <code>{</code> increase the "nesting counter". If <code>nesting counter==1</code>, start a new group, and skip to next char;</p></li>
<li><p>if the char is <code>}</code>, decrease the counter. If <code>nesting_counter == 0</code>, end the current group, and skip to next char;</p></li>
<li><p>if <code>nesting_counter&gt;0</code> append the current char to the group and continue;</p></li>
</ul>
