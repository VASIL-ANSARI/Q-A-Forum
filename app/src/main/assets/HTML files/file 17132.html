<p>For that you need the &amp; operator. It takes the address of a variable</p>

<p>Some more info on pointer operators can be found <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>to the starting address of a regular variable:</p>

<pre><code>printf("%p", &amp;variable);
</code></pre>

<p>These variables don't realy have an end address, but i think what you want is something like:</p>

<pre><code>printf("%p", (&amp;variable + 1));
</code></pre>

<p>which prints the next available address</p>
