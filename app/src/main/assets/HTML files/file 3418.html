<p>Modern Python exceptions are classes; by using <code>raise 'incorrect'</code>, you are using a deprecated language feature called string exceptions. The <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow">Errors and Exceptions</a> section of the Python tutorial would be a good place to start with basic exception handling in Python.</p>

<p>In general, exceptions are not ideal for your situation anywayâa simple <code>while</code> loop should be sufficient. Exceptions should be reserved for exceptional situations, and bad user input is not exceptional, it's expected.</p>

<p>The loop-based version of <code>Release</code> would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def Release():
    a = None
    while a not in (0, 1, 2, 3):
        print 'Please select one of the following?\nCompletion = 0\nRelease ID = 1\nVersion ID = 2\nBuild ID = 3\n'
        try:
            a = int(input("Please select the type of release required: "))
        except ValueError:
            pass  # Could happen in face of bad user input
    files(a)
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. <code>a</code> is a bad variable name; you should probably change it to <code>chosen_option</code> or something like that.</p>
