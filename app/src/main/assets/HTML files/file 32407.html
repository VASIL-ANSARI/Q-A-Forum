<p>I think everything must work. Only few moments.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '7%' ...</code> Works so I think problem with link generation.</li>
<li>never pass parameters like this <code>"#{params}"</code>. Because it's not secure. Use  <code>:conditions =&gt; ['goal like ?", "#{params[:char]}%"]</code></li>
<li>try your code in console and use pry for debugging.</li>
</ol>
