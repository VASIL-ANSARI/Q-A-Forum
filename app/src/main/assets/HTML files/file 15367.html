<p>Well, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>define(MYCLASS, 'ClassName');
$class = MYCLASS;
$object = new $class();
</code></pre>

<p>...but as far as I know, you can't use the constant directly as in <code>new MYCLASS()</code>, because it will of course look for the class named <code>MYCLASS</code>.</p>

<p>Side note: You can't have constants with names that conflict with reserved words, like <code>class</code> or <code>function</code>, even if they are uppercased.</p>

<p>You could do something silly like this if for some reason you're doing this a lot:</p>

<pre><code>function newClass($str, $args = NULL) {
    return new $str($args);
}
$class = newClass(MYCLASS);
</code></pre>

<p>...but I don't really recommend it. I'd also guess that you probably don't need so many constants, or there's a more elegant way to do what you're doing that doesn't involve constants at all.</p>
