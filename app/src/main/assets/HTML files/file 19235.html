<p>There is nothing stupid about a basic question, as everyone has to start somewhere.</p>

<p>The basic process with deploying a Rails app to Heroku is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make changes</li>
<li>Add and Commit your changes (<code>$ git add files_changed.rb</code> &amp; <code>$ git commit -m "make changes"</code>)</li>
<li>Push your changes to Heroku (<code>$ git push heroku master</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>This then pushes your code to the remote Heroku repository and redeploys your Rails application. If you have made any database migrations, you need to run:</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku run rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

<p>This runs db:migrate on your heroku app - see how that works? :)</p>

<p>Running rake db:migrate locally simply migrates your local development database.</p>
