<p>Right: each call to <code>Timer</code> does start a new thread.  Indeed, class <code>threading.Timer</code> is <em>documented</em> as being "a thread".  You can confirm this by reading <a href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/threading.py?annotate=76172" rel="nofollow">the source code</a>, line 707.</p>

<p>A good alternative is to run a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sched.html?highlight=sched#sched.scheduler" rel="nofollow">scheduler</a> in a single thread, receiving requests through a <code>Queue.Queue</code> instance (intrinsically threadsafe) and intrinsically serializing them (which may also take care of your "non-thread-safe-library" problems without needing further locking or synchronization, depending how you arrange your overall architecture of course).</p>
