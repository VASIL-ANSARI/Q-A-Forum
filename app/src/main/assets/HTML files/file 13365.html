<p>The <a href="http://www.smartystreets.com/products/cass-certified-scrubbing" rel="nofollow">CASS-Certified Scrubbing Service</a> from <a href="http://www.smartystreets.com" rel="nofollow">SmartyStreets</a> offers deduplication as part of their address verification process.  Just upload the data in a delimited text file and the duplicates will be marked on the <a href="http://wiki.smartystreets.com/cass_certified_scrubbing_users_guide" rel="nofollow">output file</a> you download.  There's always a free preview for each file you process so you don't have to purchase anything before you're satisfied with the results.  I'm a software developer for SmartyStreets and helped write the application.  I'm pretty pleased with both its functionality and ease of use.  We also have an <a href="http://www.smartystreets.com/products/liveaddress-api" rel="nofollow">API</a> you could use but the deduplication would be your responsibility (just compare the full, 12-digit Delivery Point Barcode, which serves as a unique identifier for addresses).</p>
