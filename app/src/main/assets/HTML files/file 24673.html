<p>You hit the nail on the head.  Your understanding is correct.  The difference between pre and post increment expressions is just like it sounds.  Pre-incrementation means the variable is incremented before the expression is set or evaluated.  Post-incrementation means the expression is set or evaluated, and then the variable is altered.  It's easy to think of it as a two step process.</p>

<pre><code>b = x++;
</code></pre>

<p>is really:</p>

<pre><code>b = x;
x++;
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>b = ++x;
</code></pre>

<p>is really:</p>

<pre><code>x++;
b = x;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: The tricky part of the examples you provided (which probably threw you off) is that there's a huge difference between an array index, and its value.</p>

<pre><code>i = ++a[1];
</code></pre>

<p>That means increment the value stored at a[1], and then set it to the variable i.  </p>

<pre><code>m = a[i++];
</code></pre>

<p>This one means set m to the value of a[i], then increment i.  The difference between the two is a pretty big distinction and can get confusing at first. </p>

<p>Second EDIT: breakdown of the code</p>

<pre><code>{ 
 int a[5] = { 5, 1, 15, 20, 25 } ; 
 int i, j, k = 1, m ; 
 i = ++a[1] ; 
 j = a[1]++ ; 
 m = a[i++] ; 
 printf ( "\n%d %d %d", i, j, m ) ; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>First: </p>

<pre><code>i = ++a[1];
</code></pre>

<p>At this point we know a[1] = 1 (remember arrays are zero indexed).  But we increment it first.  Therefore i = 2.</p>

<pre><code>j = a[1]++;
</code></pre>

<p>Remember we incremented a[1] before, so it is currently 2.  We set j = 2, and THEN incremented it to 3.  So j = 2 and now a[1] = 3.</p>

<pre><code>m = a[i++];
</code></pre>

<p>We know i = 2.  So we need to set m = a[2], and then increment i.  At the end of this expression, m = 15, and i = 3.</p>

<p>In summary, </p>

<pre><code>i = 3, j = 2, m = 15.
</code></pre>
