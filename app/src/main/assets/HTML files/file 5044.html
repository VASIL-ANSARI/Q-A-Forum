<p>See this answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/265774/programmatically-scroll-to-an-anchor-tag">Programmatically scroll to an Anchor Tag</a></p>

<p>Basically...</p>

<pre><code>onclick="document.getElementById('targetID').scrollIntoView(true);"
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>window.location.href = '#targetName';
</code></pre>

<p>However, it looks like at least some versions of IE don't recognize clicks on <code>&lt;options&gt;</code>, so you'll have to place the onclick code on the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> instead.  If you make the value of each option the #anchor you're going to (and remember, set the id of the anchors as well as the name), you should be able to get the value of the clicked option and then scroll to it.  This will take a lot less code as well since you write one scrolling function in one click event, and then maintain the data of the option values.</p>
