<p>Ok, I was discussing with a friend who is MUCH more SQL savvy than I am (doesn't take much), and he suggested the following SQL query:</p>

<p>"DECLARE @TVP as MyUDTTable;  SELECT * FROM @TVP"</p>

<p>This appears to give me exactly what I want, so I'm updating here should some other poor sap want something similar in the future.  Perhaps others may offer different or better answers.</p>
