<p>If the copy assignment operator isn't defined, then it isn't defined and can't be used. That's true for <code>CList</code>, as you've already observed, so no, you can't just use <code>operator=</code> to copy a <code>CList</code> object. If you want a deep copy of the collection, you will need to write a function to do so manually.</p>

<p>But consider whether you really want a deep copy. Most of the time, you'll want to pass collection types by reference, rather than by value. This is especially true in MFC, where they can contain objects derived from <code>CObject</code> that can't necessarily be copied. In fact, you'll notice that copying is explicitly disallowed by the <code>CObject</code> class, using a private copy constructor and assignment operator:</p>

<pre><code>   // Disable the copy constructor and assignment by default so you will get
   //   compiler errors instead of unexpected behaviour if you pass objects
   //   by value or assign objects.
private:
   CObject(const CObject&amp; objectSrc);              // no implementation
   void operator=(const CObject&amp; objectSrc);       // no implementation
</code></pre>
