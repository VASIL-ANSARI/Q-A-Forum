<p>Markers are simple JS objects that can be manipulated in the same way that any JS object can.</p>

<p>The only way you can control if a Marker is shown on the map is via it's setMap() function. So check out your code and see if you call setMap(your_map) for the markers you want to be shown on the map. Also bear in mind that there are some properties that must be set (position for example) in order the Marker to be shown.</p>

<p>So, don't worry of simple JS object manipulation, it doesn't interact with the Marker visibility, as long as it's initialized properly.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a theoretical point of view, if you've done all this and it still doesn't work, you must provide some additional details and code.</p>
