<p>I think your tables do not use <code>utf8_general_ci</code> as collation, but <code>utf8_bin</code>. I was able to reproduce the behaviour you describe after modifying the tables as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE test1 CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
ALTER TABLE bucket CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
</code></pre>

<p>You should perhaps set your tables' collation explicitely to:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE test1 CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
ALTER TABLE bucket CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
</code></pre>

<p>If the above changes anything, I would guess your server or session is actually set to use another collation by default (since the collation is not specified in your tables definition). This could be checked with:</p>

<pre><code>SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'collation_server';
SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'collation_server';
</code></pre>
