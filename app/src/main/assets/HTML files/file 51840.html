<p>Hittablility is an indicator of whether or not a gesture can be processed using a give point.</p>

<p>Given that UI tests flatten the view hierarchy to a query-based system, this just means that if part of a view is on screen it's hittable, otherwise it is not hittable.</p>

<p>For instance, if I have a <code>UITableView</code> that has a bunch of cells, the first cells that you can see on screen are hittable. The last cells that you can't see because they're off screen are not hittable.</p>

<p>An element can still exist in the coordinate space and be off screen. In the previous example, the last cell of a long table view would still exist, it just would be impossible to interact with it.</p>
