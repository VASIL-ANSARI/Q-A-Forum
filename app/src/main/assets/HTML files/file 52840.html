<p>This is something that's already been thought over. Don't reinvent the wheel. If you'd like to continue to use GET, use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8088473/how-do-i-url-encode-a-string">this question</a> for handling encoding on the iOS side, and read about <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.urldecode.php" rel="nofollow">this PHP method</a> for the PHP side. <strong>OR</strong>, you can use POST (which actually fits this better), and you don't have to encode anything.</p>

<p>I don't really think this needs a code example, and I'm not writing the iOS side (because it's in the link), but the PHP side should look like:</p>

<pre><code>$dishname = isset($_POST["dishname"]) ? $_POST["dishname"] : null;
$description = isset($_POST["description"]) ? $_POST["description"] : null;

// do inserts per @tadman's answer
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to use GET for whatever reason, </p>

<pre><code>$dishname = isset($_GET["dishname"]) ? urldecode($_GET["dishname"]) : null;
$description = isset($_GET["description"]) ? urldecode($_GET["description"]) : null;
</code></pre>
