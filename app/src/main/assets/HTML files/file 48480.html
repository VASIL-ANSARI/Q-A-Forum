<p>You cannot run SenseNet in the VS debugger. Here's how you can run it and debug it if needed.</p>

<p>Once you've built the project, open IIS and create a website by pointing to the website root location. If you have the complete SenseNet source this root location would be the "Source\SenseNet\Website" folder. Once your start the website you can use the debugger in Visual Studio to "Attach to Process", and the process will be "w3wp". You may need to click the "Show all processes" checkbox to see it. For more information see the <a href="http://wiki.sensenet.com/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">SenseNet wiki</a>.</p>

<p>You should be able to connect to the SQL Server alias from SSMS. If you cannot and don't want to use the alias, you can just edit the connection string in the website <code>web.config</code> file to point to the database as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;
    &lt;add name="SnCrMsSql" connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLExpress;Initial Catalog=SenseNetContentRepository;Integrated Security=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /&gt;
&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;
</code></pre>
