<p>While I don't know the internal workings of any of the aforementioned services, I'd guess that they download/create a local copy of the images and generate a thumbnail from that. </p>

<p>Imgur, as an image hosting service, definitely needs a copy of the image prior to being able to generate thumbnails or anything else from it. The image may be stored locally or just in memory, but either way, it must be downloaded.</p>

<p>The search engines displaying screenshots of the sites likely have services that periodically take a screenshot of the viewable area when the content is getting indexed, and then serve those screenshots (or derivatives) along with the search results. Taking a screenshot really isn't dangerous, so there's nothing to worry about there, and whatever tools are used to load/parse/index the websites will obviously be written with security considerations in mind.</p>

<p>Of course, there are security concerns about the data you're downloading, too; the images can easily contain executable code (such as PHP) in their EXIF data, so you need to be careful about what you do with the images and how.</p>
