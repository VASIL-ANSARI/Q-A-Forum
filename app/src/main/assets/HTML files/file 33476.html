<p>In your case, the anti aliasing filters look crummy because you have a very small image (16x16) and are upscaling it only a small bit (to 50x50). In your case, you likely want a sharper image, so you'd likely want to go with nearest neighbor interpolation, rather than the built-in default (either bi-linear or bi-cubic, not entirely sure which is the default).</p>

<pre><code>Image original = â¦;
original.setFilter(Image.FILTER_NEAREST);
Image scaled = original.getScaledCopy();
</code></pre>

<p>So in your case, it would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>Image original;
Image scaled;
original = new Image("test.png");
original.setFilter(Image.FILTER_NEAREST);
scaled = original.getScaledCopy(50, 50);
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that this won't be a true "1:1" scaling, since the scaling factor is not an integer ratio (ie: 50/16 isn't a whole non-decimal number). If you were to upscale to 64x64, you could have a "1:1" rescaling, since <code>16*k=64</code>, where <code>k</code> is an integer.</p>
