<p>I do not think HTML has such functionality. The only thing I can imagine would do the trick is to do some server-side processing. Perhaps you could get an image snapshot of the webpage you want to serve, scale it on the server and serve it to the client. This would be a non-interactive page however. (maybe an imagemap could have the link, but still.) </p>

<p>Another idea would be to have a server-side component that would alter the HTML. SOrt of like the firefox 2.0 zoom feature. this of course is not perfect zooming, but is better than nothing.</p>

<p>Other than that, I am out of ideas.</p>
