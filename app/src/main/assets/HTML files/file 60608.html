<p>The issue is exactly like it sounds, an adapter is not being attached when it needs it. You don't attach it until <code>onPostExecute</code>. Just attach it right from the beginning:</p>

<pre><code>mRecyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recycleView);
mRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getApplicationContext()));
mUserAdapter = new UserAdapter();
mRecyclerView.setAdapter(mUserAdapter);
</code></pre>

<p>As you modify the adapter in other parts of the code, your RecyclerView will update automatically, so long as you call <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> or some related method.</p>
