<p>You need to open the file in binary mode:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('kitten.jpeg', 'wb')
</code></pre>

<p>Python will otherwise translate line endings to the native platform form, a transformation that breaks binary data, as documented for the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow"><code>open()</code> function</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default is to use text mode, which may convert <code>'\n'</code> characters to a platform-specific representation on writing and back on reading. Thus, when opening a binary file, you should append <code>'b'</code> to the mode value to open the file in binary mode, which will improve portability.</p>

<p>When copying data from a URL to a file, you could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/shutil.html#shutil.copyfileobj" rel="nofollow"><code>shutil.copyfileob()</code></a> to handle streaming efficiently:</p>

<pre><code>from shutil import copyfileobj

im = urllib2.urlopen(url)
with open('kitten.jpeg', 'wb') as out:
    copyfileobj(im, out)
</code></pre>

<p>This will read data in chunks, avoiding filling memory with large blobs of binary data. The <code>with</code> statement handles closing the file object for you.</p>
