<p>Just out of curiosity, you're not trying to compile a <em>program</em> without a <code>main</code> function, are you? If so, you're going to get a compilation error.</p>

<p>As an aside, you should be aware that your <code>nextDay</code> function probably doesn't do what you think it does.</p>

<pre><code>void Date::nextDay(int d)
{
    d=d+1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since you're passing <code>d</code> in by value, this simply increments a <em>copy</em> of <code>d</code> and then exits. If you intended to modify the original value, you should change the function signature to <code>void Date::nextDay(int&amp; d)</code>.</p>
