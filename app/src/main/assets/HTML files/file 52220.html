<p>This is a possible approach to fully or partially initialize an object copying members' values from the source object.</p>

<p>In your case, you can call this as <em>mapping objects</em>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <code>rectangle</code> class could implement a static method like <code>CreateFrom</code> that would work as the current constructor and it would also work like a factory method:</p>

<pre><code>class rectangle
{
    private int length;
    private int breadth;

    public static rectangle CreateFrom(rectangle x)
    {
        rectangle r = new rectangle();
        r.length = x.length;
        r.breadth = x.breadth;

        return r;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and maybe this way you find your event handler code more interesting:</p>

<pre><code>private void button8_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    rectangle r1 = new rectangle(50, 70);
    rectangle r2 = rectangle.CreateFrom(r1);
}
</code></pre>
