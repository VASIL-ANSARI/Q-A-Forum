<p>Very nice O(n log n) algorithm!</p>

<p>You can finish there because you will never find the better interval fulfilling the given condition "range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists".</p>

<p>Suppose you are leaving current minimum <code>m</code> (the last element from some list) and instead you are removing something (not minimum) from another list. In that case the range can only grow (because minimum of the range is determined by <code>m</code>). So there is no point in doing that and you can just stop your algorithm.</p>
