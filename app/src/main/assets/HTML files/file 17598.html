<p>I don't have a thorough understanding of the behind-the-scenes processes of UITableView but I have found that when my UITableViewCell subclasses don't seem to be working as intended, that moving as much of the code as I can to the layoutSubviews method of the subclass instead of calling it in cellForRowAtIndexPath of the UITableViewController helps. </p>
