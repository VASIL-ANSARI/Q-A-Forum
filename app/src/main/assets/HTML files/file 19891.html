<p>If you have the dSYM and the app bundle, you can use this Symbolication tool I wrote to quickly Symbolicate your app's addresses. </p>

<pre><code>symbolication your.app.dSYM your.app.trace
</code></pre>

<p>The symbolicated version will be printed to STDOUT. For best results, keep your .app in the same folder as your .dSYM. </p>

<p>You could also manually Symbolicate just the problem line using GDB. Open your dSYM with GDB, then run</p>

<pre><code>set print symbol-filename on
p/a address
</code></pre>
