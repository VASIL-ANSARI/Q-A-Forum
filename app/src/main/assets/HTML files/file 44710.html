<p>open corresponding Xml file and add this Imageview after Relative Layout ..Like this..</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RootLayout&gt;
&lt;RelativeLayout &gt;
&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
&lt;ImgView/&gt;
&lt;/RootLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>u can test the behavior on Xml Graphical Layout itself.</p>

<p>issue here is that as soon as we add any view in xml , this is added in view container and container is Stack and hence the behavior!</p>
