<p>Your over thinking, we already know that a pound isn't a valid integer.  An integer doesn't contain any specific formatting that would append a pound.  You would have to convert the integer into a String.</p>

<p>The String will allow such formatting.  As you iterate through your model, you could simply do the following:</p>

<pre><code>@{ String.Format("#{0}", CompatRuleNumber); }
</code></pre>

<p>That would format in said manner, I'm not sure if you could apply it to <em>Data Scaffolding</em> while it is of an integer type.</p>
