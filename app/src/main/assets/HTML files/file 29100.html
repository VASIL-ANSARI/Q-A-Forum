<p>Using new Integer() will guarantee that you have a new Integer object reference. </p>

<p>Using the value directly will not guarantee that, since auto boxing int to Integer may not do that object instantiation. </p>

<p>I would say that you will only need new Integer(1) in really strange edge cases, so most of the time I would say you never need to do new Integer...</p>

<p>Also please bear in mind that auto boxing / unboxing may produce some errors in some edge cases.</p>

<pre><code>Integer x = null;
int y = x; // Null Pointer Exception
</code></pre>

<p>Long iterations where auto(un)boxing is happening may have a performance cost that an untrained eye might not notice</p>
