<p>I found the problem but it led to more.</p>

<p>The Side Winder RS-232 from Brush Industries has a different Vendor ID and Product ID. If you replace those variables with the correct ones (below) then your Side Winder RS-232 should be detected by your python code.</p>

<p>Vendor Id = 0x12b6</p>

<p>Product Id = 0x0092</p>
