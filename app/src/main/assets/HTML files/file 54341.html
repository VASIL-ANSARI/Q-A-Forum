<p>Hard to answer this question. If the file you are downloading is too big, copying it to memory would incur some garbage collection which comes with the corresponding overhead of course. Obviously streaming the file to some other <code>Stream</code> such as a <code>FileStream</code> or a <code>NetworkStream</code> (depending on what exactly you are trying to achieve and your specific requirements) might improve the performance and even allow you to download multiple files at a time from Amazon without busting all your available RAM and forcing the Operating System into swapping the crap out of it on the disk.</p>

  <p>My another question is when the actual download occurs in any http
  request? when I get the response object or when I copy the Stream from
  response object?</p>

<p>When you <code>await</code> on the <code>CopyToAsync</code> method call. The <code>CopyToAsync</code> method will copy small byte chunks from the source stream to the destination stream until it reaches the end of the source stream. But since your destination <code>Stream</code> is a <code>MemoryStream</code> you are of course losing all the benefits of this chunked copying because you end up with the entire file loaded into your process operating memory.</p>
