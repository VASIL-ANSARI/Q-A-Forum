<p>According to the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html#readLine()" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a>, the <code>readLine()</code> method will throw an IOException. And according to IOException's <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/IOException.html" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a>, the exception is expected tobe thrown on an interrupt. Without writing code, I would say that you can handle the case of the stream closing prematurely by catching <code>IOException</code>.</p>
