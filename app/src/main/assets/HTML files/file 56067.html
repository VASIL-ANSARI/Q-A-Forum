<p>The reason for this problem is because you've not set your <code>post_max_size</code>. The <code>post_max_size</code> defaults to 8mb. So you need to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>php_value upload_max_filesize 20M
php_value post_max_size 50M
</code></pre>

<p>You can obviously edit the <code>post_max_size</code> to something more suitable to what you need.</p>
