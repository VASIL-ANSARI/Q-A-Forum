<p>Not enough info here to know for sure, but my guess is your controller is set to extend views behind top bars. I don't believe autolayout things like <code>topLayoutGuide</code>, etc. get computed until after <code>viewDidLoad</code>.</p>

<p>Possible solutions: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Uncheck the "Extend Edges Under Top Bars" box on your view controller if you don't need that. </p></li>
<li><p>Add the view in <code>viewDidLoad</code> but position it in <code>viewDidLayoutSubviews</code></p></li>
<li><p>Position <code>myView</code> with autolayout constraints instead of explicitly setting its frame.</p></li>
</ul>
