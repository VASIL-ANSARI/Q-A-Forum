<p>We can use the fact that <code>mysqld</code> uses file descriptor 2 (<code>stderr</code>) for the error log and the <code>/proc</code> file system like this:</p>

<pre><code>sudo readlink /proc/$(pidof mysqld)/fd/2
</code></pre>

<p>this, of course, requires a currently running server. File descriptor is guaranteed to be 2 because MySQL writes to the error log via the redirection of the stderr stream to the specified log on startup, and then writing to stderr - at least in versions 5.5 and earlier, likely in later versions as well.</p>
