<p>I finally found the problem myself.
The problem was that a layout had the same name in both the Android program project and the apklib project. As a consequence the layout containing the reference to mypackage.R.id in the apkklib project was overridden.</p>

<p>In my case that was the main.xml layout of the library that was overridden by the main.xml layout created by eclipse for the "hello world" project and that I forgot to remove.</p>

<p>Maven was detecting it at compilation time while the Eclipse plugin wasn't, again a bug.</p>

<p>Removing the clandestine "hello world" main.xml from the Android project fixed it. </p>
