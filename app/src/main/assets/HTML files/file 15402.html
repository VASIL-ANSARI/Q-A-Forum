<p>In embedded systems, logging is accomplished in two preferred methods:  via debug / serial port and storing into memory.  </p>

<p>The idea behind storing into memory is that it can be retrieved later using a JTAG debugger or other facilities.  Use Non-Volatile memory for anything that needs to be saved after power-off.</p>
