<p>Not sure what's your question, but I found one mistake that you might have corrected already</p>

<p><strong>Issue 1 :</strong> 
    @Column(name="NR_DOCUMENTT", length=4, nullable=false)
    protected Integer nrDocument;</p>

<p>The column name <strong>NR_DOCUMENTT</strong> has typo!</p>

<p><strong>Issue 2 :</strong>
Have a single PK class for both Child and Parent instead of separate one as they both have same properties shared. In case of same properties but different COLUMN names, please use <code>@AttributeOverride</code> and specific column.</p>

<p><strong>Answer Updates:</strong></p>

<p>Having said the above corrected, the queries occurred twice because, your association has a <code>Set&lt;Children&gt;</code> and since you fetch <strong>EAGERly</strong>, 'n' number of Set elements would trigger 'n' select queries directly.</p>
