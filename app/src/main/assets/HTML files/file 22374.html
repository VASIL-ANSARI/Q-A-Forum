<p>you do not need the <code>as</code> option when you set up the Tag association to TaggedItem.  <code>:as =&gt; :taggable</code> would mean that tag on tagged item is polymorphic which it is not. Instead the other side is, ie., the items that are taggable as your name cleverly suggests :).</p>

<pre><code>class Tag &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :tagged_items, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :products, :through =&gt; :tagged_items
  has_many :images, :through =&gt; :tagged_items
end
</code></pre>
