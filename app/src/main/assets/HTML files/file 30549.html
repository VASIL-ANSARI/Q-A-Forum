<p>Wow I recreated exactly what you did and the only option I came up with is trying to make you listbox smaller to eliminate white space. If the list in the box isn't a fixed size you could always make its size change based on the list size and set a maximum size before you need to scroll through it.  </p>

<p>It's not the greatest solution but it seems to work.</p>

<p>It would look something like this.</p>

<pre><code>public Form1(){
            InitializeComponent();
            if (listBox1.Items.Count &lt; 6)
            {

                listBox1.Height = listBox1.Items.Count*12+9;
            }
            else
            {
                listBox1.Height = 69;
            }

        }
</code></pre>
