<p>You can use the <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/appendixes.annotations.html#appendixes.annotations.covers"><code>covers</code> annotation</a> to specify if a test covers multiple methods. So if one of your methods calls another method, you can simply add the annotation to the test's docblock and it will be added to your code coverage statistics, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @test
 * @covers MyClass::something()
 * @covers MyClass::_somethingElse()
 */
public function somethingWorksAsExpected()
{
    $this-&gt;assertSame($expected, $this-&gt;testObject-&gt;something());
}
</code></pre>

<p>For personal projects, 100% Code coverage is fine. However, I've seen talks at conferences where 100% are doubted to be necessary. Despite all the benefits, tests take time to write and in a budgeted project it might be sufficient to just test 80/20 and leave out uncritical low priority features of your app.</p>

<p>As for how to test your class, have a look at the chapter on <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/behaviour-driven-development.html">Behaviour Driven Development in the PHPUnit Manual</a>. In your case, I'd test the functionality you described in your question.</p>
