<p>If you want to access <code>@subject.steps</code> within the rendered partial, then you would need to call <code>@subject.page_title</code> anywhere before the <code>render</code> call.</p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what your use case is here, but it would be easier to follow if <code>steps</code> took a title parameter, as opposed to setting the "state" of your subject instance with another method.</p>

<p>Also, this smells like presentation formatting logic that maybe is just better off in the view or in a view helper.</p>
