<p>The most succinct way to accomplish this is:</p>

<pre><code>cv::Mat image, mask;    //image is CV_8UC1
cv::inRange(image, 255, 255, mask);
int count = cv::countNonZero(mask);
</code></pre>

<p>If you are operating on a binary image, then the call to <code>cv::inRange()</code> is unnecessary, and simply <code>cv::countNonZero()</code> will suffice.</p>

<p>Although any method must iterate through all the pixels, this may be able to harness OpenCV's built-in <code>parallel_for_()</code>, which allows parallel execution.</p>

<p>If your image is continuous, you can iterate through all the data using a single loop.</p>
