<p>I had ruby installed, but turns out it was not set in rvm. 
To fix this first I tried using <code>rvm use ruby --default</code>, but I got the infamous "rvm is not a function" error.</p>

<p>To fix this, first run <code>bash --login</code> and then then <code>rvm use ruby --default</code>. </p>

<p>Once these steps are complete you can proceed with rubygems installation.</p>
