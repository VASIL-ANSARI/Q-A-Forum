<p>Just add a parameter to the URL coming from your app, other users will not have that:</p>

<pre><code>string url = "http://mysite/somepage?fromApp=v1";
</code></pre>

<p>On your website, you can pick that up to differentiate users. Do a redirect immediately after, so they will not bookmark the page with this URL.</p>
