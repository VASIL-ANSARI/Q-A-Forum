<p>You haven't written any <em>properties</em> in the code above - you've declared <em>fields</em>. The <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> does indeed make a very significant difference :)</p>

<p>If you want to get fields, just use <code>GetFields</code> - but I'd recommend that you make them properties instead. Properties work better in terms of binding etc, as well as generally being a better <em>start</em> towards encapsulation.</p>
