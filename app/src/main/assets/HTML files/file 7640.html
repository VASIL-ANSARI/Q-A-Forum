<p>For MS SQL Server, you need to query the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms191300.aspx" rel="nofollow">inserted</a> table to get the records that are being inserted.</p>

<p>Although, the <code>inserted</code> table will include all rows being inserted for that transaction.  Processing rows on a row by row isn't generally advised in SQL Server. You should be using a set based approach.  </p>

<p>Obviously, if only one row is being inserted then there will only one row in the <code>inserted</code> table.</p>
