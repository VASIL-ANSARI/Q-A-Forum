<p>You've added <code>()</code> which causes the function to execute.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var myFunc1 = function() {
    alert('Hello');
}(); // &lt;--- () causes self execution

var myFunc2 = function() {
    return 5 + 5;
};

var some_value = myFunc2(); // &lt;--- Again () causes execution (you'd expect this one)
</code></pre>

<p>In your case, as mentioned in comments you're basically telling the <code>onclick</code> to set its value to the return value of the function.</p>

<p>If you drop the <code>()</code> it should run as expected.</p>
