<p>As toolkit mentions above, Apache Commons IO is the way to go, specifically <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-release/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html" rel="nofollow">FileUtils</a>.<a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-release/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html#copyFile(java.io.File,%20java.io.File)" rel="nofollow">copyFile()</a>; it handles all the heavy lifting for you.</p>

<p>And as a postscript, note that recent versions of FileUtils (such as the 2.0.1 release) have added the use of NIO for copying files; <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t17036.html" rel="nofollow">NIO can significantly increase file-copying performance</a>, in a large part because the NIO routines defer copying directly to the OS/filesystem rather than handle it by reading and writing bytes through the Java layer.  So if you're looking for performance, it might be worth checking that you are using a recent version of FileUtils.</p>
