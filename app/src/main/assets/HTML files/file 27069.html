<p>I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to accomplish, but generally speaking a nice way to handle Ajax requests in Rails is to send back JavaScript, which is executed on arrival. For example, if you change your controller to:</p>

<pre><code>def call_sms
  @text_number = params[:phone_number]
  @text_message     = params[:text_message].to_s
  @sms = ShortMessagingService.new

  @sms.send(@text_number, @text_message)       

  respond_to do |format|
    format.js
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>and create a corresponding view call_sms.js.erb</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if @sms.sent? %&gt;
  alert("All is well!");
&lt;% else %&gt;
  alert("Something's wrong.");
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>an alert box will pop up once the response from server gets to your browser.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can respond with a JSON object which you handle in the <code>success</code> callback of <code>$.ajax</code> function.</p>
