<p>Instead of adding view on a background thread you can parcel out the work by posting several <code>Runnables</code> on the UI thread. The code below is a highly simplified version of that technique but it's similar to how it was done in Android's Launcher app:</p>

<pre><code>private void createAndAddViews(int count} {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
         // create new views and add them
    }
}

Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        createAndAddViews(4); // add 4 views
        if (mMoreViewsToAdd) mTopLevelView.post(this);
    }
};

mTopLevelView.post(r);
</code></pre>
