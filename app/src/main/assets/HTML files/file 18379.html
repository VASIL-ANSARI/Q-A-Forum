<pre><code>SELECT * AS distance FROM items ORDER BY ABS(location_lat - lat) + ABS(location_lng - lng) ASC
</code></pre>

<p>This should roughly sort the items on distance in MySQL, and <em>should</em> work in SQLite.<br>
If you need to sort them preciser, you could try using the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) to get the exact distance.</p>
