<p>It looks like Tessaract enqueues kernels with a work-group size of <code>16x16</code>, which is a fairly typical tile-size for image processing on GPUs. However, Apple's OpenCL implementation for CPUs has a limitation that work-group sizes can only be one-dimensional (i.e. the second dimension must be 1), and therefore this work-group size will be invalid. The error code you are getting (<code>-54</code>) corresponds to <code>CL_INVALID_WORK_GROUP_SIZE</code>.</p>

<p>If you can get Tesseract to run on the GPU instead (HD Graphics 5000), you should be OK.</p>
