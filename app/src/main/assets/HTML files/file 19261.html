<p><code>dayStringSum</code> is an integer, so <code>dayStringSum[n]</code> makes no sense. You'll want to turn it into a string first, and then look at its individual characters.</p>

<p>Also, you do not assign a new value to dayStringSum inside the <code>while</code> loop, so if it is >= 10 upon entering the loop, it will remain so, resulting in an infinite loop. You say that you got a final result of 4, but I fail to see how you would get a final result at all.</p>

<p>Try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>daySum = int(day)  # Ensure that day is an int before we start.

while(daySum &gt;= 10):
    newString = str(daySum)
    dayIntA = int(newString[0])
    dayIntB = int(newString[1])
    daySum = dayIntA + dayIntB  # Will be checked on next iteration.

print(daySum)
</code></pre>
