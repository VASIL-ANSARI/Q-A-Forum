<p>If you want to have C++ code in C code, use <code>extern "C++"</code> around all the C++ code which your C program uses. Then you can compile it as a C program and Haskell wouldn't even know that it's implemented using some C++ code behind the scenes.</p>

<p>EDIT: I never tried this direction (usually you use C code in a C++ project), but basically this is how it's supposed to work.</p>

<p>If it doesn't just work, try compiling the C++ program like any normal C++ program with g++, then write a C program which uses it.</p>
