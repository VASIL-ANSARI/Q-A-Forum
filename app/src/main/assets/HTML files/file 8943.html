<p>The error message means exactly what it says: it's missing the .xcdatamodel (or strictly .mom) that the database was saved with. I'd try grabbing the .xcdatamodel from an old revision and seeing if there have been accidental changes.</p>

<p>Another problem is that Xcode isn't good at deleting files which are no longer being built, both when building and when installing (Xcode is allowed to do "incremental installs" to make development quicker, and at least in previous versions, never deleted files). Instead of building MyApp.app/MyModel.mom, it's now building MyApp.app/MyModel.momd/MyModel.mom, but the old MyModel.mom might stick around and confuse whatever you're using to load the model (usually it complains about being unable to merge models, though...). The fix is to nuke the build directory and install the app using OTA/iPhone Configuration Utility/iTunes (in order of user-friendliness), and is incidentally why I tell Xcode 4 to stick build products in the project dir (the reason why they changed it is presumably because people aren't smart enough to not commit it...).</p>
