<p>In your jquery.autocomplete.js file, at around line 360 (as of the latest version), add one line to make the section look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({ 
    type: "post", // This is the new line
    // try to leverage ajaxQueue plugin to abort previous requests
    mode: "abort",
    // limit abortion to this input
    port: "autocomplete" + input.name,
</code></pre>

<p>(If you are using a minified version of the autocomplete plugin, just do a search for .ajax and insert the line as appropriate).</p>

<p>This change causes the autocomplete script will now send form data by POST, rather then GET.  Accessing this from within codeigniter can be done as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public function filter()
{
    $filter_by = $this-&gt;input-&gt;post('q');
}
</code></pre>

<p>And from this you can generate your list as required.  I'm not sure if there is a nicer way to do this (one which doesn't require you to edit the source code), but it works for me.</p>
