<p>You almost answered your own question I think, you are basically saying, I am on a crossroad where I can choose for script which executes 30 queries, or with a little more work, it could be 1 query.</p>

<p>I think it is a no go. It is much more efficient building a query statement with the values that are send. Also a best practice because mostly, you cannot predict how the application will grow.</p>

<p>I like html validation also, though browsers still handle this differently. Since most of my projects involves using jQuery, I tend to use jquery.validate plugin, which requires just a few lines extra to get a instant responsive form which is great for User Interaction. Ofcourse, serverside validation should always be in place.</p>
