<p>I usually detect the class of the theme I want to customize, and then instead of changing directly in the jquery css, (because I prefer to have udner control my changes, and ebcuase if I update the theme, don't need to add the changes again) , I add these modified classes in an "override" block or how you want to name it, so that are same classes, but with an important;! or other hierarchy trick added. For instance, calling the parent ID to give it more weight: #content .ui-widget-content {whatever}  , or .ui-widget-content {whatever property:whatever value !important;}</p>

<p>Is usually some small bits, never a large portion of things that I want to customize, so adding these 2 or 3 classes in my main.css does not hurt. It depends, though.</p>

<p>edit: Oh... with "oder" you meant "order". Sorry, was not understanding well your question (is a bit unclear). 
If you are not supporting IE7, you might be interested in using:</p>

<p>tr:nth-child(even) {background: #fff}</p>

<p>tr:nth-child(odd) {background: #000}</p>
