<p>twil is right - you need a different port for each python app.  If you're on linux as root run this command (it will tell you the other python app are runninng)</p>

<pre><code>ps -ef | grep python
</code></pre>

<p>Find the port these apps are running as and choose a different port.  You could have other non python apps using that port.  In that case you should look what's using the port...</p>
