<p>In SQL Server, timestamp is not a datetime.  It is a synonym for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182776.aspx" rel="nofollow">rowversion</a>, an 8-byte binary number generally used for version-stamping table rows, often for concurrency checking.  As such, it will not make sense to turn this into a datetime in the target system.</p>

<p>Timestamp is arguably a confusing name for this datatype.  You can find a helpful discussion <a href="http://www.sqlteam.com/article/timestamps-vs-datetime-data-types" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
