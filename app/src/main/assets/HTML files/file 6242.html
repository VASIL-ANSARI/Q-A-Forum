<p>You could create an empty index page. There's a much better solution though:
Add <code>Options -Indexes</code> to your .htaccess file; that will result in a 403 error page instead of a directory listing.</p>

<p>If you really want a blank page you can add <code>ErrorDocument 403 " "</code> to your .htaccess (don't forget the space, an empty string won't work!)</p>
