<p>The Manifest is a file named "MANIFEST.MF" in the META-INF directory. So, you need to have your final code look like this on the filesystem:</p>

<pre><code>HelloWorld.class
WEB-INF
    MANIFEST.MF
</code></pre>

<p>Then jar that up in its entirety.</p>

<p>Finally, you should also put your HelloWorld.class in to an actual package:</p>

<pre><code>package pkg;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then your final product will look like:</p>

<pre><code>pkg
    HellowWorld.class
META-INF
    MANIFEST.MF
</code></pre>

<p>And your final class name will be <code>pkg.HelloWorld</code>.</p>

<p>Things simply work better with actual packages in Java, it's best to use them right away and avoid trouble.</p>

<p>Note: Oh my mistake, I didn't catch the use of the -m flag -- So used to larger projects where the Manifest is just part of the build artifact.</p>
