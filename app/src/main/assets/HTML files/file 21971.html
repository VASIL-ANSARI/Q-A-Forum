<p>No. That's not part of the response. That's the description of the resulting <code>NSDictionary</code> which is <strong><em>NOT JSON.</em></strong></p>

<p>Sure, because <code>NSLog()</code> ain't no magic. It expects a (format) string as its first argument, so if the object you feed it is an <code>NSString</code>, it will work fine (<code>country</code> is a string, I assume), but if you don't (<code>avg_rating</code> may be an <code>NSNumber</code>), then it won't (it will try to send the messages of <code>NSString</code> to the <code>NSNumber</code> instance, which obviously fails).</p>

<p>So understand the difference between JSON and the <strong>description</strong> of the <code>NSDictionary</code> generated from that JSON.</p>
