<p>Make sure to follow the instructions given in <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.1.0/cordova_camera_camera.md.html#Camera" rel="nofollow">Phonegap Documentation</a></p>

<p>With <strong>capureImage</strong> function, you are accessing to the camera application for taking images, instead of this you should use the <strong>getPicture</strong> function with the correct <em>sourceType</em> to get a picture from your gallery.</p>

<p>Specifically, this function will open your Gallery and handle the process </p>

<pre><code>function getPhoto() {
  // Retrieve image file location from specified source
  navigator.camera.getPicture(onPhotoURISuccess, onFail, { quality: 50,
    destinationType: navigator.camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI,
    sourceType: navigator.camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note:
In <strong>Android</strong>, SAVEDPHOTOALBUM and PHOTOLIBRARY are the same for picture sourceType, if not provided, sourceType is Camera.PictureSourceType.CAMERA by default, which leads your app to retrieve the picture from Camera.</p>
