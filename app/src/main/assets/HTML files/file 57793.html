<p>What documentation says that HE-AAC supports 8 kHz sampling rate? There's also a difference between the standard itself supporting it, and this particular encoder supporting it.</p>

<p>In practice, HE-AAC uses a technique called sideband replication (SBR). This boils down to that the main AAC stream itself is of the half sample rate, and then the higher sample rate is reconstructed on top of this. If you'd encode 8 kHz audio in this way, the main AAC stream would be 4 kHz, and I'm not sure if the encoder actually supports that.</p>

<p>Therefore, HE-AAC mostly makes sense if you have got a high sample rate - it doesn't make much sense to try to use it for a 8 kHz audio stream.</p>
