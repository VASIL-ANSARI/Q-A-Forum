<p>There is a project <a href="http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpdcd" rel="nofollow">Dead Code Detector (DCD)</a>.</p>

<p>It finds functions that are never called, which may help to clean up even the files you keep in production.</p>

<p>For finding out unused files, no firm software/algorithm exists for PHP (at least as per my knowledge).</p>

<p>For finding unused files, I think we should do it manually.</p>
