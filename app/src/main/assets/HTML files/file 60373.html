<p>It depends... For some operations, like ORDER BY, it does not matter as index is bidirectional, so sorting is not needed.</p>

<p>But for other operations, like Ranking, Index Scan, etc., it matters. SQL Engine is designed to perform forward index scan with parallelism, but if query optimizer needs a reverse index scan, such operation is single-threaded. So it may affect the performance if you choose incorrect sort order.</p>

<p>It really depends on the data and queries in your database, so I'm suggesting to capture most frequent user queries (against that table) and check their execution plans and IO stats for two different sort orders.</p>

<p>Also it can cause index fragmentation if data are added not in the same order as index sort order.</p>
