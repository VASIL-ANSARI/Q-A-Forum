<p>As a good practice its better to include column names in the select statement itself. Because the structure of the table can change in the future, and you would be pulling unwanted data..</p>

<p><strong>Performance wise</strong></p>

<p>When you use select * , sql server compiler has to replace the * with column names, which is an additional task, but I think that is negligible</p>
