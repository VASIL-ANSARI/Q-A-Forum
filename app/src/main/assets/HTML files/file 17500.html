<p>Not exactly an answer to your question, but I had a getActivity() to return null when used a Handler in a DialogFragment. Even if Handler had a link to DialogFragment instance it still had getActivity() as null in handleMessage() method. Would be glad to hear why does it happen.</p>

<p>P.S. Even more strange, what the first time this DialogFragment is created everything is fine. When we create a new instance of this DialogFragment he getActivity() in Handler starts to return null.</p>

<p>I suspect, that while we create a new DialogFragment, the Handler inside  somehow still attached to the old one (which already is detached and doesn't have activity)</p>

<p>Must admit, that my Handler is not static as recommended.</p>

<p>P.P.S I use compat lib for fragments</p>
