<p><code>shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:</code> is a <code>UIViewController</code> method. The application delegate doesn't make use of that method. You should create a <code>UIViewController</code> subclass and put your content on its view. You will have to set appropriate <code>autoresizingMasks</code> on the view or relay your views on every rotation.</p>

<p>But if you intend to persist on using the application delegate, you should use the <code>UIDevice</code> singleton to generate notifications on orientation changes which you can listen to. </p>
