<p>I don't think you've explained it very well <em>with</em> your example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I  want to get a list of learner_ids where activity_ids 1, 2 and 3 exist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How you do that depends on the structure of the table. Assuming that a unique constraint exists on learner_id and activity_id then you can do this simply with:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT learner_id
FROM yourtable
WHERE activity_id IN (1,2,3)
GROUP BY learner_id
HAVING COUNT(*)=3
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have the unique constraint, then you'd need to use:</p>

<pre><code>HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity_id)=3
</code></pre>

<p>How well this performs would depend on the number of people with all three activities compared with the number missing on or more. In some cases this may be much faster:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT a.learner_id
FROM yourtable a
, yourtable b
, yourtable c
WHERE a.learner_id=b.learner_id
AND a.learner_id=c.learner_id
AND a.activity_id=1
AND b.activity_id=2
AND c.activity_id=3
;
</code></pre>
