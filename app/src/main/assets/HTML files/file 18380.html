<p>If you are just adding existing teams, you can do with a collection_select, and add</p>

<pre><code>attr_accessible :teams_ids
</code></pre>

<p>On the other side, if you need to create teams, you'll need</p>

<pre><code>accept_nested_attributes_for :teams
</code></pre>

<p>(all this depends that you have set <code>has_many :teams, :through =&gt; :campaign_teams</code> in the <code>Campaign</code> class)</p>
