<p>If the values can be null but the keys cannot be null then having a null key would mean that there is no key.</p>

<p>If the key can also be null you can use a parallel array of booleans to store whether each space is taken or not.</p>

<pre><code>K[] keys;
V[] values;
boolean[] hasValue;
</code></pre>
