<p>Is this a design issue? Telephone number, work telephone number and mobile are different classes that should probably inherit from abstract telephone number class. </p>

<p>This would then allow you to annotate each type of telephone number as you feel necessary. I would also specify REGEX for validating format of each number. </p>

<p>Thing to think about is what happens if one day I say that work telephone number should have extension as well as the number? </p>

<p>Lookup single responsibility principle, this might help. Good luck.</p>
