<p>I think there's nothing utterly wrong with nesting arrays etc.!
Did you take a look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Collections/Articles/IndexPaths.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010167-SW1" rel="nofollow">Index Paths</a> (And <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSIndexPath_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSIndexPath/indexAtPosition%3a" rel="nofollow">NSIndexPath class reference</a>)?</p>

<p>You probably still have to code a little bit to get things done, but the methods of NSIndexPath will help you!</p>
