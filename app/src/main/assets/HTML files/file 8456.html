<p>The first approach I would try is to use the wxString constructor:</p>

<pre><code>wxString(const wxChar* psz, size_t nLength = wxSTRING_MAXLEN)
</code></pre>

<p>and pass the const char* string to it to create the object.</p>

<p>Then write some inline functions to convert from python string to wxString and vice versa.</p>

<pre><code>PyObject* PyString_FromStringAndSize(const char *v, Py_ssize_t len)
</code></pre>

<p>Now the only downside I see is that the string might be duplicate in wxString and python world.</p>

<p>A Second Approach would be to subclass wxString and hand reimplement all the operations in a way that uses the Python's PyString Object character buffer. Cython can help in coding such subclass.</p>
