<p>Theoretically, each parameter should encompass a logical whole. Collections are meant to represent a collection of values, not an aggregate of method parameters; the individual parameters should be passed separately to clearly indicate the purpose of the method.</p>

<p>Practically, when passing parameters in an array, you have to do a ton of manual checks to ensure that correct parameters have been passed. You can avoid pretty much any ambiguity by giving your parameters clear, logical names (and typehints where possible). Also, as a comment already stated, if a method takes 7 parameters, it's probably ripe for some refactoring.</p>

<p>Edit: if your method/function <em>does</em> accept a set of vaguely defined "options" that affect what the code does only in a minor way, consider using the Symfony <a href="https://github.com/symfony/OptionsResolver" rel="nofollow">OptionsResolver</a> component, to greatly ease the validation of your options array.</p>
