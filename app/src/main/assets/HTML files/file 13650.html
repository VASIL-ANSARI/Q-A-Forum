<p>If you want to print <code>the color is GREEN</code>, for example, then I think you'll have to write your own algorithm and setup some thresholds defining when you think a color turns from one name to another (e.g. from GREEN to BLUE). You would then pass the color code to that algorithm and get back the name of that color.</p>

<p>Writing such an algorithm doesn't even have to be that complicated. You could compare the base color components of your custom color and find the dominant component. Depending how much it dominates you can find your thresholds and hence your color names.</p>
