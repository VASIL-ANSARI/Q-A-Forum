<p>I don't know the standard, but I say it's not. At least, I don't like to do it like that.</p>

<p>You can check occupied ports by parsing the outputs of programs like <code>netstat</code> and avoid using those. You can also use the method that attempts connecting on one port, and upon failure, tries another port. Unless you're really really unlucky, you should get a valid port on second try.</p>

<p>You should use ports within the ranges of 49152â65535. Ports below 49152 are reserved/registered.</p>
