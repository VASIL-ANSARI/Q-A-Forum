<p>Since you provide no code of your website, I can only assume that you are using a query to insert data into the database? Should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>$query = "INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1,value2,...)";
</code></pre>

<p>To update, you can use the same type of form, except the query would be:</p>

<pre><code>$query = "UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE some_column = some_value";
</code></pre>

<p>You can find more information here: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp</a>
If you want more help, show us more code and tell us what the column names are in the database. I can the provide exact variables to put in the query.</p>
