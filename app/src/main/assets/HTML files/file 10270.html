<p><code>List.add</code> returns <code>boolean</code>, which is being autoboxed to <code>Boolean</code>. Your else clause is creating a LinkedList, calling a method on it (<code>add</code>) that returns boolean, and putting the resulting autoboxed Boolean into the map.</p>

<p>Do you know about generics? You should type w as a <code>Map&lt;String,List&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> instead of just a Map. If you did that, this error would have been caught at compile time.</p>
