<p>Your best best it to do nothing. ASP.NET Health Monitoring will write an event to the event log containing most of the data you could need.</p>

<p>If that's not enough information for you, then you should look into wrapping certain of your exceptions in an outer exception which includes the additional data. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>string fileSpec = " ... ";
try
{
    using (var stream = new FileStream(fileSpec))
    {
        // Something
    }
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    throw new Exception(String.Format("Error processing {0}", fileSpec), ex);
}
</code></pre>
