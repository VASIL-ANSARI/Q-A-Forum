<p>I don't know if this is good news, or bad news. I was able to get my two tests to work using the data you provided.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pastebin.com/z5YxUew1" rel="nofollow">Code Example 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pastebin.com/fLkGbZEU" rel="nofollow">Code Example 2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pastebin.com/WH6b4uKM" rel="nofollow">Results</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The first code example was using my sample code with the data you provided. The sample code is using the code you provided above with the line items manually added by me. You can see the request and response XML in the third code sample.</p>

<p>While we work through this here's some tips that may be useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>In your sample data provided above, in the second line item I saw a couple of dashes <code>--</code> randomly in there. Are they in your code? Or was that just a cut &amp; paste error?</li>
<li>Authorize.Net doesn't really care if numeric values are passed in quotes so putting them in there is always a good idea.</li>
</ul>
