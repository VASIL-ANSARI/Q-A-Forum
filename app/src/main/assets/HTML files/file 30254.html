<p>I'm not sure it will work but it worth a try.</p>

<p>When using <code>sys.path.insert(1, "PATH TO PACKAGE1")</code> it places the "PATH TO PACKAGE1" as the first place to look for the package.</p>

<p>So by doing:</p>

<pre><code>sys.path.insert(1, "PATH TO PACKAGE1")
sys.path.insert(1, "PATH TO PACKAGE2")
import ....PACKAGE1
import ....PACKAGE2
</code></pre>

<p>you will have a conflict since it first will go to look at place of PACKAGE2 since PACKAGE2  will be the first item in the list...</p>

<p>Can you try:</p>

<pre><code>sys.path.insert(1, "PATH TO PACKAGE1")
from Package1 import a as Package1 
sys.path.insert(1, "PATH TO PACKAGE2")
from Package2 import a as Package2 
</code></pre>
