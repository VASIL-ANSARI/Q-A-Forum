<p>The point of issue in you question is which main method is getting called, 
the StdDraw class has a main method too,</p>

<p>so my 1st recommendation is to verify, whether your app is trying to run over the main method in the <strong>StdDrar class</strong> or the <strong>Lineage class</strong>.</p>

<p>is you are developing in eclipse, then right click on the Lineage class--> run as..  and select java application...</p>

<p>will run </p>
