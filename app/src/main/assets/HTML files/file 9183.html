<p>To the best of my knowledge, you won't be quite able to do this with built-in classes.</p>

<p>You can use <code>StreamReader</code> on a <code>NetworkStream</code> to read whole lines, but you will need to code the async part yourself as <code>StreamReader</code> does not expose an async interface. Alternatively, you could use <code>NetworkStream.BeginRead</code> which is async, but then you would have to write the code to make it recognize line-based input.</p>
