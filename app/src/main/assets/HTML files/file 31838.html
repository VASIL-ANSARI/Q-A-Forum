<p><strong>Password Transmission</strong></p>

<p>The easy way to secure this is to just send passwords over SSL.  If you set up an SSL certificate and do all your authentication over https, all the back-and-forth communication is encrypted by the transport layer.  Note - <code>md5</code> is not an encryption algorithm, it's a weak hashing algorithm - don't use it for security.</p>

<p><strong>Storing Logins</strong>  </p>

<p>Your passwords should be stored in the database as a salted hash (random salt, with a collision-resistant hash function such as SHA256).  Don't store the plaintext version of the password anywhere.  If you're using PHP on the server side, you can use the new <code>password_hash()</code> function or <code>crypt()</code> to generate and compare your salted hashes.</p>

<p>If you're communicating securely over SSL, you should be able to just use the session capabilities of your web server to keep track of logins (e.g., <code>$_SESSION['user_id'] = ...</code>).</p>
