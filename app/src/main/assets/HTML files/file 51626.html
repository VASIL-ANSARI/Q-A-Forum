<p>This looks like <code>capistrano</code> is still using the old git remote address. When you change the remote url, it is not enough to do this inside <code>deploy.rb</code> etc, but you have to manually change the file <code>repo/config</code> inside the deployment dir of capistrono on the server when you already deployed it with an old remote url before.</p>

<p>So, if you have the following inside your <code>deploy.rb</code> (or <code>deploy/production.rb</code>)</p>

<pre><code>set :deploy_to, '/var/www/path/to/deploy'
</code></pre>

<p>You have to manually edit the <strong>file on the server</strong></p>

<pre><code>/var/www/path/to/deploy/repo/config
</code></pre>

<p>and amend the <code>url = XXX</code> entry of your remote to match the new one.</p>
