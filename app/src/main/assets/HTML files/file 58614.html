<p>Printing anything or everything via a loop is just about understanding the flow of execution. In your code also, if you'll start watching the flow line by line you'll come to know that how it is working exactly.</p>

<p>If you understand how it works, you would be able to print any pattern, but basics should be clear. Try printing variable i, j and k values after each iteration. See the values that how that gets changed after each cycle of execution and then see the logic you've applied.</p>

<p>Your question is somewhat very broad in scope and can not be answered exactly unless narrowed it down. I would suggest to run this line by line and watch the output, try more changes even if it doesn't make any sense, you'll be having a good understanding over looping even for all of your future tasks. And if after trying yourself, you come to any problem, share here, people are ready to solve them. :)</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
