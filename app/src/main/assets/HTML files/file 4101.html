<p>You should use a regex.  You can capture the first word up until whitespace, then the next three words separated by whitespace, then the thing in the angle brackets.</p>

<p>this works</p>

<pre><code>(\w+)\s+(\w+\s+\w+\s+\w+)\s*&lt;(.*)&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>\w means any word character.  The + means 1 or more.  \s means any whitespace character.  Things in () are captured.  The regex you would use in java code is</p>

<pre><code>(\\w+)\\s+(\\w+\\s+\\w+\\s+\\w+)\\s*&lt;(.*)&gt;
</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<p>note that you could do this with splits, but anytime you are splitting, then getting the tokens, then splitting tokens, then getting more tokens, then splitting again, you are doing something too complicated.  Regex greatly simplifies things.  </p>
