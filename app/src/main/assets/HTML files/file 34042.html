<p>You try to use another server to log in: <code>http://159.149.130.120/ruben/final/web/app_dev.php/login</code>.
It is not right. Your cookies (and session) is set up to the <code>159.149.130.120</code> server but you want it would be available on the <code>trivialarbitros.tk</code>. If you want to do cross-domain authorization you need another approach. I recommend you to use only one server for all your logic.</p>
