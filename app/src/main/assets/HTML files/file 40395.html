<p>I assume you are using absolute (full) file paths (because in the provided code its just commented), but AssetManager expects internals (you are creating it using default constructor, not specifying a FileHandleResolver). I tried your code using</p>

<pre><code>String fileName = "texture.jpg";
</code></pre>

<p>and putting a texture.jpg file in /project/android/assets/ and it works fine. Just put your internal assets in that folder, change your file path to internal and it should work.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I really think that using absolute paths is not a good idea, since not all backends accept it, and even if you only deploy to desktop, it makes non sense to have your assets in a location outside your jar is. Anyway, this code works for me, for absolute paths:</p>

<pre><code>      AbsoluteFileHandleResolver fileHandleResolver = new AbsoluteFileHandleResolver();
      AssetManager manager = new AssetManager(fileHandleResolver);
      //This could be anywhere else
      String fileName = "/home/javier/texture.jpg";

      if (!new FileHandle(fileName).exists()) {
            Gdx.app.error(TAG, "invalid file '" + fileName + "'");
            Gdx.app.exit();
      }

      if (!manager.isLoaded(fileName, Texture.class))
            manager.load(fileName, Texture.class);

      manager.finishLoading();

      if (manager.isLoaded(fileName, Texture.class))
            Gdx.app.log(TAG, "Texture loaded!");
      else
            Gdx.app.log(TAG, "Texture not loaded!");
</code></pre>
