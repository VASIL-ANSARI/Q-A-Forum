<p>Each member of <code>IPHostEntry.AddressList</code> is a <code>IPAddress</code> which has a property <code>AddressFamily</code> which you can use to filter for a specific family.</p>

<p>E.g. IPv4 addresses only:</p>

<pre><code>from address in Dns.GetHostEntry(Dns.GetHostName()).AddressList
where address.AddressFamily == AddressFamily.InterNetwork
select address.ToString()
</code></pre>

<p>(Change to <code>AddressFamily.InterNetworkV6</code> to limit to IPv6 addresses.)</p>

<p>EDIT: Clearly this is a code change, so either (1) filter at the interface to the third party library, (2) get a "better" library, or (3) it is a feature and make your application work with IPv6 (which it is likely to need in the next few years anyway).</p>
