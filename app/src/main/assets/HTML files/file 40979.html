<p>Your intuition is right, I don't know how exactly to reload the database either however what I would say is that because your writing an integration test just focus on how the user see's the site.</p>

<p>If you gave your test a few more steps like navigating to the "Alien" movie page and checking to see if the director shown on the page is "Ridley Scott" you would know that the director has been changed in your database but also that it is being displayed in your view (something that is not checked by checking the database directly).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations" rel="nofollow">Rspec expectations</a> is great for checking page content.</p>

<p>eg </p>

<p><code>expect(page).to have_text("Director: #{director})</code></p>
