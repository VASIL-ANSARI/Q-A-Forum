<blockquote>
  <p>The resizeMode attribute specifies the rules by which a widget can be resized. You use this attribute to make homescreen widgets resizeableâhorizontally, vertically, or on both axes. Users touch-hold a widget to show its resize handles, then drag the horizontal and/or vertical handles to change the size on the layout grid. Values for the resizeMode attribute include "horizontal", "vertical", and "none". To declare a widget as resizeable horizontally and vertically, supply the value "horizontal|vertical". Introduced in Android 3.1.</p>
