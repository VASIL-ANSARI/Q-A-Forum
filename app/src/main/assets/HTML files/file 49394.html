<p>It's a problem with your indentation. Just don't indent</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = simpleapp_tk(None)
    app.title('my application')
    app.mainloop()
</code></pre>

<p>In your current code the if statement is executed while <code>simpleapp_tk</code> is being defined, thus <code>name 'simpleapp_tk' is not defined</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation" rel="nofollow">Indentation</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.</p>
