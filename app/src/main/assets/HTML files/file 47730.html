<p>Found the issue: A lot of my posts were imported using a "Wordpress to Jekyll" converter and it looks like it left the "title:" field blank in the Front Matter of a few of those posts. Just wish the error would have been a bit more specific.</p>

<p>I guess the lesson at the end of the day is: don't leave your Front Matter blank, folks!</p>
