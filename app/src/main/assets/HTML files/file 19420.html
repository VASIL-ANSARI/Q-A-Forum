<p>This has been the default action since 5.1.
From the iOS 6 release notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In iOS 5.1, the UISplitViewController class adopts the sliding
  presentation style when presenting the left view (previously seen only
  in Mail). This style is used when presentation is initiated either by
  the existing bar button item provided by the delegate methods or by a
  swipe gesture within the right view. No additional API adoption is
  required to obtain this behavior, and all existing APIsâincluding that
  of the UIPopoverController instance provided by the delegateâwill
  continue to work as before.</p>
  
  <p>If the gesture would be insupportable in your app, setting the
  presentsWithGesture property of your split view controller to NO
  disables the gesture. However, disabling the gesture is discouraged
  because its use preserves a consistent user experience across all
  apps.</p>

<p>There's a <a href="http://www.i4-apps.com/splitviewcontroller-popovers/">dirty way</a> to fix this.</p>
