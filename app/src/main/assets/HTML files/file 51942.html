<p>Templatetags are not like blocks - think about them more like as <strong>methods</strong>. The error you are getting is due to bad syntax then.</p>

<p>To implement something like this just create a filter that will check a condition (exactly like your tag is doing now) and will return <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong> then use it like</p>

<pre><code>    {% if request|your_filter_name:"condition" %}
        &lt;p&gt; do_sth &lt;/p&gt;
    {% endif %}
</code></pre>

<p>by using default django-template <strong>if</strong> block</p>

<hr>

<p>Please notice that you cannot use tags in <strong>if</strong> blocks - that's why you need to change it to being filter (by adding <code>register.filter</code> instead of <code>register.tag</code>). Nothing will change but syntax:</p>

<pre><code>    request|your_filter:"condition"
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>    your_tag request "condition"
</code></pre>
