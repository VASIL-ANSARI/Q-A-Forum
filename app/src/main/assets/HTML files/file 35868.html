<p>I've managed to fix it by myself, it's a library bug.
If someone has the same problem, you have to add the following additional IF statment at line 110 of <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/+/master/src/com/android/volley/toolbox/BasicNetwork.java" rel="nofollow">BasicNetwork.java</a> </p>

<pre><code>// If request method is HEAD, there is no need to allocate
// memory
if (request.getMethod() == Request.Method.HEAD) {
     responseContents = new byte[0];
}
// Some responses such as 204s do not have content. We must
// check.
else if (httpResponse.getEntity() != null) {
    responseContents = entityToBytes(httpResponse.getEntity());
} else {
    // Add 0 byte response as a way of honestly representing a
    // no-content request.
    responseContents = new byte[0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Doing so, Volley doesn't allocate anymore Content-Length memory.
Thank you anyway if anyone has tried to help me with no result.</p>
