<p>Join clause combines records from two or more tables in a relational database.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>If you have two table called <code>Vendors</code> and <code>Invoices</code>. Now, you are looking for common data between both table on the basis of id i.e. <code>VendorId</code>. </p>

<p>But, first of all, you need to access column of a table. So, you need to specify <strong>which table</strong> and <strong>which column</strong>. Then, it goes like <code>mytable.thiscolumn</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, in your case you were trying to access <code>VendorId</code> column, which exist in both tables. So, you are explicitly telling, I need <code>VendorId</code> from the <code>Vendors</code> and <code>Invoices</code>.</p>
