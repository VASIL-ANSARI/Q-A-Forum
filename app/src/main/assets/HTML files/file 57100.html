  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It sounds like really bad practice to create individual classes for each margin direction and size combination. They would become very tedious maintain and so I wouldn't recommend it. But the answer to your question is - <em>Yes, you can do it with Less.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use Less loops to iterate through the list of values, directions and then create the selectors and property-value pairs using interpolation. Below is a sample code (inline comments added for the purpose of clarity/explanation).</p>

<pre><code>@values: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30; /* the values */

.margin-utility(@values; @directions...){ /* utility wrapper mixin which takes values and directions */
    .loop-directions(@i) when (@i &gt; 0) { /* iterate through each direction value */
        @direction: extract(@directions, @i);
        .create-margin(@values; @direction); /* call margin creation mixin with current direction */
        .loop-directions(@i - 1); /* call next iteration */
    }
    .loop-directions(length(@directions)); /* call first iteration */
}
.create-margin(@values; @direction){ /* mixin to loop through values and create classes */
    .loop-values(@j) when (@j &gt; 0) { /* iterate through each value */
        @value: extract(@values, @j);
        .margin-@{direction}-@{value}{ /* create selector through selector interpolation */
            margin-@{direction}: unit(@value, px); /* create property through property interpolation */
        }
        .loop-values(@j - 1);
    }
    .loop-values(length(@values));
}
.margin-utility(@values; top, bottom, left);
</code></pre>
