<p>use <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/parsing.html" rel="nofollow"><code>lxml</code></a>, it is very efficient as it is written in <code>c</code>, another popular HTML parser is there <code>BeautifulSoup</code> but again it is based on sgmllib so i would recommend that you should go for <code>lxml</code>.</p>
