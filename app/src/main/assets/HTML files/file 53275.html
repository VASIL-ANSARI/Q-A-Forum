<p>Shortly after I posted the question, I found the solution myself. In short, the solution is whenever a new MyLocationNewOverlay is added, the old MyLocationNewOverlay must be disabled BEFORE removal by calling:</p>

<pre><code>MyLocationNewOverlay.disableMyLocation();
MyLocationNewOverlay.disableFollowLocation(); // if you enabled this function on the overlay
</code></pre>

<p>Simply removing the overlay wouldn't work because the callback is still holding the reference of the overlay.</p>

<p>Of course, the best practice is to have only one MyLocationNewOverlay and manage the same (I made the mistake of adding a new one). I hope this will help someone with the same problem.</p>
