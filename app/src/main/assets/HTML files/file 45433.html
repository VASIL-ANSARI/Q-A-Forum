<p>I've been struggling with this too last week. I doubt there is a way to modify the default vibration duration in Phonegap as there is no way to achieve this with the iOS API. The default vibration:</p>

<pre><code>AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate)
</code></pre>

<p>lasts 4 milliseconds with one millisecond of silence. You can try to chain the same method several times but there will be always an interruption between two calls. I think there is no way to make a lengthy vibration that lasts more than 4 milliseconds :( </p>
