<p>Yes, recursion can be used for this problem.</p>

<p>Hint to get you started:  If you have <code>M</code> apples and <code>N</code> buckets, then one subset of the solutions can be found by putting <code>m &lt;= M</code> apples into the first bucket, and then finding all solutions to the subproblem with <code>(M - m)</code> apples and <code>N - 1</code> buckets.</p>
