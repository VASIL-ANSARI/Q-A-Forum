<p>It would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>val_dict = {}
for line in open('a.txt'):
    vals = line.strip().split(', ', 3)                                                                                                                                
    val_dict[vals[0]] = tuple(vals[1:])
</code></pre>

<p>But that doesn't look like a big problem, more like a homework :)</p>
