  <p>Cant import DrawerLayout from android-support-v13</p>

<p>That's because the <code>DrawerLayout</code> isn't in the v13 support library - it's in the v4 support library.</p>

<p>The answer with the most votes in the question you link to is actually incorrect with its advice when it says "Select latest version folder, i.e. v13".</p>

<p>The versions v4, v7 &amp; v13 don't represent the versions of the libraries themselves - they indicate which version of Android each one supports back to.</p>

<p>In other words the v4 support library adds newer functionality to devices running API 4 (Android v1.6) onwards, the v7 library adds newer functionality to devices running API 7 (Android v2.1) onwards and v13 adds functionality to devices running API 13 (Android 3.2) onwards.</p>

<p>You need the v4 support library - not the v13 support library.</p>
