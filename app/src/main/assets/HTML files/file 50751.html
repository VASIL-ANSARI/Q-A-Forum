<p>First, check whether the value exists in the line. If it does, then do your pattern matching, then check the startswith, then check if it exists <em>anywhere</em> else.</p>

<p><a href="https://repl.it/BZ4s/2" rel="nofollow">https://repl.it/BZ4s/2</a>  &lt;-- you can test it, here</p>

<pre><code>import re
from cStringIO import StringIO
f = StringIO("AAA - IamOK\n#AAA - IamCOMMENT\nIamOTHER\nAnother line AAA balgh")
cfgvalue = "AAA"

for line in f:
    if cfgvalue in line:
        if re.match(r'#\s*' + cfgvalue, line):
            print "found it commented out"
        elif line[:len(cfgvalue)] == cfgvalue:
            print "found it at start of line"
        else:
            print "found it at {}".format(line.index(cfgvalue))
    else:
        print "not found"
</code></pre>

<p>Results:</p>

<pre><code>found it at start of line
found it commented out
not found
found it at 13
</code></pre>

<p>This may even help identify whatever specific problem, as I've added a case to check for this <code>cfgvalue</code> at <em>any</em> position in the line. Perhaps there is whitespace or non-printing characters in which case you might want to do:</p>

<pre><code>for line in [l.strip() for l in f]:
</code></pre>
