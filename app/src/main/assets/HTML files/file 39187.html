<p>Sitecore will only bring back a certain number of search results.  Whether you are using .Page() or .Take() to limit how many results you are getting back, or Sitecore or your Search API is limiting the maximum number of results that will be returned via settings like ContentSearch.SearchMaxResults, you won't always get all the results back in your dataset.</p>

<p>TotalSearchResults will show you how many results are possible from your search query.  Hits().Count() is only showing you how many you have access to in your returned dataset.  You will want to use .Page() to get access to the additional search results that are beyond the number of Hits() you are currently getting.</p>
