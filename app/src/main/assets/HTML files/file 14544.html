<p>Your problem is that when you execute</p>

<pre><code>parent = new BinaryTreeNode(words.get(curIndex));
</code></pre>

<p>That does <em>not</em> assign a value to <code>parent</code> as far as the caller is concerned, so it doesn't get propagated back up the call stack.</p>

<p>You want to code to look something like this (taking out code not relevant to the problem):</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    // keep a reference to the root node so you can access the tree after loading
    BinaryTreeNode root = new BinaryTreeNode();
    // pass the root node into the first call to the recursive method
    saveNode(root, left, right);
}

public void saveNode(BinaryTreeNode parent, int left, int right) {
    // keep building your tree as you descend into it
    parent.left = new BinaryTreeNode();
    parent.right = new BinaryTreeNode();
    // pass the (new) branches into deeper calls     
    saveNode(parent.left, left, curIndex);
    saveNode(parent.right, curIndex, right);
}
</code></pre>
