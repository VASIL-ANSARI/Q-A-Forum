<p>Try this</p>

<pre><code>^[A-Z]{2}\s[0-9]{2}\s[A-Z]{2}\s[0-9]{4}$
</code></pre>

<p>^ means start of string <br/>
[A-Z]{2} means 2 characters in the range of A through Z<br/>
\s means white space<br/>
[0-9]{2} means 2 characters in the range of 0 through 9<br/>
\s means white space<br/>
[A-Z]{2} means 2 characters in the range of A through Z<br/>
\s means white space<br/>
[0-9]{4} means 4 characters in the range of 0 through 9<br/>
$ means end of string<br/></p>

<p>Based on what you said in your question this should be a very broad check against proper format, but I have a feeling that there are more specific regulations on how the license plates are numbered. Let me know if there are additional constraints for the regex.</p>
