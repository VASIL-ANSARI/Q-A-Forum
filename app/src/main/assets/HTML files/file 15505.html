<p>Structure fields are in different namespaces - that can't be the problem. You can even have global variables with the same names as the fields. I find the <a href="http://c-faq.com/decl/namespace.html" rel="nofollow">C FAQ</a> is very clear on this subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are four different kinds of namespaces, for:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>labels (i.e. goto targets);</li>
  <li>tags (names of structures, unions, and enumerations; these three    aren't separate even though they theoretically could be);</li>
  <li>structure/union members (<strong>one namespace per structure or union</strong>);</li>
  <li>everything else (functions, variables, typedef names, enumeration    constants), termed ``ordinary identifiers'' by the Standard</li>
  </ul>
