<p>Progress (OpenEdge) has two "personalities" -- SQL and 4GL.</p>

<p>The 4GL (or "ABL") engine is most commonly used and it does not care how wide a field is.  All data is variable width.  The width is just a suggestion for display formatting purposes and is routinely ignored by programmers.</p>

<p>Naturally this gives SQL tools fits.</p>

<p>There is a tool provided to ease your pain -- "dbtool" will scan the database and adjust the "sql-width" to reflect the actual maximum width that it finds in the data.  This is commonly run on a regular basis (usually weekly or monthly) in most Progress shops that use SQL.</p>
