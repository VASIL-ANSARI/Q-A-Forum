<p>The culprit is this guy:</p>

<pre><code>Int (int size){ data = size; };
</code></pre>

<p>Since it is not marked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/121162/what-does-the-explicit-keyword-in-c-mean"><code>explicit</code></a>, that is an implicit constructor, and the compiler will automatically shove a call to it in contexts where you have an <code>int</code> but a function (or operator) is expecting an <code>Int</code>.</p>

<p>So, for example, the compiler resolves</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt;  3 + int1 &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt;  Int(3) + int1 &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p>automatically.</p>

<p>It is often a good idea to use the <code>explicit</code> keyword to force this kind of code to be more explicit, however, it should be mentioned that implicit construction is heavily used in very prominent code, most notably the C++ Standard Library, where, for example, a <code>std::string</code> can be implicitly constructed from a <code>const char*</code>. It's a tradeoff between convenience and clarity.</p>
