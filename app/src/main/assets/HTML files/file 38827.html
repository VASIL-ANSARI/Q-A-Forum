<p>There are many ways to render text but one of the simplest is called bitmap font rendering.</p>

<p>All you need to get started is a sprite sheet with all of the letters you might want to render. Then you simply render a quad with the texture coordinates set to the location of the character you want to draw. To render a full sentence, just draw a bunch of quads, each representing a single letter.</p>

<p>Your sprite sheet will look something like the following texture.</p>

<p>Once you have that, you'll need the texture coordinates, essentially (x, y) coordinates in the range 0 to 1, for each character in the sprite texture. Use these when generating quad meshes. You'll end up drawing something like this to the screen:</p>

<p>Now that you have text on the screen, you can get fancy and take into account the glyph kerning between the letters. This allows you to render more natural text.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't find a tutorial to point you to. And its not really something that I can whip together for you here. There are many pieces to the puzzle and its no small task (matrix math, camera's, orthographic projection, texture coords, textures, sprites, generating meshes, etc...).</p>

<p>If you'd like you can look through one of my projects where I have done this with WebGL. I even generate the initial sprite sheet using javascript + 2d canvas.</p>

<h3>Or You Could</h3>

<p>Watch Notch (the guy who made Minecraft) do this, in only about 30 minutes, in Java (fast forward to 2:21 hours in):</p>
