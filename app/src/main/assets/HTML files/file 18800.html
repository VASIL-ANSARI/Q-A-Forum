<p>It's a list, isn't it? That give you one of the three: <code>ol</code>, <code>ul</code> or <code>dl</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>If it's an <strong>ordered list</strong>, i.e. the order of the elements have meaning, use an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>If it's an <strong>unordered list</strong>, i.e. the order of the elements have no meaning, use an <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>If it's a definition list, i.e. it lists definitions throughout the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or document, use a <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever is more semantic. HTML is never about efficiency, it's about semantics. Write semantically, then you by definition write efficiently.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding the display of such elements, it's more up to your CSS.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what way you choose, no way in hell you can display thousands of items on the page at once, and hope the user to accept them all. A pagination of some sort is probably mandatory.</p>
