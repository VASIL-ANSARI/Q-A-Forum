<p>Okay, so it sounds like you're reasonably new to iOS development. In iOS, the convention is to use a Modal View Controller. These are temporary views that appear overtop of other views. This view can house your form and then you can collect the data from that form as you see fit. </p>

<p>Good luck! :D</p>
