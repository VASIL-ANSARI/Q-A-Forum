<li>Don't do I/O in a painting method. Painting methods are for painting only.</li>
<li>Don't invoke repaint() in a painting method. This will cause an infinite loop.</li>
</ol>

<p>Read the image into a variable of your class in the constructor of your class using ImageIO so the image is available when it is time to paint the image. ImageIO will generate a message if the image is not found.</p>
