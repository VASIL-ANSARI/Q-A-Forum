<p>This would be a compiler bug. The compiler sees <code>__attribute__</code> followed by two opening parentheses, some other tokens and then two closing parentheses, which is probably the &ldquo;definition&rdquo; of what an <code>__attribute__</code> should look like, e.g.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;attribute&gt; ::= <code>__attribute__</code> <code>'(('</code> something <code>'))'</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My guess is that the tokens in between are being interpreted as <code>aligned(16</code> and by some miracle it still works.</p>
