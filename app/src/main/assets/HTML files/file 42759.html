<p>OK guys, just found my own answer now, after asking this question just a few minutes ago.
Affirmatively, the error was produced because of the length of the code, more exactly because the length of one of the java methods, so I divided the largest method (which had approx. 7.000 lines, and the rest of the methods together just had 300 more or less..) and now I have a new method, having the old one with 3.500 lines and the new one with the other 3.500 lines, I've run the project and perfect!</p>
