<p>As per your code your are sending database value again to confirm.php not the user selected value.
For this, assign name to  like  ..and instead of anchor click use form submission.. it will work.</p>

<p>Another solution.
You can call onchange event on  where javascript function will get call and will update selected value in database via Ajax..Hope this logic will help you</p>
