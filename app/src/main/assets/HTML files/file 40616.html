<pre><code>Quadratic_Formula work = new Quadratic_Formula();
double posAnswer = work.posquadForm(ax, bx, c);
double negAnswer = work.negquadForm(ax, bx, c);

System.out.println("Your answer is" +posAnswer  +"or" + negAnswer  +".");
</code></pre>

<p>Your functions <code>posquadForm</code> &amp; <code>negquadForm</code> have already computed the answers, you just need to store them in variables and print them out?</p>
