<p>Note: "after the page loads" can mean many things, so I interpreted it as "after all html loaded", figuring that's a fairly robust interpretation.</p>

<p>This should take care of you, with a little vanilla Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  console.log("Whatup Homie!!!");
});
</code></pre>
