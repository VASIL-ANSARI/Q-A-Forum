<p>You are receiving that error because the response that comes from the server is empty and the <code>NSJSONSerialization</code> class cannot work with a nil <code>NSData</code>.</p>

<p>To avoid the crash, sorrund the json parsing with the following condition:</p>

<pre><code>NSError* error;
if (responseData != nil) {
     resposeDataDict =  [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData: responseData options: NSJSONReadingMutableContainers error: &amp;error];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you have to investigate about why you get a nil response. The main cause with this kind of problem is in a server side exception.</p>
