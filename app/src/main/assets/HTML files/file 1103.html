<p>I tend to follow Jamis Buck's <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/5/nesting-resources" rel="nofollow">advice</a> and never nest more than one level deep.</p>

<p>Edit:
If you are going to nest more than 1 level I would check out the new <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2008/9/7/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-shallow-routes" rel="nofollow">shallow routes</a> feature in Edge</p>
