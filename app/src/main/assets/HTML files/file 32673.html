<p>Only some CSS3 properties and HTML5 elements that Bootstrap use (and by association, Yamm) are supported by Internet Explorer 8 and 9. Internet Explorer 8 requires the use of <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond" rel="nofollow">Respond.js</a> to enable media query support. There is information about <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-ie8-ie9" rel="nofollow">browser support on the Bootstrap site</a>. I've successfully got <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-ie8-ie9" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://geedmo.github.io/yamm/" rel="nofollow">Yamm</a> working in IE8 but needed to add respond.js and a <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv" rel="nofollow">html5 shim hack</a> in to work.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries --&gt;
&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
    &lt;script src="/js/html5shiv.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="/js/respond.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Internet Explorer 8 and Respond.js</strong></p>
  
  <p>Beware of the following caveats when using Respond.js in your development and production environments for Internet Explorer 8.
  Respond.js and cross-domain CSS</p>
  
  <p>Using Respond.js with CSS hosted on a different (sub)domain (for example, on a CDN) requires some additional setup. See the Respond.js docs for details.
  Respond.js and file://</p>
  
  <p>Due to browser security rules, Respond.js doesn't work with pages viewed via the file:// protocol (like when opening a local HTML file). To test responsive features in IE8, view your pages over HTTP(S). See the Respond.js docs for details.
  Respond.js and @import</p>
  
  <p>Respond.js doesn't work with CSS that's referenced via @import. In particular, some Drupal configurations are known to use @import. See the Respond.js docs for details.
  Internet Explorer 8 and box-sizing</p>
  
  <p>IE8 does not fully support box-sizing: border-box; when combined with min-width, max-width, min-height, or max-height. For that reason, as of v3.0.1, we no longer use max-width on .containers.</p>
