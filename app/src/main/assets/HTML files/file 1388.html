<p>I never used Joomla! so I just guess but maybe there's some kind of template cache? Try to clear it.</p>

<p>But what you're trying to do is a very bad practice. This label makes your forms more available (for screen readers etc.). Don't try to remove this element - just hide it using CSS:</p>

<pre><code>#mySearchForm label {
    display: none;
}
</code></pre>
