<p>To answer your original question, you should be using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/DecimalFormat.html" rel="nofollow">java.text.DecimalFormat</a>, something like:</p>

<pre><code> DecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat("##.##");
 display.setText(formatter.format(bmi_result));
</code></pre>

<p>Will force the result to be in the format of two digits followed by two decimal points, the table in the link above shows how to generate that.</p>

<p>However, since 2.0E-4 is 0.0002, I think Jon Skeet's comment is correct: You're doing your math operation wrong, since the value you're printing is a very small fraction of 25 :)</p>

<p>I'd recommend using <code>Log.v()</code> to print out your math operation before you actually do it, so you can see what the values of <code>weight</code> and <code>height</code> actually are, I highly doubt they're correctly set at what you described in the question.</p>
