<p>I don't know about performance, but one factor is ease of finding standard, well-used parsers.  There's an XML parser built into the JDK now, but I'm not aware of a CSV parser.  I think XML is far more ubiquitous than CSV.</p>

<p>Another factor is the nature of the data: XML suggests hierarchical, while CSV suggests tables.  I think the "best" way to read in data depends more on something like this.</p>
