<p>While I am not too sure what you are asking I will guess.  You want to call cek_data() and return a value into cek?  I would just use the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">$.ajax call with async set to false.</a>  In the success function set cek=data.  dont do cek= cek_data();, just do cek_data();</p>
