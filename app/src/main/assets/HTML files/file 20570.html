<p>Whenever a set of function runs on the command line, the last line of console output is always the returned value of the last operation in the input. The symbol calls out the return value of a function when there has been console output since the start of the command execution. This is to avoid confusion in a case like this:</p>

<pre><code>function logVar(someVar) {
    console.log(someVar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you run <code>logVar</code> on the console, it outputs the value of <code>someVar</code>. However, the return value of <code>logVar</code> is also logged (here, <code>undefined</code>). It's helpful to have the return value visually distinguished from the logged variable, so you don't look at the last line of the output and wonder, "Why is my variable <code>undefined</code>?".</p>
