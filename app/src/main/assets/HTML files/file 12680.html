<p>The view doesn't need to be explicitly aware of the controller. The controller can connect to any of the view's signals and the signals can relay relevant data or they can be empty. When the controller handles them in a slot, it can call methods on the view to fetch data if it isn't already included in the signal. The controller can also call any view method at any time.</p>

<p>I usually connect widget(button) signals directly to slots in the view class and expose custom aggregate signals that a controller can connect to instead of exposing all the widgets themselves.</p>
