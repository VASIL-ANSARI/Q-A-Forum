<p>You can do this by adding a variable for the form like </p>

<pre><code>int checkedItemsLimit = 2; // As you wrote in your question. This number is just an example.
</code></pre>

<p>Every time when something is checked at the ItemCheck event you can check if the numbers of checked items in the <code>checkListBox_ListOfCars</code> is equal to <code>checkedItemsLimit</code>. If this is present then unchecked the last checked. The code will look like that:</p>

<pre><code> private void checkedListBox_ListOfCars_ItemCheck(object sender, ItemCheckEventArgs e)
 {
     if (e.NewValue == CheckState.Checked)
     {
         if (checkedListBox_ListOfCars.CheckedItems.Count == checkedItemsLimit) 
         {
             e.NewValue = CheckState.Unchecked;
         }    
     }
 }
</code></pre>
