<p>The example you've posted makes use of a FusionTables layer. FusionTables are basically something like a small database or spreadsheet which containt the actual data. The ID that you've commented in the code (<code>815230</code>) is not a coordinate, but the ID of the FusionTable. In fact, you can see the data behind this ID <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=815230" rel="nofollow">in this link</a>.</p>

<p>You can read more on how to use FusionTables in your maps application in the link that you provided yourself, specifically <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays.html#FusionTables" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I would recommend reading the article about how to work with FusionTables in general, if you decide to fetch your data from them. You can find a longer article <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/fusiontables/docs/developers_guide.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
