<p>Look into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646839%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>OFN_NOCHANGEDIR</code></a> flag, although the documentation says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Restores the current directory to its original value if the user
  changed the directory while searching for files.</p>
  
  <p>This flag is ineffective for GetOpenFileName.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: Reading your question again, I guess you don't want the user to navigate up from that directory, not sure if this is possible with GetOpenFileName, you might have to create your own dialog with a directory list view and restrict them that way.</p>
