<p>The main difference between window.location.reload() and window.location.href=window.location.href is, that the first one will resend POST data if exists (the browser will ask you if you want to reload the page and resend the data), the second will just change the URL ignoring any POST data.</p>

<p>Regarding history.go(0), we are using the history object, so the browsers may use cached version of the page, stored somewhere in memory.</p>
