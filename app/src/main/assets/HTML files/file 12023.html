<p>Argument type of function is <code>Linked List</code> where as you have initialized your <code>mz_list</code> to <code>ArrayList</code>. </p>

<p>remove this <code>mzList = new ArrayList();</code> from your variable definition.</p>

<p>Moreover, since <code>mz_list</code> is defined at class level, and you are passing <code>mz_list</code> as an argument and then returning <code>mz_list</code>, there is no need of LinkedList as an argument for function.</p>

<p>You can simply have your function definition like</p>

<pre><code>public static LinkedList filereader (String filename) {
// use mz list here
}
</code></pre>
