<p>Your table is called "Users" rather than "Libusers". If you replace Libuser with User does it work?</p>

<p>For "Libuser" to work you would need a table called Libusers in your database.</p>

<p>Be careful of plurals - your ActiveRecord models should be singular (User, Book) and your table names should be plural (Users, Books).</p>
