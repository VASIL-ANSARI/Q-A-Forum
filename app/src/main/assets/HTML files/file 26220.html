<p>Having used the Gmail SMTP server in the past, I can only point out that the number for the SMTP port actually defaults to the appropriate one for Gmail, so the port argument (which can also be tacked onto the server name with a colon) can be omitted. Given this, you probably should try a different machine to ensure you're not running into networking errors, etc. Also, port 587 requires that ID check takes place, which means Gmail may think you're spamming or some other nonsense. Port 25, the default taken when no port number is entered, does not perform such a check.</p>
