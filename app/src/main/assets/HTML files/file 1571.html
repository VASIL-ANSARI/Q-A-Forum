<p>If you load your page with a bookmarklet you have free hands to use any of your javascript command inside that page.</p>

<p>You can use <code>document.getElementsByTagName('TABLE')</code> or load a JS library that will help you do the job.</p>

<p>And if you are using a modern browser you can use as well the <code>document.querySelectorAll</code> with a CSS selector.</p>
