<p>The behaviour is clearly documented. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow">re.<code>findall</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.  </p>
  
  <p>If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if you have a capture group in your regex pattern, then <code>findall</code> method returns a list of tuple, containing all the captured groups for a particular match, plus the <code>group(0)</code>.</p>

<p>So, either you use a non-capturing group - <code>(?:[\"\'])</code>, or don't use any group at all, as in your 2nd case.</p>

<p>P.S: Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literals" rel="nofollow">raw string literals</a> for your regex pattern, to avoid escaping your backslashes. Also, compile your regex outside the loop, so that is is not re-compiled on every iteration. Use <code>re.compile</code> for that.</p>
