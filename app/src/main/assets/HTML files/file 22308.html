<p>I've solved the problem.  Instead of reading from the audio file using type NSURL, use type NSData.  And instead of importing with the AVAudioPlayer.FromUrl function use the AVAudioPlayer.FromData.  This does have that limit of around 245 players.  As a test, I tried up to 6000 AVAudioPlayers with NSData and they worked fine.  </p>
