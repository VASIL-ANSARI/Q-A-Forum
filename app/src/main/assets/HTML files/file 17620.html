<p>I think you should have one busy-status per Task. Not sure how your <code>BusyTokenSource</code> idea works but it sounds a little like it.</p>

<p>Create a holder class:</p>

<pre><code>class BusyStatus { bool IsBusy; }
</code></pre>

<p>And give a new instance of it to each Task you start. When you are no longer interested in the old task, just discard the old BusyStatus and create a new instance. The old Task will eventually finish and set the busy status, but on the old instance which nobody uses anymore.</p>

<p>Just make sure that the old task does not accidentally reference the new <code>BusyStatus</code> instance.</p>

<p>As a more general rule it is often useful to have each Task (or Thread) work on distinct data structures. This a useful general guiding principle. It gains you simplicity and makes it easy to achieve safety.</p>
