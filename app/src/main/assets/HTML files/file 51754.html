<p>I would guess the video segments required to resume playback are no longer available on the content server, or did you check that? If AVPlayer buffered the live content in the background while paused then resume would be possible (limited by the local buffer size), but I don't think this is happening. Would be nice if it was possible to hide the pause button when live streaming. I haven't found a way to do that, at least not yet.</p>
