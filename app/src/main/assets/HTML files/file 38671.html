<p>If I understand your question correctly, then this should do the trick.</p>

<pre><code>NSDictionary *dictionary = someInfo;

NSMutableDictionary *mutableDictionary = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary:dictionary];
</code></pre>

<p>You should set a dictionary to a mutable dictionary via alloc init if you are just creating it.</p>
