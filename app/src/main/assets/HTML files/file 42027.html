<p>I'm sharing my solution as an answer, though not marking it as such since it doesn't solve the Webdriver issue.</p>

<p>I ended up running a Javascript function along the lines of the following in order to move the cursor to the start of the field:</p>

<pre><code>driver.executeScript("$('#field-under-test')[0].setSelectionRange(0,0)");
</code></pre>
