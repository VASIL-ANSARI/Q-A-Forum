<p>I've just stumbled upon this problem myself. Reportedly, this happens to some devices, when camera's picture size and preview size parameters have different aspect ratios. In my case, my Nexus 7 appeared to always use a 4:3 preview, no matter what I'd set. Also, <code>getPreviewSize()</code> reported the size I'd set, not the one really used.</p>

<p>The solution is to find a picture size with an aspect ratio matching preview's one. So, get a list of supported picture sizes with <code>getSupportedPictureSizes()</code>, choose one with a proper width/height ratio and then <code>setPictureSize(int width, int height)</code>. It worked for me like a charm :)</p>
