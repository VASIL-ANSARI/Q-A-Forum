<p>One thing that will speed up this code (at the expense of some memory usage) is to pull <em>all</em> potential matches out of your data store into a set or array and query that set to see if an object with your target ID is in it. Fetch requests in Core Data are <em>much</em> slower than the equivalent query against a set of objects.</p>

<pre><code>- (NSManagedObject *)feedItemWithId:(NSString *)itemId {
  NSArray *fetchedObjects; // Assume this has already been generated

   NSUInteger i = [array indexOfObjectPassingTest:^BOOL(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
     if ([idx id] = itemID)            
       return YES;
     else
       return NO;
    }];

  if (i != NSNotFound)
    return [array objectAtIndex:i];
  else
    return nil;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code was written in place, so it may not work as written. Also, there's certainly clever ways to speed this up, but as shown it should run significantly faster than individual fetch requests.</p>
