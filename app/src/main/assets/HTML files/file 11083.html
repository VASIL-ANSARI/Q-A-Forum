<p>Normalization doesn't <em>always</em> mean more joins. When the information you need is contained in the foreign key--which happens regularly with natural keys, but <em>never</em> happens with id numbers--you don't need a join to get it.</p>

<p>See, for example, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8411739/562459">this SO answer</a>, which deals with stores and their addresses in 5NF with no joins.  </p>
