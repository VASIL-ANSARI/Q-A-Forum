<p>Honestly I've not heard the term "deserialization attack", but yes you are right that would be a security vulnerability.</p>

<p>Any case where you store a file somewhere can edit it then the vulnerability exists. If they are just running on their local machine (single player) then it's not worth worrying about. You can't stop them hacking if they want to.</p>

<p>For multi-player the only way is to make the server authoritative and have it validate everything the player does. You would never let the client tell you their attack strength, you would tell the client.</p>
