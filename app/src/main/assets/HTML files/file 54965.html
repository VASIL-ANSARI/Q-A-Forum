<p>Many (non-anonymous) proxies will send a header containing the original IP address in the request. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/527638/getting-the-client-ip-address-remote-addr-http-x-forwarded-for-what-else-coul">Getting the client IP address: REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, what else could be useful?</a></p>

<p>Perhaps hostip.info is using such a header to find out your IP address. You could check what headers are sent by the proxy by making a request to an HTTP echo service, e.g. <a href="http://scooterlabs.com/echo" rel="nofollow">http://scooterlabs.com/echo</a> instead of <a href="http://hostip.info" rel="nofollow">http://hostip.info</a> .</p>

<p>BTW: How do you conclude from the output (an html page?) that hostip.info is returning your 'normal' IP address. And shouldn't a full URI like <code>http://www.hostip.info</code> be passed as an argument to <code>DownloadString()</code> ?</p>
