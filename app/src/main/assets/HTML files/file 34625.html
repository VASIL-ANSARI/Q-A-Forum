<p>First off, you can't use <code>SELECT</code> and <code>UPDATE</code> at the same time; it's one or the other. In your case, use only <code>UPDATE</code> with the table you wish to update.</p>

<pre><code>$dbCon = mysqli_connect("DATABASE");
if(isset($_POST['imagelink'])) {
    $imagelink = "UPDATE `TEST` SET `picture` = '".$_POST['imagelink']."' WHERE username = '".$_SESSION['username']."'";
    mysqli_query($dbCon, $imagelink);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Plus, make sure <code>session_start();</code> is loaded. I don't know what's inside your two included files or where your session variable is coming from, but this is how you will need to do it. See my notes below.</p>

<p>You may also want to use, if that's not what you're presently using, which is hard to tell at the moment.</p>

<pre><code>$dbCon=mysqli_connect("host","user","password","db");

if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
</code></pre>
