<p>I've used SimpleDB for something like this.  The advantage, aside from zero-maintenance, is that SimpleDB scales, essentially indefinitely.  This is really only an advantage if you want to architect for the possibility of very high traffic.</p>

<p>The main drawbacks of SimpleDB for this I see are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Higher latency.  SimpleDB is designed for huge scalability and high availability.  The tradeoff is that requests have a moderate latency - higher that you'd have with a 'local' non-distributed service like Lucene or using RDBMS text search features.</p></li>
<li><p>Less flexible text search.  Simple DB basically has an SQL-like query syntax, which supports the usual =, !=, >, &lt; etc. and also LIKE where the wildcard "%" can appear either at the start of the string, end of the string or both (e.g. "%keyword%").  There is no way to search for regexes or more complex patterns (except what you can do by combining the operators with AND/OR).  <em>Note: the LIKE condition previously only supported "%" at the end of the string - a limitation you may see written around the web but that no longer exists.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>SimpleDB also uses the 'eventual consistency' model by default (updates may take a little while - 10s of secs sometimes - to be visible consistently).  That is a consequence of scalability that can't be avoided.  However, I doubt it will be an issue for your use-case.</p>
