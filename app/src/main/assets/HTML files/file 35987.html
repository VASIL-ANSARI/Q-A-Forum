<p>In order to understand what is happening, it is necessary to understand the difference between <code>'c'</code> and <code>"c"</code> literals (constants):</p>

<ul>
<li>Character literal <code>'c'</code> is a numeric constant, a shorthand to writing <code>(char)99</code> (assuming ASCII encoding)</li>
<li>String literal <code>"c"</code> represents an address of a two-character sequence <code>{'c', '\0'}</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Had you used <code>"c"</code> instead of <code>'c'</code>, your second code snippet would have worked. You need to assign an address to <code>char*</code>, and <code>"c"</code> gives you an address. However, <code>'c'</code> is <em>not</em> an address, it's a numeric constant. That's why you get a warning.</p>

<p>When you dereference a constant <code>'c'</code> re-interpreted as a pointer, you get undefined behavior. That is why <code>printf</code> does not print anything.</p>
