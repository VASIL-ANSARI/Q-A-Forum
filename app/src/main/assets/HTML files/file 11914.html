<p>Sure thing! Just use PHP's <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php" rel="nofollow">mail function</a> to send messages to the desired recipients from the email address the users specify in your webform.</p>

<p>One caveat, though: you may run into trouble with some mail servers and artificially-created 'From' headers (like those used in the mail function). For security reasons, if a message appears to be disingenuous about where it's coming from (i.e: an unexpected sender IP), some servers will blacklist the offending IP, making it impossible to send mail from that IP to that server. You may be better-off including the subscriber's address in the subject or body of the email, and using that data (as opposed to the From header) to add recipients to your mailing list.</p>

<p>EDIT: It's also worth noting that, if the possibility exists to subscribe to many mailing lists (read: send many emails) in one execution of your mailing script, you might want to forego <code>mail()</code> for something like <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Mail" rel="nofollow">PEAR's mail package</a>. The reason for this is that <code>mail()</code> has to open a new SMTP socket for every message it sends, whereas packages like the one mentioned above are better suited for sending mail in batch.</p>
