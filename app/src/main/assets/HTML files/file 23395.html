<p>I'm not aware of any solution here. However, JKP has developed <a href="http://jkp-ads.com/articles/treeview.asp" rel="nofollow">a native TreeView in VBA with Userforms only</a> to replace the TreeView - which works fine under 64bit. </p>

<p>Though labour-intense you could consider adopting it to a ListView control... </p>
