<p>Switch your <code>from</code> and <code>left join</code> clauses - you want to drive the query from the <code>players</code>' side and display <code>null</code>s where the stats are missing, not the other way round:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT    s.schoolid,
          s.season,
          s.playerid,
          SUM(s.serviceaces) AS sumAces,
          SUM(s.attackkills) AS sumKills,
          SUM(s.assists) AS sumAssists,
          p.fname,
          p.lname 
FROM      `players` AS p 
LEFT JOIN `stats` AS s ON p.id = s.playerid 
GROUP BY  s.playerid 
HAVING    s.schoolid = 2 AND s.season = 2015
</code></pre>
