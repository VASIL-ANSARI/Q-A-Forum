<p>Considering you're new to OpenGL:</p>

<p>The default configuration of OpenGL uses the double buffering. It means each time you use the <code>OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.GL.DrawXXX()</code> methods or SetPixel() or others like that, you are drawing in the back buffer.
When you're done with the drawing, you call <code>OpenTK.GLControl.SwapBuffers()</code> and it will switch the back buffer as front buffer, and vice versa.
Because front buffer is what is displayed on the screen, you will see your drawing.</p>

<p>And of course you yould not forget the call to <code>OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.GL.Begin()</code> with the approriate <code>BeginMode</code>, and <code>OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL.GL.End()</code>.</p>
