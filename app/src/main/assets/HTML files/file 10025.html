<p>Several developers that I work with have experienced this same problem. Usually if you let the function be called once (however you're expecting it to be invoked) then reload the script on to the form containing the function, you can hit a debugger statement if you invoke the function yet again (for enable/disable rules this can be accomplished by using the IE dev toolbar and calling into the form to reevaluate the ribbon).</p>

<p>Reevaluating the ribbon rules can be done by calling the following from the dev toolbar:</p>

<pre><code>frames[0].Xrm.Page.ui.refreshRibbon();
</code></pre>

<p>A bookmarklet I created to reload the script on the form (you enter the path to the script ie if the resource is at <a href="http://crm/orgname/WebResource/org_Script.js" rel="nofollow">http://crm/orgname/WebResource/org_Script.js</a> you'd enter org_Script.js at the prompt):</p>

<pre><code>javascript:(function(){var path=prompt("Namespaced Path to File:","");var s=document.frames[0].document.createElement("script");s.src=prependOrgName("/WebResources/"+path);document.frames[0].document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);})();
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps. Please let me know if I can explain further.</p>
