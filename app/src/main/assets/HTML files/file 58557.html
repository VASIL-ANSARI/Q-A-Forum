<p>The ThreadContextMap and Stack are maintained in a ThreadLocal variable. In a servlet environment (such as Tomcat) if you don't clear up the items in the Map then the next request will still have those values even if they don't apply to that request. So in an environment like that you definitely want to clear the Map at the end of every request. </p>

<p>The stack problem is a bit different. If you push items on the stack at the beginning of the request and then don't pop them off they will still be there when the next request comes in, which presumably will push new values on the stack that also will not be popped off.</p>

<p>Whether you have a problem or not simply depends on what kind of application you are creating. If you have thread pools like Tomcat does then you have to understand how ThreadLocals will behave in that environment.</p>
