<p>No need to use a CursorAdapter because you want to show 2 lines and button, you can use any other simpler adapter.</p>

<p>getView method is called multiple times for each view, not when you click on the view or button. You are re-instantiating the Bundle everytime and it is just saving the id for the last getView call (because every call destroys the previous one), and you are also creating a new OnClickListener on every call.</p>

<p>You probably want to use OnItemClickListener and create only one instance outside getView() method.</p>
