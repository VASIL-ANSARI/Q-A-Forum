<p>I had what appeared to be a completely unrelated problem in the same app, wherein some of the buttons on the left side of the screen weren't tappable. </p>

<p>While investigating that I discovered that my UIWindow was 320x480. The problem was in my MainWindow.xib. Xcode created this xib for me, but it was probably Xcode 3 and it was several years ago. I decided to review the settings and I noticed the option for "Full Screen at Launch." I looked up that option in the docs and there was a note stating that this should always be on so that the Window is properly resized to match the device size. This was never an issue when there was only one size iPhone, but it became a problem with the introduction of the 4" iPhone. </p>

<p>So, I checked that box, and relaunched and viola, both this and the other problem were solved because the enclosing UIWindow was correctly sized. </p>
