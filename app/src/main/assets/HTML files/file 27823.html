<p>So after a few hours of digging I came up with an answer although its not great.</p>

<pre><code>class ActiveRecord::Base
  def self._get_finder_options options
    _get_construct_finder_sql(options)
  end

  private
  def self._get_construct_finder_sql(options)
    return (construct_finder_sql(options).inspect)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>adding this as an extension gives you a publicly accessible method <code>_get_finder_options</code> which returns the raw sql statement.</p>

<p>In my case this is for a complex query to be wrapped as so</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM (INSERT_QUERY) as count_table
</code></pre>

<p>So that I could still use this with the will_paginate gem.  This has only been tested in my current project so if you are trying to replicate please keep that in mind.</p>
