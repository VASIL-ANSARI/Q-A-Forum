<p>I found the instructions in FastMM4BCB file itself and I got it working.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy FastMM4BCB.cpp, FastMM4.pas, FastMM4Message.pas, FastMM4Options.inc,
and FastMM_FullDebugMode.lib to your source folder.</li>
<li>Copy FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll to your application's .exe directory (if you
intend to use FullDebugMode).</li>
<li>To your project, add FastMM4Messages.pas first, then FastMM4.pas, then
FastMM4BCB.cpp. On compiling the .pas files, .hpp files are created and
imported by the subsequent files.</li>
<li>Add USEOBJ("FastMM4BCB.cpp") to your project file, BEFORE any other
USEFORM directives.</li>
<li><p>Under the Project -> Options -> Linker menu uncheck "Use Dynamic RTL"
(sorry, won't work with the RTL DLL).</p>

<p>FastMM will now install itself on startup and replace the RTL memory manager.</p></li>
</ol>
