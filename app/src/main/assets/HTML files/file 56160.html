<p>One way to do it would be to have your python script write the value you want to use in the makefile to an output file.  Then your makefile could read in the value from that intermediary file.</p>

<p>Example:    </p>

<pre><code>with open("intermediary.tmp", "wb") as h:
    h.write(SUCCESS)
</code></pre>
