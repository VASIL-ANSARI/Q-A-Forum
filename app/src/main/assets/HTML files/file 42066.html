<p>You haven't specified whether you have a method by name authenticate in user.rb.</p>

<p>If you have that method already in user.rb, make sure you use <strong>self.authenticate</strong> rather than simple <strong>authenticate</strong> in the method defination.</p>

<p>Reason for the above is that,While creating a method in Ruby Class, you need to associate that method with that class's instance in order to access that method out of that Class.</p>
