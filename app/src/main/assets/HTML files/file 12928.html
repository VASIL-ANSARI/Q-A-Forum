<p>Try using the <strong>send_data</strong> method that all rails controllers have.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code># Generate a PDF document with information on the client and return it.
# The user will get the PDF as a file download.
def download_pdf
  send_data(generate_pdf, :filename =&gt; "my_file.pdf", :type =&gt; "application/pdf")
end
</code></pre>
