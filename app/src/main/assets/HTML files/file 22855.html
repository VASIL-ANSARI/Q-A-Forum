<p>The answer would really depend on what platform you are developing for.  An embedded RTOS for a Microchip controller is going to have one set of constraints, whereas an RTOS for an ARM solution will be completely different.  You should clarify what hardware, or at a minimum, what micro controller, you are designing for.</p>
