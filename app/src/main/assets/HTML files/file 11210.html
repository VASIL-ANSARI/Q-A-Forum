<p>Your threads are <em>spinning</em>, so they each use up an entire CPU core.<br>
That slows the system down dramatically.</p>

<p>You should never wait using a <code>while</code> loop like you're doing now.<br>
Instead, wait on a <code>ManualResetEvent</code>.</p>

<p>However, you can replace all of that code with much a simpler implementation using <code>Task</code>s and no explicit threads.<br>
Using <code>Task.ContinueWith</code> will allow you to run a task after the previous one finishes without wasting a thread.</p>
