<p>First post here but I had the same error. Correct me if I am wrong but I believe the issue also for me was that I could create the user once and then get invalid session tokens afterwards. I think its due to the fact that the "session" on the Parse Website's end is still logged in even though you can close and re-run the app on your end. </p>

<p>By putting the following code before I try to create a new parse user I fixed my issue.</p>

<pre><code>ParseUser currentUser = ParseUser.getCurrentUser();
currentUser.logOut();
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps. Cheers!</p>
