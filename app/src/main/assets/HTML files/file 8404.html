<p>Java uses erasure-based generics (i.e., the type parameters are erased at runtime---for example, <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> are treated as the same type at runtime). Since reflection is inherently a runtime feature, the type parameters are not used or involved at all.</p>

<p>In order words, you can only instantiate the raw type (<code>SomeClass</code>, not <code>SomeClass&lt;T&gt;</code>) when you're using reflection. You will then have to manually cast the type to the generic version (and generate an <code>unchecked</code> warning).</p>
