<p>As you said in your reply to my comment, you are logging queries that don't use indexes.  This query is not using an index, so it gets logged with the slow queries.  Queries that are logged because they don't use an index ignore the minimum execution time when being logged.</p>

<p>Edit: The <code>Time</code> column in <code>SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST</code> shows the time it has been in its current state, which is usually set to <code>Sleep</code> when a query finishes so that time is not reliable for timing queries.  To get a more reliable timing of the query, you'd need to use profiling or some other way of benchmarking that works more directly with the query.</p>
