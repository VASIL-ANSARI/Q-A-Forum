<p>In the POST request - i.e. when you submit the form - the url will be what you specified in the <code>'action'</code> attribute in the form. If the parameters you require are not there, your view will not get them.</p>

<p>So either update your forms's <code>action</code> attribute to have these parameters or alternatively you can add thin in the form itself (as hidden inputs).</p>

<p>In GET request you will get attributes from url that you see in the browser.</p>
