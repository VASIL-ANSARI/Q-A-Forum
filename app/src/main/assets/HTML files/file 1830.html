<p>just loop through them and check for differences on the next value in line? </p>

<pre><code>foreach($res as $key=&gt;$val){
    if($val['time_from'] == $res[$key+1]['time_from'])
        //this is same hour. lets do something here?
    else
        //this is a new hour. 
}
</code></pre>

<p>of course you vill have to check if $res[$key+1] isset also before comparison. </p>
