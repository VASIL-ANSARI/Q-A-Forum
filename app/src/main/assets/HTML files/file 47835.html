<p>The default <code>display</code> value for the <code>li</code> property is not <code>inline</code>, it's <code>list-item</code>. And a <code>ul</code> is designed to be nested in a list, so there's no problem with placing a <code>ul</code> within an <code>li</code>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as of HTML5, placing block elements inside inline elements is valid HTML.</p>

<p><em>From <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements#Block-level_vs._inline" rel="nofollow">MDN</a>:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The distinction of block-level vs. inline elements is used in HTML
  specifications up  to 4.01. In HTML5, this binary distinction is
  replaced with a more complex set of content categories. The
  "block-level" category roughly corresponds to the category of flow
  content in HTML5, while "inline" corresponds to phrasing content, but
  there are additional categories.</p>

<p>If, however, you don't want to put a block element within an inline element for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/746559/3597276">rendering</a> or other reasons, you have the option to change the <code>display</code> value:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span style="display: block"&gt;
    &lt;div style="display: inline"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; 
</code></pre>
