<p>What you want to do is writing an algorithm that compresses strings. However, this isn't really something you can do by just snapping your fingers.</p>

<p>You should first consider the type of raw input you're receiving: is it humanly comprehensible text? Then my advice is to use a pattern-searching algorithm, which looks for repeating sequences of characters and marks their position, using instead their coordinates from that point on. That's what most file-compression algorithms, like WinRar's, mainly do. To decode you then iterate the compressed string, look for coordinate headers and use them to re-ensemble the whole thing. </p>

<p>EDIT: Also, your solution is wrong because the <em>string</em> parameter for byte[].ToString(<em>string</em>) isn't the variable you want to assign, but rather a <em>format</em>. You should do something on the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>private void encodeToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        UTF8Encoding utf8 = new UTF8Encoding();
        string textstring;
        string encodedString;
        textstring = richTextBox1.Text;
        byte[] encodedBytes = utf8.GetBytes(textstring);
        richTextBox1.Clear();
        encodedString = encodedBytes.ToString();
        richTextBox1.Text = encodedString;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But I doubt that will make the string significantly shorter.</p>
