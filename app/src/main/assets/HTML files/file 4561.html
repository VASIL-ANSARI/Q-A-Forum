<p>Is <code>form_input_element</code> a class name? If so, you need a <code>.</code> in front of it. (ie <code>$(".form_input_element")</code>)</p>

<p>If it's an id, then you need the <code>#</code> in front of it. (ie <code>$("#form_input_element")</code>)</p>

<p>Remember that the string you pass to the jQuery object is virtually identical to a CSS selector, so it must be formatted as such. Currently, your selector is looking for an element named <code>form_input_element</code> which does not exist.</p>
