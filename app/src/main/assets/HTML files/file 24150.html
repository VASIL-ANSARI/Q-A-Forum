<p>You could  use(in visual studio) Lib1 project Properties -> Build Events -> Post-build event command line.</p>

<p>In the "Post-build event command line" edit box type <em>copy</em> commands that will copy required files to the  Client output folder. In that editbox you can use various VS macros (Click "Edit Post Build" -> Macros)
Like this:</p>

<pre><code>copy path\to\ThirdParty.dll  $(SolutionDir)Client\bin\Debug
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps, you will need to "Build"->"Rebuild Solution" at first time.</p>
