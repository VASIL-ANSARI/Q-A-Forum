<p>You go to line 40 <code>report.highmath(stdapp.java.40)</code> and you think<br>
what reference can be <code>null</code> on this line. It means you have a <code>null</code><br>
reference on that line and you're either calling a method on it, or<br>
are trying to get one of its variables.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>System.out.println</code> to print out some references,<br>
or use a debugger in an IDE. </p>
