<p>I would simply use the <strong>general-purpose NLP solver</strong> <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt" rel="nofollow">IPOPT</a> written in C++. It is the most robust solver among those I have tried and it is meant and successfully used on <em>very large</em> problems.</p>

<p>A change in requirements (e.g. adding constraints) would be no problem if you use the general-purpose IPOPT. </p>

<p>The time consuming part of the solution procedure is to solve the linear systems in each iteration step so it's worth getting the best linear solver + LinAlg package for your platform.</p>

<p>Unfortunately IPOPT calls Fortran subroutines internally so you will need a Fortran compiler which is sort of a pain.</p>

<p>If IPOPT is not enough, you will have to look for a problem specific solver.</p>
