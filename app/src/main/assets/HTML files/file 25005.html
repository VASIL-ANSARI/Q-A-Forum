<p>If I understand your question right, You want to get the position. You can use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/position/" rel="nofollow">.position()</a> method for this. It gets the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. See the example in the docs.</p>

<h1>From the DOCs</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>The .position() method allows us to retrieve the current position of
  an element relative to the offset parent. Contrast this with
  .offset(), which retrieves the current position relative to the
  document. When positioning a new element near another one and within
  the same containing DOM element, .position() is the more useful.</p>
  
  <p>Returns an object containing the properties top and left.</p>
