<p>The only contstraint regarding contracts in WCF is that you should have one explicit contract. But you are free to combine multiple interfaces into one:</p>

<pre><code>public interface ICombinedInterface : ICase, IUser 
</code></pre>

<p>and use the combined interface as your service contract.</p>

<p>The question: "whether should there be one or more endpoints?" doesn't have an easy answer. It depends on what your requirements and priorities are. From the client's point of view, it should not matter much. </p>
