<p>So you're looking to store the results of each test? Why not store them in a <code>list</code>?</p>

<pre><code>test1_results = []

for x in range(0,10000):
    test1 = test[x]
    # check if first element in sequence of game outcomes is a win for team A
    if test1[0] == 1:    # or '1' if you're expecting string
        test1_results.append(test1)
</code></pre>

<p>You can the run <code>print(test1_results)</code> to print the entire list of results, but if you want to print the first <code>n</code> results, do <code>print(test1_results[:n])</code>.</p>

<p>If you want your <code>if</code> statement in there, you will have to slightly adjust the placement. What does your <code>test</code> object look like? Could you give us a small sample?</p>

<p>edit: updated <code>if</code> statement to reflect comment below</p>
