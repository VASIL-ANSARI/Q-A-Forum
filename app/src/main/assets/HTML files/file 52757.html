<p>there was no php errors as there was nothing wrong with the code. The JS was firing and was working OK.</p>

<p>Turns out I was an idiot when I was being lazy and copied the include and forgot to remove scripts/ so it was actually working all OK it just didn't initiate the session before trying to scrub the variables.</p>

<p>School boy! Thanks for the help.</p>
