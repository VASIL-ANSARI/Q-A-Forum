<p>I don't know whether it would be any faster, but it would certainly be easier. And remember, the less code you have, the fewer bugs you have.</p>

<p>NSShadow works with any shape, rectangular or otherwise. In fact, some things that we wouldn't ordinarily think of as a shadow can be, in fact, implemented as shadows. A glow, for example, is simply a white âshadowâ. I'd guess that focus rings are shadows internally.</p>

<p>You do not need to create an NSBezierPath. Drawing an image with a shadow will work just fine. The only thing that doesn't is drawing a gradient (as in NSGradient).</p>

<p>For the benefit of other readers: All of this applies equally in Quartz, to CGContext's shadow properties and the exclusion of CGGradient and probably CGShading.</p>
