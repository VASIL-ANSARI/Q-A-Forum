<p>Eight threads for writings might be far too high or far too low, depending upon what your storage actually looks like.</p>

<p>If you have one spinning metal drive in your computer, this is <em>far</em> too high -- your drive will be seeking all over to perform writes. Use one thread.</p>

<p>If you have fragmented your database tables over eight or more SSD drives, this might be fine, but perhaps more threads would let you make the most of the very low "seek" latency. ("Seek" doesn't really apply to newer SSD devices, but I'm using the term by analogy with older drive technologies.)</p>
