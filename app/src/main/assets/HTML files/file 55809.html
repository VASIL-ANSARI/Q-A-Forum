<p>Given that you're using animate.css, just give the section that needs to move out one of the exit classes (Like <code>bounceOutLeft</code>) and the class you'd like to move in one of the entrance classes (Like <code>bounceInRight</code>).</p>

<p>Along with that, to keep track of which section the user is looking at, I'd have a variable that's keeping track of which section the user is looking at. I'd add 1 to the variable when the user presses the next button and the opposite with the previous button. Then just animate the the children you need based on this variable.</p>
