<p>I figured out how to make it work: You have to choose the track inside a "user playlist"!</p>

<p>If you choose a file track without specifying a playlist (this applies to using AppleScript on OSX to script iTunes), then the track is chosen from the "library playlist", which has no prepresentation in the UI, and thus can't be revealed.</p>

<p>Hence, if you make sure to get the item from a user playlist, e.g. the one whose "special kind" is "Music", then you're good.</p>
