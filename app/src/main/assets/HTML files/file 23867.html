<p>You cannot directly connect to an IMAP server using just browser javascript. Browser's cannot make IMAP connections. You will need a least a server side proxy/application that can translate your web HTTP requests into IMAP requests over the Internet. However, every web based mail client I have ever seen uses a multi-tier architecture with browser code providing the user interface, a web application server providing the business logic, and in your case external email accounts providing most of the data itself.</p>
