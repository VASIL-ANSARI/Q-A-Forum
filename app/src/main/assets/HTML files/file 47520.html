<p>Man, i don't know swift so well but as long as i know you will have to do is:</p>

<p>first of all, capture the returned data from your get and save then into NSCachedURLResponse. in objective-c will be something like that: </p>

<pre><code>NSCachedURLResponse *cachedResponse = [[NSCachedURLResponse alloc] initWithResponse:operation.response data:operation.responseData];
    [[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] storeCachedResponse:cachedResponse forRequest:urlRequest];
</code></pre>

<p>After that, if your requisition throws error, you will recuperate you previous data saved for that URL.</p>

<pre><code>NSData *data = [[[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] cachedResponseForRequest:urlRequest] data];
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that helps you.</p>
