<p>As always, when things matter you should test them empirically rather than relying solely on theoretical reasoning.</p>

<p>In this case, however, I would imagine that the two code snippets become <em>identical</em> after compilation, so there is no difference.</p>

<p>... at least in the typical case. If, for example, your variables are of a type that has the property that</p>

<ul>
<li>it is cheap to assign an integer value to it</li>
<li>it is expensive to copy from another instance of that type</li>
</ul>

<p>then you would expect chained assignment to be much more expensive, unless the optimizer is sufficiently clever.</p>

<p>(and the reverse if it's expensive to assign an integer but cheap to copy assign)</p>
