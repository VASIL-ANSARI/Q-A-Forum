<p>these selectors are generated by the compiler. they are the reserved selectors for c++ ivar construction and destruction.</p>

<p>furthermore, the runtime calls these methods for you when <code>GCC_OBJC_CALL_CXX_CDTORS</code> is enabled. there is no need to call or declare them yourself.</p>

<p>declaring them would result in a compilation error.</p>

<p>choose a unique name for your selectors, and don't implement the ones which are generated for you (when <code>GCC_OBJC_CALL_CXX_CDTORS</code> is enabled).</p>

<p>what is it you are trying to do here?</p>
