<p>Untested, but something like:</p>

<pre><code>select CAMPID, 
    count(wt_campaignmaster.CAMPNAME) as NoOf, 
    sum(TOTALDND) as TOTALDND, 
    sum(INVALID) as TOTALINVALID, 
    sum(SMSDELIVERED) as SMSDELIVERED
FROM wt_campaignmaster
LEFT JOIN wt_campaign_record_log 
    ON wt_campaignmaster.CAMPNAME = wt_campaign_record_log.CAMPNAME
GROUP BY CAMPID
</code></pre>
