<p>There is no guarantee that you'll get a useful error message if you don't handle an exception; the only guarantee is that the program will be terminated by calling <code>std::terminate</code>.</p>

<p>It seems that your implementation is able to identify that the unhandled exception was derived from <code>std::exception</code>, and use that knowledge to call its override of <code>what()</code> to generate an error message. It would know nothing about non-standard exception types, and it shouldn't randomly call functions just because they happen to have the same name as a function in a completely unrelated class.</p>

<p>If you want to print something useful when an arbitrary type is thrown, you'll need a handler to catch that type and do the right thing with it. But I would definitely advise you to only throw types derived from <code>std::exception</code> unless you've got a very good reason to throw something else.</p>
