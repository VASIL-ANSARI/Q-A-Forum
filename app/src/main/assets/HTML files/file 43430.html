<p>Getting last id via EF and setting it manually is a very bad idea, as it will certainly fail on concurrent requests.</p>

<p>As Oracle doesn't support autoincrement, you should use trigger workaround as mentioned in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11296361/how-to-create-id-with-auto-increment-on-oracle">thread</a> (it actually differs a bit from yours current implementation).</p>

<p>Have you tested insert directly on database, without specifiying Id column value? </p>
