<p>You just need to reformat the field that contains the date in question, I am assuming its called <code>DateFieldName</code> in my example.</p>

<p>Where you are processing through the result set from your query do something like this ...</p>

<pre><code>//start while loop to get data
while($row = mysql_fetch_row($result))
{
    list($y,$m,$d) = explode( '-', $row['DateFieldName'] );
    $row['DateFieldName'] = sprintf( '%s-%s-%s', $d, $m, $y );
</code></pre>
