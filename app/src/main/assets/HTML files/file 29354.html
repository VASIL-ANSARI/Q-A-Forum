<p>UIImagePickerController has a property called 'allowsEditing'. That will open the Camera in full screen and allows you to resize the taken photo after shot.</p>

<pre><code>imagePicker.allowsEditing = YES;
imagePicker.cameraCaptureMode = UIImagePickerControllerCameraCaptureModePhoto;
</code></pre>

<p>you can get the photo in the protocol method using a key 'UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage'.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info
{
    UIImage *pic = (UIImage *)[info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerEditedImage];
}
</code></pre>
