<p>For the <code>carlike</code> function, there is no performance difference. However, as you say it is a decorator - which would be called as a static function on an object - not a constructor or method. You would want to use <code>carlike({}, 0)</code> instead of <code>carlike.call({}, 0)</code>, so go with the second pattern.</p>

<hr>

<p>For the <code>move</code> function, there is a memory difference. The pattern with <code>obj</code> creates a closure, which costs more than the <code>this</code> in the first pattern. Which one to choose <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/10711064/1048572">is a different question</a>, as they simply act different.</p>

<p>If you would want to optimize memory consumption, you could further improve the first pattern by not creating new <code>move</code> functions on every invocation of <code>carlike</code>. Just do</p>

<pre><code>function move() {
    this.loc++;
}
function carlike(obj, loc) {
    obj.loc = loc;
    obj.move = move;
    return obj;
}
</code></pre>
