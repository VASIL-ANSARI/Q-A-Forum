<p>Trying to transfer a console program to a GUI program is not an easy task if you've never made a GUI program before. You need to learn about event-driven programming. I suggest you have a look at the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Swing tutorials</strong></a></p>

<hr>

<p>Some tips though. It you want a <strong>"semi-gui"</strong> program. You can just use <code>JOptionPane</code>s for the input. Say you want to get an number input. You would do something like this</p>

<pre><code>String numberString = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "Enter a Number");
int number = Integer.parseInteger(numberString);
</code></pre>

<p>once you do the first line, an input pane automatically pops up. asking for an input. The result is a String, so you <em>have</em> to parse it to get a number. </p>

<p>Also if you just want to <em>diplay</em> a message, just use</p>

<pre><code>JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, message);
</code></pre>

<p>You can do that do display some result. In the above case when you just want to show a message, you don't need to make it equal to anything. So instead of the <code>System.out.println()</code>s, you can just use the <code>JOPtionpane.showMesageDialog()</code>, and instead of <code>scan.next()</code>, you would use <code>JOptionPane.showInputDialog()</code></p>
