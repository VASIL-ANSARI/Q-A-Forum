<p>Yes, there is.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling" rel="nofollow">Long polling</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" rel="nofollow">WebSockets</a>.</p>

<p>With slow poll you run a request and the server will keep the connection open indefinitely until it has something to say (e.g. in PHP sleep a lot and once you got a result, answer and be done).</p>

<p>With web sockets you have even more possibilities.</p>
