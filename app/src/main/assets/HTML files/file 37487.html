<p>A <em>property</em> refers to a name/value pair belonging to an object. According to the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-4.3.26" rel="nofollow">ECMAScript spec 4.3.26</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>property</strong></p>
  
  <p>association between a name and a value that is a part of an object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each property <em>has</em> a name (to the left of the colon) and <em>has</em> a value (to the right of the colon).</p>

<p>In informal discussion about JavaScript, we sometimes use "key" to mean the name of a property. This commonplace usage is reflected in the existence of the function <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.2.3.14" rel="nofollow"><code>Object.keys</code></a>, which returns an array of property names belonging to an object. This use of "key" is borrowed from  computer science at large (as it applies to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array" rel="nofollow">associative arrays</a>), not from the ECMAScript language specification that defines JavaScript, but surely virtually all JavaScript programmers would understand "key" to mean "property name".</p>
