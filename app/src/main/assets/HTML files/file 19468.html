<p>Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can do that. If you're using a SQLiteDatabaseHelper, all you have to do is just not create a table in onCreate, then write a creatTable() function to handle that for you later. If you're using Context.openOrCreateDatabase(), it creates an empty database. I'm not sure how to check if a database already exists, however.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the database might not actually be created if you don't have a table in it. It wouldn't hurt anything to just create the database right before you make the first table.</p>
