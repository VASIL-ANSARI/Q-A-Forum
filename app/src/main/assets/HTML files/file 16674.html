<p>You need to understand the requirements for the AEC to work - all documented in the Speex docs - and know how to debug your flow to achieve that.</p>

<p>You can get more pointers from my answer here:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10080808/android-speex-echo-cancellation-problems">Android Speex echo cancellation problems</a></p>

<p>Also, I have a project that does a loopback sample of Speex AEC - video coverage is here:

<p>It's a whole project so no point in trying to squeeze it to an answer, but the pointers I gave should give you a start - and the video proves it's possible.</p>
