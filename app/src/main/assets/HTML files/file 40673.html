<p>I'm not completely sure but try installing their certificate and private key in your keychain and then installing the provisioning profile and check if you can chose it in the Build Settings Code Signing section. If you can set it for Release version and have the Archive Scheme configured to use Release then you should be good. </p>

<p>If not and you cannot enroll into their program you can always build the archive with your cert and provisioning profile and then resign the app using the command line <code>codesign</code> tool. Just pay attention not to break the embedded entitlements that xcode puts there. Use <code>-d</code> option to check what they are originally. </p>
