<p><code>readFile</code> should work for any content type. Presumably the "scrambled characters" you see are exactly the content of the <code>.docx</code> or <code>.doc</code> file you're reading. (If you looked at the file via <code>type</code> on Windows or <code>cat</code> on Mac/Linux, you would see the same thing.)</p>

<p>So I think the issue you're having is that you want to somehow extract the text from a variety of file formats. Dropbox (and dropbox.js) won't help you with that particular problem... you'll need to find software that understands all those file formats and can convert them to the form you need. For example, <a href="http://textract.readthedocs.org/en/latest/python_package.html" rel="nofollow"><code>textract</code></a> is a Python library that can do this.</p>
