<p>Yes: don't use -ms-filter and filter:progid:DXImageTransform etc. </p>

<p>There's a bug in the implementation of the filters causing it to use the fallback text renderer. The only way to make it consistent is to either don't use it when text is involved, or use it on all text (so that all text is equally ugly and pixelated).</p>

<p>What I usually do is, i use only standard css for transparency such as rgba() colors, opacity etc. And in the IE-specific css I set the background/text color to an approximate match to how it would look whith real transparency. </p>

<p>And for images I create an IE-specific copy of the image sprite that are transparent. But transparent png's will cause the same problems in ie7 and older, so I usually fall back to full opacity (i.e. not transparent) in ie7.css</p>
