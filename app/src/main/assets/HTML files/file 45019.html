<p>The key is: error removing unix socket, unlink(): Permission denied [core/socket.c  line 198]</p>

<p>You (very probably) previously run a uwsgi instance as root creating the unix socket file with root permissions.</p>

<p>Now your instance (running instead as www) is not able to re-bind() that socket as it is not able to unlink it (no permissions)</p>

<p>Just remove the socket file and retry.</p>
