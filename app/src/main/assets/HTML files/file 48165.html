<p>Think you can replace <code>^</code>with <code>,</code> before calling find_in_set:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
student.uid,
student.name, 
group_concat(subject.subject_name) as subjects_passed 
from student 
join subject on find_in_set(subject.uid, replace(student.subject_id,'^',',') ) &gt; 0
group by student.uid
</code></pre>

<p>But of course storeing values in such a format is very bad db design.</p>
