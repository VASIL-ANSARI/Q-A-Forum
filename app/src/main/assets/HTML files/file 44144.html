<p>Ok so i finally fixed this. After googfing around for a while in the developer tool of chrome, Though i dont understand too much of javascript, i noticed that the form that is responsible for the search feature is embedded inside the div that i am replacing with the result of the ajax post, as a result, the dom has changed and when i submit again, its not targeting that same form again. The fix was to move the form out of that div and Eureka! it worked.</p>
