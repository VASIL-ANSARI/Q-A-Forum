<p>Fragments have to declare that they can provide options. Have a look here:</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html#setHasOptionsMenu(boolean)" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html#setHasOptionsMenu(boolean)</a></p>

<p>I think you just need to call setHasOptionsMenu(true) in the onCreateView() of your Fragment.</p>
