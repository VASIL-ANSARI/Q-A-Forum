<p>@Override annotation - is an indicator for java compiler, that you intend to override or implement a method. This helps to avoid mistakes. 
For example, method signature in the interface has changed, hence you have to change instance method. In this case Eclipse will highlight an error.</p>

<pre><code>public interface ISome {
     void methodToImplement(int param);
}

public class SomeClass {

     // compile, method signature is identical to the signature of the interface
     @Override 
     void methodToImplement(int param); 

     // won't compile, cause method signature is different in the interface
     //@Override
     //void methodToImplement();

     // won't compile, cause there is no such method in the interface
     //@Override
     //void missing();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Check if you have this kind of error. If it's not the case, provide some code.</p>
