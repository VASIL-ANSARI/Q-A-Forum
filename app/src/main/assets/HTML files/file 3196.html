<p>The default behaviour when you close a <code>JFrame</code> is simply to hide it, not to cause the application to exit.  You need to call:</p>

<pre><code>frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
</code></pre>

<p>In other words: This has nothing to do with the <code>ScheduledExecutorService</code>; It is to do with the fact that the Event Dispatch thread is not a daemon thread.</p>

<p><strong>ADDITIONAL</strong></p>

<p>Rather than use a <code>ScheduledExecutorService</code> which in turn calls <code>SwingUtilities.invoke...</code> you should consider using <code>javax.swing.Timer</code>, which will fire <code>ActionEvent</code>s periodically <strong>directly on the Event Dispatch thread</strong>, hence making your code simpler / more compact and removing the need for the additional thread.</p>

<p>Also, you are recreating the <code>ImageIcon</code> on every animation frame which will be very inefficient, particularly in a tight animation loop.  Far better to create it once when the application starts.</p>
