<p>The computer on which you are viewing the log does not have a EventLog source registered with that name.  So the eventviewer does not know what multi-lingual token substitution to use.
Maybe .Net 2.0 is not installed?
Anyway, try creating a text file and naming it "net2errorreporting.reg" with these contents:</p>

<pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog\Application\.NET Runtime 2.0 Error Reporting]
"EventMessageFile"="C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\DW\\DW20.EXE"
"TypesSupported"=dword:00000007
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure the DW20.exe is present in that directory (or update the path in your new file).  Then, right-click on the file in Explorer and click Merge.</p>
