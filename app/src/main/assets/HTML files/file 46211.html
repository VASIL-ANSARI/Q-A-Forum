<p>First of all you are better off leaving it the way it is, as reflection is  much slower than normal access, and its a bad idea to include it in operators as they may be used in loops etc, but if you want to achieve a similar effect do the following:</p>

<p>Use a Dictionary seeing as your fields are all floats, then you can add a method to</p>

<pre><code>private Dictionary&lt;string,float&gt; fields = new Dictionary&lt;string,float&gt;()

public PlayerStats()
{
    fields.Add("Health", value);
    // other fields here 
}

public void SetField(string name, float value)
{
     if(!fields.ContainsKey(name))
         throw new InvalidOperationException("Field doesnt exists");
     fields[name] = value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your class could have a default set of fields which you can add to.</p>

<p>The + operator method would loop through the dictionary keys and sum the values on both objects.</p>

<pre><code>public static PlayerStats operator +(PlayerStats ps1, PlayerStats ps2){
    var playerstats = new PlayerStats();
    foreach(var key in fields.keys)
    {
      playerstats[key] = ps1[key] + ps2[key];
    }
    return playerstats;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can add strongly typed accessor's as properties</p>

<pre><code>public float Health
{
     get { return fields["Health"]; }
     set { field["Health"] = value; }
}
</code></pre>
