<p>I think what you want are separate columns for each group:</p>

<p>For your <strong>Under 21</strong> column, the expression would be:</p>

<pre><code>=SUM(IIF(Fields!Age.Value &lt; 21, 1, 0) )
</code></pre>

<p>For <strong>21 - 30</strong>, use: </p>

<pre><code>=SUM(IIF(Fields!Age.Value &gt;= 21 AND Fields!Age.Value &lt;= 30, 1, 0) )
</code></pre>

<p>And so on. The downside is that you need to create a separate one for each age group. Luckily we don't live too long. </p>

<p>Now that I re-read your question, it looks like you already have it the way you want. Are you just need to use <code>=CountRows()</code> for the number in the group?</p>
