<pre><code>Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException

</code></pre>

<p>You have a NPE in line 46 of your class. The code, posted lacks some lines obviously, but I suppose it's this line <code>String phrase = response.getStatusLine().getReasonPhrase();</code> as <code>response</code> would be <code>null</code> if anything goes wrong with the <code>httpclient.execute(request);</code></p>

<p>So, just put that line within the <code>try/catch</code> block as well and add a simple <code>return null;</code> at the end of the method instead.</p>
