<p>You should remove <code>using namespace std;</code> because this namespace <em>already contains a function called <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/swap/" rel="nofollow"><code>swap</code></a></em> and the compiler doesn't know which one to choose. To be honest, you don't really need to write such a function yourself, it has already been done for you.</p>

<p>Another way is to rename your function to something other than <code>swap</code>.</p>
