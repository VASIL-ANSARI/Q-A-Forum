<p>In the 1990s I wrote I program running on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS" rel="nofollow">MS-DOS</a> which used a product called Personal Computer High Resolution Timing (PCHRT) by a company called Ryle Design, in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan.</p>

<p>Their product provided a library of routines that provided micro-second resolution. It worked beautifully, by interfacing directly with the 8253 or 8254 timing chip found in PCs back in those days.</p>

<p>If you can track down Ryle Design, they may have found a way to provide high resolution timing under Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p>When Windows replaced MS-DOS I had to abandon that product and moved my product into custom hardware using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller" rel="nofollow">microcontroller</a> to achieve high-resolution timing. I couldn't find a way to get high-resolution timing under Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p>This article, although many years old, may help:</p>
