<p>This error means that at least one row in your Pickup_withoutproxy2.txt file has a value in its first column that is larger than an int (your PickupId field).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An Int can only accept values between -2147483648 to 2147483647.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Review your data to see what's going on.  You could try to load it into a temp table with a varchar data type if your txt file is extremely large and difficult to see.  Easy enough to check for an int once loaded in the database.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
