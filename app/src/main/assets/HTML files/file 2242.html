<p>If your interface is in Interface Builder, is the outlet for txtUserName5 hooked up?</p>

<p>For your fifth text field, why don't you have these lines after "foo" like you do for the other text fields?</p>

<pre><code>if (numFive &gt; 1)
{
    //foo
    [txtUserName5 becomeFirstResponder];
    txtUserName5.text = nil;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, for your else clause, rather than become first responder again, you should resign first responder (to dismiss the keyboard):</p>

<pre><code>else
{
    //[txtUserName5 becomeFirstResponder];
    [txtUserName5 resignFirstResponder];
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>
