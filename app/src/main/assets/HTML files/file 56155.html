<p>I'd likely choose Option A, but not maps. If you have binary data, just use an array of size 2 (this is one of the rare cases when using an array is right); if you have a small domain consider having two vectors, one for keys, one for values. This is because vector search can be made extremely efficient on at least on x86 / x64 architectures. Be sure to hide this implementation detail by providing an accessor function (i.e., <code>const value&amp; T::lookup(const key&amp;)</code>). I'd vote against using a tuple as a map key as it makes it both slower and more complicated. If you need to extremely optimize and your domains are so small that the product of their cardinality fits within 64 bits, you might just manually create an index key (like: (1&lt;&lt;3) * key4bits + (1&lt;&lt;2) * keyBinary + key2bits), in this case you'll use a map (or two vectors).</p>
