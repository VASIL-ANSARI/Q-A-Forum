<p><code>@UiField</code> has a <code>provided</code> property whose default value is <code>false</code>, meaning that UiBinder will create an instance and assign it to the field. If you provide a value yourself, then set it to true:</p>

<pre><code>@UiField(provided = true) RegistrationDTO registration;
</code></pre>

<p>(btw, as you're setting it from the constructor, I'd go as far as making the field <code>final</code>)</p>
