<p>I think the issue is you take a TABLE_NAME as a parameter to the constructor, expecting it to create this new table when opening an existing database, and this will not work. You should initialize ALL the tables you need in <code>onCreate</code> as it only happens once per database. </p>

<p>Given that, I don't think you should have that constructor parameter and I don't think you should create a new instance of <code>DbHelper</code> on every call to <code>open()</code>. I would probably go further than that and make <code>DbControl</code> a singleton, which just wraps the <code>DbHelper</code> and exposes the methods you create.</p>
