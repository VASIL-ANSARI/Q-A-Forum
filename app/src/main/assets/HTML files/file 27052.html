<p>You can change the way you do your division.  Perhaps your loop could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Figure out how many digits you have.  I'll leave that to you
int digits = ...;
for(int i = digits; i &lt; 0; i--) {
    int currentDigit = (x / Math.exp(10, i-1)) % 10;

    // You have your digit, so the checking/summing happens here.
}
</code></pre>

<p>An example would be if you have the number 1234.  It has 4 digits, so the first iteration of the loop, i = 4.  So, the expression becomes:</p>

<pre><code>int currentDigit = (1234 / 1000) % 10;
</code></pre>

<p>Which yields 1.  The second iteration would be:</p>

<pre><code>int currentDigit = (1234 / 100) % 10;
</code></pre>

<p>Which yields 2.  The division truncates the right side of the number that you don't want to see, and the modulus truncates the left side that you don't want to see.</p>
