<p>Simply use <code>*</code> as version, like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "name": "your app name"
  , "version": "0.0.1"
  , "private": true
  , "dependencies": {
      "slider": "*"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:
As noted in the comments, this is not a very good idea, it is better to state dependencies as "^1.2.3" (will match 1.x) or even better -  "~1.2.3" (will match 1.2.x).</p>
