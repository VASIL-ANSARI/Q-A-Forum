<p>If you need <code>IMyFooDependency</code> only for <code>buzz</code> creation, then you actually need buzz:</p>

<pre><code>class MyNiceConsumer
{
  private readonly IMyBarDependency bar;
  private readonly string buzz;

  MyNiceConsumer(string buzz, IMyBarDependency bar)
  { 
     this.buzz = buzz;
     this.bar = bar;
  }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>And create instance of nice consumer this way:</p>

<pre><code>new MyNiceConsumer(foo.GetBuzz(), bar);
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see any difference between obtaining buzz before passing parameters to constructor, or obtaining it inside constructor. Same value will be returned from repository. So, you don't need to depend on repository.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Technically there is nothing wrong with complex initialization logic in constructor. Take a look on winforms <code>InitializeComponent</code> method, where all controls are created, initialized and added to form.</p>

<p>But it violates SRP (creation and initialization) and its hard to test. You can read more about this flaw <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/flaw-constructor-does-real-work/" rel="nofollow">on writing testable code guide</a>. Main idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not create collaborators in your constructor, but pass them in.
  (Donât look for things! Ask for things!)</p>
</blockquote>
