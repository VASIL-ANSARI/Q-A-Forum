<p>Q1. what happens is called <em>stack overflow</em> but the effect is that you are going outside the allowed memory for the stack hence you are trying to access something that you can't access, so it's technically a <em>segmentation fault</em>.</p>

<p>Q2. your example doesn't fit because the stack doesn't hide any previous content, any pointer that points to anything which is deeper in the stack is still valid, it doesn't get hidden by a successive call. It's called a stack because it behaves like a stack (with the data allocated which grows on the top of it) but anything which is below is just memory and can be legally accessed if you keep a pointer to it.</p>

<p>Just an additional note, the call stack contains also the <em>activation records</em> of the function calls, which are used to be able to return from them correctly.</p>
