<p>It is not possible to cancel in any point, the purpose of CancellationToken is to allow user to cancel the operation, when the long running operation expect that...</p>

<pre><code>while(!finished)
{
     cancelToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
     //Some not cancelable operations
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is more common method of cancelable method</p>

<pre><code>private static void LongRunning(CancellationToken cancelToken)
{
    while (true)
    {
        if(cancelToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            return;
        }
        //Not canceled, continue to work
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is, that user requests cancellation, but only executor decides when to stop his work. Usually executor do cancellation after reaching some "safe-point"</p>

<p>It is not good experiance to <code>Abort</code> long running operations without asking oppinion, a lot of posts have been written about this.</p>
