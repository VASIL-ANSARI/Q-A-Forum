<p>Instead of trying to drive the Communicator GUI program, you might want to consider implementing an interface to the underlying chat protocol.</p>

<p>Communicator can speak the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol">XMPP protocol</a> - the same as Google Talk, Facebook Chat, etc.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Furthermore, several enterprise IM software products that do not natively use XMPP nevertheless include gateways to XMPP, including:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>IBM Lotus Sametime</li>
  <li>Microsoft Lync Server (formerly named Microsoft Office Communications Server â OCS)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You should be able to implement your own XMPP client. <a href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple"><code>libpurple</code></a>, the chat protocol library behind <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, implements XMPP; you could use this if you wanted to.</p>
