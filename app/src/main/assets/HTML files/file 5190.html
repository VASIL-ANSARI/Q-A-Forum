<p>You could do something like:</p>

<p>select id, name from Table1 a where a.id not in (select id from Table2)
UNION
select id, name from Table2 b</p>

<p>This would give you all the records from table1 that didn't have a corresponding match in table2 plus all of table2's records.  The union would then combine the results.</p>
