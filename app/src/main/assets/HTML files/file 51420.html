<p>If you have table <code>gradelevels</code> with only one column (<code>Grade</code>) with the possible grade values (1, 2, 3, ..., 10) you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO grade
SELECT
   studentdata.Id AS IdStudent,
   gradelevels.Grade AS Grade
FROM studentdata                  -- Get all the students,
CROSS JOIN gradelevels            -- one time for each possible grade.
LEFT JOIN grade ON
  -- Now we will know what (student, grade) combinations have an entry in grade.
  studentdata.Id = grade.IdStudent AND gradelevels.Grade = grade.Grade
WHERE grade.IdStudent IS NULL     -- Only take the rows where there isnt already a grade.
</code></pre>

<p>If you dont want to have a specific table with the gradelevels, you can just replace <code>CROSS JOIN gradelevels</code> with this:</p>

<pre><code>CROSS JOIN (SELECT Grade FROM grade GROUP BY Grade) gradelevels
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>SELECT</code> will give you all of the grades that are used, so if there is some grade that is not used for any students, it will not be inserted.</p>

<p>I would recommend you to have an unique index on <code>IdStudent</code> and <code>Grade</code> in the table <code>Grade</code> (or have them as primary key), to ensure no student has the same grade twice.</p>
