<p><strong>Update:</strong> Fixed <code>BETWEEN</code> predicate:</p>

<p>The reason it wasn't working is that the lowest value need to be the first value in the <code>BETWEEN</code> predicate, so in order to get those rows from the two tables having the <code>entry_date</code> between the max entry date - 15 and max entry date try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  o.Mat_Code,
  s.Mat_Spec,
  s.Mat_Make,
  o.Sup_Name,
  DATE_FORMAT(o.Entry_Date, '%Y-%m-%d') AS Entry_Date,
  o.DC_qty,
  o.Received_qty
FROM o_material_transaction_inward AS o
INNER JOIN s_material_details      AS s  ON s.Mat_Code     = o.Mat_Code
WHERE o.Entry_Date BETWEEN ((SELECT Max(Entry_Date) 
                            FROM o_material_transaction_inward) - 15)
                       AND (SELECT Max(Entry_Date) 
                            FROM o_material_transaction_inward) ;
</code></pre>
