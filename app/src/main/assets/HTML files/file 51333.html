<p>You can't manipulate <code>Fragment</code>s inside a <code>BroadCastReceiver</code>'s context. Essentially broadcast receivers are run inside application context and in which you can't access UI stuff.</p>

<p>If you would like to start an Activity once that broadcast is fired, you would need the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(context, MyActivity.class);
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
context.startActivity(intent);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Accessing to UI (including Fragments) must be done in an activity context.</p>

  <p>It seems that the BroadcastReceiver gets called everyday at around 2pm, not only on Tuesdays at 2pm, I want the app to update once a week. Is it maybe because I call my setAlarm() method on my UpcomingFragment's onCreate?</p>

<p>I think I have a better approach than yours. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Getting current time and setting its day of week to Tuesday may result in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/1319473/1841194">weird behaviors</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/19433001/1841194">boot completed broadcast receiver to set the alarm</a> may be better.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the former, your scheduling codes should set the alarm to the nearest coming Tuesday on 2 PM. For this, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3463756/is-there-a-good-way-to-get-the-date-of-the-coming-wednesday">this answer</a>  may be helpful.</p>

<p>For the latter, first, add the following permission to your manifest file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, define another broadcast receiver and declare it to the manifest file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;receiver android:name="your.package.name.BootCompletedReceiver"&gt;
    &lt;intent-filter&gt;
        &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/&gt;
    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/receiver&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In your newly created broadcast receiver add this code.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
    // Set the alarm to coming Tuesday on 2 PM
}
</code></pre>

<p>This ensures your app to get updated on every Tuesday on 2 PM in all circumstances. </p>
