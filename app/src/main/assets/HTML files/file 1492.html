<p>Would you happen to be using <code>global_settings.py</code> or <code>local_settings.py</code> in addition to <code>settings.py</code>?</p>

<p>The proper way to import Django's settings is to use the decoupled object <code>from django.conf import settings</code>, NOT to <code>import settings</code>.  See the doc page about it here: <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#using-settings-in-python-code" rel="nofollow">Using settings in Python code</a></p>

<p>I can't say for certain if that's the fix to your problem, but it's a step in the right direction to make sure your settings are being loaded properly if you say your issue is apps not showing up in <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>.</p>
