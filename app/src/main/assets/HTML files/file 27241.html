  <p>is iOS 7 still vulnerable to any of these IAP hacks/bypasses (custom

<p>No, <a href="http://www.in-appstore.com/" rel="nofollow">as far as I know</a>. But it's still early to judge.</p>

  <p>how can IAPs be protected in iOS 7?</p>

<p>As long as you verify the receipt on your server, no <em>generic</em> hacking method will work on it, unless your app is directly targeted. So if you're doing the server validation you should be OK.</p>
