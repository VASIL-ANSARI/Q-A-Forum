<p>It would help to see what you are using to create your forms. I assume you are using a ModelFrom. If you are using jQuery I think you could use the following in your forms.py to capture a new artist. However, if you are using jQuery I would save individual forms as templates and display them as necessary depending on a button or link event for a new artist.</p>

<p>forms.py</p>

<pre><code>class SongForm (forms.ModelForm):
    new_artist_name = forms.CharField()

    class Meta:
        model = Song

    def save(self, commit=True):
        # do something with self.cleaned_data['new_artist']
        new_artist = Artists.objects.filter('new_artist_name')
        if new_artist.exists():
            # Save song to artist.
        else:
            # Create and save new artist and save song to the
            # new artist.

        return super(SongForm, self).save(commit=commit)
</code></pre>
