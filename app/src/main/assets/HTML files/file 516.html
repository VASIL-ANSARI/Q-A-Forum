<p>You've got a couple options. One is to write a supressions file for valgrind that turns off reporting of stuff that you're not working on. Python has such a file, for example: 
<a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Misc/valgrind-python.supp" rel="nofollow">http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Misc/valgrind-python.supp</a></p>

<p>If valgrind doesn't like your setup, another possibility is using <code>libmudflap</code>; you compile your program with <code>gcc -fmudflap -lmudflap</code>, and the resulting code is instrumented for pointer debugging. Described in the gcc docs, and here: <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Mudflap_Pointer_Debugging" rel="nofollow">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Mudflap_Pointer_Debugging</a></p>
