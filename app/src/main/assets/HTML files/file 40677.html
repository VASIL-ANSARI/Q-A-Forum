<p>I don't believe there's anywhere in the protocol that would provide for this information - the originating system can quite easily <em>not</em> have a user account in any form that is understood - e.g. a dumb remote terminal.</p>

<p>There may be some ways of getting this information based on the client system (because you get the IP address and client name) and then back-tracking this via a known database of users -> systems; but this would only work if people accessed the system from known origin systems and didn't move around.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you know the client system and it's domain joined you could interrogate it remotely from an account that can interrogate the client system.</p>

<p>I'm open to being corrected on this, but to the best of my knowledge it's not doable.</p>
