<p>Yes. As far as the CLR/framework is concerned, they're normal types. In fact, you can do some <a href="http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2009/12/09/quot-magic-quot-null-argument-testing.aspx">interesting things</a> with reflection on anonymous types...</p>

<p>The current C# compiler actually creates a <em>generic</em> type though, so that two anonymous types which both just have a "Foo" property of different types will share a generic type, but have different closed types.</p>
