<p>Here a fragment of Martin Fowler's book <strong>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</strong>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A key point in this separation is the direction of the dependencies:
  the presentation depends on the model but the model doesn't depend on
  the presentation. People programming in the model should be entirely
  unaware of what presentation is being used, which both simplifies
  their task and makes it easier to add new presentations later on. It
  also means that presentation changes can be made freely without
  altering the model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think you should create Business methods that don't know who will access them. </p>

<p>The other class (Controller) knows how to call the business methods from the data received from the view.</p>
