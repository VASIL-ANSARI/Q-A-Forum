<p>It seems like you want to split on the whitespace outside the double-quotes. In that case you can try this regex:</p>

<pre><code>var tableau = s.split(/\s(?=(?:[^"]*"[^"]*")*[^"]*$)/);
</code></pre>

<p>this will split on whitespace, followed by an even number of double quotes.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<pre><code>\s          # Split on whitespace
(?=         # Followed by
   (?:      # Non-capture group with 2 quotes
     [^"]*  # 0 or more non-quote characters
     "      # 1 quote
     [^"]*  # 0 or more non-quote characters
     "      # 1 quote
   )*       # 0 or more repetition of previous group(multiple of 2 quotes will be even)
   [^"]*    # Finally 0 or more non-quotes
   $        # Till the end  (This is necessary)
)      
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you your final desired output:</p>

<pre><code>tableau[0] = research
tableau[1] = library
tableau[2] = "not available"
tableau[3] = author:"Bernard Shaw"
</code></pre>
