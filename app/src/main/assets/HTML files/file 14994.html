<p>If you are using code first you can customize the persistence mapping by using either a fluent code API or use attributes to refine the model. EF can resolve relationships through inference if you were to use a simple key name such as Id; in your case EF needs a hint that PersonID and AddressID are keys.</p>

<p>To use the attribute approach add a reference to System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations in your project and a corresponding 'using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;' in your source files as necessary. The following sample (EF 4.3.1) will generate a "one-to-many" relationship between the generated Addresses and Persons tables (you don't want a one-to-one in this case). After running the code, you will see the relationships in the SQL Server Database Diagram window.</p>

<pre><code>class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)

        using (ContactsEntities entities = new ContactsEntities())

            Address doeaddress = new Address() { Street = "1 Broadway", ZipCode = "01234" };
            Address doeaddress2 = new Address() { Street = "2 Broadway", ZipCode = "01234" };
            entities.Addresses.Add(doeaddress);
            entities.Persons.Add(new Person() { FirstName = "Jane", LastName = "Doe", Address = doeaddress });

            entities.Persons.Add(new Person() { FirstName = "Jim", LastName = "Doe", Address = doeaddress2 });
            entities.SaveChanges(); 
        }
