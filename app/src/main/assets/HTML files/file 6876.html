<p>Your code calls <code>$("abbr.timeago").timeago();</code> in a script block in the application template. This runs as the page is loaded for this first time, and enables timeago functionality on matching elements that exist at that moment. Any matching nodes that are added dynamically later on -- for instance your AJAX partial -- do <em>not</em> get timeago functionality.</p>

<p>One option is to call <code>$("abbr.timeago").timeago()</code> again after adding dynamic content. However, that can be hard to keep track of and remember to do as you add new functionality, which is why I use the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery">livequery plugin</a> instead. Include the livequery script in your page and replace <code>$("abbr.timeago").timeago();</code> with the following:</p>

<pre><code>$("abbr.timeago").livequery(function () { $(this).timeago(); });
</code></pre>

<p>This enables timeago on any matching nodes now <em>and</em> matching nodes added dynamically.</p>
