<p>Puppet is a very ill fit for this task. This calls for a script, which Puppet does not support. Puppet allows you to declare a piece of machine state that can portably enforced on different platforms.</p>

<p>The task is simple enough for a Shell or Perl Script.</p>

<p>With Puppet, it would entail the following scripts</p>

<ol>
<li>writing custom facts to retrieve each address / hostname pair</li>
<li>devising a defined type to render such a pair into an ethX file</li>
</ol>

<p>You'd possibly even need to generate the respective manifest, so that the appropriate interface index is chosen for each address.</p>

<p>All things considered, you would not make use of Puppet's strengths and suffer some of its weaknesses. </p>
