<p>Those are used to disambiguate variable names, and are absolutely required if you're using an array within a double quoted string, example:</p>

<pre><code>$SQL = "Select * FROM table WHERE field LIKE '{$value[5]}'";
</code></pre>

<p>Wouldn't work without the braces.</p>

<p>Here's another great example from PHP.net</p>

<pre><code>$beer = 'Heineken';
echo "$beer's taste is great"; // works; "'" is an invalid character for variable names
echo "He drank some $beers";   // won't work; 's' is a valid character for variable names but the variable is "$beer"
echo "He drank some ${beer}s"; // works
echo "He drank some {$beer}s"; // works
</code></pre>
