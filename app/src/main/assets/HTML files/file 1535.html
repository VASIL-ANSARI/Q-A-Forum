<p>Hmm? Paypal provides both API documentation and a sandbox for you to develop against.</p>

<p>Not sure - check Paypal's documents.</p>

<pre><code>I can't test a sandbox buyer account with a sandbox seller account through a real site.

<p>Why not? Just have the real site use the sanbox url/credentials, etc? I did all this a handful of years ago and I didn't have any issues. Granted PayPal's API and IPN isn't the best - it does work.</p>
