<p>Fork works like a binary tree. So its always 2^x number of processes on every x number of fork calls. </p>

<p>Lets understand with your example. </p>

<p><strong>First fork() call:</strong></p>

<p>When the first <code>fork()</code> is called. The parent process creates a new process. So we have 2 
threads.</p>

<p><strong>Second fork() call:</strong></p>

<p>At this point we have two processes(main process and a new created process).These two threads will call second fork individually and create 2 new processes each. so we have 4 threads.</p>

<p>You might have got the idea by now. Every time a fork() is encountered all the processes create their respective child processes(double themselves).</p>
