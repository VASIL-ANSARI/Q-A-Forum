<p>I just stumbled upon this question and don't know if you still need an answer.
But There is a very simple way to get what you want.</p>

<p>in your project in config you will find cucumber.yml
there is a line defining your standard options. You should change the formatting to "pretty" in there to always get the fancy output or just run cucumber with -f "pretty".</p>

<p>Here is the line I have in my cucumber.yml:</p>

<pre><code>std_opts = "--format #{ENV['CUCUMBER_FORMAT'] || 'pretty'} --strict --tags ~@wip"
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the output you will get:</p>

<pre><code> Scenario: Some scenario        # features/the_feature_its_in:line
    When I do something         # features/step_definitions/a_step_file.rb:12
    And I do another thing      # features/step_definitions/another_step_file.rb:180
    Then I validate something   # features/step_definitions/a_step_file.rb:25
</code></pre>

<p>The output will also be color coded and appear as they are run. Passing steps will be green.
Failing ones red and the failing ones will have the error message about the failure just following the step.</p>
