<p>I'm more familiar with ModeShape than Jackrabbit, but in general I think it's best practice to create a new session for each request, use that session to process the request, and then close the session. </p>

<p>Generally, sessions are pretty lightweight and inexpensive to create. But there are some reasons why creating separate sessions is better (or at least easier):</p>

<ol>
<li>javax.jcr.Session is not thread-safe, so if you're going to use a Session to handle multiple requests, you have to be sure that a Session is only being used in processing one request at a time. In other words, you'd some sort of pool of Sessions objects.</li>
<li>Session is stateful, so any information loaded by one session might be kept until the Session is refreshed or closed.</li>
<li>Session is for a specific user. If each incoming request might be associated with different users, you may be leaking privileges and data.</li>
</ol>

<p>There may be other reasons I'm not thinking of, but regardless I hope this helps.</p>
