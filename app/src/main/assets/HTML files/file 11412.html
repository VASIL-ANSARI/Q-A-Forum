<p>You don't need a debugger. What you need is called a profiler. Since you mention Ubuntu, you probably want to start with <code>gprof</code>.</p>

<p>Here's how you can use <code>gprof</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disable all compiler optimizations for your program (<code>-O0</code>) - optional of course</li>
<li>Add the <code>-g</code> and the <code>-pg</code> flags</li>
<li>Rebuild and run the program as usual</li>
<li>At this point your program should have produced a <code>gmon.out</code> file in the cwd</li>
<li><p>Use <code>gprof</code> to inspect data:</p>

<pre><code>gprof ./your_program &gt; prof
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Now you can view the <code>prof</code> file. It begins with the flat profile which simply tells you how much time it's spending in various functions.</p>
