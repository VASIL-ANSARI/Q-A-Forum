<p>You can use <code>getScreen().getVirtualKeyboard().setVisibility(VirtualKeyboard.HIDE)</code> -- with appropriate null checks after getScreen and getVirtualKeyboard, of course. </p>

<p>Note that this is only possible if you're targeting 4.7 or later -- if you want to support older platforms, you'll need a separate build without this code. </p>
