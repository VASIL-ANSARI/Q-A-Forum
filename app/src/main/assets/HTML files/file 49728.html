<p>the question was kinda unclear to me, but as far as I understand you could take a look at RegEx for filtering out on a String or clear the Console and put your output back in.</p>

<p>Clear console:</p>

<pre><code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cls");
</code></pre>

<p>RegEx example:</p>

<pre><code>yourString.replaceAll("[yourCharactersToReplace]","");
</code></pre>
