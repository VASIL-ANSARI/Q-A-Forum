<p><code>sort</code> accepts a compare function. All the function needs to do is compare two values and return a value less than 0 if a is considered smaller than b, bigger than 0 if a is larger than b, or 0 if they are equal. Using that comparison, the sort function handles the actual sorting.</p>

<p>For numbers, this compare function is easy. You just return <code>a - b</code>, and you got your return value of <code>&lt;0</code>, <code>0</code> or <code>&gt;0</code>.</p>
