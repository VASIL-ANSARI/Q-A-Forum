<p>If <code>canvasvg</code> includes <code>saveall</code> then you must do <code>canvasvg.saveall()</code>. If <code>saveall</code> were inside <code>turtle</code>, then you would have it because you did <code>from turtle import *</code>.</p>

<p>Your other option is changing <code>import canvasvg</code> to <code>from canvasvg import *</code> but <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2386714/why-is-import-bad">I don't recommend it</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I tried to run your script and I noticed that, actually, <code>canvasvg</code> contains two different submodules: <code>canvasvg.canvasvg</code> and <code>canvasvg.setup</code>. I don't know why. However, you can just replace:</p>

<pre><code>import canvasvg
</code></pre>

<p>With:</p>

<pre><code>from canvasvg import canvasvg
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can call <code>canvasvg.saveall()</code>.</p>

<p>However, I discovered that <a href="https://github.com/WojciechMula/canvas2svg/issues/2" rel="nofollow">there is a bug</a> in the last Python 3 version of canvasvg. Thus, you should either wait for canvasvg developers to fix it, or you can use the Python 2 version of canvasvg.</p>

<p>If you want to switch to Python 2, you should only change <code>input</code> to <code>raw_input</code>. I tested and it seems to work flawlessly.</p>
