<p>having the folder separated like you do is a step in the right direction.  next step is to configure IIS to point to that separate folder.  then you would need to create a DNS entry for your sub-domain at your DNS host. "subdomain.domain.com". You would be creating a new site, so you could use the same IP address, as long as you add the proper host headers for each site.</p>
