<p>You could just include results.php in your query.php page if you're just looking to keep the code separate in the source files but aren't actually required to redirect from one page to another:</p>

<p>In query.php:</p>

<pre><code>$rs = mysql_query($query);
include "results.php";
</code></pre>

<p>In results.php:</p>

<pre><code>while ($row == mysql_fetch_array($rs){
  //do something 
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as trying to "return $rs" from one page to another that's not how PHP works.  The return statement is only valid within a function.  If you want to actually pass data from one PHP page to another and will be redirecting to that other page then you'll need to use either a session, a cookie, pass it in the URL (i.e. use GET) or use curl and add it as a POST var.</p>
