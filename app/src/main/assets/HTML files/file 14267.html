<p>Order by <code>Company</code> first:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY [Company], [CompanyID]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You're currently ordering by <code>CompanyID</code> (which I assume is a primary key integer), and then <code>Company DESC</code>. This means it will order the records by the numerical <code>CompanyID</code>, then any which are matching (which I doubt would), would then be ordered by the Company Name, Z-A.</p>
