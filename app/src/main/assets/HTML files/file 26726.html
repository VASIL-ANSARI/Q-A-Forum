<p>Short answer: Yes, media-queries is the main way to go in order to create fluid layouts.</p>

<p>If you're just starting out, I would recommend you to learn writing these from scratch in order to get an understanding. There is a good article available at <a href="http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/" rel="nofollow">http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/</a></p>

<p>However, if you do not wish to code the media-queries yourself; that kind of pages with a fluid responsive layout can easily be made with bootstrap. </p>

<p>To download bootstrap, go to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" rel="nofollow">http://getbootstrap.com</a> and start working from there.</p>
