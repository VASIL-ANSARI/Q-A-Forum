<p>You could use the setMatrix method on Canvas, calculate the scaling needed once, and in your code use a fixed coordinate system.</p>

<p>As for openGL for 2D, it works much faster than Canvas, and has a larger memory buffer for bitmaps. Canvas works well for small games, but not intensive ones.</p>
