<p>What you are asking is impossible. Think about it for a while: If the computer were to do nothing else than execute your program: who would do the memory management while your program is running? <strong>You would have to be your own operating system!</strong></p>

<p>There is another flaw in your test: The file is most-likely not read from the flash drive anyway. It would come from the disk cache i.e. RAM on any modern operating system. To forego this, you would have to clear that cache, for example by ejecting and re-inserting the drive.</p>
