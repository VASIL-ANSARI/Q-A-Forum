<p>Make sure that each record contains date metadata on last changed/modified time, and load that as part of your data object. Then when attempting to commit the row to database, check the last_modified time in the table to ensure that it is the SAME as the one stored in memory for your object. If it matches, commit it, else throw exception.</p>
