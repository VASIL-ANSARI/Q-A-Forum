<p>You cannot delete/modify[*] individual lines of a text file; the only solution is to 1) create a new temporary file, 2) copy the contents up to, but not including, the line that you want modified/deleted, 3) output the modified line, 4) copy the rest of the original file, 5) replace the old file with the temporary file.</p>

<p>[*] Modification is possible ONLY if the modified line has the same length as the original line.</p>

<p>EDIT: PS: Using fgets, followed by sscanf (or some other way of tokenizing the line) will save you much grief.</p>
