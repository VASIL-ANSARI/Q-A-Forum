<p>You do not have a main method. For simplicity's sake, the main method can be explained as a static method, not associated with any objects, that is the first thing to be fired when the Java program is run. It works similarly to any other method in your program, meaning that you can code as you'd like inside of it.</p>

<p>Fire your method from within a main method such as the following:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    diceGenerator();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, your code isn't in any kind of loop, so the dice rolling will only execute once.</p>
