<p>Never used Mediawiki but that sort of problem in my experience is indicative of a php error that occurred but was suppressed either with the @ operator or because php error output to screen is turned off.</p>

<p>I hate to resort to this debugging method but when absolutely and utterly frustrated in php I will just start putting echo statements every few lines (always with a marker so I remember to remove them later), to figure out exactly where the error is coming from.  Eventually you'll get to the bottom of the rabbit hole and figure out exactly what the problematic line of code is.</p>
