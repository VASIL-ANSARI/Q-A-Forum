<p>To decrypt in Objective C you can use Apples's version of the CommonCrypto C library.  It has a man page and there are already several posts that show decryption examples on Stack Overflow for example:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27712173/determine-if-key-is-incorrect-with-cccrypt-kccoptionpkcs7padding-objective-c">Determine if key is incorrect with CCCrypt kCCOptionPKCS7Padding-Objective C</a></p>

<p>which comes from the tutorial here:</p>

<p>This also really helped me:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27014292/cccrypt-decrypting-in-aes-cbc-works-even-without-iv/27019468#27019468">CCCrypt decrypting in AES CBC works even without IV</a></p>

<p>If you have trouble getting it working post some code.</p>
