<p>In Javascript, undefined properties (such as <code>isfavorite</code>) are perceived as a false boolean. Inside your directive you should declare the <code>isfavorite</code> property which will automatically be false.</p>

<pre><code>$scope.isfavorite; //this is undefined, therefore evaluated as false
</code></pre>

<p>As written in MDN documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If value is omitted or is 0, -0, null, false, NaN, undefined, or the empty string (""), the object has an initial value of false. </p>
</blockquote>
