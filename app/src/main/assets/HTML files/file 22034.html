<p>In my research it appears that <strong>Jewelry Box does not support newer versions of RVM</strong>. I don't actually know if this is the issue that you're running into, but it seems likely.  I'd recommend uninstalling Jewelry Box and reinstalling RVM.</p>

<p>To reinstall RVM, you'll need to completely <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3558656/how-to-remove-rvm-ruby-version-manager-from-my-system">remove RVM</a> and then use the same string you used before, but this time add --rails at the end, so you get rails as well. </p>

<pre><code>\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails
</code></pre>

<p>The other parts of rails installer should still be there like git and sm.</p>

<p>Jewelry Box will no longer be useful, but for that I highly recommend getting to know Bundler. The de facto standard for working with ruby gems. It'll be more useful when using rails and will be less likely to run into dependency issues.</p>

<p>Welcome Rails as well, stick with it and you'll be a pro in no time.  I highly recommend taking a look at <a href="http://railscasts.com" rel="nofollow">Rails Casts</a>. Very good short and digestable videos tutorials for rails.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
