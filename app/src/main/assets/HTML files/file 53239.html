<p>first of all, you don't need temporary tables (especially 2nd one, as its not used at all):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
A.from, A.to
FROM booking as A
LEFT JOIN
turnostomados as B
ON (A.from = B.to)
WHERE A.day = ".$weekday."
AND B.confirmed IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>then, run <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-extended.html" rel="nofollow"><code>explain extended</code></a> to find out execution plan and add appropriate indexes to these two tables</p>

<p>probably you will need index on bookings <code>(day, from, to)</code></p>
