<p>Because there are many devices with so many different screen sizes, resolutions, etc., probably the main thing you have to avoid is using absolute positions when placing layout elements. The Android SDK has some powerful structures to avoid absolute positioning (i.e. LinearLayout, RelativeLayout), so try working with them and instead of defining positions like "12dp", use the correct combination of layout_width, layout_height (wrap_content or match_parent) and layout_weight, which can help you to place layout elements without specifying absolute positions.</p>
