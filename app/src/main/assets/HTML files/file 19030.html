<p>EDIT - Try this:</p>

<p>I think you may need to change $_FILES['file'] to $_FILES['image_file'] to work with your setup. I have left it as below for ease of reading...</p>

<pre><code>if ($_FILES['file']['error'] === UPLOAD_ERR_OK &amp;&amp; $_FILES['file']['size'] &gt; 0){

   ... upload was successful ...

}elseif($_FILES['file']['error'] === UPLOAD_ERR_OK &amp;&amp; $_FILES['file']['size'] == 0){

   die("Upload failed, random upload issue... please try again);
   // change this error to something more useful... (leave this error in for testing)

}else {

   die("Upload failed with error code " . $_FILES['file']['error']);

}
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't solve the random filesize issue, but it will allow your code / process to continue. Treat it as a failed upload and tell the user to try again...</p>
