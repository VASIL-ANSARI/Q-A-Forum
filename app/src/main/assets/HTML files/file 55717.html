<p>Sorry, but you're going to need to use JavaScript since the API for canvas is written in it.</p>

<p>Another issue you're having, I think is you data layering. Which will eventually look like this:</p>

<p><code>C# Server &lt;- Javascript Events -&gt; Canvas View</code></p>

<p>Basically Javascript will call async methods to your server every so often, either getting data (current high scores) or sending data (giving new scores). In turn it will update the canvas view. Also, everything that happens to the canvas will be handled in JavaScript through its event handling system. These event handles can trigger other events like calls to the server or a local event like the current falling block to rotate.</p>

<p>I don't see away around JavaScript being a huge part of this, since you can't really do a real time game without a lot of it being client side, at least in a web based game.</p>
