<p>That method does not exist on Windows Phone, because you are many to use async IO constantly. You need <code>GetRequestStreamAsync</code> or <code>BeginGetRequestStream</code>.

The relevant example is here, in the phone a based documentation: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/System.Net.HttpWebRequest%28v=vs.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/System.Net.HttpWebRequest(v=vs.105).aspx</a></p>
