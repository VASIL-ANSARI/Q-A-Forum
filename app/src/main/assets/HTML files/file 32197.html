<p>First off, good job noticing that large if/else statements are not a positive thing. There are a lot of ways to make them less painful and easier to read, some of which you've touched on. For example, you could move this to another class (as you said), or at the very least another method to isolate them from the rest of your code.</p>

<p>One design pattern that I've found helpful in this situation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern" rel="nofollow">chain-of-responsibility pattern</a>. In the CoR pattern, you have a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern" rel="nofollow">command</a> objects that are responsible for knowing if they can handle a particular value. So in your case, you'd have a command object for each if/else in your logic, and each command object would know if they can handle newCondition.number. If the command object can handle the value, it performs its' logic (in your case, it'd perform the stuff inside the if/else); if it cannot, it passes the message along to the next object in the chain.</p>

<p>This has the benefit of isolating the logic and making it easier to add functionality with minimal impact. You can also name the command subclasses something interesting and informative to remove some of the mystique of the code.</p>

<p>At the very least, I'd refactor the if statement into its own method. And if you have lots of if/else statements, I'd consider the chain-of-responsibility pattern.</p>

<p>There is a great book called <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/r2p.html" rel="nofollow">Refactoring to Patterns</a> that I highly recommend.</p>
