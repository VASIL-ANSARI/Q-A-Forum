<p>Try creating a covering index on</p>

<p>( enterprise_id, creation_date, caller_circle )</p>

<p>This way, the WHERE clause is optimized by the ID, and the GROUP BY can be used from the index too.</p>

<p>Also, change from "count(ID)" to just "count(*)" so the engine does not have to go to the page to get the ID, it just knows a record qualified from the covering index.</p>

<p>I would then suggest creating a secondary table that holds the simple aggregate roll-ups for the given enterprise, date and caller circle.  That is... if the raw data won't change historically (such as back-filling call data).  It happened, it's done, the totals are what they are for the historical date.  Then, if anything needs to be re-calibrated, you could rebuild on a gradual basis, such as for a month/year so you are not plowing through a billion records in the future.</p>
