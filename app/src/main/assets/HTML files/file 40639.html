<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Library/</strong> This is the top-level directory for any files that are not
  user data files. You typically put files in one of several standard
  subdirectories. iOS apps commonly use the Application Support and
  Caches subdirectories; however, you can create custom subdirectories.
  Use the Library subdirectories for any files you donât want exposed to
  the user. Your app should not use these directories for user data
  files. The contents of the Library directory (with the exception of
  the Caches subdirectory) are backed up by iTunes. For additional
  information about the Library directory and its commonly used
  subdirectories, see The Library Directory Stores App-Specific Files.</p>
  
  <p><strong>tmp/</strong> Use this directory to write temporary files that do not need to
  persist between launches of your app. Your app should remove files
  from this directory when they are no longer needed; however, the
  system may purge this directory when your app is not running. The
  contents of this directory are not backed up by iTunes.</p>

<p>You shouldn't put these kind of files in Library, instead you can use temporary directory \tmp:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *fileName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@_%@", [[NSProcessInfo processInfo] globallyUniqueString], @"OfflineData"];
NSURL *fileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[NSTemporaryDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:fileName]];
</code></pre>
