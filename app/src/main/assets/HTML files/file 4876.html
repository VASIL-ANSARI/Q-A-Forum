<p>You can use:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(1) FROM MyTable WHERE ... 
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>WHERE [NOT] EXISTS 
( SELECT 1 FROM MyTable WHERE ... )
</code></pre>

<p>This will be more efficient than <code>SELECT *</code> since you're simply selecting the value 1 for each row, rather than all the fields.</p>

<p>There's also a subtle difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column name):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>COUNT(*)</code> will count all rows, including nulls</li>
<li><code>COUNT(column name)</code> will only count <em>non null occurrences</em> of column name</li>
</ul>
