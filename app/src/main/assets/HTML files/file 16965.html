<p>Since you are trying to create a custom UITabBarController, you should use a container view controller. To do that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open your storyboard and add a custom UIVIewController (let's call it ContainerViewController).</li>
<li>Insert the UIVIews that represent your tabs into that controller and then insert another UIVIew (*currentView in the code below) that will take the rest of the screen. That's what the child controllers will use to display their scene.</li>
<li>Create a UIVIewController for each scene (child controller) you need, as you would normally, and give each of them a unique identifier (Identity Inspector -> Storyboard ID)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you have to add the following code your ContainerViewController:</p>

<pre><code>@interface ContainerViewController ()
    @property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIView *currentView; // Connect the UIView to this outlet
    @property (strong, nonatomic) UIViewController *currentViewController;
    @property (nonatomic) NSInteger index;
@end

@implementation ContainerViewController

// This is the method that will change the active view controller and the view that is shown
 - (void)changeToControllerWithIndex:(NSInteger)index
{
    if (self.index != index){
        self.index = index;
        [self setupTabForIndex:index];

        // The code below will properly remove the the child view controller that is
        // currently being shown to the user and insert the new child view controller.
        UIViewController *vc = [self setupViewControllerForIndex:index];
        [self addChildViewController:vc];
        [vc didMoveToParentViewController:self];

        if (self.currentViewController){
            [self.currentViewController willMoveToParentViewController:nil];

            [self transitionFromViewController:self.currentViewController toViewController:vc duration:0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionNone animations:^{
                [self.currentViewController.view removeFromSuperview];
                [self.currentView addSubview:vc.view];
            } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
                [self.currentViewController removeFromParentViewController];
                self.currentViewController = vc;
            }];
        } else {
            [self.currentView addSubview:vc.view];
            self.currentViewController = vc;
        }
    }
}

// This is where you instantiate each child controller and setup anything you need  on them, like delegates and public properties.
- (UIViewController *)setupViewControllerForIndex:(NSInteger)index {

    // Replace UIVIewController with your custom classes
    if (index == 0){
        UIViewController *child = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"STORYBOARD_ID_1"];
        return child;
    } else {
        UIViewController *child = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"STORYBOARD_ID_2"];
        return child;
    }
}

// Use this method to change anything you need on the tabs, like making the active tab a different colour
- (void)setupTabForIndex:(NSInteger)index{

}

// This will recognize taps on the tabs so the change can be done
- (IBAction)tapDetected:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer {
    [self changeToControllerWithIndex:gestureRecognizer.view.tag];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, each view you create that represents a tab should have it's own TapGestureRecognizer and a number for its tag.</p>

<p>By doing all this you will have a single controller with the buttons you need (they don't have to be reusable), you can add as much functionality you want in them (that's what the setupTabBarForIndex: method will be used) and you won't violate DRY.</p>
