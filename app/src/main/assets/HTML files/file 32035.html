<p>The trick here to use a projection node.  A projection will allow you to rename columns and also filter data.  You could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>prj_1 = CE_PROJECTION(:emp_table,["ID","FNAME", "LNAME", "AGE", "PAY" AS "SALARY"], '"PAY"' &gt; 1000);

prj_2 = CE_PROJECTION(:address,["EMP_ID" AS "ID", "ADDR1", "ADDR2", "ZIP"]);

join_1 = CE_JOIN(:prj_1, :prj_2, ["ID"]);
</code></pre>
