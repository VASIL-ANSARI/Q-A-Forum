<p>The code you posted wouldn't compile, because references cannot be default constructed. Also, you seem to think you are reseating a reference, which you are not (see <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/references#reseating-refs" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Instead, you are just copying objects over whatever _bar was referencing, so the value of:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;(f.GetBar())
</code></pre>

<p>never changes. You shouldn't delete _bar because you never owned it (or even really knew it was dynamically allocated) to begin with. That should be the responsibility of whoever "newed" it.</p>
