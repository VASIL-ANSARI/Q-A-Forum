<p>From the GOF book, the intents are very different:</p>

<p>Visitor - Object Behavioral - Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.</p>

<p>Bridge - Object Structural - Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.</p>

<p>Strategy -  Object Behavioral - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.</p>

<p>There are lots of Java example around.</p>
