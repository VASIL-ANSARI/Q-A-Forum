<p>You can use same bundle identifier, Just make sure provisioning profile must have selected with VOIP. else you would not get notification.</p>

<p>Yes, you need to implement Pushkit framework. if and if your app is related to VOIP. This helps specifically in silent push notification, that does not come in notification tray, but make active your app in background mode. ( would not invoke or come in foreground )</p>

<p>For example - If your app is like Skype.</p>

<p>Once you get incoming call notification, when you gets missed call notification, incoming call notification gets cancelled ( Removed from notification tray )</p>

<p>Getting silent push notification though push kit, you can schedule local notification, while getting another ( missed call ) notification you can remove earlier local notification and schedule missed call local notification.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
