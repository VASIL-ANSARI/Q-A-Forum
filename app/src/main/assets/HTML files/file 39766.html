<p>Welcome to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell" rel="nofollow">DLL Hell</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In COM and other parts of Windows, prior to the introduction of side-by-side Registry-free assemblies, the Registry was used for determining which underlying DLL to use. If a different version of a module was registered, this DLL would be loaded instead of the expected one. This scenario could be caused by conflicting installations that register different versions of the same libraries, in which case the last installation would prevail.</p>
