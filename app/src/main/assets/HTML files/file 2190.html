<p>Not sure I completely follow what you're building, but would it work can use the pub section of their website? (which isn't very discoverable).</p>

<p>Using a URL like this no credentials are needed:
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/?first=Ryan&amp;last=Farley" rel="nofollow">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/?first=Ryan&amp;last=Farley</a></p>

<p>You could parse the results to display differently, however doing so does violate the site user agreement. </p>

<p>I am pretty sure their public API does not allow for a public search (at least not the last I looked at it)</p>
