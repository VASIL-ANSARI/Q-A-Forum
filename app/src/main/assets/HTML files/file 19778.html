<p>This should get you started, but it is difficult to know exactly what you'll need.</p>

<p><code>%include &lt;windows.i&gt;</code> makes SWIG handle Window-isms like <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code>.</p>

<p>SWIG does not recurse include files by default, so include the ones you need SWIG to process.  There is a switch to recurse, but then it would process <code>stdio.h</code>.</p>

<pre><code>%module gaiageo

%{
#include "gaiageo.h"
%}

%include &lt;windows.i&gt;
%include "gaiageo.h"
%include "gg_const.h"
%include "gg_structs.h"
%include "gg_core.h"
%include "gg_mbr.h"
%include "gg_formats.h"
%include "gg_dynamic.h"
%include "gg_advanced.h"
</code></pre>

<p>Save that as a <code>gaiageo.i</code> file and run something like:</p>

<pre><code>swig -c++ -&lt;target_language&gt; gaiageo.i
</code></pre>
