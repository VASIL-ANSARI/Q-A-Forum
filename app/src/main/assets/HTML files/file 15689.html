<p>You can see what density your device thinks it is by looking at the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html#density" rel="nofollow"><code>DisplayMetrics</code> density</a>.  That's where the device will look first for resources.</p>

<p>I can't find the reference right now, but I'm pretty sure the value of <code>density</code> in that class for mdpi is 1.0, hdpi is 1.5, and xhdpi is 2.0.</p>

<p>Remember that screens also have a size which is independent of the density.  If you're trying to account for different screen sizes only with art density, you're doing it wrong.  Ideally, a <code>large-mdpi</code> image and a <code>large-hdpi</code> image will be approximately the same size when measured with a plastic ruler on the screen, but the <code>hdpi</code> image should look nicer on account of having more pixels.  You can have <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#AlternativeResources" rel="nofollow">more refined size qualifiers</a> than just "large screen" and "normal screen".  That might do what you want.</p>
