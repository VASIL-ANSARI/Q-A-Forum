<p>Just looking at the code, this line:</p>

<p><code>if (! in_category ('-32'));</code></p>

<p>looks a little odd.</p>

<p>Firstly, it looks like a double negative â it's not not in the category 32.</p>

<p>Also, can you pass a id as a string <code>'-32'</code>? â the docs suggest the id should be a integer.</p>

<p>Does that help in any way?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Also, your <code>if</code> should end in a colon, so:</p>

<p><code>if(!in_category(32)):</code></p>
