<blockquote>
  <p>The return value is â1 if the function could not create the dialog box, or IDABORT if some other error occurred, in which case the Output window will contain error information from GetLastError.</p>

<p>The system is unable to create and run your dialog. You can read the provided MSDN link for more information.</p>

<p>It is likely you have a control or DLL that is not registered correctly that the dialog needs and therefore cannot find.</p>
