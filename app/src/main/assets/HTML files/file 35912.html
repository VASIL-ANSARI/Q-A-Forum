<p>Changing your project over to Maven may be a big help; .jar files would no longer be stored in version control.</p>

<p>You would need to open project A, run 'mvn install' to produce the library files on your PC, and then you could use project A's libraries from project B.</p>

<p>Another alternative is to run your own Maven artifacts server, such as Artifactory, Nexus, etc... Project B would look at the artifacts server to see if project A's files are available.</p>
