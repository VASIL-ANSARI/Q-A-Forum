<p>Take a look at notifications, which are intended for general distribution to multiple instances exactly like this.  See the docs for <code>NSNotificationCenter</code>.</p>

<p>Notifications are not just for hardware events, as you seem to misunderstand.  They are a general purpose broadcast mechanism to distribute information, just as delegation is a general purpose mechanism to allow an individual object to manage another objects behaviour.</p>

<p>In other words, your communications handler should post a notification of state change, and your other controllers should all register to receive that notification, and can respond however is appropriate for them.</p>

<p>Post example; put this when your file has finished loading:</p>

<pre><code>    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"PDLAssetManagerAssetFileLoaded" object:self];
</code></pre>

<p>And in each controller that needs to update itself when loading is complete, put:</p>

<pre><code>[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(loadComplete:) name:@"PDLAssetManagerAssetFileLoaded" object:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>loadComplete:</code> is a method that takes the notification as an argument, and does whatever you need it to do.  You can pass extra data using the userInfo dictionary, which I have ignored here.  <strong>Hot tip</strong>: make the notification name string a constant; I skipped this in the interest of brevity.</p>
