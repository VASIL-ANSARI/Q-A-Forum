<p>This is because <code>static int num</code> is not marked <code>volatile</code>. Java "knows" that <code>num</code> is not going to change after the first read, so it is not reading it again.</p>

<p>Change the declaration to</p>

<pre><code>static volatile int num;
</code></pre>

<p>to fix this problem. This will force memory reads on each access to <code>num</code>.</p>

<p>Note: static variables are <em>not</em> a good way of communicating between threads.</p>
