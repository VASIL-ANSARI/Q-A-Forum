<p>I believe you can use mongoid which works as an ODM - object document mapper. </p>

<p>Taken from the mongo docs</p>

<p>You can define associations where children are stored in a separate collection from the parent document like so:</p>

<pre><code> class Band
  include Mongoid::Document
  has_many :members
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can also define associations where the relation is embedded in the parent like so</p>

<pre><code>class Person
  include Mongoid::Document
  embeds_many :addresses
end
</code></pre>
