<pre><code>cp: files 1.pdf: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>The file <code>files 1.pdf</code> isn't inside the current directory. It's inside the directory you listed, <code>./espacio/</code>. If <code>files.pdf</code> worked, it's only because by coincidence there was also a <code>files.pdf</code> inside the currect directory.</p>

<pre><code>parent_path = './espacio/'
for file_name in os.listdir(parent_path):
    file_path = os.path.join(parent_path, file_name)
    subprocess.call(["cp", "-v", file_path ,"/tmp/"])
</code></pre>

<p>However, as @Colonel Thirty Two commented, it's generally a better idea to do the copying inside Python rather than using a shell command when you can.</p>
