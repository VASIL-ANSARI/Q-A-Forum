<p>I thought about what I changed during startup lately and it is adding Parse's initialization code to my App() in App.xaml. </p>

<pre><code>ParseObject.RegisterSubclass&lt;ParseUserData&gt;();
ParseClient.Initialize("---", "---");
ParseFacebookUtils.Initialize("---");
</code></pre>

<p>I moved these from the start of App() into the end of it and the problem went away.</p>
