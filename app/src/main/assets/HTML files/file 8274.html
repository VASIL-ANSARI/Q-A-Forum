<p>The runtime will be able to automatically determine how to marshal data between native and managed code in most cases, so you generally don't need to specify the attribute. <code>MarshalAs</code> is only necessary when there is an ambiguity in the definition (and you want to tell the runtime precisely how to marshal the data) or if you require non-default behaviour.</p>

<p>In my experience, <code>MarshalAs</code> is only really required when working with strings, since there are so many different representations in native code; unicode/ansi, c-strings or not, etc.</p>
