<pre><code> MultiUserChat muc = manager.getMultiUserChat(userJid);

        muc.create("InstantRoom");
</code></pre>

<p>when you get a MUC, you have to get a NAME (so the manager can tell you if already exist).</p>

<p>indeed, when you create a muc, you'll have to enter an username.</p>

<p>So</p>

<pre><code>String myMUCName = "InstantRoom";
String myMUCService = "conference.myServer";
String myMUCfullName = myMUCName + "@" + myMUCService;
MultiUserChat muc = manager.getMultiUserChat(myMUCfullName);
muc.create(userName);
</code></pre>

<p><em>(if this will not solve your problem just tell me after assure yourself that the service it's already registered on Server - maybe you'll have extra issue on Form)</em></p>
