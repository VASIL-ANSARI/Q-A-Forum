<p>Using <code>FileInfo.Name</code> you're only getting the filename, not the full path. </p>

<p>Hence you're trying to read the file relative to the current directory, where it doesn't exist. </p>

<p>Obtain the full path instead, i.e. <code>FileInfo.FullName</code> instead of <code>FileInfo.Name</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to read all files, you should loop over the files instead of only reading the first (<code>files[0]</code>), the latter of which is dangerous anyway, because that will throw if there are no files found.</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var fileInfo in files)
{
    int Vara = File.ReadAllText(fileInfo.FullName).Contains("namespace") ? 1 : 0;

}
</code></pre>
