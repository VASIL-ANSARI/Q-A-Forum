<p>You are already <em>not</em> <code>catch</code>ing access violations and you never could. Access violations are not C++ exceptions. They are "exceptions" of a different kind &mdash; that raised by your operating system. I prefer not to call them "exceptions" at all, in fact.</p>

<p>Linux and Linux-like operating systems simply terminate a process (using a <em>signal</em>) that performs an access violation.</p>

<p>Windows instead uses something called "structured exceptions" which you can potentially catch and possibly ignore using language extensions in Visual Studio. We're venturing off-topic now, but you could <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/2782915/560648">read up about those</a>. I still wouldn't recommend their use, mind you. Once you have an access violation I'd personally be content to say "all bets are off", and "we have some debugging to do".</p>
