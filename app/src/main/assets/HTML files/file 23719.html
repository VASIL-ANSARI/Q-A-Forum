<p>Nothing here helped, and this site is Heroku's technical support.  Paying $35/mo doesn't buy me any support, so I'm stuck and there is no way forward with Heroku.</p>

<p>So my answer to this problem is to move the app to Engine Yard.  I don't see that I have any other options.  Heroku is awesome when it works and it's a complete mystery with no technical support when it doesn't work.</p>
