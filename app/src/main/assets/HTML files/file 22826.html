<p>A generic Process does not have a built-in mechanism to provide progress notification.  You need to figure out some means for the process you are starting to inform of its progress.</p>

<p>If you control that process, you might have it write to Standard Out or Standard Error, and use the </p>

<pre><code>outputReader = process.StandardOutput;
errorReader = process.StandardError;
</code></pre>

<p>you have defined to read that progress back into your program.  For example, the process could write to Standard Error</p>

<pre><code>10
31
50
99
</code></pre>

<p>and your parent process, reading <code>errorReader</code>, could interpret those individual lines as % complete.</p>

<p>Once you have a means of getting the % complete of the child process, you can use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.progressbar.aspx" rel="nofollow">ProgressBar</a> to show that progress.</p>
