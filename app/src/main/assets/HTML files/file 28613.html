<p>The array_diff and array_intersect convert each element in the primary array in to a string for comparison. If you would like a different comparison, then you could use the callback method with the following built-in functions:</p>

<pre><code>array_uintersect_assoc() - Computes the intersection of arrays with additional index check, compares data by a callback function
array_intersect_uassoc() - Computes the intersection of arrays with additional index check, compares indexes by a callback function
array_uintersect_uassoc() - Computes the intersection of arrays with additional index check, compares data and indexes by a callback functions
</code></pre>

<p>I found these by searching PHP.net for the function array_diff and followed the related function links. Its a great way to see alternatives for doing something.</p>
