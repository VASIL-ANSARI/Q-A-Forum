<p>That is a very confusing line of text and I think you should completely ignore its existence.</p>

<p>You absolutely can access <code>follower_id</code>. You can also access the associations <code>follower</code> and <code>followed</code> as per "default generated" rails models. The only difference here is that they will be instances of the <code>User</code> class.</p>

<p>Just ignore that line and carry on.</p>
