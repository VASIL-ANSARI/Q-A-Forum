<p>Hey there user2799766!</p>

<p>I really didnt get the question, but I'll have a go at it. </p>

<p>So if u want to make a new page from the code above, just open a new document, paste the code u want, and save as .html. And voiala, a new page
*You might want to add a proper html structure to you're new page</p>

<p>If you want to include the code above, in a page, using php, follow the above steps, and use a include("page/location");
inlcude_once() ..... require_once();</p>

<p>Or you might need something else?</p>

<p>Trying to help out,
George</p>
