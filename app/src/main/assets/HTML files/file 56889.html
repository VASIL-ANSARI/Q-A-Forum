<p>While building an iOS app, the architectures (armv7, armv7s, armv64) you choose dictate what all platforms you will be supporting. <strong>The "Deployment target" version that you select in xcode is the minimum OS version that you can support.</strong> An iOS app is a universal binary, which means that it can contain code supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Building with 64 bit support (iOS 8 SDK) is not the same as dropping support for earlier 32-bit OS versions.</p>
