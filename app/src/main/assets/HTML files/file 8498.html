<p>If you are using Visual C++ 2010 (and probably earlier versions) then you can enable secure SCL and iterator debugging by using these two macros:</p>

<pre><code>#define _SECURE_SCL 1
#define _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING 1
</code></pre>

<p>The other standard libraries may have that too.</p>

<p>Edit: Just as has been suggested, there is a single macro in VC2010, that is <code>_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL</code> which has 3 levels defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>#if _HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING
    #define _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL 2
#elif _SECURE_SCL
    #define _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL 1
#else
    #define _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL 0
#endif
</code></pre>
