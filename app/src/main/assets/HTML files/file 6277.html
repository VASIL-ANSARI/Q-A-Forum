<p>With git, there's no reason for developers to work on a separate branch or to have mocked up views. Have designers and developers work in the same branch, on the same codebase. When a view is done (or at least improved and not crashing) have the designer commit and push them to a master repository. The same is true for developers: when a local change is 'done', have them commit it and push it.</p>

<p>Before pushing, each side needs to pull (to ensure there are no conflicts). If the two groups are working in mutually-exclusive pieces of code (separate files or even separate parts of the same files), then the pull will simply update the local copy and all will work well.</p>

<p>With this, both sides are always seeing the most up-to-date codebase, and contributing directly towards the exact end goal, watching it evolve.</p>
