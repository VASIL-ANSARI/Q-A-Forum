<p>You could in fact do that. And then <em>every instance</em> of <em>every polymorphic class</em> would need to have its entire virtual table stored as part of the object. For classes with a large number of virtual methods this would be a significant memory overhead. There's no guarantee it would even be faster because you could decrease cache locality by storing so much redundant data.</p>
