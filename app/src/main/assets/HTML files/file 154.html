<p>I vaguely remember having a similar sounding problem with the DB2 for as/400 oledb driver when trying to set up a linked server from sql 2005 to the as/400. It was a permissions issue and I eventually found that only sql server accounts (not windows) could use the linked server because (i think) then the driver was loading using the credentials of the sql instead of impersonated ones. If it works when "run as" admin then it gotta be permissions. </p>
