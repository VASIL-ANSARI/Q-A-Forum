<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/" rel="nofollow">Google Elevation</a> page gives you this:</p>

<p><em>Usage Limits</em></p>

<p><em>Use of the Google Elevation API is subject to a limit of 2,500 requests per day (Maps API for Business users may send up to 100,000 requests per day). In each given request you may query the elevation of up to 512 locations, but you may not exceed 25,000 total locations per day (1,000,000 for Maps API for Business users). This limit is enforced to prevent abuse and/or repurposing of the Elevation API, and this limit may be changed in the future without notice. Additionally, we enforce a request rate limit to prevent abuse of the service. If you exceed the 24-hour limit or otherwise abuse the service, the Elevation API may stop working for you temporarily. If you continue to exceed this limit, your access to the Elevation API may be blocked.</em></p>
