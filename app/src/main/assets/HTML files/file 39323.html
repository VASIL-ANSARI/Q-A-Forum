<p>You can't, <code>const_set</code> is occuring after <code>Class.new</code>. At the point where <code>ModuleX</code> is included (<code>MOduleX</code> is, I assume, a typo), the class is well and truly nameless.</p>

<p>Not to even mention that a constant can't be called <code>test</code>, as Ruby grammar mandates that constants must start with a capital letter.</p>

<p>However, if your module must know the class name at inclusion time, it's probably doing something wrong. I suggest rethinking and refactoring.</p>
