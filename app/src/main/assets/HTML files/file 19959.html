<p>I have exactly the same issue on iOS6. Odd behavior is that it appears only the first time I open the image picker. When closed and opened again, "in-picture" button disappears. Looks like a bug in UIImagePickerController.</p>

<p>To overcome this issue, you can hide image controls by setting showsCameraControls property to NO and use custom overlay view with own controls. Disadvantage of this is that you have to provide all controls then and code action handlers for them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I didn't find a better way so far.</p>
