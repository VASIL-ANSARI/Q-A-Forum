<p>You should typically also get an error that <code>net.sourceforge.scuba.data.Gender</code> could not be resolved. Probably you have removed the line</p>

<pre><code>import net.sourceforge.scuba.data.Gender;
</code></pre>

<p>from your Factory JAVA class. The missing Gender class is part of the scuba_data library in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/ajmrtd/code/HEAD/tree/" rel="nofollow">aJMRTD code repository</a>.</p>
