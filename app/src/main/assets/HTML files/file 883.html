<p><strong>Update:</strong> I see your point now after reading more. "Tomcat's JULI implementation is not intended to be a fully-featured logging libary, only a simple bridge to those libraries. However, JULI does provide several properties for configuring the its handlers. These are listed below."  Funny that they say that the default java.util.Logging implementation is too limited then they work around it by providing an even more limiting implementation.</p>

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging/FileHandler.html" rel="nofollow">FileHandler javadocs</a></p>

<ul>
<li>java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit specifies an approximate maximum amount to write (in bytes) to any one file. If this is zero, then there is no limit. (Defaults to no limit).</li>
<li>java.util.logging.FileHandler.count specifies how many output files to cycle through (defaults to 1). </li>
</ul>

<p>for the one file per web app, you probably want to separate it by the name of the logger and it depends on how the loggers are created for each app. If they're based off the package or class name then you can filter the logs based on that.  It looks like the sample on the link you provided tells how to do this</p>

<pre><code>org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].level = INFO
org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].[localhost].handlers = \
   2localhost.org.apache.juli.FileHandler
</code></pre>
