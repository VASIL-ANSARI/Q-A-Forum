<p>Your connection string should be defined in your Web.Config, and if you move your database to a different server, it's just a matter of modifying the web.config entry. As long as you keep the connection string name the same, the BindingSource object will pick up the new value from the config.<hr><strong>edit</strong><br><br>
In truth, the same concept should apply here as it does in the web app answer listed above.</p>

<p>All of your data objects should be hard-coded, and it's just the connection string (which you'll have to either ask the user for, or push out as update when the DB moves) which will get modified.</p>

<p>For example, create a App.Config file in your project. Have one of your configuration values  be the connection string. This config value will be where you go to get the connection string whenever you need it. Then your wizard will be there to allow users to easily modify the connection.</p>
