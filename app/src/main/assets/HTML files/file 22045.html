<p>There are a few reasonable options:</p>

<p>1) Use the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/if-binding.html" rel="nofollow">if</a> binding to control the rendering (not just visibility) of a block of HTML. Each row of data would have an observable property called <code>isEditing</code>. Then, add behavioral functions to control edit/cancel/etc. Your article template would include something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div data-bind="if:isEditing"&gt;
   &lt;input type="text" data-bind="value: DisplayAddress" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>2) If it's just one field, you might want to create a custom binding handler that adds the behavior you want to an element (it would dynamically add/remove a field). There are a few good examples on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13354491/knockout-inline-edit-binding">Stackoverflow</a> of this technique.</p>
