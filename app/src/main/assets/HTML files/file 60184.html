<p>It is better to filter the items of the array in the controller or better on the server instead of hiding them after having rendered them. If you filter the array before displaying it the browser don't need to render the DOM associated to the item and then spending time to hiding it. Keep in mind that using <code>ng-hide</code> applies the CSS class <code>display: none</code> to the element, so the node exists but is not visible.</p>
