<p>Ok, so it is impossible to do that.</p>

<p>here is quote from <a href="http://forum.ag-software.net/thread/1515-Showing-user-presence-without-having-to-subscribe" rel="nofollow">Alex (agsxmpp forum)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>XMPP requires always mutual subscription. This means the contact you are adding and subscribe to must approve your subscription. Without the approval you get no presence. This means that the contacts you add must either manual or automatically accept this requests. If they will do so everything will work and the server will start sending you presence.</p>
