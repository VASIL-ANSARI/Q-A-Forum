<p>This is not really Java's style, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>The methods you would like remind me of <code>Rails</code> and <code>Grails</code>, concepts that don't work well with a static beast like Java (don't get me wrong, I love my beast).</p>

<p><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-roo" rel="nofollow">Spring Roo</a> mimics what rails and grails do and generates Controller methods like the ones you would like but that would mean you would have to use Spring Roo.</p>

<p>Another Idea would be to post-process your generated code by using a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/" rel="nofollow">source code parser</a>. But that's also going to be a tough call.</p>

<p>Probably your best bet is to get the code of the hbm2java tool and add a hook for your routines.</p>
