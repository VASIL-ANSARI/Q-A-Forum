<p>You could add an event from 0800-2100 and render it in one color (say grey or green). Then  just add events for appts with usage hours, and render them differently (say red), which will appear on top.</p>

<p>Another way: add events in 15min (or whatever) intervals, and mark them as available. As these are clicked, mark them as occupied (in your DB) and render them differently.</p>
