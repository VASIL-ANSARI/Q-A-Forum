<p>You are iterating through the dict's keys, so you need to account for this in your <code>for</code> loop like this:</p>

<pre><code>for offer in networkoffers:  # will look through keys, which are strings and not dicts
    networkoffers[offer]['name']
</code></pre>

<p><code>networkoffers</code> is a <code>dict</code>, and <code>offers</code> (or <code>offer</code>, note the discrepancy) is a key (a <code>string</code>). <code>offers['name']</code> means nothing to Python, since offers is a string. But <code>networkoffers[offers]</code> is a dict (a value of <code>networkoffers</code>).</p>
