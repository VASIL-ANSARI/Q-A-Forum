<p>Standard mysql libraries' <code>query()</code> functions return a result HANDLE, even if the query would only ever return a single field and/or row. You need to FETCH a row from that handle, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>$result = mysqli_query("SELECT ...");
$row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
echo $row['count'];
</code></pre>

<p>In this code, if you did <code>echo $row</code>, you'd get your output of <code>Resource id#xxx</code> because it's NOT the value that was selected - it's the result handle of what you can FETCH that value from.</p>
