<p>I found a link to the ksoap2 google group: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ksoap2-android/browse_thread/thread/f8e17bdecc6b65d7#" rel="nofollow">How to send a Complext type Array </a> which describes how to send an array of complex type. Maybe this will help you. Found it while searching for a way to send one complex object to a wcf service. But i don't get it working :/ If you have any idea, check my question ;) </p>
