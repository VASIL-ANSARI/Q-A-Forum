<p>While Marcelo's answer (and the linked to "duplicate" question) will explain how to do what you're after, a quick explanation why your code doesn't work.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.gettype.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>GetType()</code></a> does exactly what it says: it gets the <code>Type</code> of the object on which it is called.  In your case, it will return <code>System.String</code>, which is the <code>Type</code> of the object referenced by your <em>variable</em> <code>MyString</code>. Thus your code will actually print the <code>.Name</code> of that <code>Type</code>, and not the name of the variable (which is what you actually want.)</p>
