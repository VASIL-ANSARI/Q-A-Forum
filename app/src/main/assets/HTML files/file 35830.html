<p>I've seen exactly the same issue. The only thing that stops it from closing is setting closeable to false,
which is not a setting I would otherwise use.</p>

<p>When you enable debug mode for the modal, you get the following message: </p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8VyNm.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8VyNm.png" alt="1"></a></p>

<p>I suspect that jquery isn't aware of the element.</p>
