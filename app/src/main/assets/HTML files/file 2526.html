<p>It seems to be more of a matter of [version] <strong>incompatibility between SciPy and NumPy</strong> versions than between NLTK and Numpy.<br>
While SciPy is not required for NLTK, it is an optional import, and will load if available.</p>

<p>A few hypothesis regarding your situation:</p>

<p>Hyp #1</p>

<ul>
<li>you formerly were running under NumPy 1.3 along with a compatible version of SciPy</li>
<li>you recently installed NumPy 1.4 but didn't touch SciPy
==> "Old" SciPy is broken.<br>
Remedy : Install newer SciPy or uninstall it altogether (although you may be using/needing SciPy, without knowing it, depending on the modules of NLTK you use)<br>
Alternate Remedy: re-install NumPy 1.3 over 1.4.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hyp #2 (less likely)</p>

<ul>
<li>You never had SciPy and NLTK was happy, working without it.</li>
<li>You recently installed NumPy 1.4 (over 1.3) <em>and</em> SciPy (over nothing)</li>
<li>For some reason NumPy and SciPy don't play nice together<br>
Remedy: Uninstall SciPy </li>
</ul>
