<p>Based on the comment about the installed location, it seems you would need to add this in your qmake project file:</p>

<pre><code>LIBS += -L/usr/local/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ -llastfm
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is that, you seem to have installed lastfm into a "custom" location which is not in the library path by default. Hence, you need to tell qmake where to look for the lastfm libraries.</p>
