<p>This is an easy one, because it is tail-recursive: there is no code between the recursive call &amp; what the function returns.  Thus, you can wrap the body of <code>go</code> in a loop <code>while (frozen&lt;3)</code>, and <code>return solution</code> once the loop ends.  And replace the recursive call with assignments to the parameters: <code>solution=bestSol; t=newT;</code>.</p>
