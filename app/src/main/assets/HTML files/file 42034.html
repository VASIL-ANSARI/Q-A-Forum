<p>If you're calling the service synchronously, don't unless you have a very good reason to do so.  Do the work with the returned data in a callback or better still use a jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/promise/" rel="nofollow">promise</a>.  </p>

<p>Is the service itself slow?  Measure time to first byte (TTFB) latency, if this is long the service itself is slow.  In a dev environment this might be because the service isn't being accessed and if hosted in IIS the app pool will be recycled.  Each initial request will therefore pay the performance price of warm up.  If the form is also doing a lot of work on load that doesn't depend on the data from the service it's even more important you allow this to execute in parallel by calling the service asynchronously.</p>
