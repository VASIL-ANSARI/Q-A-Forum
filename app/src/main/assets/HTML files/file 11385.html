<p>You've got to add a component to the GUI first before it can display anything. Where do you add your print1 and print2 JLabels to the GUI or to any container for that matter?</p>

<p>Also, you'll want to use layout managers rather than null layout and absolute positioning to make coding your GUI's much easier.</p>

<p>Also, you'll want to call <code>setVisible(true)</code> on the JFrame <em>after</em> adding all components.</p>
