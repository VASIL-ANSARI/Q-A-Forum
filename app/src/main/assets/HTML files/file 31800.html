<p>Because you recurse only if the entered value isn't a palindrome, and it would take over 10,000 recursions to increment 123456789 into a palindrome.</p>

<p>Your code is a bit weird, you take a string, which you assume to be a number, and increment it using string manipulation.  Converting to a long (or BigInteger if Long isn't big enough) would be MUCH simpler.</p>

<p>Further, you seem to increment twice, once at the start of the <code>palindroom</code> method, and again in the <code>else</code> block.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
From your comment, I take it you may not be clear on what a Stack Overflow Error is.  So the java call stack is the stack (i.e. LIFO) of methods.  In your case, your call stack would be main, palindroom, palindroom, palindroom, palindroom, palindroom, etc...  Please note java only allows a maximum size for the call stack, if this size is exceeded, you get a stack overflow exception.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2127217/java-stack-overflow-error-how-to-increase-the-stack-size-in-eclipse">Java stack overflow error - how to increase the stack size in Eclipse?</a> has some details on defaults and configuring this.  </p>
