<p>First, instead of calling <code>list.requestFocus</code>, you may want to use <code>nameTextField.clearFocus</code> as that more accurately conveys what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>Now, I don't know all the details of this specific error, but my guess is that <code>onEditorAction</code> is called by TextView synchronously, inside its handling of the <code>ACTION_DOWN</code> or <code>ACTION_UP</code> event message. Calling <code>requestFocus</code> somewhere else may then disrupt the normal event flow for key presses. Again, that's just a guess.</p>

<p>What you could do is wrap your <code>list.requestFocus</code> call in a <code>Runnable</code>, and post that runnable to your event loop using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler.html#post(java.lang.Runnable)" rel="nofollow"><code>Handler.post(Runnable)</code></a>. A common pattern is to hold a private field containing a Handler in your UI class (e.g. fragment or activity) for things like this:</p>

<pre><code>Handler mHandler = new Handler();
...
mHandler.post(...);
</code></pre>

<p>This will let the current event/message finish processing and only execute the Runnable (in this case a call to <code>list.requestFocus</code> after all other currently posted messages have been processed (this is usually only a few milliseconds).</p>

<p>And as I said above, try using <code>clearFocus</code> instead.</p>
