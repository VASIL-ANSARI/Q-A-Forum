<p>I'm unaware of any supported method of running an oracle client without some sort of install (the xcopy version includes a batch file for installation so the "xcopy" is a bit of a misnomer.</p>

<p>That said, if you're going to do something that's unsupported, you might as well go with something that WILL eventually be supported - the 100% managed provider (meaning no extra unmanaged dlls to copy) is currently in beta:

<p>I am suborn to see something to the end even for just the learning experience so I'd understand if you wanted to see your current way to fruition.  The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/html/E15167_01/InstallODP.htm" rel="nofollow">oracle documentation</a> does indicate that the application directory is in fact first in the unmanaged dll search order.  My guess is that additional dlls are needed (you are using a newer version than your linked article).  I would see which specific dlls it's loading from outside of your app directory using a tool like <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx" rel="nofollow">Process Monitor</a> and see if you can find the equivalents from the new ODAC to copy over.</p>
