<p>First, make sure IUSR has Read permission on the config file (which I believe you have done that)</p>

<p>Then, change IIS authentication method to BasicAuthentication</p>

<p>If still not working, probably the .config extension is not properly installed in IIS. </p>

<p>Try all 3! Good luck!</p>

<p>EDIT: Forget to ask you, what kind of appliation is it?</p>
