<p>I'm not sure to understand your question...
You want to start a new activity and destroy the previous one?
If this is what you need, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>startActivity(new Intent(this, myActivity.class).setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP));
</code></pre>

<p>The "CLEAR_TOP" flag tell "Hey! I want to start this activity and kill all the other ones!"</p>
