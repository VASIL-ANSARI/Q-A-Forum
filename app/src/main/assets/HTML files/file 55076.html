  <p>Is there a way to detect when an activity has been garbage collected in Android?</p>

<p>Not really.  But it is good to test scenarios ex. finishing an activity to return a result when the first activity is no longer there.  I had a bug once where <code>onCreate</code> would (re)run to re-create the activity I assumed was already there and that caused an issue.</p>

<p>What you <em>can</em> do to test these cases is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enable Developer Options (you have probably already done this)</p></li>
<li><p>Under "Apps" category, enable "Do not keep activities"</p></li>
<li><p>Do your testing/debugging</p></li>
</ol>
