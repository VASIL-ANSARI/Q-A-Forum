<p>You are creating too many items. <code>insert</code> is creating 2 items, only the first one is needed. <code>removeAt</code> is creating 2 more nodes.. Most of these need to be removed. </p>

<p>Make the below changes and test again.</p>

<pre><code>MyNode before = get(pos-1);

MyNode before = get(pos -1);
MyNode remove = get(pos);
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:.. Even <code>MyNode current = new MyNode();</code> in <code>get</code> is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Edit: Your <strong>core issue</strong> is that <code>get</code> returns the data and not the element, you should write a version that returns the <code>Node</code> and use that in all internal methods, like above. The current way has you making new nodes that are immediately destroyed because they are not properly inserted to the list. </p>
