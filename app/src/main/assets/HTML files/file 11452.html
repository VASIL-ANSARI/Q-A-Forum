<p>I think you want all shortest matches of strings starting with A and ending with E. You can use the regexp 'A.*?E' to do this: rather than being greedy like 'A.*E' would be it finds the smallest match. You can use findall rather than finditer to get the matched strings. Overall, you have code like this:</p>

<pre><code>print re.findall('A.*?E', mystring)
</code></pre>
