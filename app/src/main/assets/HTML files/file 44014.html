<p>OK. I'm found a workaround to solve this issue.</p>

<p><strong>My Work around,</strong> steps I'm made:</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm just created a new WebAPI project (default template) and upload it for a new website in Azure. Tested it. This working great. So, from here I'm understand that the problem is not in my code. </li>
<li>Now I'm uploaded my new project and override my existing not working project. Now, my new project is stopped working too. Same problem like in my previous project.</li>
<li>At this point I'm understand that something going bad with my Azure account. So I'm removed my old website account and create it again. Now it's working fine. </li>
</ol>

<p>So, Just try to remove and upload your project again.</p>
