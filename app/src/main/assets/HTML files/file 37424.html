<p>Indeed, JavaScript is not a regular language, which can be proved with the fact that braces must be balanced as your intuition suggested.</p>

<p>A useful tool for demonstrating that languages are not regular is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages" rel="nofollow">Pumping Lemma</a>. You can use it to demonstrate that if JavaScript was regular, some sequence like</p>

<pre><code>function(){ function() { function(){ ... function () {
</code></pre>

<p>(in which <code>{</code> are not matched) could be repeated any number of times when surrounded by a certain prefix and suffix, which is in obviously in contradiction with the fact that curly braces must be matched.</p>
