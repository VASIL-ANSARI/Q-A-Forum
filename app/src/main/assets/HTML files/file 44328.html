<p>YouTube changes the content of their site using JS. I am not sure if there are any events fired when youtube changes the location. The only event I know of is popstate, which fires, whenever the user navigates using the back or forward buttons (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/popstate" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/popstate</a>).</p>
