<p>Why don't you return an object and then in your client you can call as <code>response.d</code>?</p>

<p>I don't know how you are calling your Web Service but I made an example making some assumptions:</p>

<p>I made this example using jquery ajax</p>

<pre><code>function Test(a) {

                $.ajax({
                    type: "POST",
                    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
                    url: "TestRW.asmx/HelloWorld",
                    data: "{'id':" + a + "}",
                    dataType: "json",
                    success: function (response) {
                        alert(JSON.stringify(response.d));

                    }
                });
            }
</code></pre>

<p>And your code could be like this (you need to allow the web service to be called from script first: '[System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptService]'):</p>

<pre><code>    [WebMethod]
    public object HelloWorld(int id)
    {
        Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; dic = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
        dic.Add("message","success");

        return dic;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In this example I used dictionary but you could use any object with a field "message" for example.</p>

<p>I'm sorry if I missunderstood what you meant but I don't really understand why you want to do a 'response.write' thing.</p>

<p>Hope I've helped at least. :)</p>
