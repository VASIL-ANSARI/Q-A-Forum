<p>If you have built a deployment package and transferred it to your server (via FTP), you are almost done. There are two things you have to do after that. <em>Remember, do not run the first-time setup.</em></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Copy the ~/App_Data folder</strong> from development to production. If transferring the files with ftp, make sure to transfer in binary mode. <em>Make sure that the account, under which the AppPool runs has read/write permissions to that folder.</em></li>
<li><em>If you use SQL Server Compact.</em> Do nothing - the database has already been copied in 1.</li>
<li><em>If you use SQL Server 2005/2008 database.</em> Migrate your db to production environment. Next, change the connection string to point to the new database inside Settings.txt file located under ~/App_Data/Sites/Default.</li>
</ol>

<p>After that, you can run your site and everything should be ok. So in your scenario, you can only copy the folder from 1. and you'd be set.</p>
