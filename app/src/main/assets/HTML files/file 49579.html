<p>I don't know what the test is checking, so I don't know why it's failing. However, it's easy to tell the differences between the two implementations.</p>

<p>In Java (quoting the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.5" rel="nofollow">4.12.5. Initial Values of Variables</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all reference types (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.3" rel="nofollow">รยง4.3</a>), the default value is <code>null</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The objects in second case are assigned <code>null</code> until you initialize them, and you do that on <em>each</em> call of <code>topologicalSort</code>. So every time the method is called, a <em>new</em> object will be created.</p>

<p>In the first implementation, you only initialize them once - when the class is created. This should be enough for you to dig more into the problem and better understand why the test is failing in the first implementation.</p>
