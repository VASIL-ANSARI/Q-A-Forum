<p>You're passing in an opcode rather than a handle type as the handle type. Since they're both just ints, there's no type error, but you're providing garbage values which cause a verification error at load time.</p>

<p>You probably meant to do something like this (note the H_ prefix)</p>

<pre><code>Handle bootstrap = new Handle(Opcodes.H_INVOKESTATIC, "package1/Test2",
        "bootstrap", mt.toMethodDescriptorString());
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/asm40/javadoc/user/org/objectweb/asm/Handle.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the Handle documentation.</p>
