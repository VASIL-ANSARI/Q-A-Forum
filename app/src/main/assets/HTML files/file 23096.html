<p>Though the question is a bit dated, I somehow stumbled upon it...</p>

<p>If I understand your query correctly, you want to get all users from a certain school, who are not being educated...</p>

<p>If so, I'd go the following route - given that your relations are all properly set up:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.find_educated_by_school_name(school_name)
    Education.pluck(:user_id).joins(:schools).where('schools.name = ?', school_name)
  end
end

User.where('users.id NOT IN (?)', User.find_educated_by_school_name('school_name'))
</code></pre>

<p>Also keep in mind, that by convention <code>myUser.find_by_*</code> would mean "find something on a given <strong>user instance</strong>". Hence, it should make use of the user instance to find something.</p>

<p>Whereas <code>User.find_by_*</code> means "find users in general, by a certain criteria".</p>

<p>Hope it's clear what I mean!</p>
