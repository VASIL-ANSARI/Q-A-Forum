<p>Instead of calling <code>fit</code> for the first batch, call <code>partial_fit</code> and give it a list of all classes in your problem as the <code>classes</code> argument:</p>

<pre><code>clf.partial_fit(X, y, classes=targets)
</code></pre>

<p>(This is assuming <code>y</code> actually contains the class labels instead of their indices.)</p>

<p>You cannot change the number of classes after the first call to <code>partial_fit</code> (or <code>fit</code>). You simply have to know the number of classes up front or retrain the whole model.</p>
