<p>I'm using my own custom vertical slider.. tried to convert it to horizontal: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/8nQLb/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/8nQLb/</a></p>

<p>It's not perfect but might be enough for you.. problem is that when using float the inner div elements are getting "wrapped" so the extra div with image is added too late - in the vertical version I had no such problem.</p>

<p>Feel free to mess around with it, I will try to improve it when I'll have some time.</p>
