<p>As long as your application is layered reasonably, it shouldn't be an issue.</p>

<p>UI layer (e.g., event handlers) and the logical UI layer (e.g., ViewModel) require a UI context and should not use <code>ConfigureAwait</code>. Other layers should use <code>ConfigureAwait</code>. That's a simple guideline that has worked well for me.</p>
