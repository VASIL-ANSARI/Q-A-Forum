<p>A <code>HashMap&lt;String, HashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> looks  just fine to me for holding the type of data you've shown.</p>

<p>That "architect" of yours might be right about too much complexity when we're talking about how that data structure is exposed to the rest of your program. For example: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>That type signature above does not make any statement about what kind of strings are used as keys, and what kind of values are in the value sets. Do they represent names? Or ISBN numbers? Or any text, or only particular enumeration values? etc.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use such a <code>HashMap</code> everywhere in your code, when adding values into the sets you will have to remember everywhere to do two steps: (1) creating an empty set only if no value is in the dictionary for some given key, and (2) adding the new value to the set of a given key. Having to think about routine stuff like that opens up the door for bugs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps it would be better to hide your actual data structure behind a nice, simple and easy-to-use "collection" interface, perhaps similar to the following:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>interface ApplicableValuesCollection
{
    void Add(int code, String value);
    void Remove(int code, String value);
    bool Contains(int code, String value);
    Iterable&lt;String&gt; GetValuesOfCode(int code);
    â¦
}
</code></pre>
