<p>The answer is "there's no difference" in most implementations, but if there were a difference, obviously the one that puts more code into the <code>for</code> loop is going to be less efficient, as the code generated for the <code>try</code> block (if there is any, and remember, generally there isn't) is going to be executed more times.</p>
