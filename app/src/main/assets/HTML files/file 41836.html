<p>What you are missing is that Latin uppercase letters compare <em>less than</em> Latin lowercase letters. The relevant part of the Unicode character code chart can be found <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want this to behave differently, you need to supply your own comparator. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2839137/how-to-use-comparator-in-java-to-sort">How to use Comparator in Java to sort</a></p>

<p>One way to achieve your desired behaviour is by having the comparator convert both letters to lowercase, and then compare the result.</p>
