<p>This because of <em>integer promotion</em>.</p>

<p>Your results are bring promoted to larger integers before being passed to printf.</p>

<p>You could store the result back into your variable, before passing that variable to printf. They will necessarily be truncated.</p>

<p>Also, the <code>printf</code> specifier for an <code>unsigned char</code> is <code>%hhu</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, I would suggest the following (untested) instead:</p>

<pre><code>static inline uint8_t rol8(uint8_t x)
{
    uint8_t low = (x &amp; (1&lt;&lt;7)) &gt;&gt; 7;
    return (x &lt;&lt; 1) | low;
}
</code></pre>
