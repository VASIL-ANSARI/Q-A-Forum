<p>You could use <code>partition</code> to split those out and track what didn't have the information.</p>

<pre><code>with, without = car_array.partition { |car| !!car.manufacture }
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have 2 arrays, <code>with</code> contains cars where <code>manufacture</code> had something, and <code>without</code> contains ones that didn't.  Log or throw as you see fit.</p>

<p>You can now safely get the manufacture as well:</p>

<pre><code>car_manufacture = with.map(&amp;:manufacture)
</code></pre>
