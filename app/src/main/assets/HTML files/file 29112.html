<p>I've found the answer, with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTCOOKIELIST" rel="nofollow">CURLOPT_COOKIELIST</a> (I was confusing it with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_getinfo.html#CURLINFOCOOKIELIST" rel="nofollow">CURLINFO_COOKIELIST</a>, which can only be used to read cookies). Using CURLOPT_COOKIELIST, I can enter my cookies as HTTP headers, which do not need that flag field. I'll only need to give format to the date. It looks like specifying the cookies for any handle is enough to set them in the CURLSH object, because I can set them in one handle and read them any other handle.</p>
