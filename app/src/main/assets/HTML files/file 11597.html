<p>JavaScript has automatic memory management. Memory containing objects which are no longer referenced will be eligible for garbage collection, unless you have a memory leak. <strong>There is generally no need to manually assign <code>undefined</code> to variables.</strong></p>

<p>If your program is using too much memory, you should <strong>shrink</strong> the arrays to get rid of elements you no longer need. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop" rel="nofollow"><code>Array.pop</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift" rel="nofollow"><code>Array.shift</code></a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice" rel="nofollow"><code>Array.splice</code></a>.</p>
