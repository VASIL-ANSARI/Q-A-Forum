<p>This is strictly a performance tradeoff. It's going to depend on how many cards you'll eventually have on the page. You don't want to go crazy and have 1000 copies of something you may not need, but if it's only 10, it's probably fine to have them hidden on the page. That way the response doesn't require another request to the server nor any delay.</p>
