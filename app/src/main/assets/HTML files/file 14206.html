<p>It is very rare that you want to use <code>dataWithContentsOfURL:</code>. It's a blocking call so requires a background thread. It's also inflexible and doesn't provide good error returns (which is the problem you're encountering).</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/URLLoadingSystem/URLLoadingSystem.html" rel="nofollow">URL Loading System Programming Guide</a>. Generally you'll want to configure an asynchronous <code>NSURLConnection</code> for this kind of work. If you're doing a lot of network operations, you may want to consider a framework like <a href="https://github.com/MugunthKumar/MKNetworkKit" rel="nofollow">MKNetworkKit</a> or <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking" rel="nofollow">AFNetworking</a> which handle a lot of the complexities for you.</p>
