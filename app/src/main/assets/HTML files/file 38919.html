<p>You shouldn't probe objects to see if they exist every x seconds. Attach events with a callback function, then you only fire an event once, when you actually need to and not a million times before.</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>var openDialog = function(uri, name, options, closeCallback) {
    var win = window.open(uri, name, options);
    win.addEventListener("onunload", test);

};

var test = function() {
    alert(bye);
};
</code></pre>

<p>this should fire your alert when the window closes, enjoy</p>
