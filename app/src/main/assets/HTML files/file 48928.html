<p>You need to link with zlib:</p>

<pre><code>cc -lz test.c -o test
</code></pre>

<p>Also your spelling is wrong. "compressFile" vs. "comressFile".</p>

<p>Remember, in C <strong>declaring functions before using them is optional</strong>. If you don't do it, or spell the name wrong, the function is implicitly declared at first use, which is probably not what you want.</p>
