<p>The most reliable way is to determine which files are impacted by the QFE and use <code>System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo.GetVersionInfo(path)</code> on each file and compare the version numbers.</p>

<p>edit: I think there's a way to check the uninstall information in the registry as well, but if the QFE ever becomes part of a Service Pack or rollup package that might report false negatives</p>
