<p>I think what you probably want is a <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html" rel="nofollow">model callback</a>.  In your instance, something like</p>

<pre><code># on models/budget.rb

before_update :nullify_author

def nullify_author
  if status == 1
    author = nil
    answered_at = nil
    status = 0
    save
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you shouldn't use <code>toggle</code> here.  Ruby's falsiness is WAY more restrictive than JavaScript's.  In Ruby's case, only <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are falsy.  Relevantly to you, 0 is <em>not</em> falsy but truthy.  To prove it, try <code>!0</code>.  The returned value is the boolean <code>false</code> not the FixNum 1</p>
