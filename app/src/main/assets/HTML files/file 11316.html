<p>inspired from this post I made a XML StateList generator, you can find it <a href="http://www.myandroidsolutions.com/2014/01/26/android-state-list-generator/">here</a>, I would love to see if somebody have better generator.</p>

<p>Have a great day! </p>

<p>Made an update to my Android State list generator, now you can make use of all the supported states.</p>
