<p>I don't think you want ViewFiller to be an activity... but I might be wrong. If it's just a regular class which you're using to create some object used by the main activity, and you need access to the MainActivity just pass the context into the constructor of the object.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Try something like this, i'm a little rusty with Android too, so i'm not sure if it'll work (I might be completely wrong, sorry):</p>

<pre><code>Activity activity;
public ViewFiller(Activity activity){
     this.activity = activity;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and...  instead of <code>this.getContentResolver().query(
            MediaStore.Audio.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI, projection,
            selection, null, null);</code>, </p>

<p>try:</p>

<p><code>activity.getContentResolver().query( MediaStore.Audio.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI, projection, selection, null, null);</code></p>

<p>And in your main activity: <code>ViewFiller k = new ViewFiller(this);</code></p>

<p>However, i'm not sure if this is what you want. So I apologize if I went wrong somewhere.</p>
