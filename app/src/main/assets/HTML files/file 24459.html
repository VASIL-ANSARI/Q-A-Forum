<p>I'm not sure, i couldn't get the query to run on sql fiddle, but it semes like you are lowering the granularity of your group by and therefore yielding a lower count.</p>

<p>That lower count, is not > 1.  Therefore you're missing rows.</p>

<p>Try changing the last line here to ><strong>=</strong> 1:</p>

<pre><code>HAVING (COUNT(track_number_count) &gt;= 1 )
</code></pre>
