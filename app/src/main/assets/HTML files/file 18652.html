<p>If this is initial view controller and you have settings in plist file to start application in  portrait mode then it would display in portrait mode doesn;t matter what is your device orientation. When you put your device in landscap mode and present new view controller, it will be landscap as it follows the status bar orientation! Before presenting new view controller try reseting status bar to portrait mode and then present new view controller. It will be presented in portrait mode! I had this similar issue in iOS 6.0.</p>
