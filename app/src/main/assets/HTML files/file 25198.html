<blockquote>
  <p>A collection similar to a Map, but which may associate multiple values
  with a single key. If you call put(K, V) twice, with the same key but
  different values, the multimap contains mappings from the key to both
  values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use Multimap in java to do that</p>
