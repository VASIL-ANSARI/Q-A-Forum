<p>Your Rails API was still MVC. The "view" component was probably just generated implicitly, so to speak. That is, Rails sometimes uses a set of default behaviors for generating implicit views. In an API, for example, if you use <code>respond_to :json</code> and <code>respond_with(@my_object)</code> then a JSON "view" will be auto-generated as the response from <code>@my_object.to_json</code>. You can override this "view" by overriding the <code>@my_object.as_json</code> method... or you can get fancy and add a Presenter layer to your object and have it generate the JSON "view" code. Either way, it's still MVC even if you don't have an explicit view template all the time.</p>

<p>Also, some Rails gems exist, such as <a href="https://github.com/nesquena/rabl" rel="nofollow">RABL</a>, which make the "view" component/approach more explicit if you like that style.</p>
