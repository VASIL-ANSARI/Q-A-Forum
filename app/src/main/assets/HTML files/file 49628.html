<p>Textarea does not have a hard limit for as far as I know. </p>

<p>So unless you set a limit on the textarea or have a limit in the language you process the data with then textarea input lenght is limited, Otherwise you can just continue adding data untill your browser crashes :p.</p>

<p>I tested 100K characters and it still posted and saved to database using <code>PHP</code>, I don't know if other languages have a standard limit.</p>

<p><code>rows="20"</code> Does not limit maximum amount of characters allowed. It only limits the amount of rows allowed in the field.</p>
