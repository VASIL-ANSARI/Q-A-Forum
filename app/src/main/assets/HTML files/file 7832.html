<p>you actually have to get the path to the file on sd card. if you are loading it in an image view you probably have it in an object in the adapter (like calling im.getImagePath() or something to get the path in your case) afterwards you can build an Uri if you need it or you can use a file part for the multipart upload which can be created from the image path. from the uri you can just open a stream and have a streamPart for the multipart upload. whichever works better for you has the same result. although using an Uri can get you the images which normally you can't access by path (like contact photos which are stored on the phone memory not the sdCard).</p>
