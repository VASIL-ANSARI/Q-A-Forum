<p>This line will be instantiated on every request:</p>

<pre><code>FacebookApp apps = new FacebookApp();
</code></pre>

<p>Do you realize that? Is that what you want? </p>

<p>I ask because down in <code>Page_Load</code> you have:</p>

<pre><code>if(apps.Session != null)
</code></pre>

<p>Which seems to always be true since apps is a new instance with presumably a new Session. In other words, your <code>else</code> block on <code>Page_Load</code> will never fire. But that's besides the point here.</p>

<p>So it seems to me that the app load fine, you click on the button, the <code>btn_Click</code> handler is called and the user is redirected to <code>resutl.aspx</code> and then <code>result.aspx</code> must be doing something that causes the user to be redirected to <code>default.aspx</code> like for example, perhaps checking if the user is authenticated or not. </p>

<p>What kind of authentication are you using?</p>
