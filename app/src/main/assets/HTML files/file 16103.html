<p>Can you provide Calculation class? it could be a static issue</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>ok try removing static in your variable declaration</p>

<p>there </p>

<pre><code>//These are the attributes for the Variables object.
   private **static** double initial_accel = 0.0,
</code></pre>

<p>also you will have to remove static on all the methods that those variables appear</p>

<p>think that the statics variables and/or methods are stand alone and they have no dependency on the current instance, which means that any static attribute will always be the same between objects of the same instance, you can even reefer to those attributes without instance</p>

<pre><code>Person person1 = new Person();
person1.name = "User";
Person person2 = new Person()
person2.name = "Admin";
</code></pre>

<p>if name is static then person1.name will always be person2.name, otherwise they will have their own name</p>
