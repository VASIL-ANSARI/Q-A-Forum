<p>You could call <code>Write(byte)</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>((FooBase)writer).Write((byte)6);
</code></pre>

<p>Generally, C# would prefer to use an overload defined on the type directly and cast your argument rather than use an overload defined on a parent type.</p>

<p>It's sort of bad style to have a method shadowing a base class method in this fashion.</p>
