<p>You can just create the Species class like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Specie
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public int TaskId { get; set; }

    public Task ParentTask { get; set; }

    public ICollection&lt;Specie&gt; CurrentSpecies { get; set; }

    public ICollection&lt;Specie&gt; HistSpecies { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have to create the Task object and the collections within this object then I would suggest you rethink your design. Essentially the task object should then become the aggregate root.</p>

<p>I would also look at using Fluent Api for complex mapping as it offers some flexibility. You can view that here:</p>
