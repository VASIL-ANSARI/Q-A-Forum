<p>With the Facebook Object API, you no longer need to set up a server in order to host Open Graph objects. You can directly create/add them to Facebook.</p>

<p>You can also use the native Share Dialog (in versions 3.5+ of the SDK) to share Open Graph stories with photos and user tagging embedded. See the Scrumptious app on how to create a story with photos and tags and publishing either via Open Graph directly, or using the native Share Dialog.</p>
