<p>You could just make each of those queries subqueries to an outer query that performs your desired summation:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    (SELECT SUM(1column2) FROM table1 WHERE 1column1 = '0')
  - (SELECT SUM(1column4) FROM table1 WHERE 1column3 = '0')
  - (SELECT SUM(2column2) FROM table2 WHERE 2column1 = '0' 
      AND 2column3 = 'w' AND 2column4 != 'f');
</code></pre>
