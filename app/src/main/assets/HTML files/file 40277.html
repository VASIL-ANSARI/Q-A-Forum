<p>I had a similar task in my app, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11361117/105717">this answer</a> solved it for me. You essentially have the parent app resolve the bookmark and access its security scope, and then pass a plain NSURL to the XPC service. I have my XPC service call in turn call a completion block that stops accessing the security scope. The Apple Dev Forum link in that answer gives a more detailed explanation.</p>
