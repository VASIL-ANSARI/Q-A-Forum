<h1>Explanation</h1>

<p><strong>First step: setting of markers:</strong></p>

<p>We set the separator strings that mark the begin and the end of the part we want:</p>

<pre><code>SET @pre = '@@';
SET @post = ',#';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second step: getting the needed part</strong></p>

<p>We use an expression similar to yours to get the part we want to have. Because our @pre and @post separators belong to the part we want and SUBSTRING_INDEX eliminates them, we've got to concatenate them afterwards again.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(@pre, SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(@x1, @post, t.n), @pre, -1), @post) 
FROM (SELECT @x1 as haystack) h
</code></pre>

<p>** Third step: generating numbers**</p>

<p>The trick to fill the part number, here <code>t.n</code> with numbers is to do a cross join with a number generating query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    1 + a.N + b.N * 10 + c.N * 100 AS n
FROM
    (SELECT 0 AS N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) a
    ,(SELECT 0 AS N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) b
    ,(SELECT 0 AS N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) c
ORDER BY n
</code></pre>

<p>This kind of query is easily adaptable to get as many numbers as one wants.</p>

<p><strong>Last step: limiting the numbers as needed</strong></p>

<pre><code>WHERE t.n &lt;=
(
    (
        LENGTH(@x1) 
        - 
        LENGTH(REPLACE(@x1, @post, ''))
    ) 
    / LENGTH(@post)
);
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Get the difference in string length by replacing the separator by an empty string</li>
<li>Divide the result by the length of the separator</li>
</ul>
