<p>The first seems to be something like:</p>

<pre><code>update t
    set col = concat('40.example.com/', substr(col, 16))
    where col like '31.example.com/%' and col not like '%.gif';
</code></pre>

<p>The second is unclear.  You say you want to replace something that is not even in the string, so it doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>I think the answer to your question is:  use the <code>where</code> clause for filtering the rows to update.</p>
