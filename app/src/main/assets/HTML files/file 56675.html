<p>You can remove the tags using this</p>

<pre><code>$('style, script').remove();
</code></pre>

<p>Styles will no longer show on screen and both HTML elements will dissapear from the DOM.</p>

<p>BUT, javascript code will still be executed if events have been attached before running the <code>remove()</code> code. </p>

<p>If you're only looking to clean some code returning by an ajax call (for example), it will work fine. If you want to clear the styles and javascript from the page you're already in, some Javascript code might already be attached to elements before you remove the <code>script</code> tag. </p>
