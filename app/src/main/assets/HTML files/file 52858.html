<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT Keyword,b.metals 
FROM(
      SELECT 'usersearch' AS Keyword
      FROM metaltable  
    ) AS a 
INNER JOIN metaltable AS b
ON a.Keyword like '%'+b.metals+'%'
</code></pre>

<p>Put your user input to 'usersearch', it would be work.
When you input 'gold or diamond of bronze', it would show three records.</p>
