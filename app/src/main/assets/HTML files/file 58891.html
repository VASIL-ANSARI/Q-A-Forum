<p>You can wrap your expensive initialization inside a context manager:</p>

<pre><code>def run(self):
    with expensive_initialization() as initialized_object:
        do_some_logic_here(initialized_object)
</code></pre>

<p>You will have a chance to properly initialize your object before calling <code>do_some_logic_here</code>, and to properly release the resources after leaving the context manager's block.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>
