<p>The only guidelines I was ever taught about links is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make it obvious that it is a link. Do not do anything that might trick a user to click on something they didn't want to click on.</li>
<li>Make it obvious that it is different than the other texts on the page because you do not want your users to miss out on a link they might have wanted to click on.</li>
<li>Years ago, I was taught that all links should be underlined. Obviously, many, including our beloved SO, do not do that. Many now favor that links are underlined only when hovered over.</li>
</ul>
