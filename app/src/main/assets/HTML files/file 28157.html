<p>The idea of a menu is to let the user choose what should happen now - and then to do it.</p>

<p>If you have a number of checkboxes where the user can set or unset filters, then my suggestion is to follow the Android design guide:</p>

<p>Simply call an Activity with a small layout of checkboxes and a button to save the changes. </p>

<p>A less complicated user experience and a more stable App (no hacks) will be on your side.</p>
