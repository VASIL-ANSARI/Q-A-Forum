<p>Basically, you can't.  At least, not in any sensible way.  Currently all that you have is <em>a query</em>.  You don't actually have a collection of objects, you just have information about <em>what you need to do to create those objects</em>.  It is the job of the query provider that you're currently in the process of writing to actually build the objects that the query defines and return them.</p>

<p>You've designed your program such that the query provider that creates the objects needs to have the already created objects already in order to properly build the query.  It's impossible to already have the objects defined by the query <em>that you haven't built yet</em>.  You've created a circular dependency for yourself.</p>

<p>It's important for you to provide the information needed to build the query somewhere other than in instances the objects that the query itself creates.  Typically this is done with attributes on the properties, or by basing the query on the other existing C# metadata about the type itself.  This type data exists, and is accessible to your query provider <em>without needing any actual instances of the objects you're tasked with creating</em>.</p>
