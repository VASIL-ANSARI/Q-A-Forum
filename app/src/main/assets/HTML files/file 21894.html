<p>AWESOME! I found the mistake why it couldn't work. The fault was in my LruCache, which stored AsyncDrawables, what is totally dumb. Everytime sizeOf in the LruCache was called, the bitmap inside of the asyncdrawable was null, so he just returned super.sizeOf(key, value). </p>

<p>Now it works like a charm!! :)</p>

<p>Thanks for your helps!</p>
