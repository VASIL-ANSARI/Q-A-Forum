<p>I would set up the two polymorphic associations (in my model and the required columns in my DB) and then create a method for getting both of the items (you don't want to override them method otherwise you would't be able to write new relationships).</p>

<pre><code>def get_entries
  if entries.any?
    entries
  else
    template_itinerary_entries
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can still use <code>entries</code> when you need to add items.</p>

<pre><code>reserve = Reservation.new
reserve.entries &lt;&lt; Entry.create()
</code></pre>

<p>But you could use the <code>get_entries</code> method to get either of the items.</p>

<pre><code>reserve.get_entries
=&gt; [template_itinerary_entries] # if there are no entries.
</code></pre>
