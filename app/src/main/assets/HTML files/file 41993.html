<p><code>Array.length</code> property just takes the last numerical <em>identifier</em> and adds one to it </p>

<p>(If the Array is formed by <code>Array</code> constructor, it will have that <code>length</code> assigned to it, which was passed to the constructor). </p>

<p>So, here the the last numerical identifier was <code>5</code> so length will return <code>5 + 1</code> which equals 6.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When setting a property on a JavaScript array when the property is a
  <strong>valid array index</strong> and that index is outside the current bounds of the
  array, the engine will <strong>update the array's length property accordingly</strong></p>
