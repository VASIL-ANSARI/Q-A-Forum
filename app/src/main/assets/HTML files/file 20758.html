<p>try this</p>

<pre><code>public void pump(InputStream in, OutputStream out, int size) {
byte[] buffer = new byte[4096]; // Or whatever constant you feel like using
int done = 0;
while (done &lt; size) {
    int read = in.read(buffer);
    if (read == -1) {
        throw new IOException("Something went horribly wrong");
    }
    out.write(buffer, 0, read);
    done += read;
}
// Maybe put cleanup code in here if you like, e.g. in.close, out.flush, out.close
     }
</code></pre>
