<p>It's too simple for me to explicitly write the code but this should help you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open "input.bin" for read as binary</li>
<li>Open "output.bin" for write</li>
<li>Read each byte, printing the binary value on the screen using an auxiliary function</li>
<li>Add 5 (no need to do anything special just literally add 5 and make sure to use the type unsigned char) and write the byte's value to output.bin</li>
<li>When EOF, remove("input.bin"); and rename("output.bin", "input.bin");</li>
</ul>

<p>For printing a number in binary the question has been answered many times:
