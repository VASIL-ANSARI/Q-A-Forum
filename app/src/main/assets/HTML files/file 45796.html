<p>You say the Gdx.files.internal method works on desktop and android, but the Gdx.files.local doesn't on android. Do you have any part of your code where a Gdx.files.local call on android works? </p>

<p>I think internal is where assets should reside, and local is meant for smaller files (ex: game state). </p>

<p>Different OSs treat the internal/local locations slightly differently. This could be why things "work" on desktop and not on android. Your interchanging of Gdx.files calls may be pointing you to different places.</p>
