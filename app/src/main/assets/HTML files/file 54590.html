<p>I'm not famliar with the lib, but after quick-check the source code:<br>
There are two classes:
<code>UserMixin</code> and <code>AnonymousUserMixin</code>. 
For <code>UserMixin</code> <code>is_authenticated</code> is <code>True</code> and <code>is_anonymous</code> is <code>False</code>, and the opposite is for <code>Anonymous</code>. </p>

<p>So when you open the application and don't authenticate yourself(current session doesn't have <code>user_id</code>, flask-login set user to anonymous user(creates instance of <code>AnonymousUserMixin</code>), otherwise it creates an instance of <code>UserMixin</code>(I don't think these classes should be called <code>mixins</code>, but doesn't matter). </p>

<p>Long story short, depends on authenticated you or not, <code>user</code> object created by flask-login will be instanced from the class with appropriate values of <code>is_authenticated</code> and <code>is_anonymous</code>. </p>
