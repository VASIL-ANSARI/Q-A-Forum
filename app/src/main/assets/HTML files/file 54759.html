<p>Maybe your local gradle distribution is corrupted. Check the projects and make sure all gradle files point to the same gradle version(2.0.0-beta6 in your case). Close Android Studio delete <code>.gradle</code> folder from your pc (the folder located in your home directory of your computer). Then open the project again. </p>
