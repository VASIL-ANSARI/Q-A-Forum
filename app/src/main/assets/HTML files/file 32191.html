<p>As mentioned in the comments, one approach would be to use a regular expression.  The following regex matches any of your operators when they are not surrounded by commas, and replaces them with the same string with the commas inserted:</p>

<pre><code>inputstring = 'wrong_syntax(b&gt;=c) correct_syntax(b,&gt;=,c)'
regex = r"([^,])(&gt;=|&lt;=|!=|==|&gt;|&lt;|=)([^,])"
replace = r"\1,\2,\3"

result = re.sub(regex, replace, inputstring)

print(result)
</code></pre>

<p>Simple regexes are relatively easy, but they can get complicated quickly.  Check out the docs for more info:</p>
