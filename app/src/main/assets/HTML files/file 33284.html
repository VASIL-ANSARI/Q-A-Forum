  <p>"No value given for one or more required parameter"</p>

<p>This is generated because you are not passing parameters properly to query.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code>"select name from table where name="+abc+";
</code></pre>

<p>this kind of thing generate this problem as <code>' '</code> are missing.</p>

<p>Or you are providing less parameters in query for prepared statement.
<em>(there may be some other reasons)</em></p>

<p>Please check.</p>

<p>Because I don't find anything wrong with this</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [Date] FROM TABLE1
</code></pre>
