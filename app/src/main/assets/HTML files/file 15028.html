<p>For a simple multi-uploading method you can use a multiple attribute on the input tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="file" multiple="multiple" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, the user can only select files visible in the current folder view; usually just one folder.</p>

<p>If you wanted to be able to add more files, perhaps dynamically apply <code>display:none;</code> to the file input tag and add a new one in its place. To show which files have already been selected, list out the current files to be uploaded using javascript, as is seen here, <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/multiple-file-upload" rel="nofollow">multiple-file-upload</a>.</p>

<p>Or skip the hiding step above so you have all the file upload forms visible at any given time, while dynamically keeping one blank one, so more files can be uploaded.</p>

<p>Be careful if you want valid XHTML/HTML as the <code>multiple</code> attribute is still part of the HTML5 speculation (SPEC).</p>

<p>Another alternative would be to use iframes and reload the iframe when a file is uploaded, so the user can instantly choose another file.</p>

<p>I personally never use Frames, so I have no idea how this might work.</p>

<hr>

<p>The so called "AJAX file uploader" methods are also just a clever iframe trick from what I have seen.</p>

<hr>

<p>The only other option I can think is to statically have a lot of <code>&lt;input type="file"/&gt;</code>s and hope your user needs no more than were provided.</p>

<hr>

<p>I would personally just use the plain <code>&lt;input type="file" multiple="multiple"/&gt;</code> as I would assume that most user's groups of pictures they are trying to upload simultaneously would be in the same folder.</p>
