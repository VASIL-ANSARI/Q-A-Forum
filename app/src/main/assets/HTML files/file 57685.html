<p>I'm not really sure why your not aware on how to update an sql if you knew how to insert.. Is this for your homework??
 anyway here is a script on how to update it just modify it to your need. On SO we dont spoon feed everything. We give ideas the rest we find ourselves</p>

<pre><code>$query_upload="UPDATE images_tbl SET images_id = ".$your_image_id." images_path = ".$your_target_path.";
</code></pre>
