<p>curl used to include a list of accepted CAs, but no longer bundles ANY CA certs. So by default it'll reject all SSL certificates as unverifiable.</p>

<p>You'll have to get your CA's cert and point curl at it. More details at cURLS's <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html">Details on Server SSL Certificates</a>.</p>
