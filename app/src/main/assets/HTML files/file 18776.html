<p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> has never been a "simple separator", at least not in any standard version of HTML<sup>*</sup>.  It is a container element -- a "paragraph", hence the "p" -- and always has been.  It just happens that the end tag is optional, so a bunch of people (a*hem*)  have been using it wrong all this time.</p>

<p><sup>* It appears <em>very early drafts</em> of the HTML spec said that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> was a separator.  But by the first public standard version (2.0), it was a container, and it's been that way ever since.</sup></p>
