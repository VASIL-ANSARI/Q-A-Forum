<p>add a class to the div when you click the button that you want to disable <code>div</code> with, say <code>disabled</code>... and then check for this class in the appropriate piece of code to see if it's present, if so - don't add anything to it...</p>

<p>something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>$('.addButton').click(function(){ 
   if ($('#whatever').hasClass('disabled'))
      return false;
   // your code here
});

$('.disableButton').click(function(){
    $('#whatever').addClass('disabled')
});
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the working <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/6YnUL/" rel="nofollow">FIDDLE</a>. </p>

<p>By clicking "add html" button it appends html to the div, by clicking "disable" button - it disables the div and you won't be able to add new html to it when you click "add html" button, also I added "enable" button just to show you how you can do it in case you'll need it</p>
