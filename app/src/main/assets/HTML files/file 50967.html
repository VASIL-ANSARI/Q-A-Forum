<p>Answering my own question:</p>

<p>Knowing that Swift uses the same ARC implementation as Objective-C, the answer is that it is not recommended to rely on the ARC to deallocate scarce resources.</p>

<p>Apple recommends against using ARC this way here:</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmPractical.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004447-SW13" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmPractical.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004447-SW13</a></p>

<p>the stated reasons are (copied from the docs):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Order dependencies on object graph tear-down.</strong>
The object graph tear-down mechanism is inherently non-ordered. Although you might typically expectâand getâa particular order, you are introducing fragility. If an object is unexpectedly autoreleased rather than released for example, the tear-down order may change, which may lead to unexpected results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-reclamation of scarce resources.</strong>
Memory leaks are bugs that should be fixed, but they are generally not immediately fatal. If scarce resources are not released when you expect them to be released, however, you may run into more serious problems. If your application runs out of file descriptors, for example, the user may not be able to save data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cleanup logic being executed on the wrong thread.</strong>
If an object is autoreleased at an unexpected time, it will be deallocated on whatever threadâs autorelease pool block it happens to be in. This can easily be fatal for resources that should only be touched from one thread.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, the "defer" keyword says the the instructions written under the defer clause will be executed when stack of the current function is unwinded. This has the effect that C++ RAII has, it gives you the ability to tie the lifetime of a scarce resource to the lifetime of a value on the stack.</p>
