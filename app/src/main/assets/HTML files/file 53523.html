<p>First issue:</p>

<p>Regarding your specific question with the four dots.</p>

<p>Simply set the <code>renderer.enabled = false</code>, that's all there is to it.</p>

<p>Note however that as I mention in a comment, you would never try to "cull yourself" in Unity (unless I have misunderstood your description).</p>

<hr>

<p>Second issue:</p>

<p>Regarding the small spheres.  I suspect you have very many in the scene.  You simply can't do that. In video games (the most difficult of all 3D engineering), you just do this with <strong>billboarding</strong>. It's how say "grass" is done in a scene. You can achieve this nicely with the particle system in Unity, or other techniques. An implementation is beyond the scope of this answer, but you will have to fully investigate billboarding. Simply it's a small flat image which always faces the camera in the render pass.</p>

<p>Issue 2B:</p>

<p>Note however that sphere <em>colliders</em> are wonderful, and you can use as many as you want. I'm sure this is obvious from base mathematical reasons. Side tip: often folks try to "write their own" thinking it will be faster. It's impossible to outwrite the 100? person-years of spatial culling scientific research in PhysX, and moreover they use the metal, the gpu, so you can't beat it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Issue three:</p>

<p>Is there a chance you're using a <em>mesh</em> collider somewhere in the project? Never use mesh colliders, at all.  (It's extremely confusing they are mentioned or used in Unity; they only have one or two very specific limited uses.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Issue four:</p>

<p>I'm confused about why you are <em>turning things on and off</em>. I have a guess.</p>

<h1>I suspect you are not using more than one "stage"!</h1>

<p>There's an amazing trick about video games when you have more than one camera. In fact you have "offscreen" scenes! So you may have players in a dungeon or the like.  Off "to the side" you may have an entirely duplicate or triplicate setup of the whole thing running (you could "see it if the camera turned the wrong way") for the other cameras. (In the example you would have different qualities on the dopplegangers, coloring, map-style or whatever the case is.) Sometimes you make a whole double just to run physics calculations or address other problems.</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/answers/299823/view.html" rel="nofollow">Fascinating extreme example of that sort of thing</a>.</p>

<p>In short in your situation,</p>

<h1>You likely need one whole 'stage' of a camera <em>and brain</em> for each of the camera views!</h1>

<p>Again this can be <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/answers/299823/view.html" rel="nofollow">http://answers.unity3d.com/answers/299823/view.html</a> but it is indeed the everyday thing. In your overall scene you will see eight happy brains sitting in a row, each with their own camera.  In each one you would display whatever items/angle etc are relevant.  (Obviously, if certain items are "identical, other than the viewing angle" you could use the "same brain with more than one camera": but I would not do that, best to have one-brain-one-camera for each view.)</p>

<p>I believe that could be the fundamental issue you're having!</p>
