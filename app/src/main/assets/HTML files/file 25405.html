<p>First, you should not use id starting with a number. They're correct in HTML5 but are problematic in many tools and in CSS.</p>

<p>But if you want to get the element with biggest id, you could do this :</p>

<pre><code>var me;
$('.a').each(function(){
   var num = Number(this.id); // this ensures the id is only a number
   if (num &amp;&amp; !(me &amp;&amp; me.id&gt;num)) {
      me = this;
   }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose you have id that are "a1", "a2", etc.</p>

<p>Then you can do</p>

<pre><code>var me;
$('.a[id^="a"]').each(function(){
   var num = Number(this.id.slice(1));
   if (num &amp;&amp; !(me &amp;&amp; me.id.slice(1)&gt;num)) {
      me = this;
   }
});
</code></pre>
