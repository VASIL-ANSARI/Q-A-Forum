<p>The problem is that you've told Java that project11D implements CarbonFootprint, but you then haven't implemented CarbonFootprint.  According to how you've defined your interface, all implementations of that interface will have a method called "getCarbonFootprint()" that returns a double.  Yet class project11D doesn't have that defined.</p>
