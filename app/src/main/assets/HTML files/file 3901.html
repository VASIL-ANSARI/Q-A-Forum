<p>It shouldn't make much of a difference.  If you want to use specific libraries, they might only have installation packages for 32 bit and not 64 bit -- but more and more packages are offering 64 bit packages.  On the other hand, unless you are expecting to write applications that use more than 2GBs of memory, you won't need 64 bit support.</p>
