<p>Don't optimize prematurely! View controllers are lightweight. <em>Views</em> are heavyweight, but the views of all the view controllers except the "top" (visible) view controller in a navigation controller are not in the interface, so they have no backing store and take up little memory. And if there is a memory problem, then there's an easy solution: manipulate the UINavigationController's "stack" of view controllers directly to remove intermediate view controllers. (See the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UINavigationController_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UINavigationController/setViewControllers:animated:" rel="nofollow">UINavigationController documentation</a> to learn how to do this.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have to say that your entire architecture sounds like a much better candidate for a UIPageViewController than for a UINavigationController. UIPageViewController is exactly meant for moving to previous or successive "pages" in a "book" arrangement, and the wonderful thing is that only <em>one</em> view controller exists at any given moment (or, at most, three - if you use the "scroll" style of page view controller, the previous and next view controller always exist, automatically, so that scrolling to them is fast).</p>
