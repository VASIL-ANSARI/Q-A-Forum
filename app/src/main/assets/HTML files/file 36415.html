<p>I think you just need conditional aggregation:</p>

<pre><code>select laborid, workorderid,
       sum(case when datename(weekday, startdate) = 'Sunday' then hours end) as S,
       sum(case when datename(weekday, startdate) = 'Monday' then hours end) as M,
       sum(case when datename(weekday, startdate) = 'Tuesday' then hours end) as T,
       sum(case when datename(weekday, startdate) = 'Wednesday' then hours end) as W,
       sum(case when datename(weekday, startdate) = 'Thursday' then hours end) as T,
       sum(case when datename(weekday, startdate) = 'Friday' then hours end) as F,
       sum(case when datename(weekday, startdate) = 'Saturday' then hours end) as S
from timecardentries
group by laborid, workorderid;
</code></pre>
