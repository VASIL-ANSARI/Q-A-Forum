<p>How much freedom do you have with this? I would say you need 3 tables, 1 for each : Polls, Voters, Participation . In the Polls table you store Poll_ID and Poll_Description. In voter you store all Voter_ID and any other voter information you might have. Then in the participation you store, Poll_ID,Voter_ID, and results or simply a date of when they participated. Then when you want to see such information you query the 3rd table, and join it on the other too for the specifics</p>

<p>The best way to check if a user already voted is to query the Polls_Voters tables in your setup it would be </p>

<pre><code>Select *
from Polls_Voters
where Voter_ID = 'ID of voter you are looking for'
and poll_id = 'ID of poll you wish to see if they voted in'
</code></pre>
