<p>There's a special method for this in Rails, called <code>increment_counter(counter_name, id)</code>. For example, if a forum has many topics and there's a topics_count field on the Forum model (which there should be, for caching/performace reasons):</p>

<pre><code>Forum.increment_counter(:topics_count, 1)
</code></pre>
