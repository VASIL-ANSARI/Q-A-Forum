<p><code>KeyDown</code> is bubbling event, which means it is first raised on the source control (the <code>TextBox</code>), then on the parent, then on the parent's parent, and so on, until it is handled. When you set <code>AcceptsReturn</code> to true, the control handles the Return key, so the event is not bubbled. In this case you can use the tunneling version of the event: <code>PreviewKeyDown</code>, which is raised on each ancestor of the control from the top to the bottom before it reaches the source control.</p>
