<p>So, I "think" I've found a way to scale the radius (given in meters) to the pixels on the Cartesian plane d3 geo map.  I'm probably making this way more complicated than it needs to be - but I'm not sure how else to do it.</p>

<p>The map's height, width, and projection is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>var width = 200;
var height = 120;
var projection = 
    d3.geo.mercator()
    .scale((width + 1) / 2 / Math.PI)
    .translate([width / 2, height / 2]);
</code></pre>

<p>The geo objects that I'm plotting on the map contain lat/long coordinates for multiple points.  By searching on stackoverflow, I found a distance formula:</p>

<pre><code>d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
</code></pre>

<p>The formula requires two points from the cartesian plane (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).  I picked the circle's point and one of the polygon points, the lat/long coordinates are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Lat/Long for polygon1, point1: 36.5625, -24.9609375
Lat/Long for circle: 31.640625, 13.359375
</code></pre>

<p>I used the following web site to find out how many miles it is between the two coordinates above - <a href="http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-is-it-between.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-is-it-between.htm</a></p>

<pre><code>Miles between the two coordinates on the map are: 3020.207
</code></pre>

<p>Then I found the projected coordinates (x,y) on the Cartesian plane for the two lat/long coordinates via:</p>

<pre><code>projection([long,lat])
X/Y for polygon1, point1: 86.0634765625, 38.040230671805666
X/Y for circle: 107.458984375, 41.36090550209383
</code></pre>

<p>So, I then plugged these values into the formula to calculate the pixel distance between the two points:</p>

<pre><code>d = sqrt ( (107.458984375 - 86.0634765625)^2 + (41.36090550209383 - 38.040230671805666)^2  )
result = 21.651665891641176 pixels
miles per pixel = 139.49074473599643 (calculated by: 3020.207/21.651665891641176)
meters per pixel = 224488.5930964074505 (calculated by 139.49074473599643 * 1609.34)
</code></pre>

<p>This seems like an awfully roundabout way to scale meters to a mercator map projection.  If anyone has a much simpler solution - please share!</p>
