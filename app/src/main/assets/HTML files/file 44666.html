<p><code>list</code> and <code>listcopy</code> both refer to the same object. Here are some ways to make a copy of a list:</p>

<pre><code>listcopy = list[:]

import copy
listcopy = copy.copy(list)

# Also make a copy of the objects in the list
import copy
listcopy = copy.deepcopy(list)
</code></pre>
