<p>In your AppDelegate.m you can utilise the following delegate method:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)applicationWillResignActive: (UIApplication*)application
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look through the other <code>UIApplicationDelegate</code> methods here, and find out which one will be the best fit for your app:</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>One way that I accomplish this is to use the delegate method <code>-(void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application</code> to display your login interface, is not already done elsewhere.</p>

<p>This method will always be called when the user opens the app from scratch, or if resuming from the background, or if on iOS5 for example, if they're in your app and they interact with the draggable status bar and then close it again, this method will be hit. I think this is probably the best time to ask them to login.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if you want a user to be able to resume on the screen they were on, so you need to decide whether to log them out when the app enters the background. (see the application delegate class reference again, or check out your app delegate method file)</p>
