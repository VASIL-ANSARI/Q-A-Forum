<p>If you do not wish to use Charles Proxy consider some Java or Python based logging proxies. One that I had seen a few years ago was Grinder (Java based). Here is the page that shows how to <a href="https://theholyjava.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/simple-logging-http-proxy-with-grinder/" rel="nofollow">start it</a>. And here is the <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">home page</a>.</p>

<p>For a Python based proxy check this discussion <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4412581/seriously-simple-python-http-proxy">seriously simple python HTTP proxy?</a> and this one <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3480147/python-proxy-a-simple-one">Python proxy.. A simple one!</a>.</p>
