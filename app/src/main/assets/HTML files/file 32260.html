<p>Get rid of unnecessary implementation of generated methods, e.g., your copy constructor: as is, your copy constructor does the same as the default constructor. It should, however, copy the object. Removing it will result in a copy constructor which does just that. As an added bonus, the compiler would also generate a move constructor for you.</p>

<p>When inserting an object into a container the object is copied (or moved if it is a temporary object): C++ is based on <em>values</em>, not on references!</p>
