<p>I'm thinking this is what's happening:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Keytool is already in your PATH, it might be pointing to a symlink
  at /usr/bin/keytool. In this case, check the symlink target to be sure
  it points to the Keytool in the JDK.

</blockquote>

<p>If the symlink does point to the right location of your keytool, then the next thing I would attempt is to try signing the application <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#releasemode" rel="nofollow">manually</a> through the command line. This is to eliminate IntelliJ as a possible cause of your problem. Once you're able to sign your key with the command line, then you can delete the key and try again with intelliJ.</p>
