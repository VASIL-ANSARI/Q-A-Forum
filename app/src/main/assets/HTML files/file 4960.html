<p>If you want to continue in your script use:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    shutil.move(srcFile, dstFile)
except WindowsError:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>The reason your getting error 32 is because there is another process on your computer or server that is using that file. You might want to not copy temp files as they are not really important by name.</p>
