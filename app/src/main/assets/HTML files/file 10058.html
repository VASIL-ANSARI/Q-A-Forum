<p>Assuming that is the actual contents of your js file, including the <code>//My.js</code> comment, then that is your problem right there.</p>

<p><code>/// &lt;reference</code> comments must be at the very top of the file, before any other content, otherwise they will not work.</p>

<p>Side note, did you know there is a code snippet for that reference?  its <code>ref</code>, then <kbd>tab</kbd> <kbd>tab</kbd>.  Also you can drag / drop a file and get the comment.  </p>

<p>Once you have your references done, you can force VS2010 to refresh your js comments by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> while editing the .js file</p>
