<p>First off...take care using dyamic statements like this as they can open up the possibility of SQL injection attacks.  It'd be safer to use a static SQL statement inside of RPGLE.</p>

<p>But if you must use CLLE... try the following:</p>

<pre><code>dcl  &amp;quote  type(*CHAR) len(1) value ('''')
dcl  &amp;stmt   type(*char) len(512)

chgvar  var(&amp;stmt) value('UPDATE mylib/myfile set n53dsc = ' + 
              *CAT &amp;quote *CAT &amp;TEXT *CAT &amp;quote +
              *CAT 'where ' *CAT &amp;N53GIDCHAR *CAT '=' +
              *CAT &amp;quote *CAT &amp;CHARID# *CAT &amp;quote) 
dmpclpgm
runsql_x SQL(&amp;stmt) COMMIT(*NONE)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
Based on your comment.  I'd liek to point out that reading one record at a time and updating (with SQL) is a poor use of SQL.  </p>

<p>SQL is designed &amp; optimised for set a time operations...</p>

<p>I think the following would accomplish what you are trying to do..(not sure exactly what fields are in which tables)</p>

<pre><code>update mylib/myfile
   set n53dsc = &lt;TEXT&gt;
  where n53gidchar in (select n53gidchar from mylib/otherfile)
        and n53gidchar = charid#
</code></pre>
