<pre><code>$(document).ready();
</code></pre>

<p>fires after the DOM has completely build up, so the code in your head will execute after the code at the bottom of your code and therefore skrollr will not find any mathing tags/attributes.</p>

<p>Why not writing all of the code in a <code>$(document).ready()</code> block, no matter where it is notated?</p>
