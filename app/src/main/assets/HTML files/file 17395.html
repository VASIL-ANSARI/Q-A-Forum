<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/" rel="nofollow">IBM ILOG CPLEX</a> has a <a href="http://www.decf.berkeley.edu/help/apps/ampl/cplex-doc/relnotescplex/relnotescplex19.html" rel="nofollow">solution pool</a> feature and it's free for academic purposes.</p>

<p>I guess you can probably get all solution if you set the maximum pool size sufficiently large. I don't know for sure, never tried.</p>
