<p>Some times, you can right click on a stack frame and choose "Unwind to here" (or very similar wording). It's not always possible, and I'm not sure what the necessary conditions are, but I'm going to make a guess as to what might prevent it:</p>

<ul>
<li>A native code frame on the call stack in the middle</li>
<li>Being halted at a StackOverflowException (obviously, death to a process in any case)</li>
<li>Maybe lambda expressions or other things that prevent Edit-and-Continue from working (?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, anything "unusual".</p>

<p>Other than that, if it works, then there you go!</p>
