<p>In Java, the equivalent of globals are public static variables.  If you want to make the static variable immutable, then it should also be declared as final.  </p>

<p>Also, the naming convention in Java for static variables is to capitalize the entire name, and separate words with underscores (ex: SOME_BOX).</p>

<p>Using your example above, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>public static final int[] BOX = {0,0,0....};
</code></pre>
