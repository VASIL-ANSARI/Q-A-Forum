<p>The easiest* way to evaluate the actual value of a <code>Tensor</code> object is to pass it to the <code>Session.run()</code> method, or call <code>Tensor.eval()</code> when you have a default session (i.e. in a <code>with tf.Session():</code> block, or see below). In general,** you cannot print the value of a tensor without running some code in a session.</p>

<p>If you are experimenting with the programming model, and want an easy way to evaluate tensors, the <a href="http://tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/client.md#InteractiveSession"><code>tf.InteractiveSession</code></a> lets you open a session at the start of your program, and then use that session for all <code>Tensor.eval()</code> (and <code>Operation.run()</code>) calls. This can be easier in an interactive setting, such as the shell or an IPython notebook, when it's tedious to pass around a <code>Session</code> object everywhere.</p>

<p>This might seem silly for such a small expression, but one of the key ideas in Tensorflow is <em>deferred execution</em>: it's very cheap to build a large and complex expression, and when you want to evaluate it, the back-end (to which you connect with a <code>Session</code>) is able to schedule its execution more efficiently (e.g. executing independent parts in parallel and using GPUs).</p>

<p>*&nbsp; To print the value of a tensor without returning it to your Python program, you can use the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/api_docs/python/control_flow_ops.html#Print"><code>tf.Print()</code></a> op, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/36296783/3574081">And suggests in another answer</a>. Note that you still need to run part of the graph to see the output of this op, which is printed to standard output. If you're running distributed TensorFlow, the <code>tf.Print()</code> op will print its output to the standard output of the task where that op runs.</p>

<p>**&nbsp; You <em>might</em> be able to use the experimental <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/api_docs/python/contrib.util.html#constant_value"><code>tf.contrib.util.constant_value()</code></a> function to get the value of a constant tensor, but it isn't intended for general use, and it isn't defined for many operators.</p>
