<p>It is in the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/identifiers.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifier quote characters can be included within an identifier if you quote the identifier. If the character to be included within the identifier is the same as that used to quote the identifier itself, then you need to <strong>double the character</strong>. </p>

<p>In your case:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE t1 (```id``` INT);
</code></pre>
