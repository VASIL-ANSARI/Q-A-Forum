<p>Assuming the existence of a <code>myTextBox</code> textbox on the form, you simply access its <code>Text</code> attribute to retrieve the value:</p>

<pre><code>Process.Start("increase.exe", myTextBox.Text);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, without validating that this is an existing path (and the user has permissions to it), you will get an exception.</p>
