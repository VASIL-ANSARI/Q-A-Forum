<p>The <strong>_id</strong> and <strong>_rev</strong> values are needed to CouchDB. The first one, <strong>_id</strong> (<em>uuid</em>), has to ensure uniqueness of the document in the database, the second one, <strong>_rev</strong> (<em>revision</em>), has to ensure there are no conflicts while multiple processes try to edit the same document.</p>

<p>These fields are <strong>mandatory</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>_id</strong> is assigned by CouchDB when it's not in the document we try to create, <strong>_rev</strong> is always assigned by CouchDB.</p>
