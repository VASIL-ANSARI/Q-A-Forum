<p>Are you referring to the Azure Scheduler in Mobile Services?</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-schedule-recurring-tasks/#add-job" rel="nofollow">this</a> link.</p>

<p>Otherwise I believe you'd need to have a service running that will run a task on scheduled times and occasionally poll the database for new times to run (pretty simple to do. Sounds like you probably have most of that already).</p>
