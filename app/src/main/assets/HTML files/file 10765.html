<p>a declaration of</p>

<pre><code>int a,b,c;
size_t x,y,z;
</code></pre>

<p>means that all of a,b,c are same type (int) as are x,y,z (size_t)</p>

<p>The declaration inside a for-loop is no different -- and in your example both x and y are of type size_t</p>

<p><strong>however</strong> in your example <code>x</code> is not initialized (only y is set to <code>somevalue</code>) -- and unless the body of the loops set it to something you will find that <code>y -= x</code> is going to give you <s>random</s> undefined results.</p>
