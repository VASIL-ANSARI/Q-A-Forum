<p>Sounds like the application pool the website is running is not configured correctly. You're probably using the wrong Managed Pipeline Mode. </p>

<p>In IIS7 manager find the Application Pool your web site is using (To check the app-pool click the website in the tree, then click "Basic settings" in the right pane, the Application pool name is then shown in the dialog). If you click the "Application pools" item in the tree to the left you will see a list of Application Pools in the middle. Your application pool should probably be running in "Classic Managed Pipeline Mode" if it has been ported directly to IIS7 from an IIS6 server.</p>

<p>To change the Pipeline mode, select the App-pool in the list then click "Basic Settings" to the right, the dialog shown also lets you select the .NET framework version used when running the site.</p>

<p>You can read more about pipeline modes on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb515251.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a></p>
