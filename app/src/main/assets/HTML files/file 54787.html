<p>The elements I was missing are (these are my interpretation, may still be incorrect):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If it's a package (with <code>__init__.py</code>), use it from outside the <code>pkg</code> folder, not from inside.  ie, using a package both ways (calling from outside and using modules from within) might be hard to set up, so don't. This is the main insight that solves my problem.</p></li>
<li><p>the dot notation for getting submodules and subpackages works both for files and for folders within <code>pkg</code>.  Thus, from some other folder, but with <code>pkg</code> in my path, I can call any of the following:</p>

<p>import pkg
from pkg.cow import foodle
from pkg.components import foodle
from pkg.components.components import foodle</p></li>
</ul>
