<p>Make the file an objective C++ file with extension .mm Then you can call object C and C++ objects in the same code.</p>

<p>XCode will call the correct compiler from the file extension (ie adding -x objective-c++ to the compile command)</p>

<p>Not that C++ and objective C are different languages and do not understand each others objects so to move data between them you will need to convert the data to a C type e.g. void, char int and pointers to them.</p>
