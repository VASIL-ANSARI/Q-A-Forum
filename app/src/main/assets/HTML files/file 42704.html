<p>In your MainWindow.xib you specify a nib name to load for the DummyViewController but you don't specify anything for the SplitViewController.  You've told the tab bar controller what kind of object to use (SplitViewController) but nothing about how it should create child view controllers for that object.</p>

<p>This results in a SplitViewController with no view controllers to use, therefore the error message.</p>
