<p>Because it goes out of scope when the loop ends.</p>

<p>So you should have</p>

<pre><code>var linking;
for (i=0;i&lt;=4;i++)
{
   linking= links[i]; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>But furthermore, what are you trying to do here?  You overwrite linking four times.  Do you want to display all of the links?  If so, you can concatenate them like:</p>

<pre><code>var linking = "";
for (i=0;i&lt;=4;i++)
{
   linking = linking + links[i] + " "; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: the commenters are right; I did forget that there is no block scoping in Javascript.  Did this fix your code?  I can't imagine that it did.  The only other thing that I can think of is that <code>links[4]</code> is undefined, and then you would be assigning <code>undefined</code> to <code>linking</code>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I can't delete this because it's been accepted, but if anyone else comes up with a more useful answer, feel free to unaccept this one.</p>
