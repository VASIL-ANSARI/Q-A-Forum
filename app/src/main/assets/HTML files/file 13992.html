<p>Just to post the beginnings of a proper answer. I think I would use a http handler (.ashx) file to code up some custom handling for these files - this <a href="http://www.dotnetperls.com/ashx" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> shows an example.</p>

<p>Your link would be something like </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="MyMp3Handler.ashx?fileName=MyFile"&gt;Click here to download&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The handler would do the streaming work. </p>

<p>Example of what the handler might look like (based on this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5596747/download-stream-file-from-url-asp-net">SO question</a>)</p>

<pre><code>public void ProcessRequest (HttpContext context) {

    var filePath = Server.MapPath(context.Request.QueryString["fileName"].ToString()) + ".mp3";          
    if (!File.Exists(filePath))             
        return;          

    var fileInfo = new System.IO.FileInfo(filePath);         
    Response.ContentType = "application/octet-stream";         
    Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", String.Format("attachment;filename=\"{0}\"", filePath));         
    Response.AddHeader("Content-Length", fileInfo.Length.ToString());         
    Response.WriteFile(filePath);         
    Response.End();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The handler also needs to be registered in the web.config.</p>

<p>Note though - this is off the top of my head so code will need tweaking to work. Just thought I'd pop in how i would start off</p>

<p><strong>Additional Note</strong></p>

<p>A colleague has just pointed out that even with content type set to <code>application/octet-stream</code> it is still up to the browser implementation of how that gets rendered so it still may not stream. That said I did something similar but in PHP and I got the mp3 file streaming down in Firefox, IE and Chrome so the principle does work. I provided the example in asp.net since that is what your question was tagged as.</p>
