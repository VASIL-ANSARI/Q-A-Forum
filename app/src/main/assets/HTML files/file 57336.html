<p>No, a NULL pointer is not used to terminate strings.  The NUL character is used.  They are different things, but if you assign either of them to an integer in C, the result is always the same: zero (0).</p>

<p>A NUL character is represented in C as <code>'\0'</code> and takes up one <code>char</code> of storage.  A NULL pointer is represented in C as 0, and takes up the same storage as <code>void *</code>.  For example, on a 64-bit machine, a <code>void *</code> is 8 bytes while <code>'\0'</code> is one byte.</p>

<p>I.e., nullptr is not the same thing as <code>'\0'</code>.  And the character is the null character, called NUL, but it is not supposed to be called a NULL byte or a NULL character.</p>
