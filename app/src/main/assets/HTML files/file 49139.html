<p>I wrote this utility in "C" that tries to mimic what Systinternal's utility "handle.exe" does, and made it a SourceForge project.  You might have to modify the source code to make it do what you need it to do.</p>

<p>The code is very ugly, in that there are a number of "undocumented" (not necessarily unsupported) things being done.</p>

<p>I hope this helps (and I think it might)...</p>

<p>I realize it is written in "C", but hopefully you can "translate" the functionality to C#.</p>
