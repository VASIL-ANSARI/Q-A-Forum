<p>The error you are getting is stating that the property <code>title</code> does not exist in the context of the line <code>&lt;li data-bind="text: title"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The syntax error here <code>&lt;ul data-bind=" template: {name:'point', foreach: points"&gt;</code> prevents the context of the next line from being a <code>point</code> object and instead retains the original context which is the view model itself. Your view model does not have a <code>title</code> property, hence the error.</p>
