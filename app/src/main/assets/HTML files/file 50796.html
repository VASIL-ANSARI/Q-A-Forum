<p>This is because you don't pass to your view the form object created in your controller because you don't call your contact controller.</p>

<p>If it's a one page, creat a twig view named <code>contact.html.twig</code> with your form and add in your index twig template where you want render the form : </p>

<pre><code>{{ render(controller('YodaHomeBundle:Home:contact')) }}
</code></pre>

<p>This twig method will call your <code>indexController</code> and the <code>contactAction</code></p>
