<p>Remove the single quotes, and include all products you wish to pivot, should just be FOR ProductName IN ([Product1], [Product2]), you also need to give your subquery an alias. You have also put two ts in <code>selectt</code>.</p>

<p>Making the final query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  temp.Product1, temp.Product2
FROM    (   SELECT  ProductName, Ammount
            FROM    CustomerProducts
        ) AS c -- SUBQUERY ALIAS HERE
        PIVOT
        (   SUM(Ammount)
            FOR ProductName IN ([Product1], [Product2]) -- REMOVE SINGLE QUOTES, INCLUDE ALL PRODUCTS
        ) AS temp;
</code></pre>
