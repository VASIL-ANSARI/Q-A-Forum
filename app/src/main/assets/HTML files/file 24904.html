<p>Welcome to stackoverflow! First of all I would like to second @amon. If you have any kind of code ideas, please post them. Otherwise, you shoudl maybe formulate a more precise question. That said, I'll try to give an answer anyway and could update it if you provide any further specifications.</p>

<p>If you are working with sequences or even more generally speaking, bioinformatics, you should definitely have a look at <a href="http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Bioperl</a>. It comes with interfaces for most commonly used data formats in bioinformatics and even with interfaces to certain online ressources, including databases.
And then there are Perl modules to interface with databases in general, for SQL databases I would guess that <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/MLAWREN/SQL-DB-0.971.0/lib/SQL/DB.pod" rel="nofollow">SQL::DB</a> is probably a good starting point, but haven't used any of that myself, so far.</p>
