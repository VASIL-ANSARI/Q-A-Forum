<p>There's no "right" answer in my opinion, but I like the <code>struct list</code> approach.  You can even make it opaque to the end user.  Then you could change the underlying implementation to be a doubly linked list or backed by array, and the user wouldn't have to change any code to take advantage of it.</p>
