<p>Create a temporary file with an extension of ".pdf", and then use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776419%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>FindExectuable</code></a> for your temporary file. Note that even though only the extension really matters, <code>FindExecutable</code> still requires a real file, not just a name with the right extension.</p>
