<p>Since both databases reside on the same host, why don't you simply copy them over using SQL? Loosely taken from your code:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO SMARTURBIA.cities 
SELECT SMARTURBIA_OLD.cities.*,catagories.name 
  from SMARTURBIA_OLD.cities, SMARTURBIA.CATEGORIES 
 WHERE cities.path=categories.name;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO SMARTURBIA.kmz SELECT * FROM SMARTURBIA_OLD.kmz;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO SMARTURBIA.pois SELECT * FROM SMARTURBIA_OLD.pois;
</code></pre>

<p>and so on :)</p>

<p>That way, you can see immediately (number of Rows affected) if all rows have been migrated.</p>
