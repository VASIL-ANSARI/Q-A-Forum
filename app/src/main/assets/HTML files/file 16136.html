<p>Yes, but without more code it's going to be tough to do because you have no way of identifying that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as it currently is coded. If it followed a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with and ID of <code>somediv</code> then you could do:</p>

<pre><code>$$('#somediv &gt; div')[0].setAttribute('id', 'myId');
</code></pre>
