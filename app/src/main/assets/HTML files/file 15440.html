<p>There isn't just an unneeded ORDER BY, there's also a spurious TOP(1). </p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP (1) NULL AS [EMPTY] ...
</code></pre>

<p>That subselect will only return 0 or 1 rows. In fact without the TOP there it wouldn't be legal to have an ORDER BY in a subselect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ORDER BY clause is invalid in views, inline functions, derived tables, subqueries, and common table expressions, unless TOP or FOR XML is also specified.: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( SELECT * FROM Table1 ORDER BY foo )</p>

<p>I think you have probably done something wrong in your LINQ. Are you sure you haven't written <code>.Take(1)</code> or similar somewhere in your query, before calling <code>.Count()</code>?</p>

<p>This is wrong:</p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Foo&gt; foo = (...).OrderBy(x =&gt; x.Foo).Take(1);
int count = foo.Count();
</code></pre>

<p>You should do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Foo&gt; foo = (...);
Iqueryable&lt;Foo&gt; topOne = foo.OrderBy(x =&gt; x.Foo).Take(1);
int count = foo.Count();
</code></pre>
