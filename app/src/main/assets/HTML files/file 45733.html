<p>Change this :</p>

<pre><code>if (symbol == "/" &amp;&amp; number2 == 0) // This part seems to be broken.
                answer.Text = "Invalid input.";
</code></pre>

<p>To : </p>

<pre><code>if (symbol == "/" &amp;&amp; number2 == 0) { answer.Text = "Invalid input."; return; }
</code></pre>

<p><em>Explanation:</em>
The condition in 'if' clause in your code is correct. And it does what is expected - it changes answer.Text property to "Invalid input" however a bit later it is changed again on this line : </p>

<pre><code>answer.Text = ans.ToString("n"); // Change label value to a number.
</code></pre>

<p>And because your condition in 'if' clause returned true - 'else' block was not executed. That's why you see 0.00 (default value of type double). </p>

<p>P.S.
So by adding <code>return</code> statement to if clause you just basically end your method.
It is like if you say to compiler *"Hey <em>if</em> this guy is trying to <code>divide by zero</code> alert him 'Ivalid input' and do nothing, return from method".*</p>

<p>Other way to sort it out would be to :  </p>

<pre><code>if (divide by zero attempt) { your code here } else
{
    and place rest of your method code here
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I would not recommend this because it uses redundant else statement and {} figures. You can avoid all of it by using if() {....; return; } in your case.</p>

<p>You may also benefit from using <code>switch</code> block and your code might be refactored to something like :</p>

<pre><code>double number1, number2, ans; // Identify variables as double to account for decimals.
number1 = Convert.ToDouble(num1.Text); // Convert the contents of the textBox into a double.
number2 = Convert.ToDouble(num2.Text); // 
ans = 0.0;
string symbol = modifier1.Text;

if (symbol == "/" &amp;&amp; number2 == 0) { answer.Text = "Invalid input."; return;}
switch(symbol)
{
   case "+": ans = number1 + number2; break;
   case "-": ans = number1 - number2; break;
   case "*": ans = number1 * number2; break;
   case "/": ans = number1 / number2; break;
   default : answer.Text = "Invalid sign."; return;
}                

answer.Text = ans.ToString("n"); // Change label value to a number.
</code></pre>
