<p>It seems to be that when you call <code>password_path(resource_name)</code> in your view code, the routing system thinks you mean <code>/passwords/resource_name</code>, rather than the controller namespaced under <code>users</code> by Devise. This is because you have the line</p>

<pre><code>resources :passwords
</code></pre>

<p>directly under your <code>devise_for</code> call in your routes file. Now I'm not sure if that line is there for a reason, but does your problem go away when you comment it out?</p>
