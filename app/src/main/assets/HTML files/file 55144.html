<p>You need to iterate on each line, parse and save the values in a class. Then provide a GUI to make the edits. When you are done rewrite the text file (or better serialize the class) from the class. I hope i understood and answered your question</p>

<p>I would suggest using XML, i simplifies everything, plus you already have the API to deal with serialization and deserilization</p>
