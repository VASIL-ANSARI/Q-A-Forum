<p>Have you seen the "System.Security.Principal.WindowsImpersonationContext"
and the demo written in MSDN.</p>

<p>Way back, in the .NET 1.1 days, I had to write a windows service for validation of users in 2 windows domains, used LDAP - and WindowsImpersonation as fail-back.</p>

<p>As I remember I got insperation form CodeProject and Google :-S</p>
