<p>The problem is when you are encoding to xml itself. HTML is parsing the values properly. For html &amp; is &amp;. Please check how you are encoding to xml. XML should not be having all those ascii chars.</p>

<p>basically your string is having the character '/'. when encoded it is getting converted to &#xD; for xml. This &#xD; is not known to html. Either when creating xml replace '/' with &sol; and when decoded html will automatically convert to '/'</p>
