<p>You're not doing anything wrong (at least at the code level it's rather conceptual) - json serializer just goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Product - serialize it, but wait - there is a category field, so serializer must serialize the category field</li>
<li>Category - serialize it, but wait - there is a products field, so serializer must serialize each of the product in the list</li>
<li>Product - because your collection contains the product &amp; product contains category it goes in a endless loop untill a timeout.</li>
</ol>

<p>You must use a view or just skip it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/12/02/latest-jackson-integration-improvements-in-spring" rel="nofollow"><code>@JsonView</code></a></p></li>
<li><p>Use a view as a POJO
Return <code>new ProductView</code> that has all fields of product and a reference (category) to <code>new CategoryView</code> (you can end at this point) that has collection of (products) <code>new ProductViewWithoutReferences</code>, and so on</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>@JsonIgnore</code> on a collection of products</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And as a side note - if it's a <code>@RestController</code> and you're invoking "all-products" then it's a bit unusual to return something else than a list. Wrapping the response in a map is redundant. Many rest clients expect a list when they invoke <code>list()</code> method.</p>
