<p>If you use a class in a header file, normally people will say "use a forward declaration".  However, this advice does not apply when creating subclasses.</p>

<p>The header file that declares the interface for <code>FeedDetailViewController</code> needs to <code>#import</code> the header for <code>FeedViewController</code></p>
