<blockquote>
  <p>A rope is a high performance replacement for Strings. The datastructure, described in detail in "<a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.9450&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" rel="nofollow">Ropes: an Alternative to Strings</a>", provides asymptotically better performance than both String  and StringBuffer  for common string modifications like prepend, append, delete, and insert. Like Strings, ropes are immutable and therefore well-suited for use in multi-threaded programming. </p>
