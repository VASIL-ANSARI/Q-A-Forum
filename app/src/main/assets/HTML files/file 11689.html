<p>All javascript code you want to use on a page has to be included in that page or dynamically loaded by that page.  You cannot call code that is only in another page.  </p>

<p>The usual way of sharing code among pages is to have a .js file that contains common code that is included in more than one page and then a .js file that contains code that is unique to each specific page (if required).</p>
