<p>Just a wild guess:</p>

<p>The 1st generation iPod touch doesn't <em>have</em> a speaker. So perhaps you cannot override the audio route to a non-existent speaker.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Oh, and only the latest (4th gen) iPod touch has a microphone built in. All other generations require that the headphones (with microphone) be plugged in to record. Maybe that's why it stopped working all of sudden, the headphones were removed.</p>
