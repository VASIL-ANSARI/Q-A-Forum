<p>I'm pretty certain that you can't use 64-bit DLLs in 32-bit Windows.</p>

<p>You can go the <em>other</em> way by using tricks like thunking or 32-bit subsystems like WoW64, but you don't have all the support for 64-bit code in the 32-bit version..</p>

<p>Hopefully your third party will continue to provide a 32-bit version of their DLL so you don't have to worry about it. If not, and you want to upgrade, you're going to need to go 64-bit as well.</p>
