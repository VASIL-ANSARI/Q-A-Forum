<p>SurfaceViews have two parts, the "surface" part and the "view" part.</p>

<p>The "view" part is a transparent hole that gets laid out with all the other views.  All of the views are composited onto a single layer.  The "surface" part is a completely separate layer that is rendered behind the view layer.  It has the same position and size as the "view" part, but appears behind <em>all</em> views.</p>

<p>If you need the "view" interaction to be a bit less weird, and you're using API 14 or later, you can use TextureView for your Camera preview instead.</p>
