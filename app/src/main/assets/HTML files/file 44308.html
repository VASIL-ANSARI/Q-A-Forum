<p>Instead of handling it in <strong>SQL*Plus</strong>, I would rather do it at <strong>OS level</strong>. In your scenario, you want to spool the file only if data exists. But, to do that, you need to check the <strong>COUNT</strong> of rows in the table, thus it is an overhead to the process.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I would:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let the spool happen always</li>
<li>Do a <strong>grep</strong> of the spool file to check the content</li>
<li><strong>Remove</strong> the file if no content found. <code>rm filename</code></li>
</ul>
