<p>It would be much easier to use native Facebook and G+ login. What you are trying to accomplish is much more complex than using native logins.</p>

<p>If you really, for some reason, must do it in a UIWebView, you would have to implement some strategy like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>override <code>-(BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType</code> method of <code>UIWebViewDelegate</code> protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>in your implementation, you should open the login interface in another modal UIWebView and handle login events there, and on the dismissal of that modal view, if login was successful continue with the app flow.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>-(BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType {

    NSURL *url = [request URL];

    //for facebook login
    if ([[url absoluteString] containsString:@"m.facebook.com"] &amp;&amp; [[url absoluteString] containsString:@"login"]) {

        // instantiate and present new modal UIViewController containing UIWebView that loads the url. 
        return NO;
    }

    //for G+ something similar

    return [super webView:webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:request navigationType:navigationType];

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the modal viewControllers for login would also have to implement the logic of how to handle the possible login events, and dismiss itself on success, which would be very complex.</p>

<p>The first webView would than also have to know when the modal is dismissed (can be done with protocol or some other way), and then check the login status, and proceed if successful.</p>

<p>So, as I said, it would be best if you used the native logins.</p>
