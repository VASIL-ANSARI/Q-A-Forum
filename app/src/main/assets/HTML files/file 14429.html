<p>If you are using gdb I assume you are using linux, right? Then you should install <code>libexerces-c++-dev</code> (or <code>libexerces-c++-devel</code> depending on your distribution) packet AND the source code. This would allow you to even set breakpoints in the xerces code.</p>

<p>I've been using xerces a lot in the past and when it crashes generally the problem is not in the library itself but in the "caller".
In your case I'd create a very trivial project using the external library, and try to parse a simple known-to-work XML file, because even if you can find the crash instructions I doubt it would help, given that xerces is used not directly by you but by another library</p>
