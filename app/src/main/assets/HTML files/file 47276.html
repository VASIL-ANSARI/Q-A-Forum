<p>Do not use regex delimiters:</p>

<pre><code>name = Regex.Replace(name, @"\W", "");
</code></pre>

<p>In C#, you cannot use regex delimiters as the syntax to declare a regular expression is different from that of PHP, Perl or JavaScript or others that support <code>&lt;action&gt;/&lt;pattern&gt;(/&lt;substituiton&gt;)/modifiers</code> regex declaration.</p>

<p>Just to avoid terminology confusion: <em>inline modifiers</em> (enforcing case-insensitive search, multiline, singleline, verbose and other modes) are certainly supported and can be used instead of the corresponding <code>RegexOptions</code> flags (though the number of possible <code>RegexOptions</code> flags is higher than that of inline modifiers). Still, <em>regex delimiters</em> do not influence the regex pattern at all, they are just part of declaration syntax, and do not impact the pattern itself. Say, they are just kind of substitutes for <code>;</code> or newline separating lines of code.</p>

<p>In C#, regex delimiters are not necessary and thus are not supported. Perl-style <code>s/\W//g</code> will be written as <code>var replaced = Regex.Replace(str, @"\W", string.Empty);</code>. And so on.</p>
