<p>I figured out a way that worked for me, I used a variable with global scope to store value of cookie. defined a method to check if cookie value is not same as that of variable, refresh the page.</p>

<p>But if you don't need to refresh the current page update the value of variable whenever you update cookie.</p>

<p>So basically i am refreshing other tabs but not my current tab. I know this is not the best way to do this, but it will do the job.</p>

<p>If you find something more efficient please post. </p>
