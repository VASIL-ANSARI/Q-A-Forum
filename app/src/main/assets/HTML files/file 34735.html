<p>Everything you need will be in the 4.42 SDK, however be aware that there will be features of the 4.42 SDK that won't be supported on Android 2.2 since the SDK is far newer than the target version of Android. This won't cause any problems however, as long as you don't try to implement any of the unsupported features.</p>
