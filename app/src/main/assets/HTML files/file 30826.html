<p>Mitch, I'm looking at this part:</p>

<pre><code>  success: function() {  
     $.growl({ title: "Success!", message: "Your answer was submitted successfully!" });
     $("#answerForm").find("input[type=text], textarea").val("");
     $("#conversation").hide().html(data).fadeIn('fast');
  } 
</code></pre>

<p>See the expression ".html(data)"??? Where is "data" being declared? The code above will never work.  Now, look at the lines below.  Particularly the first one.  See my change?</p>

<pre><code>  success: function(data) {  
     $.growl({ title: "Success!", message: "Your answer was submitted successfully!" });
     $("#answerForm").find("input[type=text], textarea").val("");
     $("#conversation").hide().html(data).fadeIn('fast');
  } 
</code></pre>

<p>Once you make this change, you need to use a debugger (chrome's or otherwise) to examine that what's coming back from your ajax call (which we don't have here) is what you need.  But first, fix the bug.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
