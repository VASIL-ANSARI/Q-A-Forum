<p>Yes and no. "Messages" are the Smalltalk and Objective-C terminology for method calls. The thing is, it's not only the terminology that differs, but the actual implementation too. There are 8 different possible combinations for matching the terminology, the syntax and the implementation, like this:</p>

<pre><code>+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
|    terminology    |        syntax        |   implementation   |
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
|  "method call"    | Simula (o.method())  |  static binding    | non-virtual C++ methods
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
|  "method call"    | Simula               |  dynamic binding   |
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
|  "method call"    | Smalltalk ([o meth]) |  static binding    |
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
|  "method call"    | Smalltalk            |  dynamic binding   |
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| "message passing" | Simula               |  static binding    |
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| "message passing" | Simula               |  dynamic binding   |
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| "message passing" | Smalltalk            |  static binding    |
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| "message passing" | Smalltalk            |  dynamic binding   | Objective-C
+-------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>The combination the language designer choses is just a matter of taste.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm still uncertain why the language designers would choose a messaging system over a more direct method calling system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it has some advantages, such as runtime interposition and introspection -- one can query and modify the behavior of classes, methods and objects at runtime. In the implementation of Objective-C, this have been done in a way such that it is very cheap, it has almost no overhead.</p>
