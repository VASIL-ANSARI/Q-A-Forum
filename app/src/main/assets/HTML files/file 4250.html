<p>PHP curl doesn't rely on a curl bin being available. (PHP supports curl by default since 4.0.2)</p>

<p>Your hosting provider just needs to make sure your PHP ini has <code>safe_mode</code> switched off.</p>

<p>But given the way the handled this (giving you a curl binary) it looks like you should use <code>exec()</code> to call it.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd recommend you find a better host.</p>
