<p>You don't want to divide <code>NOW()</code> by seconds per run -- you already did the division when you calculated that. You want to subtract.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE last_run &lt; DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL (time/package) SECOND)
</code></pre>

<p>Your calculation  in the EDIT using <code>UNIX_TIMESTAMP</code> is equivalent, so it should work.</p>
