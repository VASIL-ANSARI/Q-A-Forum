<p>I managed to get it working. It's all about Google Tag settings. There is a trigger which fires when you send an event like this</p>

<pre><code>dataLayer.push({
    'event':'GAevent', 
    'eventCategory':'Ad', 
    'eventAction':'click', 
    'eventLabel':'FJbanner'
});
</code></pre>

<p>trigger expression</p>

<pre><code>Event contain GAevent
</code></pre>

<p>so my error was that I didn't set it up correctly. You should specify an event name in a trigger settings according to Event variable value, 'GAevent' in my case</p>
