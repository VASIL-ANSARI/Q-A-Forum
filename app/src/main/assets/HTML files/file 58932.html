<p><code>proc.stdout</code> isn't available to be read <em>after the process exits</em>. Instead, you need to read it <em>while the process is running</em>. <code>communicate()</code> will do that for you, but since you're not using it, you get to do it yourself.</p>

<p>Right now, your process is almost certainly hanging trying to write to its stdout -- which it can't do, because the other end of the pipe isn't being read from.</p>
