<p>Both the problems you list seem to be problems with the XML file itself, not with the parsing code. The first one looks like there's an entity reference <code>&amp;D</code> without a matching <code>;</code> or something.</p>

<p>The second one probably means that the restriction applies to the <em>contents</em> of the <code>Item</code> element (the text between its opening <code>&lt;Item&gt;</code> and closing <code>&lt;/Item&gt;</code> tags), not to its attribute named <code>value</code>).</p>
