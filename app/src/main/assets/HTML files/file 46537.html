<p>This seens to work in the current development version of GIMP (compiled from GIT master) - if you are hang this behavior on the latest GIMP stable (2.8.14) you've hit a program bug.</p>

<p>However, this is a hacky way to draw a circle, even if it works (ok if you wnat to use it for other brushes rather than circular ones) - but for circles, you should instead: 
1) Make an ellipse selection centered on the image center and with radius min(width, layer)/2
2) Fill the selection.</p>
