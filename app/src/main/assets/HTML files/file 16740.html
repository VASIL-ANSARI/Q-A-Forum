<p>Yeah I see the same thing. Seems the only way to interact with udev_monitor_receive_device these days is with select/poll - I have a similar loop to you, and adding these lines before udev_monitor_recieve_device makes everything act sensible:</p>

<pre><code>int fd = udev_monitor_get_fd(mUdevMonitorObject);
fd_set fdset;
FD_ZERO(&amp;fdset);
FD_SET(fd, &amp;fdset);
if(select(fd+1, &amp;fdset, NULL, NULL, NULL) &lt; 0) {
    /* error in select */
    continue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would be nice if receive_device still blocked until there was data ready instead of making you do this dance, but there you go.</p>
