<p>Starting with IOS 7 you can have the str render itself into the current context. To do this import UIKit. This will extend the defenition of NSAttributedString with drawAtPoint: method. So for example you might do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[str drawAtPoint:CGPointMake(x,y)]
</code></pre>

<p>For more info about this and other related methods please see the following:
