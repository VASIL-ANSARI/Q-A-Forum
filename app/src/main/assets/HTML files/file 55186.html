<p>After spending many hours trying to work this out, I found that there was an out of date static library <code>libReactNativeControllers.a</code> in <code>build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator</code>. </p>

<p>Deleting <code>libReactNativeControllers.a</code> and rebuilding the project solved the issue. </p>

<p>It seems that the Pod static libraries are now being saved in their respective folders e.g. <code>build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/ReactNativeControllers/libReactNativeControllers.a</code></p>

<p>My guess is that the recent builds were saving the static lib in the subfolder, but the linker was picking up the out-of-date one. Anyone know why this might have changed recently? </p>
