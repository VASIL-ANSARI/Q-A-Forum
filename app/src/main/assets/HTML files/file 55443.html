<p>Your second link/circle has z-index of -5 which will always put it under anything else (unless you use an even lower z-index next to it). Make the second link/circle z-index at least 0, but defnitely higher than the other two circles; I used z-index: 2 in this case.</p>

<p>I recommend this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com" style="position: relative; left:-60px; z-index: 2"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And add css defining all the a hrefs as display: inline-block like this: </p>

<pre><code>a {
  display: inline-block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to do this is to create three divs and make them border-radius: 100%, that way their overlaps are actually circles, not the squares created by the a href and the png image inside.</p>
