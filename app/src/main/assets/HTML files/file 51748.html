<p>You can define the <code>UNITY_ANDROID</code> symbol (or <code>UNITY_EDITOR</code>, ecc..) following these steps (for Visual Studio 2015, but I think it is pretty similar to 2013):</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Solution Explorer (from Window menu or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>) </li>
<li>Right click on your project (should by csharp or csharp.editor if you are using Unity) and click <code>Properties</code> from the context menu (or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>)</li>
<li>Select the <code>Build</code> tab</li>
<li>Write <code>UNITY_ANDROID</code> (or whatever) in <code>Conditional compilation symbols</code> field</li>
<li>Save project or solution</li>
</ul>

<p>Now your code inside <code>#if UNITY_ANDROID ... #endif</code> shouldn't be grayed out anymore (and you should be able to use IntelliSense and all the other stuff).</p>
