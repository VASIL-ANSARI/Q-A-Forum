<p>I am a little unclear as to what you are trying to do specifically. But If you are trying to do what I think you are trying to, then you could use a variable.</p>

<p>For example, lets say you only want to have your font color red in IE. You could do something like this.. Although I don't see how using SASS would be all that beneficial in this use case, unless of course you are trying to do something different.</p>

<p><strong>SASS:</strong>

<pre><code>$ieEightAndNine: "\0/";
.container {
   color:unquote(red + $ieEightAndNine);
   width:100px;
   height:100px;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>CSS:</strong></p>

<pre><code>.container {
  color: red\0/;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>TEST IN CHROME VS IE:</strong></p>
