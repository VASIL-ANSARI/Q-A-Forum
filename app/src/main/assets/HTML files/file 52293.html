<p>Assuming you are talking about this line:</p>

<pre><code>Data d2 = d1;
</code></pre>

<p>A copy will happen regardless, since <code>d1</code> isn't an rvalue.</p>

<p>You can use this instead:</p>

<pre><code>Data d2 = std::move(d1);
</code></pre>

<p>In which case, a move will happen.  Your class will automatically get a move constructor since you haven't defined your own copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move assignment operator, or destructor.</p>
