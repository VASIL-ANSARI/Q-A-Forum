<p>You can generalise this problem as: I am including 3rd party JavaScript on my page and when I do it changes the presentation and/or behaviour of what was there without the 3rd party JavaScript.</p>

<p>Whether the Google Maps JS inclusion is causing the matter is not really possible to say.</p>

<p>It could be that the Google Maps JS is modifying the DOM which impacts your presentation. It could be that the Google Maps JS is conflicting with your JS. This could be due to poorly-written Google Maps JS. This could be due to your JS being poorly written.</p>

<p>There are too many factors to suggest a solution or even a single starting point.</p>

<p>You can try:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>removing your JS and see if the problem persists; if not, investigate in what way the affected content of your page is dependent on your JS and how your JS could be rewritten to not conflict with the Google Maps JS</p></li>
<li><p>examining the DOM with and without JS enabled and see in what ways the Google Maps JS could be modifying things</p></li>
<li><p>examining the applied styles on the affected content; how could your CSS be updated to compensate?</p></li>
</ul>
