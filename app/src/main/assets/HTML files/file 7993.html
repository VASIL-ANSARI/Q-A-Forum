<p>You need to create MeshLoader.h, and put something like this in it</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef INCLUDED_MESH_LOADER_H
#define INCLUDED_MESH_LOADER_H

char* FindTexturePath( char* TexturePath ,LPSTR FileNameToCombine);

#endif
</code></pre>

<p>And include that in your other cpp files.  Each of the cpp files just need the declaration of FindTexturePath to compile.  So whenever you need to make a function in a cpp public to other cpp files, create a .h file that has the function declarations in.</p>
