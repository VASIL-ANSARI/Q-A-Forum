<p>You are currently making no attempt to serialize the <code>data</code> array into a format that can be properly handled by both <code>$.ajax()</code> and your PHP script.  When you try to rely on jQuery's default object to query string conversion with code like this:</p>

<pre><code>data: {data:data},
</code></pre>

<p>jQuery expects <code>data</code> to be an object (i.e. key-value pairs) that it can serialize into a query string.  Passing a numerically indexed array as <code>data</code> is going to cause the conversion errors you are seeing.</p>

<p>You need to either properly create a serialized query string, or (and this would be my recommendation) since you are trying to pass a more complex data structure, you might consider JSON-encoding the data structure and POSTing to PHP with <code>application/json</code> header type.  This would require you to then read the raw POSTed data in PHP, not read the data from <code>$_POST</code>, as PHP does not populate the <code>$_POST</code> superglobal for content type headers other than the form-encoded types.</p>

<p>To send JSON, your ajax call might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>         $.ajax({
             type: "POST",
             url: "seatingProcess.php",
             contentType: "application/json",              
             data: JSON.stringify(data),
             success: function(msg){
                 console.log(msg); //testing the sql statements
             },
             error: function(){
                 alert('fail');                  
             }               
         })
</code></pre>

<p>In PHP you read the JSON from raw input like this:</p>

<pre><code>$postdata = file_get_contents("php://input");
$request = json_decode($postdata);
</code></pre>
