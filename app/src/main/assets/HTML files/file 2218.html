<p>Hard to know exactly what's going on without seeing the code that's throwing.  However, if you need to communicate dates to SQL Server, it is generally good practice to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="nofollow">ISO 8601</a> standard for representation because it is unambiguous and locale-independent.  The most important formats are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>yyyy-MM-dd</code> for dates</li>
<li><code>hh:mm:ss</code> for time</li>
<li><code>yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss</code> for date/time</li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is that you have a query that's sending over dates in the current locale, and the locale on the server does not match.</p>

<p>Edit: And for the record, this doesn't preclude anything that Rob said in his answer, i.e. try to avoid passing hard-coded dates or hard-coded SQL at all.  This only applies if you <em>need</em> to for some reason.</p>

<p>Edit 2: I've been informed that the <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code> format can <em>still</em> be wrong for some locales; so instead of this, if you need to pass in a literal date string, you should instead use <code>yyyyMMdd</code>.</p>
