<p>When you start to get complicated queries, sometimes you don't want to rely on doctrine to generate your sql code.  Not to mention the pain you are going through trying to convert an already working query to satisfy Doctrine.</p>

<p>In these cases, I would usually recommend running the queries as SQL instead of passing it through the doctrine query builder.  </p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/api/orm/1.2/doctrine/doctrine_rawsql.html" rel="nofollow">Doctrine_RawSql()</a></p>
