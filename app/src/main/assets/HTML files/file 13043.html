<p>Most probably you didn't install the right certificate on keychain, or you haven't added the device to the provisioning profile.</p>

<p>Here's a nice link that should help you (has a list of possible issues causing your problem): <a href="http://esscomp.co.uk/?tag=cssmerr_tp_not_trusted" rel="nofollow">http://esscomp.co.uk/?tag=cssmerr_tp_not_trusted</a></p>

<p>Search for <code>cssmerr_tp_not_trusted</code> on google and there's more.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Make sure you installed Apple WWDR certificate (you can download it from Apple Developer Portal, 'Certificates' section <code>*If you do not have the WWDR intermediate certificate installed, click here to download now.</code>). Make sure it doesn't also show up in keychain more than once.

<p>After you install/reinstall WWDR certificate check if your certificate still shows <code>This certificate was signed by an unknown authority</code>. If it doesn't try to build.</p>

<p>If you still have issues you'll most probably need to recreate the certificate, see <code>Certificates/How To</code> section from the provisioning portal for a nice tutorial on how to do this.</p>

<p>You should delete all your invalid certificates to prevent any conflict.</p>
