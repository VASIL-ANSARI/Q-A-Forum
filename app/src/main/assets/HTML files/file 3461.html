<p>Your widget most likely needs to resize itself to the full size to show its contents.  What is probably happening is that the minimum size you set is the only size it is getting, so it uses that.  I would suggest adding a layout to the widget to make it size dynamically based on its children, but I don't think that would work very well with draggable contents.</p>
