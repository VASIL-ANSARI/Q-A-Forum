<p>You're only looking at the numbers from 0 to 0. </p>

<pre><code>x = 0
even_count = 0
for n in xrange(x):
</code></pre>

<p>I think you mean <code>for num in xrange(n)</code>.</p>

<p>But if you want to input a list of numbers, which I think you do since you say the user should enter an arbitrary sequence of numbers, then you would just have:</p>

<p><code>for num in n</code></p>
