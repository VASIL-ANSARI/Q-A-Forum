<p>When a browser loads the script from the src attribute, it should follow all redirection links, in the same method it retrieves html, images, stylesheets, etc.  So the use case you've provided <em>should</em> work.</p>

<p>But since it's not working for you, you have got a couple options to resolve your problem.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/" rel="nofollow">fiddler</a> or a similar debugging proxy to see what's going on between your browser and the server.  Perhaps the 301 is malformed, or perhaps the mime-type is misconfigured, it could be any number of things.  Troubleshoot it the same way you'd troubleshoot any other issue where the browser isn't following redirects.</p>

<p>Or... instead of using redirects, you can use <code>mod_rewrite</code> (or a similar server-side URL rewriting tool) to modify the request for a particular version of a script to your canonical version.</p>
