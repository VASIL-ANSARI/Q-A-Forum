  <p>Another mysterious behavior is that when you double tap space, it
  doesn't add a period to the end. It replaces the last character with a
  period. So, "What" + space + space becomes "Wha."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not mysterious. That means that your <code>UITextView</code> uses <strong>autocorrection</strong>. 
Fix:</p>

<pre><code>UITextView *txtView; // your UITextView
[txtView setAutocorrectionType:UITextAutocorrectionTypeNo];
</code></pre>

<p>About spaces... as space is not a drawable symbol, your <code>UITextView</code> can't measure is size (width differs with different <strong>alignment</strong>), so your <code>UITextView</code>'s <code>contentSize</code> property won't be changed and behaves mysteriously. You should set <code>contentSize</code> <strong>manually</strong> (you can easily calculate size of your <code>NSString</code> with <code>sizeWithFont:</code> method).</p>
