<p>It seems that you're just trying to do some kind of inheritance; typically you do this by assigning a parent instance to the prototype of the child.</p>

<p>I think you will want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var SmallTank = (function () {
  function SmallTank(name) {
      Tank.call(this, name);
      this._weight = 2;
  }
  SmallTank.prototype = new Tank();

  return SmallTank;
}());
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively you can assign <code>Object.create(Tank.prototype)</code>. </p>
