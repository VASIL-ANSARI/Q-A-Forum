<p>The system is detecting a different version of Java.
Instead of Appending %DEV_TOOLS%\jdk6\bin to PATH, prepend it to PATH. Order matters.</p>

<p>To prepend Java without the variables, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>PATH=C:\Path\To\Java\bin;...
</code></pre>

<p>In your case you want something like:</p>

<pre><code>PATH=%DEV_TOOLS%\jdk6\bin;...
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, be sure DEV_TOOLS is defined</p>
