<p>You are probably creating those huge sized arrays locally and thus running out of stack space since it is limited.   </p>

<p>There are a few options to choose from:    </p>

<ul>
<li>Use a <code>std::vector</code> or</li>
<li>Declare them as global or static or</li>
<li>Use dynamic memory allocation using <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do use the last option make sure you use RAII through smart pointers and not raw pointers.</p>
