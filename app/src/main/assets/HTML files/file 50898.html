<p>I suppose the problem is that the web service called is sending the email on the <strong>same thread</strong> that the request is accepted. When the web page executing the javascript (acting as HTTP client) is submitted, the uncompleted <strong>HTTP request is interrupted</strong>. Therefore, the web service method does not execute and therefore the email is never sent. If the web service sends the email on another thread, the problem will probably be solved.</p>
