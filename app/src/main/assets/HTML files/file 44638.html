<p>In principle you could, but since Meteor uses Fibers you would have to wrap calls. I had to migrate some <code>sqlite3</code> data in the past and using a Fiber to wrap db calls worked. Was something like this</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var Fiber = Npm.require('fibers');

db.method('query', function(){
  Fiber(function(){
    // more queries
  }).run();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Or around the same idea, I would have to look at the code to be sure but that was around those lines.</p>
