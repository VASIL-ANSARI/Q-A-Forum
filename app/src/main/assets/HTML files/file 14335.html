<p>There's a series of four articles over on CodeProject which may be what you are looking for:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/24681/WPF-Diagram-Designer-Part-4" rel="nofollow">WPF Diagram Designer (including source)</a></p>

<p>This above is the final part in the series, the article links to the three earlier parts. Article is using .NET 3.5, however I believe the changes between .NET 3.5 and .NET 4.0 in WPF are minimal (assuming you are going to be developing in .NET 4.0).</p>
