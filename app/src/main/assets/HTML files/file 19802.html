<p>It was user error. I did not set the appropriate permissioning to get the status.  I had to include "frends_status" to the permissions array.</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)openSessionWithAllowLoginUI:(BOOL)allowLoginUI {
    NSArray *permissions = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:
                            @"user_likes",
                            @"read_stream",
                            @"friends_status",
                            nil];
</code></pre>
