<p>You can create the form to enter the values into a sql table. so, for instance you'd have a title text box, a content text box, and then a button. In your button action you will enter that data to the table. 
then you can create a navigation that for intance - to keep it very simple - does a select all titles from table name. you'll have these titles as your pages. so, upon clicking the title you'd have a script to bring up the details.
This is a very simple overview of how you can create pages.
since you said you are new I'd recommend going through some tutorials. I highly recommend plural sight <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/</a></p>

<p>hope this helps!</p>
