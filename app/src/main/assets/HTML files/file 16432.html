<p>If employees can only belong to one branch and branches can only be a child to one branch then you might consider adding a column to represent this information instead of whole new tables:</p>

<pre><code>employee // id | branchId | information
branch   // id | parentBranchId | information
</code></pre>

<p>If you have many to many relationships for employee/branch and branch/branch then I think your original structure is fine.</p>
