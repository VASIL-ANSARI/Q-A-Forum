<p>That is some stupid "security feature" one had to implement to avoid some careless people to display their database password on their websites (because they forgot to turn debug off).
So if the key "password", "schema" etc is in the array the value will be cloaked.</p>

<p>Just use pr(), var_dump(), print_r() or any other method that does not do that.</p>

<p>PS: you could have found that out taking a look at the code ( <a href="https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/lib/Cake/Utility/Debugger.php#L449" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/lib/Cake/Utility/Debugger.php#L449</a> )</p>
