<p>It's not about <code>vY.T</code>, but <code>vBeta</code>, i.e. <code>x</code> being passed by <code>fmin_bfgs</code> to <code>fnRSS</code> as not a 2d vector but a 1d array. So despite the fact you explicetely try to specify <code>x0=vBeta</code> to be an array of shape (5,1), it is converted internally to 1d array of shape (5, ), and in the end is returned as such.</p>
