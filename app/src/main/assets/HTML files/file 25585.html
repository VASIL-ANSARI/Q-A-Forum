<p>You're either setting <code>connexion</code> to <code>null</code> somewhere or not initializing it before you use it.</p>

<p>Most likely, one class is calling <code>Disconnect</code> which sets <code>connexion</code> to null, while another class assumes it's not null and tries to use it.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the comments, keeping a static reference to a resource like a <code>SqlConnection</code> is not a good idea.  If you want to re-use code you can create a static <em>function</em> that returns a <em>new</em> <code>SqlConnection</code> instance and make the <em>connection string</em> static, but having a static reference to a connection that's share across the entire web site will give you more problems that it's worth (as you're already seeing).</p>

<p>One way to do it in a static function would be:</p>

<pre><code>public static SqlConnection GetConnection()
{
    System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder builder = new System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectionStringBuilder();
    builder["Initial Catalog"] = "Upload";
    builder["Data Source"] = "base";
    builder["integrated Security"] = true;
    string connexionString = builder.ConnectionString;
    connexion = new SqlConnection(connexionString);

    return connexion; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your client code would then look something like:</p>

<pre><code>using (SqlConnection conn = Data.GetConnection())
</code></pre>
