<p>I don't think android has any in built view for this. But searching on net gave me two ways one is RealViewSwitcher, with little bit tweeking you could be using this </p>

<p>and the next is infinitepageviewer</p>

<p>If you have made this can you please let me know I am in process of writing similar thing for my app.</p>

<p>I tried both of these, the only problem I faced is dynamic creation of views, having said that there should be some way out using these I am till trying them. </p>
