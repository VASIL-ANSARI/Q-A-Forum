<p>Probably</p>

<pre><code>@subjects = Cartitem.find_all_by_cid(session[:customerid])
</code></pre>

<p>will work, because Rails documentation says, that line You gave:</p>

<pre><code>@subjects = Cartitem.find_by_cid(session[:customerid])
</code></pre>

<p>will actually call:</p>

<pre><code>Cartitem.find(:first, :conditions =&gt; ["cid = ?", session[:customerid]])
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think the solution with <code>to_a</code> (mentioned by user141146) will work at all because, object that is being returned is not an instance of any kind of QuerySet (e.g. like in Django) but pure model instance thus it probably wont has this method at all.</p>
