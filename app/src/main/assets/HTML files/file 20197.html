<p>Does the widget insert html code in your template, or is it an iframe? In the latter case you're screwed and you'll probably have to wait for google to fix it.</p>

<p>If it inserts html, you could always add a javascript/jquery snippet to the page, forcing the urls to do a "target='_blank'".</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$("#widget_id a").attr("target","_blank");
</code></pre>
