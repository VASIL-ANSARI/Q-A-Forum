<p>Yes you can. Grunt is completely independent of IDEs and texteditors and is a really helpful tool for all kinds of web development in any editor.</p>

<p>Grunt is described as âa node based javascript task runner with which you can automate tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting and moreâ. You can use it for example when you do not like to be dependent on an asp.net web server doing minification and bundling for you, or you simply like to be able to use tools that are not (yet) supported by the asp.net/Visual Studio ecosystem.</p>

<p>Here is all you need: <a href="http://joeriks.com/2013/08/06/can-i-benefit-from-grunt-for-my-visual-studio-based-web-development/" rel="nofollow">http://joeriks.com/2013/08/06/can-i-benefit-from-grunt-for-my-visual-studio-based-web-development/</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
