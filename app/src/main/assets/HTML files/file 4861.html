<p>Assuming that you are referring to OWASP CSRFGuard 2.x here (there is no library/framework called OWASP), the message referred to, is displayed when the incoming CSRF token is absent or different from the one expected (which is stored in the HttpSession object). The token itself is managed via a session cookie on the client side, having a default name of OWASP_CSRFTOKEN.</p>

<p>It would be a good thing to check for the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are cookies enabled in Safari?</li>
<li>Is the browser transmitting the CSRF token cookie on every request (after it has been initially set) to the server?</li>
<li>Has the server conveyed the session cookie containing the CSRF token to the client? And, is the server generating a CSRF token (utilizing a SHA1PRNG provider by default) when the first request is submitted by the client to the server? This is less likely to be a problem, given that there are no problems with MSIE and FF.</li>
</ol>
