<p>Try installing it locally:</p>

<pre><code>pip install --user -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<p>which would, I believe, install the file in a sub-directory of your <code>$HOME</code> directory (which your virtual env I would think would set). Otherwise I think you could just use:</p>

<pre><code>/path/to/virtualenv/pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
