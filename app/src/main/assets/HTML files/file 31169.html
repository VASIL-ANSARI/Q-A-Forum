<p>Turns out I was actually performing the segue twice only on the second time though. The problem was that using a NSNotificationCenter notification in a subview of the root view to tell the root view to segue, but not unregistering the observer such that when the root view returned I subscribed to the notification again. That meant that the segue ended up being called twice on the second time because the notification was received twice.</p>
