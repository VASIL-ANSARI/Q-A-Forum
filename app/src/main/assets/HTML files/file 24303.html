<p>Depending on where you have rvm installed, if you're using rvm.</p>

<p>If rvm is installed in your home directory:</p>

<p>In terminal, <code>echo $HOME</code>
this will return your home directory.</p>

<p><code>cd /whatever/returned</code> or <code>cd ~/.</code> will also change directory into your home directory</p>

<pre><code>ls -a
</code></pre>

<p>will list all directories.</p>

<pre><code>cd .rvm
cd gems
cd ruby-2.0.0-p195
cd gems
cd whatevergemname-version#
</code></pre>

<p>Find the file you are looking for inside of that gem and then <code>pwd</code> will display the current location.</p>

<p>It should look in your dependencies though, so maybe you have conflicts between ruby installations.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
