<p>I think you are asking if you can select records from three different tables by date for the columns they have in common?</p>

<p>If so, you need to do a union.</p>

<p>In your case it may look something like this in SQL. note that I have made a dummy column to denote the source of the record (which you may want)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Date, GrossPay, TaxAmount, NetPay, 'Table1' as Source FROM Table1
UNION
SELECT Date, GrossPay, TaxAmount, NetPay, 'Table2' as Source FROM Table2
UNION
SELECT Date, GrossPay, TaxAmount, NetPay, 'Table3' as Source FROM Table3
WHERE Date = '2013-05-05'
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't bother with a view and definitely don't replicate your data with a seperate table.</p>
