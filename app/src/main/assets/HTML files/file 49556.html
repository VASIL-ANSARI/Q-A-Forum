<p>In one file this variable should be define as is:</p>

<pre><code>  int N;
</code></pre>

<p>in others as <code>extern</code> (it is better to use header file to include such declaration), i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>  extern int N;
</code></pre>

<p>The directory structure is not important, just cpp files must be compiled together to allow linker resolving connections.</p>
