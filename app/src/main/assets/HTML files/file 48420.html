<p>In your require statement, you need to require the exact path of the library you're looking to import if it's not in the same folder, for example:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Cannot find module 'react-typeahead' from '/Users/xxx/code/xxx/app/assets/javascripts'
at /Users/xxx/code/xxx/node_modules/browserify/node_modules/resolve/lib/async.js:46:17
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how it's looking in app/assets/javascripts, point it towards your node_modules folder.</p>
