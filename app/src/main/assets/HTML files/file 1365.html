<p>You need to have a different app bundle identifier. I think that's your problem.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>

<p>Go into your projectname-info.plist file and change the CFBundleIdentifier.</p>

<p>I'd recommend something like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>com.mycompany.mycoolapp</strong> for the app store</li>
<li><strong>com.mycompany.mycoolapp-beta</strong> for the beta version</li>
</ul>

<p>You should actually be able to set up the "Debug" build configuration to use a different info.plist file configured with a different CFBundleIdentifier and a different icon filename. That way you'll automaticlly get the beta ID and icon, etc for the Debug build and the real id/icon for the full one.</p>

<p>This should allow users to install and use both the production and test versions of the apps at the same time without confusion.</p>

<p>You might also find this IPA target template helpful if you're doing ad-hoc distribution to Windows users for testing:</p>
