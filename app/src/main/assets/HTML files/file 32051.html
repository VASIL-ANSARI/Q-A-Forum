<p>so, thanks to msg7086 suggestion to have a look at the console, I tracked the error down to this particular server using <code>&amp;amp;</code> as opposed to  just <code>&amp;</code> when using http_build_query.</p>

<p>the fix for this appears to be using </p>

<pre><code>http_build_query($array,'','&amp;');
</code></pre>

<p>as opposed to just </p>

<pre><code>http_build_query($array);
</code></pre>

<p>maybe this helps someone</p>
