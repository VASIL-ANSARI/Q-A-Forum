<p>Note: I still need help but made progress.</p>

<p>The following code will add a plist array entry name "Hi" with children:
Item 0, test1
Item 1, test2</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableDictionary *plist = [[NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:databasePath] mutableCopy];
NSMutableArray *newArray = [[[NSMutableArray alloc] init] autorelease];
newArray = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"test1", @"test2", nil];
[plist setObject:newArray forKey:@"Hi"];
[plist writeToFile:databasePath atomically:YES];
[plist release];
</code></pre>

<p>I think making a dictionary item would work the same as the array item.
I am still not sure how to add entires into children though :/</p>
