<p>It is not clear what output you expect. But you can remove <code>MONTH(purchase_date)</code> from <code>GROUP BY country,MONTH(purchase_date)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT   COUNT( `country` ) as item,
     `country`,
     MONTH(purchase_date) AS Month,
     YEAR( purchase_date) AS year
FROM     charmy_purchase
WHERE    YEAR(purchase_date)='2012'
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country ASC
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you distinct countries. But it will give you also any month and year if there a more for one country. </p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>If you want the months and year to be listed in one row comma seperated then try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT   COUNT( `country` ) as item,
     `country`,
     group_concat(MONTH(purchase_date)) AS Months,
     YEAR( purchase_date) AS year
FROM     charmy_purchase
WHERE    YEAR(purchase_date)='2012'
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country ASC
</code></pre>
