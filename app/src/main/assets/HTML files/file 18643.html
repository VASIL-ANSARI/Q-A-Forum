<p>As I see it, there are two ways to do what you want. You could create a parent entity for User and Client and add it as a type to your index. Just take a look at Doctrine's <a href="http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/inheritance-mapping.html#single-table-inheritance" rel="nofollow">Inheritance Mapping</a>; I am not sure however if and how FOQ_ElasticaBundle handles these when persisting these entities in the index. This is just a pointer in the direction, I am not sure if this would work at all!</p>

<p>I would recommend the following approach: Searching the index instead of the type. You can use <code>foq_elastica.index_manager</code> to retrieve the index you want (website) and then build a query which uses the Type-filter to limit the results to your User and Client-Type.</p>
