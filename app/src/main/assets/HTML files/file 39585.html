<p>You should wrap your input on a div, position that DIV exactly where you want the text input to be, and then set the DIV to position relative. Also place your icon inside this DIV.</p>

<p>On another note, if you ICON is supposed to be clickable for submit purposes, dont use a span, either use a 'button' tag or an actual input-type:submit </p>
