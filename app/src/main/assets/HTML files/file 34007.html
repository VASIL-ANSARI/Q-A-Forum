<p>You won't solve this problem by "grabbing a pointer to a specific driver". You need to locate the specific buffer used by the keyboard driver that resides on top of the USB driver. </p>

<p>You will have to actually grok the keyboard and USB drivers for Windows. At least part of which is probably available if you have a DDK (driver development kit) [aka WDK, Windows Driver Kit]. You will definitely need a graphics driver for this part of the project. </p>

<p>You will also have to develop a driver mechanism to map an arbitrary (kernel) lump of memory to your graphics driver - which means you need access to the source code for the graphics driver. (In theory, you could perhaps hack about in the page-tables, but Windows itself isn't too keen on software messing with the page-tables, and you'd definitely need to be VERY careful if the system is SMP, since modifying page-tables in an SMP system requires that you flush the TLB's of the "other" CPU(cores) in the system after updates). </p>

<p>To me, this seems like a rather interesting project, but a really tough one in a closed source system like Windows. At least in Linux, the developer has the source-code to read. When it comes to Windows, most of the relevant source code is completely unavailable (unless your school has special license to the MS Source code - I think there are some that do). </p>
