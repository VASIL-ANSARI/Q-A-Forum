<p>I believe that your issue is that because your delegate is declared as a weak var, your delegate is getting disposed while you wait for the timer to complete, thus the reference to the optional is lost (and returns nil when you force unwrap it).</p>

<p>try removing the weak keyword from your CustomView class.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to use the notification center to notify your view to call for the segue.</p>

<p>Something along the lines of what I proposed <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/37690477/5229157">here</a></p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
