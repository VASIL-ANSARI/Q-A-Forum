<p>I found a way around the problem. I put the .pem file in the project directory and added the extension to the .gitignore.  Then I can just use the other deployment method:</p>

<pre><code>~/google_appengine/appcfg.py update my/app/location
</code></pre>

<p>Google wasn't my only repository so this isn't a problem to stop using push to deploy.</p>
