<p>Your ratingImageView uses autoresizing masks to resize and position itself when you are not using AutoLayout. By default this means that the distance to the left and top is fixed and the size won't change.</p>

<p>When you toggle a cell to edit the contentView moved and resizes but your ratingImageView stays fixed to the top and left. You can visualize this by temporarily (for learning purposes) set a background color to the cells contentView and see how it resizes as you edit and delete the cell.</p>

<p>What you want is for your rating view to stay a fixed distance from the right edge instead of the left. You can either change this in InterfaceBuilder (where you do your XIBs or Storyboard) or in code by setting the autoresizingMask property of the ratingImageView.</p>

<p>Change the autosizing like this</p>

<p>Or do it in code</p>

<pre><code>// in code you specify what should be flexible instead of what should be fixed...
[ratingImageView setAutoresizingMask:UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin];
</code></pre>
