<p>Hide the status bar in your LMHomeViewController xib file.</p>

<p>In your info.plist set "Status bar is initially hidden" to YES.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that your LMHomeViewController get "rendered with a status bar" and then you add this view to a view without a status bar, so there is a 20 px gap.</p>
