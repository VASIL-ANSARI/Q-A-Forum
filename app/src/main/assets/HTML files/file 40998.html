<p>Division by 0 gives out infinity when using floats or doubles.</p>

<p>You could add an additional check to see if 0 miliseconds is elapsed
and in that case not calculate the value. At Time = 0, since nothing is downloaded
yet the value is probably not useful to the user.</p>

<p>You could also add unit tests by passing a class that implements an interface with the right
methods to simulate the call to back.ReportProgress such as:</p>

<pre><code>private void CalculateDownload(int ln, IBackgroundWorker backw)
</code></pre>

<p>to figure out what happens at Time = 0, Time = 1 and so on.</p>

<p>Finally that line:</p>

<pre><code>int dnsize = ln;
</code></pre>

<p>is not useful since you already have the variable passed to your function</p>
