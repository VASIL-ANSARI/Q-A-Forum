<p>Sounds like you want a non-rectangular 2-dimensional array.  You'll want to avoid defining the second dimension on your 2D array.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>final Path path = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("src/main/resources/csvfile");
final List&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.readAllLines(path);

final String[][] arrays = new String[lines.size()][];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; lines.size(); i++) {
    arrays[i] = lines.get(i).split(",");
}
</code></pre>

<p>All lines are read into a List so that we know the first dimension of the 2D array.  The second dimension for each row is determined by the result of the split operation.</p>
