<p>Open your output file as a binary file.  Otherwise writing into that file will convert LF to CR/LF automatically.</p>

<pre><code>tempfile = open(tempFilePath, 'wb')
</code></pre>

<p>That of course is only necessary on Windows systems.  Unixes won't convert anything, regardless whether a file has been opened as text or as binary file.</p>

<p>You should take care when uploading as well that you don't get such-like corrupted data into S3 in the first place.</p>
