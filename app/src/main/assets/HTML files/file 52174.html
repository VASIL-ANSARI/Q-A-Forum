<p>The excess whitespace is a function of the <code>height</code> that you've chosen. Your image is roughly 5 times as wide as it is tall, but you've asked to render it in a box that 80 x 45 pts (i.e. a view whose height is over half the width, rather than one fifth). If you pick the dimensions of the image view to match (adjusting for scale) the size of the image, you get something more like:</p>

<p>As you can see, with judicious selection of the width and height, there will be less whitespace than in your example. Note, there is some inherent whitespace between the detail accessory view that you cannot control, but by making sure you set the width and height correctly, you can reduce it to these minimal values.</p>
