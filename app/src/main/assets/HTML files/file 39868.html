<p>The 'u' indicates that the format of the string is unicode.  When you print a list, it's going to include that tag to indicate the string format.  If you were to run the following code:</p>

<pre><code>for lugar in agloms:
    print lugar
</code></pre>

<p>the output would be</p>

<pre><code>BAHIA BLANCA
CIPOLLETTI
CONCORDIA
FORMOSA
GRAN CORDOBA
</code></pre>
