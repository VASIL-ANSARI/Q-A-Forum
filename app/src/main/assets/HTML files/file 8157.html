<p>The second one would be more efficient as it just has one predicate to evaluate against each item in the collection where as in the first one, it's applying the first predicate to all items first and the result (which is narrowed down at this point) is used for the second predicate and so on. The results get narrowed down every pass but still it involves multiple passes.</p>

<p>Also the chaining (first method) will work only if you are ANDing your predicates. Something like this <code>x.Age == 10 || x.Fat == true</code> will not work with your first method.</p>
