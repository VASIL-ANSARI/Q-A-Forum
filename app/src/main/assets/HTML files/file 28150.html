<p>Why you don't read the value directly where you need it?
In this case you wouldn't need to store anything in the "selectedValue" variable. Something like: </p>

<pre><code>cmd.Parameters["@stock"].Value = 
   ((DropDownList)FindControl("drpList")).SelectedValue;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: I added the cast to DropDownList.</p>
