<p>Straight to your question - here you are sure about creating your <code>Order</code> instance so you don't have to check for <code>nil</code>. But in other cases you will have to check for <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>What bothers me here is that you will have a <em>retain cycle</em>. So what you can make to avoid retain cycles is to keep weak reference to the <code>Order</code> instance inside your <code>Product</code> class (an order should always have a product but a product can go without an order). Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Product {
    weak var order: Order?
}
</code></pre>
