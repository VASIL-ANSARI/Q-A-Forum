<p>I feel as though you've made this harder than it needs to be.  Don't fight the framework, it's here to help!</p>

<p>First, for your join table, use the standard Rails naming convention:  order the models alphabetically.  If you roll back a bit, rather than create three migrations for one action, why not:</p>

<p><code>rails g migration callouts_users callout_id:integer user_id:integer</code></p>

<p>That coupled with <code>has_and_belongs_to_many</code> relations in your models and you should be good to go.</p>
