<p>IVH Treeview allows you to <a href="https://github.com/iVantage/angular-ivh-treeview#selectdeselect-handlers" rel="nofollow">provide an expression</a> to be run whenever a node is selected or deselected by the user:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller="MyCtrl as fancy"&gt;
  &lt;div
    ivh-treeview="fancy.bag"
    ivh-treeview-on-cb-change="fancy.otherAwesomeCallback(ivhNode, ivhIsSelected, ivhTree)"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/febexe/edit?html,js,output" rel="nofollow">Here's a full example</a>. If you only wanted to perform an action for leaf nodes you could perhaps have <code>otherAwesomeCallback</code> check that <code>ivhNode</code> is a leaf before doing anything else.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work you might consider using <code>ivhTreeviewBfs</code> to create watchers on leaf nodes yourself:</p>

<pre><code>ivhTreeviewBfs(myTree, function(node) {
  if(!node.children) {
    $scope.$watch(function() { return node.selected; }, function() {
      console.log('oh snap a leaf node changed!');
    });
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>That's untested and not great practice, I would 100% stick the the former solution if possible. Also, be mindful that if a node becomes a leaf or stops being a leaf later on you would need to handle that too. Depending on your use case you might consider just putting change handlers on the checkboxes themselves too.</p>

<p>In short though, IVH Treeview does not have any particular </p>
