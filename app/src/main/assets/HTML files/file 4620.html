<p>The entityManager is conversation-scoped. If you do not start a conversation (with <code>@Begin</code>) in a request, Seam closes the entityManager after the request. Outjecting the entity into the session scope doesn't help because the entityManager closes anyway.</p>

<p>To prevent Seam to close the entityManager you either use an extended persistence context as you mentioned yourself or work with a conversation-scoped component. Depending on the context of your component, and subsequent calls respectively, using the conversation scope might not be appropriate.</p>

<p>If you outject the entity to the session scope. You can re-attach it to the new entityManager in subsequent calls by using <code>entityManager.find(.)</code> or <code>entityManager.getReference(.)</code>.</p>
