<p>At the top of  <code>- (NSManagedObjectContext *)managedObjectContextChild</code> put a breakpoint and see where else that <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> is being used. </p>

<p>The error is telling you that it already has a persistent store coordinator, so that's your line of attack. </p>

<p>You are accessing these as single instances so the other areas of the application need to know what to do with them (and what not to do!). You could also inspect <code>persistentStoreCoordinator</code> and <code>parentContext</code> property just before the error to help get a picture of what's happening. </p>

<p>It's nothing terrible and shouldn't be too difficult to find with a couple of sensibly placed breakpoints, however you may have to think about how you manage the various contexts more carefully to solve the issue.</p>
