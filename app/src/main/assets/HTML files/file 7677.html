<p>No.  The only way to do this is to request the HTML for the page, render the page and then create a thumbnail from that page render.  Google does this because in the process of spidering the web, they already get all that data, and they've got a nice optimized rendering engine (Chrome) that they can put the data through, and then they've got tons of online storage space to store the cached image.  There's a lot of work there, though.</p>
