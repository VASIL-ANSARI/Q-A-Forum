  <p>How do I access the data in my Home controller action ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By writing a view model of course:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyViewModel
{
    public DateTime Time { get; set; }
    public decimal OldValue { get; set; }
    public decimal? NewValue { get; set; }
    public string Action { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then having your controller action take a collection of this view model as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
public ActionResult TableEdit(IList&lt;MyViewModel&gt; data)
{
    ... do something with the view model here
}
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, beware of the format of DateTime fields. Make sure that your application's current culture settings format matches the one in your JSON. You also might need to adjust the data types used in your view model depending on your specific requirements.</p>
