<p>initialize your <code>x</code> variable to global meaning initialize it outside your method
,don't keep on initializing it inside your <code>runthread()</code> method , you will always get x=0 for that.</p>

<p>and in your last condition,change it to this</p>

<p><code>if(x==10){x=0;}</code></p>

<p>and also</p>

<p>place your timer in onWindowsFocusChanged() override that method</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onWindowFocusChanged(boolean hasFocus) {
super.onWindowFocusChanged(hasFocus);
   Timer Tim=new Timer();
   Tim.schedule(new TimerTask() 
   {   @Override
       public void run() 
       {    runthread();   }
    },1000,1000);
}
</code></pre>

<p>because onWindowsFocusChanged() signifies that your layout has been loaded properly, that's the time you can manipulate your Imageview.</p>
