<p>You could write the server side application in Node JS or whatever other server side language you prefer - and implement that using REST services. Then in your Java desktop application, it would just communicate with the server using HTTP REST / SOAP etc.</p>

<p>That way if you were to then want to swap to use something like .NET to make your desktop application you would be free to do so without it changing anything on the server side. Also you would be able to implement a mobile application / tablet app / other web application and reuse all of the server side implementation easily without changing anything server side.</p>

<p>Another option is to use ServerSocket for the Java server side, and then connect to that from the client but you seem to know and dislike that option.</p>

<p>Another option to connect each side of the application would be to use some kind of pub / sub middleware messaging service - check out JMS as a framework - you will need some kind of implementation of JMS such as Active MQ, Websphere MQ or one of the many other free implementations.

<p>Difficult question to answer, but those are 3 high level options.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use web technologies to connect client to server HTTP REST, or SOAP</li>
<li>Use ServerSockets and Socket connections and do everything manually</li>
<li>Use a messaging framework such as JMS</li>
</ol>
