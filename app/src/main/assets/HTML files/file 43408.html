<p>Wouldn't it just something like:</p>

<pre><code>db.Employees.Select(m =&gt; new { Employee = m, Company = m.Company });
</code></pre>

<p>As each employee has a Company, why don't just add navigation property "Company" to Employee entity?</p>

<p>To get vacations, just change it to the following:</p>

<pre><code> db.Employees.SelectMany(
 employee =&gt; employee.VacationDays, 
 (employee, vacationDay) =&gt; new 
  { 
      Employee = employee, 
      Company = employee.Company, 
      VacationDay = vacationDay 
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>Actually, there is no difference between:</p>

<pre><code>(from c in db.Companies
 from e in c.Employees
 select new { Employee = e, Company = c}).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>(from e in c.Employees
 from c in db.Companies
 select new { Employee = e, Company = c}).ToList();
</code></pre>
