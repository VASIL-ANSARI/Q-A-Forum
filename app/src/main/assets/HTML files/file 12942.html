<p>I don't know if this is the only error, but at least, <code>setTimeout</code> needs a function (or a string, but let's not go there), not an result of invocation (unless the result is a function or a string... you get the drift)... so,</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function() { $(slide[i]).removeClass('show') }, 500);
</code></pre>

<p>(actually it would be prettier if refactored out into a variable, but works for illustrating contrtast)</p>
