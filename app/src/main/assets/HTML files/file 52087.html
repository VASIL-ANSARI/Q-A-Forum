<p>Same problem i have faced my app rejected due to we are getting phone number and email id like that.</p>

<p>What you have to do now is ,reply them like this .</p>

<p>1.To contact customer we are getting user information ,there is no illegal purpose in it.</p>

<p>like that you need to explain about your app.</p>

<p>Don't worry they rejected your app for getting information about your app purpose ,explain it clearly .</p>
