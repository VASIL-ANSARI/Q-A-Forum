<p>In version 2.x, Connection events return Task taking an input parameter of bool stopCalled.  You simply need to update your method to return task, which is returned by base.OnDisconnected(stopCalled).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/guide-to-the-api/hubs-api-guide-server#onreconnected">Documentation</a></p>

<pre><code>public override Task OnDisconnected(bool stopCalled)
{
    // Add your own code here.
    // For example: in a chat application, mark the user as offline, 
    // delete the association between the current connection id and user name.
    return base.OnDisconnected(stopCalled);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I believe the current SignalR documentation may actually erroneously be advising you to use OnDisconnected() without a bool stopCalled parameter.  However, looking at the source for HubBase (which Hub inherits from), you can find the OnDisconnected method declared as the following in 2.x.</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Called when a connection disconnects from this hub gracefully or due to a timeout.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="stopCalled"&gt;
/// true, if stop was called on the client closing the connection gracefully;
/// false, if the connection has been lost for longer than the
/// &lt;see cref="Configuration.IConfigurationManager.DisconnectTimeout"/&gt;.
/// Timeouts can be caused by clients reconnecting to another SignalR server in scaleout.
/// &lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;A &lt;see cref="Task"/&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public virtual Task OnDisconnected(bool stopCalled)
{
    return TaskAsyncHelper.Empty;
}
</code></pre>
