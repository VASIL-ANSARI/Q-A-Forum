<p>I suspect you are running into an error as a result of using floating-point precision. The way to fix this is to use <code>NSDecimalNumber</code> instead of <code>NSNumber</code>. There's a great post about this <a href="http://www.cimgf.com/2008/04/23/cocoa-tutorial-dont-be-lazy-with-nsdecimalnumber-like-me/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><code>NSDecimalNumber</code> has a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDecimalNumber_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSDecimalNumber/decimalNumberWithString%3a" rel="nofollow"><code>+ decimalNumberWithString:</code></a> method. Would that suffice for your purposes?</p>
