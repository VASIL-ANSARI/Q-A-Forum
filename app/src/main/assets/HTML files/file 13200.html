<p>You can't set custom actions on back buttons. (Or, rather the action of the back button item is set to a internal one that does the back-behaviour.) If you want to do something when the user comes back to your view controller, consider doing it in <code>viewWillAppear:</code>. You might need to keep track of whether you're appearing after pushing a child view controller or appearing the first time, etc.</p>
