<p>Assuming you  just want to iterate through the result object, instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>$(result).each(function(index, item) {
</code></pre>

<p>I think you probably want:</p>

<pre><code>$.each(result, function(index, item) {
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If that still doesn't get you where you want, then add a</p>

<pre><code>console.log(result);
</code></pre>

<p>to examine exactly what the result of the ajax call is and make sure you have exactly the data you expected and that you're iterating the right part of it.</p>
