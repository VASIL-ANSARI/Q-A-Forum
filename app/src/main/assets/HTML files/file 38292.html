<p>The regex is only considering word characters whereas your input <code>String</code> contains a colon <code>:</code>. You can solve this by replacing <code>\\w</code> with <code>\\S</code> (any non-whitespace character) in your regex. Also there is no need for two patterns.</p>

<pre><code>String regex = "@\\S*";
</code></pre>
