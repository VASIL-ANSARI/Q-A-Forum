<p>The <code>system</code> function doesn't support stdio-style formatting codes such as <code>%s</code>. You need to pre-create the command string using a call that does understand them, such as <code>snprintf</code>, and pass the result to <code>system</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>char command[256];
snprintf(command, sizeof command, "touch -am -t 200005050000 %s", file);
system(command);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this approach (as well as your original attempt) will fail to work for files whose names contain whitespace or quoting characters. To operate on such files, you should either surround the file name with quotes, or switch to less portable low-level process creation APIs, such as <code>execlp</code> on Unix-like systems.</p>
