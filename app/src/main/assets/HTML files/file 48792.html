<p>I figured out that it was a react-native issue.  If you are loading a @aar dependency in a package you also need to declare it as a repository in
<code>android/build.gradle</code>
in the block </p>

<pre><code>allprojects {
  repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    jcenter()
    DESIRED_REMOTE_REPO_HERE
  }
}
</code></pre>
