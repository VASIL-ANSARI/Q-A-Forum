<p>I would suggest you look at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-java/" rel="nofollow">OWASP-ESAPI</a> project, but the basic principles are as follows</p>

<ul>
<li>never trust input from the user
<ul>
<li>lets say you need a number, then you would validate that number to ensure it is a number, otherwise reject it, this ensures that only numbers come through</li>
<li>if you need a title say, then you can already restrict to <code>[A-Za-z]{2,4}</code> for example.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>always encode output
<ul>
<li>anything that comes from the database/user should be encoded properly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
