<p>Unless you have a compelling reason to use an iframe, don't. Typically, you would redirect to the application after successful login. You can set the <code>defaultUrl</code> in Web.config, which is the page to go to after successful login by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ka5ffkce%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;
    &lt;forms defaultUrl="Default.aspx" loginUrl="Login.aspx" timeout="20" protection="None" cookieless="UseCookies"/&gt;
&lt;/authentication&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you're going for a single-page app, call a login method via Web API and alter the page accordingly with JavaScript. Make sure no sensitive data is loading before authentication.</p>
