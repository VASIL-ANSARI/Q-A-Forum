<p>Because standard library algorithms are supposed to work for arbitrary ranges of (compatible) iterators. So the first argument to <code>accumulate</code> doesn't have to be <code>begin()</code>, it could be any iterator between <code>begin()</code> and one before <code>end()</code>. It could also be using reverse iterators.</p>

<p>The whole idea is to decouple algorithms from data. Your suggestion, if I understand it correctly, requires a certain structure in the data.</p>
