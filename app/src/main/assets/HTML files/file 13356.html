<p>You can tell the current heap size for Sesame by accessing the Sesame server via a browser (e.g. <a href="http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/</a> ) and clicking 'System' in the left-hand menu. It will show the memory currently in use and the maximum heap size.</p>

<p>To increase the heap size, the easiest way is just to allocate a larger heap to Tomcat itself. Have a look at the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/FAQ/Memory" rel="nofollow">Tomcat FAQ entry</a> on how to do that, or do a Google search, there's tons of helpful Howtos on this topic (<a href="http://www.techiepark.com/tutorials/how-to-increase-heap-size-for-tomcat/" rel="nofollow">here's one</a>).</p>
