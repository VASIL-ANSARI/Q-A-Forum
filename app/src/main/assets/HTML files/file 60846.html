<p>Zeppelin has introduced a synchronous API to run a paragraph in its latest yet to be releases 0.7.0 version. You can clone the latest code form their repo and build a snapshot yourself. URL for API is <a href="http://[zeppelin-server]:[zeppelin-port]/api/notebook/run/[notebookId]/[paragraphId]" rel="nofollow">http://[zeppelin-server]:[zeppelin-port]/api/notebook/run/[notebookId]/[paragraphId]</a>. This will return output of the paragraph after it has run completely.</p>
