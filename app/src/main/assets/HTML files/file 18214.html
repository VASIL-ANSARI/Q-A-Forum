<p>AChartEngine makes the visible area based on the data points that are added to your dataset by default. When there is no point added, there is no visible area, when there is one single point, the minimum and the maximum visible range are equals. This changes only when adding more than one point and now it is able to display labels.</p>

<p>However, you can manually set the visible area and you will probably get visible labels:</p>

<pre><code>renderer.setXAxisMin(minXValue);
renderer.setXAxisMax(maxXValue);
renderer.setYAxisMin(minYValue);
renderer.setYAxisMax(maxYValue);
</code></pre>
