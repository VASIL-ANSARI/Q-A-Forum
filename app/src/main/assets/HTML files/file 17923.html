<p>You can use <code>dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion</code>, from the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIViewController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIViewController/dismissViewControllerAnimated%3acompletion%3a" rel="nofollow">iOS Developer</a> docs</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:</p>
  
  <p>Dismisses the view controller that was presented by the receiver.
  - (void)dismissViewControllerAnimated:(BOOL)flag completion:(void (^)(void))completion Parameters</p>
  
  <p>flag</p>

<pre><code>Pass YES to animate the transition. completion

A block called after the view controller has been dismissed.
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Discussion</p>
  
  <p>The presenting view controller is responsible for dismissing the view
  controller it presented. If you call this method on the presented view
  controller itself, it automatically forwards the message to the
  presenting view controller.</p>
  
  <p>If you present several view controllers in succession, thus building a
  stack of presented view controllers, calling this method on a view
  controller lower in the stack dismisses its immediate child view
  controller and all view controllers above that child on the stack.
  When this happens, only the top-most view is dismissed in an animated
  fashion; any intermediate view controllers are simply removed from the
  stack. The top-most view is dismissed using its modal transition
  style, which may differ from the styles used by other view controllers
  lower in the stack.</p>
  
  <p>If you want to retain a reference to the receiverâs presented view
  controller, get the value in the presentedViewController property
  before calling this method.</p>
  
  <p>The completion handler is called after the viewDidDisappear: method is
  called on the presented view controller. Availability</p>

<pre><code>Available in iOS 5.0 and later.
