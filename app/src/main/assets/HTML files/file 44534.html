<p>It's a litle complex. You can send the from fields to server to save as a 'draft' when the form fields changed.</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<pre><code>setInterval(autoSave, 1000);
function autoSave() {
    if form is changed {
        use ajax to post form fields to server to save as a draft
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>when user reloads the page, fill the form fields with your saved draft.</p>
