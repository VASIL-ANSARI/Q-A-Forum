<p>This sounds like a bad url in the src attribute of the image. right click the broken image icon and inspect it (most, if not all browsers support this) and see where the url leads. </p>

<p>Fixing url, try one of the following:</p>

<p>Try adding a / in front of your image links</p>

<p>Try including the full path on the image including the http, also you can try excluding the http and writing //yourwebsite.com/images/foo.jpg instead and see if that fixes things.</p>

<p>If you work on some framework there is bound to be a base url variable which you can use instead of manually writing the url</p>
