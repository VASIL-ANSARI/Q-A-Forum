<p>The documentation of PhoneGap tells you exactly how to access the Accelerometer:</p>

<p>Using the code snippets provided on this website, you can define different offsets that qualify as slow, medium and fast shaking. Tweak the numbers by playing around with the demo code and your device to get a feeling what acceleration of the different x,y and z axis you feel is adequate for your purpose.</p>
