<p><code>RKRoute</code> objects are used for requests so they play no part in processing the response data.</p>

<p>Your response descriptor has an individual mapping: <code>@"responseError" : @"responseError"</code> - this would be used if you were mapping the response direct into a dictionary: <code>@property (copy, nonatomic) NSDictionary *responseError;</code>.</p>

<p>As you want to map the response into an <code>RKResponseError</code> instance you need to create another mapping for that class and use <code>addRelationshipMappingWithSourceKeyPath:@"responseError" mapping:responseErrorMapping</code> to connect the new mapping to the 'outer' mapping.</p>

<p>Finally, note that <code>RK</code> is the naming prefix for RestKit and you should use a different prefix for classes that you create yourself.</p>
