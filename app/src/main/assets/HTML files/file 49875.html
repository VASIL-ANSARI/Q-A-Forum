<p>The problem is that you keep assigning the same list to the new variables that you generate so <code>random.shuffle</code> just shuffles the original list over and over. You should make a copy first.</p>

<pre><code># randomize lists
for j in range(1,l):
    t = targets_null[:]
    random.shuffle(t)
    globals()["targets"+str(j)] = t
    jj = jitter_null[:]
    random.shuffle(jj)
    globals()["targets"+str(j)] = jj
</code></pre>

<p>Using globals like this is awkward. You could just use lists. Assuming you want to associate jitter with target you can put them together in a tuple.</p>

<pre><code># randomize lists
targets = []
for _ in range(1,l):
    t = targets_null[:]
    random.shuffle(t)
    j = jitter_null[:]
    random.shuffle(j)
    targets.append((t,j))
</code></pre>
