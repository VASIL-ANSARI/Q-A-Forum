<p>You can retrieve the selected value in your controller since you are using ng-model="FIELD" in your select.</p>

<p>So if you want to get the value in your controller you can use:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.FIELD // FIELD can be location, phase, facility, etc
</code></pre>

<p>This variable will store the value of the selected option of each select.</p>
