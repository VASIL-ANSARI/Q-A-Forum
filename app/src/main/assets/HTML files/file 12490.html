<p>There are a few issues with your code. First of all, you should consider using NSString instead of NSMutableString because it should be faster. Second, why are you putting the dictionary object in a string then calling the dictionary object again in the next line? That first line is unnecessary. It's entirely possible that the dictionary entry is not a string, and that is why you are having issues. You should write it like this <code>NSString *textnamed = (NSString *)[dictionary objectForKey:key1]</code>. Also, <code>imageNamed</code> can only be used for files in the file bundle. Are you sure those pictures are stored there? There are a few other issues you could be having. What exactly is going wrong here?</p>
