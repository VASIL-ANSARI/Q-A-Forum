<p>Turns out, I was exceeding the number of controls allowed in a single postback. </p>

<p>You can read about it here:</p>

<p>I used this web.config setting to increase it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;appSettings&gt;
    &lt;add key="aspnet:MaxHttpCollectionKeys" value="2000" /&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whether I should be using that many controls is an entirely different question. :)</p>

<p>I figured this out by removing other content on my page. When I did, it started to work again.</p>

<p>This nearly drove me to the brink of insanity. Hooray!</p>
