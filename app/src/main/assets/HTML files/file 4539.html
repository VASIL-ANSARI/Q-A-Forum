<p>First you need to get the point where you first touched the screen. Then for each 'touch moved' get the delta x and y coordinates for the new point and move the image by that amount. </p>

<pre><code>// This is untested code and I can't even be sure if it compiles
// Hopefully it is verbose enough to help you with that you are
// Trying to do. If not I can update once I get back infront of 
// a Mac.
- (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
    lastPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view];
    CGPoint delta = currentPoint - lastPoint;

    currentViewLoc = imageView.center;

    imageView.center.x = currentViewLoc.x - delta.x;
    imageView.center.y = currentViewLoc.y - delta.y;

    currentPoint = lastPoint;
}

- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
{
    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; 
    currentPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view];
}
</code></pre>

<p>something like that anyway. I hope you get the idea of what I am trying to say.</p>
