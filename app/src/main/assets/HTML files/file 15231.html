<p>Warning: the Java Tutorials on sound aren't the easiest read.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/accessing.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/accessing.html</a>
This one will show you how to find out what is on your system. You will need to figure out which line or port corresponds to OS speaker outputs.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/controls.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/controls.html</a>
This one will show you how to place a Control on the line or port. You will then be tieing your JSlider output to this Control.</p>

<p>Maybe start with that and come back with more specific questions along the way, if (when!) you run into problems.</p>
