<p>I don't know a great deal about SQLAnywhere but in your 1st select statement is being parsed as </p>

<pre><code>SELECT 35 as Str1, 42 as Str2
</code></pre>

<p>which is fine because they're both integers
Your 2nd statement </p>

<pre><code>SELECT 35 as Str1, 42a as Str2
</code></pre>

<p>should probably be </p>

<pre><code>SELECT 35 as Str1, '42a' as Str2
</code></pre>

<p>So I'd try changing the code to</p>

<pre><code>Test test = connection.Query&lt;Test&gt;("SELECT :Str1 as Str1, ':Str2' as Str2",
            new Test() { Str1 = 35, Str2 = "42" }).FirstOrDefault();
</code></pre>
