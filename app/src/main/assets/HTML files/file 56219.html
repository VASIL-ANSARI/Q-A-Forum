<p>For most digit manipulation assignments, I recommend treating the number as a <em>string</em> of <em>characters</em> rather than as a number.</p>

<h2>The Foundation</h2>

<p>Let's start with the foundation:  </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::getline;

int main(void)
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Paused.  Press Enter to continue.\n";
  cin.ignore(100000, '\n');
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above program will hopefully keep the console (terminal) window open until the <code>Enter</code> key is pressed.  </p>

<h2>Getting The Input</h2>

<p>We'll ask the User for a number, this is also known as <em>prompting</em>:  </p>

<pre><code>// The prompt text doesn't change so it's declared as const.
// It's declared as static because there is only one instance.
static const char prompt[] = "Enter a number: ";
cout.write(prompt, sizeof(prompt) - 1U); // Subtract 1 so the terminating nul is not output.

// Input the number as text
string number_as_text;
getline(cin, number_as_text);
</code></pre>

<h2>Printing The Digits</h2>

<p>Really, before this step, you should verify that the text only contains numbers.  Repeat the prompting until the User inputs nothing or valid data.  </p>

<p>A string can be accessed as an array.  So we'll set up a loop:  </p>

<pre><code>const unsigned int length = number_as_text.length();
for (unsigned int index = 0U;
     index &lt; length;
     ++index)
{
  // Extract the digit.
  const char c = number_as_text[index];

  // Verify it is a digit.
  if (!isdigit(c))
  {
    continue;
  }

  unsigned int quantity = c - '0'; // Convert to a number.
  if (quantity == 0) quantity = 1; // The requirements lie, for zero there is a quantity of 1.

  // Use "quantity" to print copies of the character.

}
cout &lt;&lt; "\n";
</code></pre>

<h2>Stuff</h2>

<p>I'm not going to write the entire program for you, as you haven't paid for my services.  So you will have to figure out when to print the '-' and how to print many copies of the digit.  </p>

<p>If this answer is not correct, please update your question with some clarifications or restrictions.</p>
