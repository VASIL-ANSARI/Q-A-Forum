<p>According to <a href="https://developers.google.com/shopping-search/v1/reference-request-parameters" rel="nofollow">this</a>, the accountId property is the <em>Id of the merchant center account that published the product</em>. That sounds an awful lot like the store.</p>

<p>Create an array of merchant id numbers you would like to have, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$merchants = array('Amazon' =&gt; '123456',
                   'HMV' =&gt; '789012');
</code></pre>

<p>Then generate your request and pass those values as the accountId. I'm not sure if you can pass multiple values at a time.</p>

<p>One thing to note, is it may be difficult to find the accountId of some merchants.
