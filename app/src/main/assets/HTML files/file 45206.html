<p>When you cannot dump the contents of your tree into a vector and sort the vector on different fields, I suppose you could try the following:</p>

<p>step 1: find, report, and keep a copy of the smallest element based on the new sort field.  (search the entire tree)</p>

<p>step 2 (and subsequent): find, report, and keep copy of the smallest element that is also larger than the previous smallest element. (search entire tree)</p>

<p>Not terribly efficient, but I think you should be able to make this work.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
