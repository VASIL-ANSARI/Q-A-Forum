<p>You should not have any problem if you use this guide.</p>

<p>Only problem I had was, when I add like <code>packet &lt;&lt; coorX &lt;&lt; coorY</code>, and open that packet like <code>packet &gt;&gt; p2CoorX &gt;&gt; p2CoorY</code>, I had a big issue, problem was, packet was not cleaning at all. so it puts coorX and coorY to packet, and it does it again and again... packet is getting really big and while its getting bigger, the receiving part (<code>packet &gt;&gt; p2CoorX &gt;&gt; p2CoorY</code>) reads only the first two variables.</p>

<p>That was my problem but I fixed it with using <code>packet.clear();</code></p>
