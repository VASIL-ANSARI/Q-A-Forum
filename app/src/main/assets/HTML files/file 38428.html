<p>Don't have an answer, but have a suggestion for further analysis.</p>

<p>if you want it in binary, then you want the bits starting in the Nth bit, where N=X+1 where X is described as follows:</p>

<p>2^X = 10^(10^100)
take log(b=10) =></p>

<p>X = 10^100 / log(2) ==> ~ 3.3 E 100</p>

<p>Still not sure how to reduce it from there, but maybe playing with logarithm identities might be interesting.  If you can compute X, maybe you can come up with a long division algorithm, though the running time argument on your reference makes me imagine the runtime for computing this could be the same. I.e. see you in ~600 years.</p>

<p>Another idea might be to investigate how numeric coprocessors create iEEE mantissas in binary.  </p>

<p>Maybe there is an algorithm there you can leverage for something like this.</p>

<p>Just guessing though</p>
