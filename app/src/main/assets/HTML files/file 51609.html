<p>When a model is created with formulas, then the missing value handling defaults to 'drop', and rows with missing observations are dropped from all data arrays given to the model (<code>__init__</code>). In the non-formula interface the default is currently to ignore missing values.</p>

<p>However, there is currently no check and automatic dropping of missing values in the arrays that are given at a later point, in this case data that is required in <code>cov_kwds</code>. If this has the original set of observations, but some have been dropped in the dependent and explanatory variables, then there will be a length mismatch, and it will raise the reported exception.</p>

<p>I reopened <a href="https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/1220" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/1220</a> because it is possible to handle missing values in the special cases where we have enough information through the pandas indices.</p>
