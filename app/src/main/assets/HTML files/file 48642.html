<p>Are you using the iOS8 SDK? iOS8 introduced UITextEffectsWindow - this gets created in addition to the application window so @app.windows.size == 2 and not 1. You can check this by running your app and in the REPL looking at the 2 window objects.</p>

<pre><code>(main)&gt; UIApplication.sharedApplication.windows[0]
=&gt; #&lt;UIWindow:0x11280d700&gt;
(main)&gt; UIApplication.sharedApplication.windows[1]
=&gt; #&lt;UITextEffectsWindow:0x10b6127a0&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest modifying the default spec to one which tests that the application window has a default rootViewController for example.</p>
