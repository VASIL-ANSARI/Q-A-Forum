<p>I do not think that not checking for a connection will cause your app to be rejected, but you should do it anyway.</p>

<p>Ed Marty has pointed out that my original suggestion of using </p>

<p><code>- (BOOL)checkResourceIsReachableAndReturnError:(NSError **)error</code></p>

<p>will not work in iOS (thanks!).</p>
