<p>In general, Rails makes your life easy if you agree to go along with its conventions, and hard otherwise.  So I'd recommend leaving this one alone.</p>

<p>But if you really want the param to be <code>:user_id</code> - say for readability reasons or something - you can just "alias" it in a before_filter:</p>

<pre><code>params[:user_id] = params[:id]
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
