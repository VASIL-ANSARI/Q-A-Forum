<p>The short answer? Lose the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> characters in your jQuery identifiers. You should treat the identifiers the same as you would CSS identifiers. </p>

<p>i.e.; <code>$('&lt;a&gt;')</code> should actually be <code>$('a')</code>.</p>

<p>To test this, go ahead and run them both in your favorite browser console and see the difference. </p>
