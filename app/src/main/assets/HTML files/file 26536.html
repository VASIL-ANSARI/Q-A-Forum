<p>Looking at the script you pasted, you have a few issues.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The following line is not commented out right, <code>**Uncaught type error: Object[object Object] has no method 'rating'**</code>  What is this line doing in your code?  It appears to be some form of exception which you've inserted as a comment, but your comment syntax isn't right.  Remove it altogether, or if you must keep it, change it to this, <code>/**Uncaught type error: Object[object Object] has no method 'rating'**/</code></p></li>
<li><p>The next issue is that you've commented out the 'Success' member method of the $ajax object, but left the comma in place above it.  This will throw an exception for the syntax alone.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT:  Number 2 of my list above is actually inaccurate.  JS does allow the trailing comma in an object literal member collection.</p>
