<p>I can't directly answer your first question, but if you're using wxWidgets anyhow, why don't you use <a href="http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.1.0/classwx_stack_walker.html" rel="nofollow">wxStackWalker</a> or even <a href="http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.1.0/classwx_debug_report.html" rel="nofollow">wxDebugReport</a> instead of reimplementing them?</p>

<p>As for the second one, you really need to look at the disassembly, it's quite likely that the optimizer replaces your code with something entirely different or even removes it entirely as it doesn't seem to have any side effects.</p>

<p>Edit: as for the third question (which should really be asked independently as it doesn't have much to do with the other ones), the function names are kept in the resulting binary even without debug information, you may use <code>strip</code> to get rid of them (although usually there should be no real reason to).</p>
