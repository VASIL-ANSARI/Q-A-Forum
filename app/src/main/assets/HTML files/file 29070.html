<p>I dont think there is an option for that but perhaps what you can do is subclass your cell and in <code>didTransitionToState:</code> you can detect the delete confirmation state.</p>

<p>Now at this point im not entirely sure what you can do to prevent the scrolling but I hope this puts you in the right direction.</p>

<p>Maybe you can disable the cell's gesture recognizer in this state?</p>
