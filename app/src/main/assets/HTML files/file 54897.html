<p>I don't know what is more important to you, is it "checking for child process status" or being able to "fork off additional child processes as needed". If the latter than this might help you:</p>

<pre><code>  queue = ['A','B','C','D']
  forks = []
  while queue.size &gt; 0
    q = queue.shift
    forks &lt;&lt; Process.fork do
      puts q
    end

    if forks.size &gt;= 10
      forks.delete Process.wait 
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>You can keep pushing new elements to queue or if your goal is to loop forever then you can easily change it loop from <code>while</code> to <code>loop</code>.</p>

<p>With the <code>forks.size</code> you can set amount of the child processes being processes at the same time</p>

<p>Important thing to know about <code>Process.wait</code> is that when you don't pass parameters to it, it waits for any child process to finish and returns pid of that process.</p>
