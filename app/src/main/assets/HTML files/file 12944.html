<p>The body of each catch block is the same.  There's no need to catch the specific exception types in this case, because you are taking no type-specific action.  This is better:</p>

<pre><code>   try 
    { 
        this.data = CSVReader.ToDataTable(file); //throws a few basic exceptions 
    } 
    catch (Exception e) 
    { 
        throw new FailedLoadingCSVException(e, currentLine, file); 
    } 
</code></pre>
