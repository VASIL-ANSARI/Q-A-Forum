<p>The usual behavior is that an App takes the timestamp direct from the location delivered by the system. Most probably this is the case in that App, otheriwse this would be a heavy programming bug. (The delay between nominal GPS time and receiving system time of about 200ms is plausible, I saw that in my app, and in ios Map app, which makes a correction in their map api to extrapolate the location into the future, to try to compensate that delay)</p>

<p>Under android (and ios) it is import to know whether the location are determined exclusively by GPS. On both plattforms (ios, android) an App can set whether GPS only or combined GPS + WLAN + Cell Locationing is used.</p>

<p>For high quality recording is is highly recomended to use GPS only.</p>

<p>A GPS chip once having a location usually outputs a location with a timestamp exactly at 000. Exception can happen before the location is valid.
Under ios if the location was obtained by GPS the millisecond are always 0.
I have no experience with android, but usually the GPS chip itself sets the value to millis = 0. (However, some android phones are known to use a crippled cheap GPS chips, that are not able to get an intial position without the help of an internet conection)<br>
It is possible to determine whether the location was obtained by GPS by looking at the course (or called heading) and speed value, which are invalid for non GPS locations (cell Tower locationing)
To know whether this time variations come from the Application (not using the GPS only mode) or if it is caused by Android, you can test that with another application on the same phone. (E.g Motion-X GPS) (Or by comparing both apps on another android phone)</p>
