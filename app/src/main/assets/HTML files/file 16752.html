<p>It would appear that the latter half of the <code>EKEvent</code> property <code>eventIdentifier</code> contains the <code>CalEvent</code> property <code>uid</code>. I don't know what the first identifier (before the colon) in the <code>eventIdentifier</code> is. It seems to relate to the calendar, but I don't recognize the identifier.</p>
