<p>The problem was that IntelliJ was using the Maven goal <code>spring-boot:run</code> as the launch configuration, and trying to debug this causes the debugger to attach to the wrong process.</p>

<p>Setting a new launch configuration of type <code>Application</code> and pointing it at the project's class with the <code>main()</code> method resolves this issue.</p>

<p>Thanks to the commentors for suggesting that this was the way to go about it!</p>
