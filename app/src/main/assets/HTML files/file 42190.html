<p>You can achieve it using a version of the draw method in the SpriteBatch class, which is </p>

<pre><code>batch.draw(Sprite, float x, float y, float  width, float  height)
</code></pre>

<p>So you can scale to 160 * 160 pixels by calling:</p>

<pre><code>batch.begin();
batch.draw(yourSprite, 0, 0, 160, 160);
batch.end();
</code></pre>

<p>You should note that scaling is an expensive operation especially for low -end devices and should be used when absolutely necessary. Ideally, you should resize all your images/textures before using them in your project.</p>
