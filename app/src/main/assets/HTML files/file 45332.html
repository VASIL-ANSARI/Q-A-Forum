<p>The problem was that I used to rename dlls before storing them. I still don't know the work around but I changed my algorithm so that I can store and recall dll with the same name as it was originally compiled. Problem solved.</p>

<p>What was the effect of changing AppDomainSetup? In first alternative, asp.net was finding a copy of that renamed dll (with original name) in bin directory of asp.net project.</p>
