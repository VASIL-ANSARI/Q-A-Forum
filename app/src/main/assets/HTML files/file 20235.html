<p>The program is going to act flakey if you overwrite the stack. The particular compiler is going to format the stack in its own internally defined way.</p>

<p>The way to avoid this is to use something that reads in a way that limits the number of input chars to the size of the buffer.</p>

<p>One way is to add the length into the format <code>"%9s"</code> leaving room for the end of string character.</p>
