<p>This is probably compiler-specific (you could look through the C spec to be sure), but the integer parameter should be allocated on the call stack for the function. Each time you call the function, there will be an extra 4 bytes allocated to work with that will be freed when the function returns.</p>

<p>For the reference version of the function, it will allocate space for the int pointer on each function call. Depending on your machine, that may be bigger, smaller, or the same size as an int. Compare <code>sizeof(int)</code> with <code>sizeof(int*)</code> to see which is bigger.</p>
