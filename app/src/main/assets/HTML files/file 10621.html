<p>Here's 2 tools that advertise dependency graph generation.  I don't have any experience with them however.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.springsource.com/landing/best-development-tool-enterprise-java">SpringSource's build of Eclipse</a> - It advertises a "Spring Bean Dependency Graph"</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myeclipseide.com/me4s/">MyEclipse for Spring</a> - says "bean dependency graphs"</li>
</ul>
