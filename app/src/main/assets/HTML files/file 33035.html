<p>Distributing an application with an embedded webserver allows for standalone setup and running it by just calling <code>java -jar application.jar</code>.</p>

<p>However, there may be users who want to be in control of which web server is used or who want to deploy multiple applications into a single webserver (e.g. in order to prevent port clashes especially with ports 80 and 8080). In that case a "fat" jar might cause problems or at least some unneeded code and thus a larger memory footprint.</p>

<p>IMHO the best approach for those two cases would be to provide two artifacts: a "fat" jar for (easier) standalone setup and an application-only war/ear for those who want to deploy the application in their own container.</p>
