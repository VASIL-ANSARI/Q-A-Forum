<p>Sparkle is really good, however if you prefer in-house solution then here is one possible approach.</p>

<p>Steps:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Old application (after launch) checks for updates</li>
<li>if update found download and unpack it into a temp location</li>
<li>launch an external application do to the "swapping" replace old currently running app with the new one unpacked into a temp location</li>
<li>old app terminates</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the real "magic" happens is when old app is done with the download and unpack. 
Then old app from it's bundle copies to a temp location it's relaucher (simple terminal app) and launches it with the following command line args: </p>

<ul>
<li>First param is the process ID of the old app (which is running)</li>
<li>Second is the path to the new version (this will be moved into Applications folder)</li>
<li>Third (optional) path to the old application (used to delete it explicitly)</li>
</ul>

<p>When all is done, after launching the relauncher old app terminates.
At this point relauncher is already running and waits for old app's termination.</p>

<p>When old app terminates then relauncher does three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deletes the old app from Applications</li>
<li>Copies new version from temp location into Applications</li>
<li>Launches the new version from Applications. </li>
</ul>

<p>Update is done.</p>
