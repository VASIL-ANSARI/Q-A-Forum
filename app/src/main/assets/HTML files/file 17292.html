<pre><code>$pattern = "~(\w*)&lt;span&gt;(\w+)&lt;/span&gt;~";
</code></pre>

<p>This should do the trick.</p>

<p>If the second group should be able to match empty strings as well, replace the <code>+</code> by another <code>*</code>. Note that <code>\w</code> will match letters, digits and underscores. If that is too much or insufficient, replace it by an appropriate character class.</p>

<p>One more thing: I think the syntax for <code>preg_replace_callback</code> requires you to hand in the function name as a string.</p>
