<p>I've had this problem too a couple of times, it turned out I was stopping processing of transactions before calling finishTransaction on all queued transactions. I was forgetting to finish failed transactions in the particular case.</p>

<p>So, you could try letting your application run once and call finishTransaction for each and every one in your observer delegate like this: </p>

<pre><code>-(void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions 
{
   foreach(SKPaymentTransaction *tr in transactions) [queue finishTransaction:tr];
}
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. finish every transaction irrespective of transaction state.
After the test run revert to your original handling code.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
