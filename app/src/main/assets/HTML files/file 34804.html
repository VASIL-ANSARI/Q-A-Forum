<p><code>multiprocessing</code> creates a <em>copy</em> of the memory for each process at the time you start the new processes.  Sharing state via module-level globals doesn't work because every process gets it's own "snapshot" of the globals at the time you fork the process.  Changing one processes' globals doesn't magically propagate to other processes.</p>

<p>If you need to share state between processes, you need to use one of the tools that <code>multiprocessing</code> gives to you.  You can share c types via <code>Value</code> or <code>Array</code>, or use <code>Manager</code> to share arbitrary data types.  See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes" rel="nofollow">sharing state between processes</a> in the docs for details and examples.</p>
