<p>$.myfunc refers to a "static" or global function in the jquery namespace. It is not reliant on jquery initialisation via a selector such as $('#id').myfunc(...). </p>

<p>$.ajax is an example.</p>

<p>$.fn.myfunc on the other hand adds myfunc to the prototype of the jquery object, so that when a jquery objetc is created via a selector $('#id') the new object has a method called myfunc that is invokable in the context of the newly created jquery object.</p>
