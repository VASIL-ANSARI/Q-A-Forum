<p>You MUST specify the table in the <code>ORDER BY</code> if you have two similar column names. It's that simple. </p>

<p>You should be able to use a different alias in the <code>SELECT</code> which disambiguates from both <code>boat</code> columns and then use that in the </p>

<pre><code>$sortcol = "bboat";
$sql= "
  SELECT 
    fleet,
    /* Alias as bboat to disambiguate from b.boat and o.boat
    b.boat as bboat,
    owner 
  FROM 
    boats as b
    LEFT JOIN owners as o ON  b.boat=o.boat 
  ORDER BY IF($sortcol is NULL,1,0), $sortcol";
</code></pre>

<p>Note: if <code>$sortcol</code> is the result of any kind of user input, it is necessary to compare it against a whitelist of acceptable column names to prevent SQL injection.</p>
