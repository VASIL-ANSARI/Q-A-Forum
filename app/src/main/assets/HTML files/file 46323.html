<p>I wanted to post this as comment but I dont have the necessary credits to post, so I am adding this as an answer.From the code that you have posted here it seems like you are working on the  PageAdapter instantiateItem function. Well, from the output one can make out that the instantiateItem function is called just once for the page which sets up your initial adapter which has the contents genre[] and displays them. The next time you press "a" the page is being reused instead of being created fresh and so the instantiateitem function is not being called again. So, probably instantiateItem is not the place to switch adapters ?</p>
