  <p>My only current ideas for this is to traverse the text character by character until I find a { which would increment a "depth" variable. Capture the words in between until I find a } decreasing the depth variable and upon it returning to zero, stop capturing words. I was just wondering if there's a much easier way of doing this.</p>

<p>That sounds like a reasonable way to do it. Another way to do this is by using a bit of regex, although that <em>might</em> result in a solution that is (far) less readable (and therefor less maintainable) than your own solution.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$text = "You've come to the {right; correct; appropriate} place! 
    Start by {searching; probing; inquiring} our site below, or 
    {browse; {search; {foo; bar}; lookup}; examine} our list of 
    popular support articles. {the right; the correct; the appropriate}";

preg_match_all('/{((?:[^{}]*|(?R))*)}/', $text, $matches);

$arr = array();

foreach($matches[1] as $m) {
  preg_match_all('/\w([\w\s]*\w)?/', $m, $words);
  $arr[] = $words[0];
}    

print_r($arr);

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>would produce:</p>

<pre><code>Array
