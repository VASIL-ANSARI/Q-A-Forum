<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> The specific problem you're running into has to do with the fact that you are running the application through Xcode, and in a nutshell you can't test production push notifications this way, you'd have to use the sandbox push server and certs. If you want to test prod pushes you'll need to distribute the application signed with an Ad Hoc provisioning profile. I'm sure there are a million ways to do this, but actually my two favorites are using Testflight and Crashlytics' new <em>Beta</em> feature, that allows you to distribute ad hoc builds to devices basically using a single line of code, automatically once you archive a new build. I would recommend Crashlytics because it also automatically handles extremely useful analytics as well as crash reporting.</p>

<p>If you are referring to the initial push notifications permissions pop-up, that will only be displayed once or the lifetime of the application. The ONLY way I believe to get around this is to uninstall the up and <em>leave it uninstalled</em> for 3 days (I believe this is the limit).</p>

<p>I'm unfortunately not familiar with PubNub, but in your application are you registering for push notifications and receiving a device token?</p>
