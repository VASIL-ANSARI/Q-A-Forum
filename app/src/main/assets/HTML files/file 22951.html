<p>There's nothing wrong with the way your model is set up. Storing multiple uploads in a separate model makes it easier to maintain down the track, should you ever wish to change the requirements.</p>

<p>You've only specified <em>one</em> attached file in upload.rb, which is why it inserts a separate entry for each upload. Specifying random <code>attr_accessibles</code> won't do anything, those fields don't even exist.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> remove the upload model altogether, and just store the uploads directly on the submission:</p>

<p><strong>submission.rb</strong></p>

<pre><code>has_attached_file :package_a
has_attached_file :packabe_b
</code></pre>

<p>This would store the uploads in a single row, associated to the submission. This is not scalable. </p>

<p>I would not store multiple uploads in your upload model in an unscalable fashion as above, that wouldn't make logical sense from an OOP point of view.</p>

<p>All in all, I think the way you've got it set up now is the best approach.</p>
