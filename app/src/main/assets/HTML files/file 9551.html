<p>You need the .pdb file that corresponds to the executable.  That'll give you the symbols.</p>

<p>There are a couple tricky parts to debugging a release build:</p>

<ol>
<li>The order of operations may be off due to optimizations</li>
<li>Whole functions/variables/etc. may be optimized away</li>
<li>In particular, the arguments passed into functions may not exist (for example, 'this' may be a register, not a spot in memory).  Windbg is pretty good about getting the stack track from that though, including figuring out the arguments.</li>
</ol>
