<p>You shouldn't use one three-dimensional array. You will need 3 tables to that. Store all your types in a database.<br>
3 tables are:<br>
1. paper<br>
2. media<br>
3. papermedia  </p>

<p>so. you populate first dropdown with papersizes. 
then when item is selected in papersizes you run a query to populate dropdown media (you join through intersection table). this way you will only show media that is only available for this papersize. or you can do the other way around.
Does this answer your question?</p>
