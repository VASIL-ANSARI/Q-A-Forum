<p>You must create a thread inside your listener. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) {

                Thread hilo = new Thread(new Runnable() {

                    @Override
                    public void run() {

                        //here your code

                    }
                });         
                hilo.start();

            }
        });
</code></pre>

<p>If the JFrame doesn't freeze is only because the execution is fast and it hasn't time to freeze, but if the execution needs more than seconds the JFrame will freeze.</p>
