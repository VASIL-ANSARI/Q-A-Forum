<p>It depends on the specific legislation that you are concerned about. In the UK, for instance, the wording of <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/2426/regulation/6/made" rel="nofollow"><em>The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003</em></a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>, a person shall not use an electronic communications network to store information, or to gain access to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>While it is commonly referred to as "The Cookie Law", it definitely does not apply solely to cookies.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Browsers considers localStorage and sessionSotrage a kind of a cookie? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mean, do not save the data when the user select to always erase the cookies </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When erasing them, Chrome bundles local storage with cookies. Doing a comprehensive investigation into all the circumstances where all browsers allow the user to determine when cookies and local storage will be erased is a bit beyond the typical scope of a SO question though.</p>
