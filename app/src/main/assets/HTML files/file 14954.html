<p>It's possible to join the same table twice by using aliases:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    Buyers.FirstName,
    Items1.Name, Cards.Item1Quantity,
    Items2.Name, Cards.Item2Quantity,
    Items3.Name, Cards.Item3Quantity,
    Items4.Name, Cards.Item4Quantity
FROM Buyers
INNER JOIN Cards ON Buyers.OGCard=Cards.OGCard
INNER JOIN Items AS Items1 ON Cards.Item1ID=Items.ItemName
INNER JOIN Items AS Items2 ON Cards.Item2ID=Items.ItemName
INNER JOIN Items AS Items3 ON Cards.Item3ID=Items.ItemName
INNER JOIN Items AS Items4 ON Cards.Item4ID=Items.ItemName
WHERE OGCard=13451
</code></pre>

<p>If some of the <code>Items_n_ID</code>s can be missing, you could use a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> instead of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> so that you still get the results for the values that are present.</p>

<p>However I'd strongly recommend you to normalize your database rather than going with this approach.</p>
