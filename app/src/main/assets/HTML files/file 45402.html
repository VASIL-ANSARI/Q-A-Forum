<p>I think I understand what you are asking. Are you trying to create a bunch of "fake" pages that are all one HTML file? I created a working example of what I think you want. It works by updating <code>location.hash</code> with the current section as you scroll. When you reload it should appear on the same section ("fake" page). You need to download this for it to run properly so I put it in a gist.</p>

<p><em>This is because Stackoverflow and JSFiddle fun the code in a sandbox where <code>location.hash</code> can not be updated.</em></p>

<p>This will update your browser history every time you scroll to a new page. I figured this was annoying so I have HTML5 push state setup. This will only work on a web server but every time you scroll to a new page it will replace the current url (and history) with the "fake" page in view so you do not have an infinite history. The code I posted will run locally on your computer or on a webserver but it will run better on a web server.</p>

    &lt;p&gt;HTML5 is a core technology markup language of the Internet used for structuring and presenting content for the World Wide Web. As of October 2014 this is the final and complete fifth revision of the HTML standard of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[3]
      The previous version, HTML 4, was standardised in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.). HTML5 is intended to subsume not
      only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the
      language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications,
      and user interfaces for many mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;section id="bootstrap"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript
      extensions. The bootstrap framework aims to ease web development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootstrap is a front end, that is an interface between the user and the server-side code which resides on the "back end" or server. And it is a web application framework, that is a software framework which is designed to support the development of
      dynamic websites and web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
