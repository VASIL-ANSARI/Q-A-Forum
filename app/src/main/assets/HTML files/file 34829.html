<p>Try generating a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ios/bluetooth/" rel="nofollow" title="iOS Bluetooth diagnostic log">Bluetooth diagnostic log</a>, that's the most info you will get (without jail breaking).
If you need more info, a Bluetooth sniffer/protocol analyzer may be needed.</p>
