<p>I would say you first should clean your code. It's not looking modular at all really. You should divide the endpoint view into a modular functions, so that it will become much easier to read. You're mixing the camelCase and under_score style in your variable naming, which is regarded as bad style.</p>

<p>After you have done this, you are ready to move on to the actual problem :). For that, I want you to get familiar with <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow">The python debugger</a>. With that you can easily debug python code. Oldschool way would be to insert prints in your code, but that is usually slow, unless you smell where the problem could be.</p>
