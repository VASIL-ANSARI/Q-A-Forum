<p>what you have said makes perfectly good sense given what you have told us.</p>

<p>You probably want to add a <code>reset()</code> method of some kind to your Scene(s) and call that when you switch to a different scene - or when you leave a particular scene.</p>

<p>But ... if they are your variables in your class, then that built in <code>reset()</code> method can't reset your variables.</p>

<p>Add a method like <code>resetSceneVars()</code> and reinitialize anything that needs to be the same as it was when you created the scene. As long as you maintain a reference to the scene, those variables will keep their latest values.</p>
