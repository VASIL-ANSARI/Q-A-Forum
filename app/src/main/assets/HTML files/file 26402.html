<p>I think it's important to think of this formula from Apple's Auto Layout Guide when working with constraints:</p>

<pre><code>y = m*x + b, where:

y and x are attributes of views.

m and b are floating point values.
</code></pre>

<p>You can think the constraint for the top of _container like this:</p>

<pre><code>_containter.top = m*_screenView.top + b
</code></pre>

<p>When you are creating a constraint using <code>NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:...</code> the multiplier argument is "m" and constant is "b" in this formula. To create a constraint that keeps the top of _container 30 points below the top of _screenView you would do this:</p>

<pre><code>NSLayoutConstraint *myConstraint =[NSLayoutConstraint
                                   constraintWithItem:_container
                                   attribute:NSLayoutAttributeTop
                                   relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual
                                   toItem:_screenView
                                   attribute:NSLayoutAttributeTop
                                   multiplier:1.0
                                   constant:30.0];
</code></pre>

<p>The bottom constraint would be:</p>

<pre><code>NSLayoutConstraint *myConstraint =[NSLayoutConstraint
                                   constraintWithItem:_container
                                   attribute:NSLayoutAttributeBottom
                                   relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual
                                   toItem:_screenView
                                   attribute:NSLayoutAttributeBottom
                                   multiplier:1.0
                                   constant:-50.0];
</code></pre>

<p>Also keep in mind that in the UIKit coordinate system X values go up from left to right and Y values go up from top to bottom. In other words, 0,0 is at the top-left of screen and the values go up from there.</p>

<p>If you want to create the four contraints you show above you will have to create them all individually. You could also use the <code>constraintsWithVisualFormat:options:metrics:views:</code> method of NSLayoutConstraint to make multiple at once. I find it more clear to write them out the way I did above.</p>
