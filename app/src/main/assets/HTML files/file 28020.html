<p>Indeed, you have to employ some periodic function like sin(x) and normalize it to your desired scale. For example, Triangle wave: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave</a></p>

<p>Another approach (maybe, more preferred for simple cases) is to use an array of pre-calculated results and iterate through them (and handle index overflow with help of mod function).</p>
