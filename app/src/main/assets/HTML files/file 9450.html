<p>If your property is defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, readwrite, retain) NSMutableDictionary *dictionaryIvar;
//...
@synthesize dictionaryIvar;
</code></pre>

<p>then the synthesized method would take care of releasing/retaining the dictionary objects.</p>

<pre><code>self.dictionaryIvar = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
</code></pre>

<p>should thus be sufficient.</p>

<p>There's a distict difference between <code>self.dictionaryIvar</code> and <code>dictionaryIvar</code> wherein the former gets passed to a synthesized property method (<code>- (NSMutableDictionary *)dictionaryIvar;</code> and <code>- (void)setDictionaryIvar:(NSMutableDictionary *)aDictionary;</code> respectively) and <code>dictionaryIvar</code> simply accesses the variable.</p>

<p>Thus this would leak (and crash, both):</p>

<pre><code>dictionaryIvar = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
</code></pre>

<p>while this wouldn't:</p>

<pre><code>self.dictionaryIvar = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>But I'd (in most cases) really just go with this simple call:</p>

<pre><code>[dictionaryIvar removeAllObjects];
</code></pre>
