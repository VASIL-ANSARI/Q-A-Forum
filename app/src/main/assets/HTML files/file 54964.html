<p><strong>Feature extraction &amp; matching to the help!</strong></p>

<p>The problem is a typical recognition application. Inder to match two image successfully, you have to find some distinct or unique properties that will help you to find what you are looking for. These are called "Features" in pattern recognition/image processing environments. However, that is not simple as it is. There are many feature extraction methods which are already implemented in OpenCV <strong>(SIFT, SURF, ORB</strong> etc.)</p>

<p>In Iris recognition case, you will need scale, illuminance and rotation invarient features. SIFT features will be the best candidate for this work.
Therefore, extract SIFT features of iris images and store them to the database. OpenCV also has feature matchers, <strong>flaNN</strong> is one of them. </p>
