<p>first of all, use https not http protocol.</p>

<p>Also, use md5 or SHA for password encryption.</p>

<p>I would also encrypt the usernames, emails and everything with an encryption algorithm that can be decrypted by you only.</p>

<p>Hide your mysql database behind a DMZ and also put it seperate then the webserver/php server.</p>

<p>Thats my few ideas</p>
