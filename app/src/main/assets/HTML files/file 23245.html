<p>I would personally use <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/" rel="nofollow">mechanize</a> as I do not have any experience with scrapy. However a library named scrapy purpose built for screen scraping should be up for the task. I would just have a go with both of them and see which does the job best/easiest.</p>
