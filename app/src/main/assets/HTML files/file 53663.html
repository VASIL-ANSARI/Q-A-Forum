<p>The thing is, is you don't need two equal structures with different names.</p>

<p>Taking Ed Heal's example:
if you have bananas and apples, and you simply classify them by volume and color, you need one struct to cover that for both, so just call your struct 'fruit'</p>

<p>if you need to separate bananas and apples, add a field to your struct that does that. e.g (Pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>int type = (banana)?1:0
</code></pre>

<p>You should not think about wether it is forbidden or not and why if there is no use at all for it!</p>
