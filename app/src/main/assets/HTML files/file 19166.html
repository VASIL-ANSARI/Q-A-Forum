<p>Assuming you have those .lib already compiled you need to make sure that the .lib files are in the Library path (look VC++ Directories->Library path). </p>

<p>The compiler will place a link to the DLLs at compile time, using the .lib to discover the correct entry points etc, so they can be loaded efficiently when the EXE/DLL starts up at run-time. </p>

<p>The type of runtime DLL discovery you're talking about requires LoadLibrary + GetProcAddress type code, which Boost doesn't support.</p>

<p>(Static linking actually puts code from a statcially compiled .lib code into your DLL/EXE.)</p>

<p>EDIT: Also, check you're using the correct .lib files for your archicture, e.g. 32-bit or 64-bit. That would cause a similar error with the signatures. </p>

<pre><code>dumpbin /headers 
</code></pre>

<p>will tell you which 'machine' type the .lib has been built for (the first section of the dumpbin output).</p>
