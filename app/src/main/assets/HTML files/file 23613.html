<p>The foreach will iterate the IEnumerable returned from ComputePower. "Yield return" automatically creates an implementation of IEnumerable so you don't have to hand-roll it. If you put a breakpoint inside your "while"-loop you will see it getting called for each iteration</p>

<p>From msdn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You consume an iterator method by using a foreach statement or LINQ query. Each iteration of the foreach loop calls the iterator method. When a yield return statement is reached in the iterator method, expression is returned, and the current location in code is retained. Execution is restarted from that location the next time that the iterator function is called.</p>
