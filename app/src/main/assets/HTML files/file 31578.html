<p>Bean is just an object in JVM. You certainly cannot use an object from one JVM in another JVM straightforward. </p>

<p>But you can do 2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use proxies - some objects that will have the same interface but invoke somehow to the proper server as implementation.</li>
<li>Use service-oriented architecture (SOA). Each server should have some limited set of beans that are responsible for their functionality. And all beans can interact with each other.
Maybe OSGI is suitable for this.</li>
</ol>
