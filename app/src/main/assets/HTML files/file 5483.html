<p>if you re-layout your views when the view is about to be rotated I think when it really rotates it won't have animations.
I mean, write a method with the new coordinates, frames, positions for each subview and call that method in <code>willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</code> or <code>willAnimateFirstHalfOfRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration:</code> 
(This is not a smart way of doing things though. I wonder, why do you need no-animation?)</p>
