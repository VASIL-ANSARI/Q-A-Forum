<p>Well, you might start with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.readalllines.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>File.ReadAllLines()</code></a> method. Then, iterate through the lines in that file, checking to see if they match a pattern. If they do, extract the necessary text and do whatever you want with it.</p>

<p>Here's an example that assumes you want lines in the format <code>[(field 1)][(field 2)]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// Or wherever your file is located
string path = @"C:\MyFile.edf";

// Pattern to check each line
Regex pattern = new Regex(@"\[([^\]]*?)\]");

// Read in lines
string[] lines = File.ReadAllLines(path);

// Iterate through lines
foreach (string line in lines)
{
   // Check if line matches your format here
   var matches = pattern.Matches(line);

   if (matches.Count == 2)
   {
      string value1 = matches[0].Groups[1].Value;
      string value2 = matches[1].Groups[1].Value;

      Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0} - {1}", value1, value2));
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs them to the console window, but you could obviously do whatever you want with <code>value1</code> and <code>value2</code> (write them to another file, store them in a data structure, etc). </p>

<p>Also, please note that regular expressions are not my strong point -- there's probably a much more elegant way to check if a line matches your pattern :)</p>
