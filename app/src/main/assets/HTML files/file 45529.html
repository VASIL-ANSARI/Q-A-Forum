<p>There is no documentation on that, because it is not a public API. It is implementation details which means it can change at any moment.</p>

<p>Though the best thing you can do is to look into the code of the platform.</p>

<p>When the intent of your app is called for example because you tapped icon in a launcher, the system identifies that it belongs to your app, first it needs to figure out if the Application object is already created. If it's not - make it. It does it using reflection by using class loader which is a member of the context classes.</p>

<p>Look at LoadedApk.java</p>

<p><code>if (mApplication != null) {
    return mApplication;
}
...
java.lang.ClassLoader cl = getClassLoader();
app = mActivityThread.mInstrumentation.newApplication(
        cl, appClass, appContext);</code> </p>

<p>After application is created in my experience it also creating content providers, and finally the activity that is related to your intent.</p>

<p>Regarding your question about how the apk is used with DVM, I believe it is with the class ApplicationLoaders:</p>

<p><code>PathClassLoader pathClassloader = new PathClassLoader(zip, libPath, parent);</code></p>

<p>The DexClassLoader class accepts a file which is actually a zip with classes.dex in it. <em>LibPath</em> is a path to .so files and <em>parent</em> is a parent classloader - all the system stuff which is known to zygote upfront and which bootstrapped the whole thing in the first place.</p>
