<p>I have no idea about the API, but I know Ultramon (<a href="http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/" rel="nofollow">http://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/</a>) has a feature included for preserving icon placement (although I've never used it for preserving icon location, it is indispensable for multiple monitor usage). The latest beta release works flawlessly with Vista (except for sometimes having a minor glitch or two when initially logging into my machine via RDP), and of course, haven't had any issues with XP. I've used it for over four years now.</p>

<p>And did I mention that it's the best utility for multiple monitor usage?</p>
