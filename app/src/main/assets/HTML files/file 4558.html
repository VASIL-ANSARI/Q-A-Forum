<p>Unlike a <code>Panel</code> control for example, a <code>UserControl</code> does not act as a container control once it is placed on another form. There is full design-time support while you are designing the <code>UserControl</code> itself, but its default behavior does not allow it to act as a constitutent control after it has been placed on another form. This is why you are unable to add other controls to it by dragging them from the toolbox.</p>

<p>In order to add this type of behavior to a <code>UserControl</code>, you need to add the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.designerattribute.aspx"><code>DesignerAttribute</code></a> to the definition of your custom <code>UserControl</code> class. For example:</p>

<pre><code>using System.ComponentModel;
using System.ComponentModel.Design;

[Designer("System.Windows.Forms.Design.ParentControlDesigner, System.Design", typeof(IDesigner))]
public class MyUserControl : System.Windows.Forms.UserControl
{
    //...your code here
}
</code></pre>

<p>(See the relevant <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813450">MSDN</a> article for further reading.)</p>

<p><br>
If you want to implement full designer support for <em>nested</em> controls inside your <code>UserControl</code>, this is slightly more difficult.
