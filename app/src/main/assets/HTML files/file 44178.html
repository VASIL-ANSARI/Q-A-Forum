<p>The sample is a little muddled with that "SampleImage" name. The confusing part is that Win32 resources may be identified with either strings or (16-bit) integers. The sample leads you to use strings (e.g. L"SampleImage"), but the Visual Studio IDE (and, frankly, most code I've come across) prefers integers. To allow both kinds, the Win32 resource functions take parameters of type LPCWSTR and callers are supposed to use a macro, MAKEINTRESOURCE, to convert an integer ID into a "pseudo string". The same applies for resource types. There are some built-in types (ICON, CURSOR, BITMAP, et al), but you can always define your own types using strings.</p>

<p>If you look around in your code, you should be able to find a header file (Resource.h, probably) with the definition for IDB_PNG1. It's most likely a small integer, so you need to use the MAKEINTRESOURCE macro. PNG was probably not defined anywhere, and it's not one of the built-in resource types, so the resource compiler treated it as a string and so should you.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>FindResource(
    NULL, // This component
    MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDB_PNG1), // Resource name
    L"PNG",                    // Resource type
    );
</code></pre>

<p>Try that and let us know if it works.</p>
