<p>That looks kind of complicated.  I probably don't understand what it is you're trying to achieve, but what about something like this?</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/ruby1.8

class Symbol

  alias_method :old_to_s, :to_s
  def to_s(*args)
    if args == [:upcase]
      old_to_s.upcase
    else
      old_to_s(*args)
    end
  end

end

puts :foo                   # =&gt; foo
puts :foo.to_s(:upcase)     # =&gt; FOO
</code></pre>

<p>and a partial spec:</p>

<pre><code>describe :Symbol do

  it "should return the symbol as a string when to_s is called" do
    :foo.to_s.should eql 'foo'
  end

  it "should delegate to the original Symbol.to_s method when to_s is called with unknown arguments" do
    # Yeah, wish I knew how to test that
  end

  it "should return the symbol name as uppercase when to_s(:upcase) is called" do
    :foo.to_s(:upcase).should eql "FOO"
  end

end
</code></pre>
