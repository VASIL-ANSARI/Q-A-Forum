<p>Your question is actually operating system or file system specific.</p>

<p>All files (on POSIX systems like Linux, and probably also on Windows) can only be truncated at their tail: the file system layer of your OS does not allow removing bytes at the front (or in the middle) of the file (viewed as a sequence of bytes).</p>

<p>So you need to copy the N last lines elsewhere (in some other temporary file) then rename that temporary file appropriately.</p>

<p>(BTW, my answer is not Python specific. It is the same in C++ or Ocaml ...)</p>
