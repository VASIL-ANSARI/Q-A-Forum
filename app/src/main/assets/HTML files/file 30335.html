<p>I think this happens because you have "." (the current folder) on the classpath. That is a) a bad idea and b) makes your app break in odd ways.</p>

<p>What you need to understand is the difference between a file and a resource. A file is something outside of the classpath.</p>

<p>You should use <code>File</code> and <code>FileReader</code> to access them.</p>

<p>A resource is something on the classpath. Paths for resources always use <code>/</code> as file separator and not <code>File.separator</code>.</p>

<p>Another way to fix this is to add <code>$HOME/repository/</code> (Linux) or <code>%HOME%/repository/</code> to the classpath and load the resource using <code>"resources/api_templates/api.xml"</code>. for this to work, <code>resources</code> must be a folder in <code>$HOME/repository/</code>.</p>

<p>If you don't do this, then all files in your home directory (or whatever directory you happen to start the application in) are added as resources to the classpath.</p>
