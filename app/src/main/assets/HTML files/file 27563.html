<p>I assume this is for an assignment?</p>

<p>Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Separate the cases where you get an open bracket from the ones where you get a closing bracket by using something like if/else if statements</p></li>
<li><p>When you get an open bracket, you want to push it on the stack and that should be it</p></li>
<li><p>When you get a closing bracket, you want to verify the top of the stack to see if there is an associated opening bracket of the <strong>same type (if this is relevant for you)</strong>, and remove that opening bracket by popping the stack.</p></li>
<li><p>When the loop finishes, the stack should be empty, or else there is an error</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You probably want this structure:</p>

<pre><code>for (size_t i=0; i&lt;ie.size(); i++)
{
    if (/*conditions for open brackets*/) 
    {
        //Push the bracket on the stack
    }
    else if (/*conditions for closing brackets*/)
    {
        //Check the top of the stack if there is an opening bracket
        //If so, pop the stack. If not, error.
    }
}
</code></pre>
