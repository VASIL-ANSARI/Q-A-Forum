<p>In general, you shouldnât try to submit anything built with a beta SDK (such as the one that includes WatchKit support) to the App Store. Youâll need to remove the WK bits from your appâor move them to a branchâand then build the app with the current public version of Xcode to submit it to the App Store.</p>
