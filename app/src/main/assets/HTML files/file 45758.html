<p>It's normal that you cannot insert a duplicate record if you have a unique primary key.
You have been talking about multiple tables, but you've schown us just one table definition.
I I've understood well your problem, you would something like this:</p>

<pre><code>create proc insert_data 
-- params are coming here
as
if not exists(select 1 from your_target_table1 where column = @condition)
   --your insert comes here
else
  -- do nothing or log en error in an error table or do an update
if not exists(select 1 from your_target_table2 where column = @condition)
   --your insert comes here
else
  -- do nothing or log en error in an error table or do an update
-- and soon
</code></pre>
