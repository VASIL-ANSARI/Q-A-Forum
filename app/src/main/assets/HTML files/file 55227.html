<p>the data you are passing to the resolve is an object and not an array.</p>

<p>objects do not have a length property, calling length on an object will give you undefined unless you have assigned a length property on it.</p>

<pre><code>var arrayLike = ['a', 'b']
console.log(arrayLike.length)
//outputs: 2

var objectLike = { "a": 1, "b": 2 }
console.log(objectLike.length)
// outputs: undefined (no length property on the object, only a and b.
</code></pre>
