<p>The <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/api/org/hibernate/Session.html#load%28java.lang.Class,%20java.io.Serializable%29" rel="nofollow">load javadoc</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return the persistent instance of the given entity class with the
  given identifier, assuming that the instance exists. This method might
  return a proxied instance that is initialized on-demand, when a
  non-identifier method is accessed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hibernate (if not specified otherwise) will lazy-load instances and proxy them so when you try to access a field then the proxy will get the value from your database. </p>

<p>In your particular case the Linked property will be pointing mostly to a proxy that will have lazy loaded properties too. Hibernate makes this to not to load your entire database in one query (or in this case, your load method).</p>
