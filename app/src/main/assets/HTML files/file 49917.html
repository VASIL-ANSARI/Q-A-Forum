<p>I think this thread might be very connected to your issue. I'm not familiar with onsen, but what you would like to do anyways is to control the behavior from some controller, and with UI-route-provider, you could manage to control if page reloads on switch.</p>

<p>See the first answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21714655/angular-js-angular-ui-router-reloading-current-state-refresh-data">here</a></p>
