<p>You have to define <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733127.aspx" rel="nofollow">data contract</a> for your posted data - generally class or set of related classes which will be used to deserialize JSON message and use that class as input parameter. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb412179.aspx" rel="nofollow">Here is example</a> how to use data contracts without WCF service - it can help you to define correct contract for your message.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I just noticed that you are posting url encoded values - that is not a JSON request and it has different content type: <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. JSON request for WCF is JSON passed in request content. Working with URL encoded requests in WCF is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/604463/best-way-to-support-application-x-www-form-urlencoded-post-data-with-wcf">hard</a>. This will change in Web API which <a href="http://wcf.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Exposing%20a%20service%20over%20HTTP%20using%20HTTP%20Messages" rel="nofollow">has support for these requests</a>.</p>
