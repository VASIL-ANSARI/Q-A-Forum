  <p>Why should I use the more complicated method I mentioned first, when I can create a dynamical 2d array with this one line:</p>

<p>You would need that when the number of columns are different in the rows. Say you have a 2D array that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4
9 8 8 5 6 4
</code></pre>

<p>For a case like this the second method won't work. You need to use:</p>

<pre><code>p[0] = new int[10];
p[1] = new int[4];
p[2] = new int[6];
</code></pre>
