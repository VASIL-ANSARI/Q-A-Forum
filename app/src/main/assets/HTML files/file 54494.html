<p>You've got a whole lot of problems to correct...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have misunderstood scanf greatly</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't return what it read</li>
<li>It doesn't accept a prompt</li>
<li>When reading from the terminal, it doesn't "see" anything until return is pressed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What does your method <code>Pop()</code> return when the stack is empty?</p></li>
<li><p>What does your method <code>Top()</code> return when the stack is empty?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did you write <code>while(mystack.top != -1)</code>?  Would it make more sense to write <code>while (!isEmpty(mystack))</code> and then write an <code>isEmpty</code> method?</p></li>
<li><p>You didn't initialize <code>input</code> - do yo know what is in it at the start?</p></li>
<li><p>Your indention "scheme" makes my head hurt. :)</p></li>
</ul>
