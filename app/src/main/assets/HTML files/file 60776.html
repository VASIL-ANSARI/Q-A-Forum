<p>Per my experience, the following steps may be useful for you.</p>

<p>1.You should use a pure Eclipse Environment and you could get a pure eclipse from this URL <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/</a>.</p>

<p>2.You could click Help->Installation Details in order in your eclipse Env and then you could select Configuration pane.
    After, you could click View Error Log to see whether there are some plug-in conflict error.

3.You could get the Plug-in installed by the Eclipse Marketplace. Click Help->Eclipse Marketplace in order and then input word azure in the search bar. After, you could see the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse and you could click install button to install it.
