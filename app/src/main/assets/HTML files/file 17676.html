<p>Not a lot to go on there, but I think what you're looking for is to flip the <code>width</code> and <code>max-width</code> values:</p>

<pre><code>#container2 {
  width: 90%;
  max-width: 960px;
  /* etc, etc... */
}
</code></pre>

<p>That'll give you a container that's 90% of the width of the available space, up to a maximum of 960px, but that's dependent on its container being resizable itself. Responsive design is a whole big ball of wax though, so this doesn't even scratch the surface.</p>
