<p>I'm not sure why you wouldn't recieve any errors at your FROM address, but your JSON contains the following flaws:</p>

<ul>
<li>, near the end makes the string invalid json</li>
<li>spaces around the first % in %name%, that might make sendgrid think it's an invalid substitution tag</li>
<li>if you use the X-SMTPAPI header to specify multiple recipients, you are not supposed to add a standard SMTP <code>TO</code> using AddTo().</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides that, you didn't wrap the header at 72 characters (see the <a href="https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/using_the_smtp_api.html" rel="nofollow">example</a> in the documentation).</p>
