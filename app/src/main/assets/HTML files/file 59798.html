<p>You can just change to an inequality.  And, you should also use <code>JOIN</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT basetable.letter as test_letter, basetable.d1, basetable.d2,
       overlaptable.letter as overlap_letter, overlaptable.d1 as overlap_d1, overlaptable.d2 as overlap_d2
FROM test basetable JOIN
     test overlaptable
     ON basetable.d1 &lt;= overlaptable.d2 AND
        basetable.d2 &gt;= overlaptable.d1
WHERE basetable.letter &lt; overlaptable.letter  -- This is the change
ORDER BY basetable.letter, basetable.d1;
</code></pre>
