<p>The problem is that <code>tellp</code> is implemented in terms of the underlying stream buffers <code>pubseekoff</code> with 0 offset from current write head position ( basically, it's just poor design ). Now, the kicker here is that <code>zlib_compressor</code> does not work with <code>output_seekable</code> sinks ( as can be seen in the docs ). This is fairly natural since changing the write head would almost definitively lead to corrupted data. You have the very same problem if you try to decompress.</p>
