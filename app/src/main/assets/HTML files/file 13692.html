<p>Are you saving <code>NSDate</code> in an ivar and checking it after the app is relaunched? It'll be the old date if this is the case.</p>

<p>You could re-initialize the ivar on <code>viewWillAppear</code>, or do it in your <code>AppDelegate</code>. Alternatively you can also set it to <code>nil</code> on exit.</p>
