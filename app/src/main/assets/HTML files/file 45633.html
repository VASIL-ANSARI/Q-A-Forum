<p>Simply configure your FK to delete on cascade:</p>

<pre><code>modelBuilder.Entity&lt;Company&gt;().HasMany(m =&gt; m.Members).WithOptional().HasForeignKey(m =&gt; m.CompanyId).WillCascadeOnDelete(true);
</code></pre>

<p>Cascading deletes always work in one direction, from the referenced table (Companies) to the referencing table (Users), so deleting a company will also delete its users, but deleting a user won't do anything to the referenced company.</p>
