<p>The effect you're seeing is almost certainly due to rate-limit type policies on the Twitter API (multiple requests in quick succession).  They keep a tight watch on how you're using their API:  the first step is to check their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms" rel="nofollow">terms of use</a> and policies on <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting" rel="nofollow">rate limiting</a>, and make sure you're in compliance.</p>

<p>Two things jump out at me:</p>

<ol>
<li>You're hitting the API with multiple requests in rapid succession.  Most REST APIs, including Google search, are not going to allow you to do that.  These APIs are very visible targets, and it makes sense that they'd be pro-active about preventing denial-of-service attacks.</li>
<li>You don't have a <strong>User Agent</strong> specified in your request.  Most APIs require you to send them a meaningful UA, as a way of helping them identify you.</li>
</ol>
