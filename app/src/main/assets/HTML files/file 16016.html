<p>System.Configuration.dll is from v2.0 of the Framework.  The file in the location you found is still the same as the .NET 2.0 file, but it's just there as a packaged component of the 3.5 Client Profile (with the Client Profile just being a trimmed down version of full .NET).</p>

<p>Version 3.5 of .NET is just a set of extensions on version 2.0 as it runs on the 2.0 CLR, and, as such, implements 2.0, 3.0, and 3.5 versions of the DLLs from the .NET framework.  The classes in System.Configuration.dll were introduced, and are still all from, version 2.0 of the framework, thus the DLL itself will always be 2.0.0.0</p>
