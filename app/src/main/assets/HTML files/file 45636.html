<p>The problem is that you've got two entirely independent properties called <code>Facts</code> for an <code>Apple</code>. That's a really bad idea - it makes this sort of thing really confusing. The compiler is using whichever one it has access to, based on the compile-time type of the expression you're using.</p>

<p>You should already be getting a warning about this - don't ignore warnings! Here's a short but complete program demonstrating the problem:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

class Fruit
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

class Apple : Fruit
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}


class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var apple = new Apple { Name = "AppleName" };
        Fruit fruit = apple;
        Console.WriteLine(fruit.Name); // Nothing!
        fruit.Name = "FruitName";
        Console.WriteLine(((Fruit) apple).Name); // FruitName
        Console.WriteLine(((Apple) fruit).Name); // AppleName
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One object, two names... depending on how you "view" the object.</p>

<p>Just get rid of the declarations of the <code>Facts</code> properties in <code>Apple</code> and <code>Orange</code>.</p>
