<p>I wasn't sure on the direction you were intending to sort in, so I included indexes for both - you should delete one, if you're not planning to use it, but this should do the trick for you:         </p>

<pre><code>class Article
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :comments_count, :type =&gt; Integer, :default =&gt; 0
  index [[ :comments_count, Mongo::ASCENDING ]]
  index [[ :comments_count, Mongo::DESCENDING ]]
  has_many :comments

  before_save :update_comments_count

  protected
  def update_comments_count
    self.comments_count = self.comments.count
  end
end
</code></pre>
