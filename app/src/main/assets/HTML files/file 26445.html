<p>Are you aware of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/whirlingdervishescplusplus/references/scope-and-lifetime" rel="nofollow">Scope and Lifetime Of Variables Concept</a> ? If you are, then you do know that what you are trying to do invokes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" rel="nofollow">"Undefined Behavior"</a>. You are lucky your code is even printing out something or not at all printing rather than referencing the unallocated memory and crashing due to Heap corruption.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap">SO Soln</a>::</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To what extent are stack/heap controlled by the OS or language
  runtime?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The OS allocates the stack for each system-level thread when the thread is created. Typically the OS is called by the language runtime to allocate the heap for the application.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is their scope?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The stack is attached to a thread, so when the thread exits the stack is reclaimed.</strong> The heap is typically allocated at application startup by the runtime, and is reclaimed when the application (technically process) exits.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What determines the size of each of them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The size of the stack is set when a thread is created. The size of the heap is set on application startup, but can grow as space is needed (the allocator requests more memory from the operating system).</p>
