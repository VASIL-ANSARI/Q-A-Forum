<p>OpenGL 2.1 might be the best. as a comparison it has relatively the same compatibility as DirectX 9c, which is the latest Windows xp can get, and i know there are a lot of XP boxes out there. some of my friends still prefer xp.</p>

<p>Graphic cards that don't support these APIs at this point of time might very well be very obsolete.</p>

<p>If a user cannot run your game using 2.1 you might have to suggest the user to buy a newer computer. you might even want to use OpenGL 3.0, if you adopt this thinking.</p>

<p>In my opinion, i would try learning 2.1 first and getting some practice, and after that, start using 3.x and eventually 4.x. Big game companies usually dont care about compatibility and have the user buy new hardware.</p>
