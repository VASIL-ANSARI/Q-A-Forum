<p>If no space is taken in a row or column or diagonal, then they will all be <code>" "</code>.  However, that will still satisfy a condition, such as</p>

<pre><code>board[i][0].equals(board[i][1]) &amp;&amp; board[i][1].equals(board[i][2])
</code></pre>

<p>Then it will return <code>" "</code> right away and not check the other positions.  <code>" "</code> is the winner!  But you also use <code>" "</code> to indicate that there's no winner.</p>

<p>Add an additional check to your conditions to make sure that the first position you check is not equal to <code>" "</code> before checking the rest of the conditional expression:</p>

<pre><code>!" ".equals(board[i][0]) &amp;&amp;
board[i][0].equals(board[i][1]) &amp;&amp;
board[i][1].equals(board[i][2])
</code></pre>

<p>And you can change the other conditions similarly.</p>
