<p>android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout takes two views, first is the main content view and the second is the view drawn on drawer slide.</p>

<p>So I suggest to wrap all the views other than the main content in a layout and put it under the main content layout.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>As I understand you want to add a button under the listview of the right drawer, so you should wrap the listview with a button in a linear layout and don't forget to set the gravity of it to the right</p>
