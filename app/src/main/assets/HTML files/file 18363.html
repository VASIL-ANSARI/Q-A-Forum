<p>Try this.</p>

<pre><code>= CStr(SUM(CInt(Fields!TOTPRICE.Value)) + SUM(CInt(Fields!TAX.Value)))
</code></pre>

<p>Ok i think your problem occurres due to which both of your fields' type are string, so before you can perform an add operation you need to convert them to integer </p>

<p>You need to convert the result to string in order to present it in the placeholder</p>

<p>I have created an example for you, First the QUERY</p>

<p>Next the report in edit mode

<p>Has you can see i am presenting the TOPPRICE in the first column and the TAX in the second column and i wrote an expression for the third column</p>

<pre><code>= CStr(CInt(Fields!TOTPRICE.Value) + CInt(SUM(Fields!TAX.Value)))
</code></pre>

<p>This is the results</p>
