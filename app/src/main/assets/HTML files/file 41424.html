<p>Remove the <code>css: paths.css,</code> in the compass config. Otherwise compass thinks it should generate a css directly.</p>

<pre><code>var compass = require('gulp-compass');
var autoprefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer');

gulp.task('app-compass', function() {
    var stream = gulp.src('./app/styles/index.scss')
        .pipe(compass({

            sass: 'app/styles',
            image: 'app/assets/images',
            generated_images_path: paths.images
        }))
        .pipe(autoprefixer())
        .pipe(gulp.dest(paths.css));
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I just ran it again, and indeed, it created the css directory in the root. I had only checked the app/cssâ¦ Sorry, it looks like the documentation says that it is not possible for the ruby compass to work that way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please make sure to add css and sass options with the same value in
  config.rb since compass can't output css result directly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't see a good solution at the moment. Fortunately, the extra file generation wont kill your performance.</p>

<p>Or you could have a look at Bourbon, which is pretty similar to Compass and better integrated into the node environment (because it is only the mixins without a special compiler of its own):</p>
