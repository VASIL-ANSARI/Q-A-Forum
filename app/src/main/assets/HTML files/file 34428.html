<p>You can use both Zurb Foundation and Twitter Bootstrap with Codeigniter (or any PHP frameworks). You just need to link the correct CSS file to your page. The choice between these 2 is entirely dependent on what all CSS features you want. Please check their respective websites to find the components that they provide. I personally think Bootstrap has more number of components.</p>
