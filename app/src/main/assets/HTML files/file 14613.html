<p>If your local proxy or box is configured to allow entering connections, the easiest is to assign a fixed name that will be mapped to your (dynamic) IP.</p>

<p>There are a lot of dynamic DNS free solutions on the web (ex : <a href="http://www.no-ip.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.no-ip.com/</a>)</p>

<p>If you just want to make a one time test, you can see what IP you have with a service like this one : <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatismyip.com/</a></p>
