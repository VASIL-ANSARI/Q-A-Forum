<p><strong>Be sure you're plugin key is correct.</strong> Near the top of your <code>atlassian-plugin.xml</code> you should find a line that looks like: <code>&lt;atlassian-plugin key="${project.groupId}.${project.artifactId}" ...&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>project.groupId</code> is the groupId in your pom.xml, and the <code>project.artifactId</code> is the artifactId in your pom.xml.</p>

<p>So lets say your groupId was <code>com.atlassian.plugins</code> and your artifactId was <code>tabpanel</code>, then using your web resource key which is <code>tabpanel-resources</code> (as shown in this line <code>&lt;web-resource key="tabpanel-resources" name="tabpanel Web Resources"&gt;</code>), the resulting requireResource statement should be:</p>

<pre><code>#requireResource("com.atlassian.plugins.tabpanel:tabpanel-resources")
</code></pre>

<p>This should be put at the top of your Velocity template and the macro will put the resources into the head element of the resulting HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Possible other cause</strong></p>

<p>The <code>#requireResource</code> part is a velocimacro which is made accessible by the webResourceManager object being available in the Velocity template. So if it doesn't work, make sure an instance of <a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/latest/com/atlassian/jira/plugin/webresource/JiraWebResourceManager.html" rel="nofollow">JiraWebResourceManager</a> is put into a context map for the velocity template with the key of "webResourceManager".</p>
