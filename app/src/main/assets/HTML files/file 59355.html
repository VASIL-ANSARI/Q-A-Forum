<p>Since there is no fixpack 5 for WebSphere Application Server traditional 8.5, I assume you're talking about 8.5.5 fixpack 5 or 8.5.5.5.  According to <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27005002" rel="nofollow">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27005002</a>, 8.5.5.5 is shipped with Java SDK 7.1.2.10, but you said you removed that and installed Java SDK 7.1.3.40. The only way you could safely do that would be to install a later fixpack but I don't see any 8.5.5 fixpack listed on the above page as shipping with SDK 7.1.3.40.  This may explain why your server is broken and even installing Java 6 doesn't fix the issue.  It is key to remember that you can not manually service the SDK level of WebSphere Application Server traditional, it can only be serviced by installing fixpacks.  If you need a WebSphere Application Server where you can bring your own JDK, consider Liberty instead.  </p>
