<p>You weren't that far away, as far as I can tell you just needed to add a <code>GROUP BY</code> clause, which groups by <code>ID</code> and gets a count of the books per <code>ID</code>. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT MEMBER.ID, COUNT(*)
FROM MEMBER, CHECK_OUT
WHERE MEMBER.ID = CHECK_OUT.MemID
GROUP BY MEMBER.ID;
</code></pre>
