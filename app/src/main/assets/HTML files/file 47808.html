<p>ok I've fixed the problem.
If anyone ever stumbles across such an issue , the solution is to copy the image to a more applicable Drawable folder.</p>

<p>In my case, I placed the image only in drawable-hopi at first, then I've noticed that the Eclipse emulator works perfectly ,but my phone with 1080p resolution gets sluggish, so I just copied the image to the drawable-xxhdpi and it solved it. </p>
