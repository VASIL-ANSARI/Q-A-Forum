<p>I figured my problem might be heap corruption from some previous code. A way to debug that is to comment off snippets of previous code to see whether the bug would go away or come back. Almost immediately I found that I was calling dismissModalViewControllerAnimated: on the current view controller's parent controller.  Why that works in iOS 4.x I have no idea.  The problem I face is that I have two modal dialogs that I need to close simultaneously, which I cannot get working, but that is a different question.</p>
