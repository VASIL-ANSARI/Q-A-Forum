<p>Basically when <code>$destroy</code> is broadcasted from the scope, it also means that the scope has invoked the <code>$destroy()</code> method. This means that everything related to that scope is also being cleaned up, including the <code>watchers</code>, <strong><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/rootScope.js#L841" rel="nofollow">this part of the source code</a></strong> shows how the <code>$destroy()</code> method empties the watchers of that scope.</p>
