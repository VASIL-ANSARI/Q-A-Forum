<p>I don't think there is an easy way to directly manipulate the raw camera stream using the GPU from the end-user (or developer)'s perspective. The chip vendor does have the interface between the camera pipeline and the GPU. Some of the interface might be open for the phone vendors as well. But those interface are definitely for internal-usage only. They will be used either in the driver or the system-level application, I don't see how a developer can directly access those kind of interface. </p>
