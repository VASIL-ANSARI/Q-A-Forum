<p>Areas could be considered nodes in a connected graph.  The edges are defined by what nodes a particular node is connected to.</p>

<p>You could define your area class something like this.</p>

<pre><code>public class Area
{
    public string Name {get;set;}
    public string Left {get;set;}
    public string Right {get;set;}
    public string Up {get;set;}
    public string Down {get;set;}

    // if you really need an x-y location put it here.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then have a dictionary in the background to access the relevant information.  Dictionaries are great because you can use the name of a room to access its properties rather than an index.</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string,Area&gt; MyDungeon = new Dictionary&lt;string,Area&gt;();

// define two areas that are linked.

Area hall = new Area();
hall.Name = "hall"
hall.Left = "room"; // go left from here to get to the room

Area room = new Area();
room.Name = "room";
room.Right = "hall"; // go right to get to the hall

MyDungeon.Add(hall.Name,hall);
MyDungeon.Add(room.Name,room);
</code></pre>

<p>Let's start the user off in the hall.</p>

<pre><code>Area CurrentArea = MyDungeon["hall"]; 
</code></pre>

<p>Now say the user presses the left arrow key and you need to handle it.  You could do something like the following.</p>

<pre><code>private void Move_PreviewKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
{
    if(e.Key == Key.Left)
      {
          CurrentArea = MyDungeon[CurrentArea.Left];
          txtbox_ticker.AppendText("You are now in " + CurrentArea.Name);
      }

    else if(e.Key == Key.Right)
      {
          CurrentArea = MyDungeon[CurrentArea.Right];
          txtbox_ticker.AppendText("You are now in " + CurrentArea.Name);
      }

}
</code></pre>
