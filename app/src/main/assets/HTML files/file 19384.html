<p>I would check the RFC as this is the exact specification of the protocol. The problem with DNS is, that there is more than one RFC. For a simple start, I would check <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035" rel="nofollow">RFC 1035</a> which contains the basics. If you need advanced functionality, check the other related RFCs.</p>
