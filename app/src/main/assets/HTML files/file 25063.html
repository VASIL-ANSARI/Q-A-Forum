<p>It's not possible<sup>*</sup>. Think about why templates need to be in header files in the first place: so that every .cpp file which uses code instantiated from a template can access it (templates are instantiated on demand only).</p>

<p>So in a way, you can think of a class template as a template for data layout (data members) plus a set of templates, one for each member function. Therefore, all members of a template class are treated as templates. You can even explicitly specialise a member function of a class template.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup> As always, if explicit instantiation is an option, you can define the member function in a .cpp file and provide all required expicit instantiations in that .cpp file.</p>
