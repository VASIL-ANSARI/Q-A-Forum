<p>"Is the navigation controller just doing something like keeping that object in case it needs it at some point?"</p>

<p>Yup. That is exactly what it is doing. It will send you <code>viewDidLoad</code> and <code>viewDidUnload</code> messages though. And that is the place where you should allocate and free resources that your viewcontroller uses.</p>

<p>Note that <code>viewDidUnload</code> will only be called when the system thinks it needs to free memory.</p>

<p>If you need more immediate control over when things are loaded and freed then a better place might be <code>viewWillAppear:</code> and <code>viewDidDisappear:</code>.</p>

<p>My alloc/init methods for viewcontrollers are usually pretty empty or not even there.</p>
