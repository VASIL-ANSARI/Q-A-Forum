<p>Added permissions on the ...copy-www-build-step.sh file and that fixed THIS build error. On to the next...</p>

<p>In order for these permissions to stay even after doing a full-checkout from SVN via Jenkins, find the copy-www-build-step in your source control. View the properties for the file, and add svn:executable.</p>

<p>This fixes it so you don't have to keep updating the permissions if you do a full checkout for every build.</p>
