<p>It can't find the class: <code>com.bugfullabs.depress.Splash.</code> First thing is to make sure there's not a typo in the package name. (seems like it should be bugfullaps)</p>

<p>Next, is the Splash class contained in a library? If so, check your Java Build Path configuration and make sure under the Order and Export tab that your library file is checked so that it's exported with the application.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just remembered, if you have a <code>lib</code> directory, rename it to <code>libs.</code> That's one of the things that changed from the version you were using. Good luck!</p>
