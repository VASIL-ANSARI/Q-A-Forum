<p>No, an archive file must be stored in accessible file system to use it with TrueZIP. But you have a number of other options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>TrueZIP uses instances of the IOPoolService interface to manage temporary files. You could provide your own implementation which encrypts all temporary files or maybe even just stores them on the heap (if they are small). Have a look at the TrueZIP Driver FILE to see the reference implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>You could use the ParanoidZipRaesDriver to use RAES encrypted ZIP files. This driver ensures that no unencrypted temporary files are used by limiting the number of concurrent threads for writing an archive file to one.</p></li>
<li><p>You could use the standard ZIP drivers with FsOutputOption.ENCRYPT to switch on WinZip AES encryption. To ensure that no unencrypted temporary files are used, you could then override the ZipDriver.newOutputSocket method just like the ParanoidZipRaesDriver does.</p></li>
</ul>
