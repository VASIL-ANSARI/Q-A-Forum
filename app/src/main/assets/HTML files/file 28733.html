<p>As you are using MySQL, you can select fields across databases. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/674115/select-columns-across-different-databases">this related question</a> for
details. For example you should be able to do this:</p>

<pre><code>err := db.QueryRow(`
    SELECT 
        db1.users.username 
    FROM 
        db1.users 
    JOIN 
        db2.comments 
        ON db1.users.id = db2.comments.username_id
`).Scan(&amp;username)
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course simply fetch all entries from <code>db2.comments</code> using a second database connection and use the values in a query to <code>db1.users</code>. This is, of course, not recommended as it is the job of the database server which it can, most likely, do better than you.</p>
