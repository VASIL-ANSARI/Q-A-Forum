<p>Use <code>withUnsafePointer</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>let outputStream = NSOutputStream(toMemory: ())
outputStream.open()

var count: Int = 0x01020304 // = encodedDataArray.count in your program
withUnsafePointer(&amp;count) { (pointer: UnsafePointer&lt;Int&gt;) -&gt; Void in
    outputStream.write(UnsafePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;(pointer), maxLength: 4)
}

outputStream.propertyForKey(NSStreamDataWrittenToMemoryStreamKey)
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;04030201&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it'll write the bytes in little-endian order (because all platforms on which Swift currently runs are little-endian). If you want to write in big-endian, use <code>encodedDataArray.count.bigEndian</code>.</p>
