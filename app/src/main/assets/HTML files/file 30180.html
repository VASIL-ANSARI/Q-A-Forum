<p>First the value array of The dictionary(teachersList) is unsorted and you don't know how the element in are arranged.</p>

<p>Second <code>Dok Teacher</code> and <code>Test Teacher</code> is the same on the second word, there is no order between them, the order of them after sorting is depended on the sorting method(stable or unstable) and the order of the original array.</p>

<p>If elements in the value array have the same order in <code>teachersNames</code>, the result will be the same. Otherwise the order of <code>Dok Teacher</code> and <code>Test Teacher</code> is undefined.</p>

<p><b>Note: value array here is <code>teachersList.allValues</code></b></p>
