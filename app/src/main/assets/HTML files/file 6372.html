<p>The only options in straight jQuery are <code>swing</code> (the default) and <code>linear</code>, but with jQuery UI you have <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/#easing" rel="nofollow">all of these options</a>.</p>

<p>I think <code>swing</code> is S-shaped already, but there are definitely more options in jQuery UI.</p>
