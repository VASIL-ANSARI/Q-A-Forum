<p>UISplitViewController does pretty much everything you ask.  If there is enough space it will display your view controllers side-by-side (see the preferredDisplayMode property).  If you really want to force a side-by-side view controller arrangement in a confined space (ie. portrait), which is probably not advisable from a UX perspective, then you will need to write your own custom split view controller.  Just layout 2 view controllers inside a parent view controller side-by-side and give each of them equal widths.  </p>

<p>Also, you do not have to use a UITableView for your master view in a UISplitViewController.  Each view controller in completely customizable.</p>
