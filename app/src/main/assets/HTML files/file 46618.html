<p>Before asking question please google it.Have you tried <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9588026/passing-a-double-value-through-to-a-different-class-in-android-java">that</a>.There are tons of examples.</p>

<p>You can use intents, which are messages sent between activities. In a intent you can put all sort of data, String, int, etc.</p>

<p>In your case, in activity2, before going to activity1, you will store a String message this way :</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(activity2.this, activity1.class);
intent.putExtra("message", message);
startActivity(intent);
</code></pre>

<p>In activity1, in onCreate(), you can get the String message by retrieving a Bundle (which contains all the messages sent by the calling activity) and call getDouble() on it :</p>

<pre><code>Bundle bundle = getIntent().getExtras();
String message =  bundle.getDouble("message");
</code></pre>
