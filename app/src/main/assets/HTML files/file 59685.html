<p>According to the error you provided, I recommend that you could try to make sure the specific assembly is deployed to Azure. You could use Kudu Console and check your assembly in the following path:</p>

<p><code>d:\home\site\wwwroot\app_data\jobs\[triggered|continuous]\{job name}</code></p>

<p>Additionally, if you deploy your WebJob via the Azure Portal, you could directly upload a zip file that contains the WebJob's files. For more details about Web Jobs, you could follow this <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Web-jobs" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>.</p>
