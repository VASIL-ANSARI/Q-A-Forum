<p>This works well in my gcc 4.4.7, and in linux kernel source code, there are many circumstances written in this way. Like file_operations, inode_operations, etc. It is combined with strategy pattern and some object-oriented programming thoughts.
So, I think it is not bad form in C, the only flaw I think is that you can write it like this:</p>

<pre><code>a b = {.x=2, .y=3, .add=add}; 
</code></pre>

<p>This is more readable and c style.</p>
