<p>You will need to map the DTOs in the client side anyway, so, for symmetry, it is better to make the inverse mapping in the server side. This way you isolate your conversions into well-separated abstraction layers.</p>

<p>Abstraction layers are good not only for validations, but to insulate your code from changes below/above it, and make your code more testable and with less repetitions.</p>

<p>Also, unless you notice a great performance bottleneck in the extra conversion, remember: early optimization is the root of all evil. :)</p>
