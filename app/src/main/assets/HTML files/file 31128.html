<p><code>firstLocation</code> in your code is not the first location since location updates started; it is the first location to be returned to you since the previous callback to the <code>locationManager:didUpdateLocations:</code> method (the location services may collect multiple locations before calling back to your delegate method in certain circumstances -- the most recent location is always going to be the last object in the locations array).</p>

<p>If you need to store the first location since location updates started, you should create a property such as</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, strong) CLLocation *startingLocation;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the <code>locationManager:didUpdateLocations:</code> method, add the code:</p>

<pre><code>if (!self.startingLocation) {
    self.startingLocation = [locations objectAtIndex:0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will store the starting location into the property after the first callback. (You can set the property to nil if you want to reset it.)</p>

<p>Don't forget that the very first location you receive many not be very accurate, as it takes time for location services to get a fix on the device's position if they were not recently enabled.</p>
