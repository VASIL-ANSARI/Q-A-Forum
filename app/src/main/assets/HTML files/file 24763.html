<p>A long shot but I think your PHP code (the one that has the AJAX function or one of it's includes) may have whitelines infront of the <code>&lt;php</code> tag (or somewhere else). </p>

<p>Change the php method that your ajax code calls so that it return a hardcoded value. When you test it again, you can be sure that it isn't the inner logic and see if the lines are still there. Example:</p>

<pre><code>//get project content
public function getProjectContent($projectid, $email) {
    $this-&gt;projectid= $projectid;
    $this-&gt;email = $email;
    $gpc    =   $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare('select content from projects where id=? and owner=?');
    $gpc-&gt;execute(array($projectid, $email));
    $result =   $gpc-&gt;fetch();
    $content = $result['content'];
    return "test on first line";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: for people looking for whitespaces in php files, I made a regex which finds them <code>(\s\&lt;\?)|(\?\&gt;\s)</code>.</p>
