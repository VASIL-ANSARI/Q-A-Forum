<p>There are 1 plus N sockets playing in this game. </p>

<p>1 The <strong>listening socket</strong>, which was passed to <code>bind()</code> and <code>listen()</code>. Only this socket is bound to the port on which the server listens.</p>

<p>2 All the N <strong>connected sockets</strong> created by the N 'processes' of the clients connecting to the server, and being returned by <code>accept()</code>. Those sockets are serving the connections to the clients. Such sockets do <strong>not</strong> listen in the sense the <strong>listening socket</strong> does.</p>

<p>The rules you quoted apply to the <strong>listening socket</strong> only. </p>

<p>So if you only run one instance of your server the third rule <em>does not</em> apply, as it <code>bind()</code>s only one socket to <code>listen()</code> on the server's port.</p>
