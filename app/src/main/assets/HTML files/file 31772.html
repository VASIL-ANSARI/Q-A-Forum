<p>Do you mean like how to actually view your background page? You can do that by opening up the extension tab in chrome, finding your extension, and clicking on "Inspect views: background page". That will open up a popup for <code>background.html</code> and from there you can view the background page, use the console to interact with your background script, read the log, etc.</p>
