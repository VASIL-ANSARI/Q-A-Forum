<p>I think this might have to do with how the data in the array is stored. In memory, the data is just stored <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5920944/how-are-3d-arrays-stored-in-c">sequentially</a>. Since <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3473675/are-negative-array-indexes-allowed-in-c">negative array indexes are allowed in C</a> the functional outcome in your case is that forest[1][-1] points to the same data located in cell forest[0][9], which you will note is 'T'.</p>

<p>Because forest[0][9] (aka forest[1][-1]) is 'T', you fail this test</p>

<pre><code>if(forest[i][j-1]!='T' &amp;&amp; forest[i-1][j]!= 'T')
</code></pre>

<p>Which means that a ' ' is registered in cell forest[1][0] instead. Prevent negative index values, and you should be good.</p>
