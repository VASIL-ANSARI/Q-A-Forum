<p>If you inject the constant into your module's config function, you should be able to set whatever properties of the object you want. For example:</p>

<pre><code>angular.module('app', ['ui.bootstrap.buttons']).config(["buttonConfig", function (buttonConfig) {
  buttonConfig.activeClass: 'selected'
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>If you simply redefine the constant, you would be getting rid of the other properties on that constant's object (toggleEvent would no longer be available in your case). Here is a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/hLHxt/1/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle</a> I put together to demonstrate the ability to change the activeClass property of a constant object from "active" to "selected".</p>

<p>The line:</p>

<pre><code>var closeOthers = angular.isDefined($attrs.closeOthers) ? $scope.$eval($attrs.closeOthers) : accordionConfig.closeOthers;
</code></pre>

<p>isn't extending the constant, but rather overriding it. This is saying that if the close-others attribute was put onto the directive than use that, else revert to what was defined in the constant. By using the constant in the config, you can set default values that would be used if these attributes were left off the directives.</p>
