<pre><code>pi = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, dailyIntent,
                                PendingIntent.FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT); 

         // notice getBroadcast()
</code></pre>

<p>where  <code>dailyIntent</code> is an intent for broadcast. This will send the mentioned broadcast intent upon clicking the notification.</p>
