<p>I think they key is in this claim from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177213.aspx" rel="nofollow">Managed Templates on MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a template is not instantiated, itâs not emitted in the metadata. If a template is instantiated, only referenced member functions will appear in metadata.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means that functions that aren't used in the C++ code won't be in the generated DLL and you won't be able to use them from C#. To fix this, you could add a phony function to your C++ code, which references the function:</p>

<pre><code>void phony()
{
    auto vec = gcnew Vector3fP();
    vec-&gt;foo();
}
</code></pre>
