<p>Ok,</p>

<p>After much searching I think I found the answers. This app created its own iCloud subdirectory [with the same name] and if I copy files into it; I can see them. It works.</p>

<p>But I can only see files and not directories, a limitation of NSMetadataQuery it seems.</p>

<p>My investigations also took me to extensions, of which there are half a dozen or more it seems. One of those UIDocument extension, but wait this also only offers single files too. Better I can see folders within my generic icloud account, posted some code <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39899316/uidocumentmenu-document-selected">SO question</a> that works here.</p>

<p>There is a means to identify a custom piece of code to open a specific file type, of which I followed and did this tutorial.</p>

<p>It works well too, google it if this link breaks. But this is a single file in effect; and I wanted a folder. </p>

<p>Might this be the answer, perhaps. But its not really ideal.</p>
