<p>Your Sprite pointer is not initialized.  You see it on the bottom of your screenshot (Sprite is NULL).  </p>

<p>Trying to call a function for a null objject results in an access violation.  </p>

<p>Consider initializing your sprite with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb172797%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>D3DXCreateSprite()</code></a> before using it.  </p>
