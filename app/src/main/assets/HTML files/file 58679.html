<p>This is a classic problem given to new learners in Java. I would suggest to go for a simple approach as it is intended to help you practice your coding skills</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the java source code as a file in your program char by char.</li>
<li>Search for comments beginning. In this case, there are 2, <code>/*</code> and <code>//</code>.</li>
<li>Open a string buffer and start writing the read contents into it.</li>
<li>If its <code>/*</code>, then don't write it in buffer. Keep on moving to next character till you find <code>*/</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat till end of file is reached.</li>
<li>If single line comments need to be removed, then same algorithm can be followed till you get a new line character.</li>
<li>If you need help in reading from file char by char, refer to Java documentation.</li>
<li>When end of file is reached, then write the string buffer back to the file.</li>
</ol>
