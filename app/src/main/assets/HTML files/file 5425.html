<p>The default constructor is only generated if you don't declare any constructors. It's assumed that if you're defining a constructor of your own, then you can also decide whether you want a no-args constructor, and if so define that too.</p>

<p>In C++0x, there will be an explicit syntax for saying you want the default constructor:</p>

<pre><code>struct Foo {
    Foo() = default;
    ... other constructors ...
};
</code></pre>
