<p>Afther some days for serching the web i found this: <a href="http://html5demos.com/contenteditable" rel="nofollow">http://html5demos.com/contenteditable</a></p>

<p>it work only for html 5, and it amazing feature!</p>

<p>if any 1 have this wierd request too, this simple code with get your start:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;div contenteditable="true"&gt;this is a smaple&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this attribute is what make the megic happend: <code>contenteditable="true"</code></p>

<p>in that div, you can throw any thing from out side your work space. meaning, you can do a href with WORD, and just copy it to the div, and it will set it up for you!</p>

<p>1 thing that is still wierd, if you dont have borders to the div, it will not set 1 for you like normal text field or textarea. so if u dont see it, it dosnt mean is not there!</p>

<p>enjoy.</p>
