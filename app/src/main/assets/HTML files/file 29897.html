<p>If you don't need the pElems to live longer than the enclosing scope, there's no need to dynamically allocate at all:</p>

<pre><code>dataStr *  process(char *start, char *stop, GTree* tree)
{
  pElem p;
  while ( (cp != NULL) &amp;&amp; ( cp   &lt; nextI))
  {
      fillPElem(&amp;p, cp, dateP, s);

  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(yes, I know that none of cp, nextI etc. are defined - I just copied from the question).</p>
