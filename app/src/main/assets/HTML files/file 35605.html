<p><code>WEEKDAY()</code> returns 0 to 6 depending on which day of the week it is.  You could put logic in the code to ignore weekend conditions, and go back to the Friday.</p>

<p>Returns the weekday index for date (0 = Monday, 1 = Tuesday, â¦ 6 = Sunday).</p>

<p>So if <code>WEEKDAY(date) - 1  == 5 || WEEKDAY(date) - 1 == 6</code> then make it equal 4 (Friday) instead.</p>
