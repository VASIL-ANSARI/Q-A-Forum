<p>I've had good success using java.awt.Robot to grab a screen shot (or a segment of the screen), but to work with ImageIO, you'll need to store it in a BufferedImage instead of the memory image source.  Then you can call one static method of ImageIO and save the file.  Try something like:</p>

<pre><code>// Capture whole screen
Rectangle region = new Rectangle(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize());
BufferedImage capturedImage = new Robot().createScreenCapture(region);

// Save as PNG
File imageFile = new File("capturedImage.png");
ImageIO.write(capturedImage, "png", imageFile);
</code></pre>
