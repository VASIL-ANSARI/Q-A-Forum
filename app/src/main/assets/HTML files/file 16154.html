<p>Well, are you saving <code>invitationID</code> some where ? if you save that in db it can be benefit, so that you'll get to know that this <code>invitationID</code> is already used by marking it as used in db. This way you can validate double registration.</p>

<p>i have used this kind a invitation registration, i send url link an email then on clicking that link i do validation. before sending the link i generate a unique string and save it in db with respect to that user.</p>
