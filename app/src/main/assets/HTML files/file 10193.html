<p>As awful as it might seem, you might want to consider running your stuff inside Tomcat. You can pack your application as a war, have nice automated deployment options and it's quite easy to tie into the lifecycle of a webapp. Plus, if you need a management frontend, you are halfway there (although JMX might be better suited).</p>

<p>You can also look at Spring Batch/Spring Integration, which might provide components you can use.</p>
