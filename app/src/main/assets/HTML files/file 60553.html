<p>Looking back through the commits, a Junior dev originally assigned the <code>time_start</code> field as a <code>string</code> data-type in table <code>B</code>. The solution was to grab the version number of the previous migration (table <code>A</code>), and run <code>rake db:migrate VERSION=213412341234</code>, then <code>rake db:migrate</code>. It is now saving correctly. </p>
