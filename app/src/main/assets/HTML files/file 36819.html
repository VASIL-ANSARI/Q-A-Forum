<p>CSS is not designed for a single set defined display.
It addresses multiple platforms, screen dimension, print layout,portrait/landscape etc.
You need to design a style for any of these you want your audience to be able to use.
It really is a language in itself.
And once you learn it then you will find each of these target platforms will have their own quirks that will break things in places even if you use defined W3C definitions.</p>

<p>It is well work learning, however for quick adaptation use jquery and jqueryUI widgets.
That in itself is not a fixall and you will still need to know what is going on.</p>
