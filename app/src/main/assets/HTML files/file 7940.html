<p>I'd say Firefox is actually in the right here. According to the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow">W3C's validation tool</a>, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> isn't allowed inside <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Also, <code>checked="true"</code> should be <code>checked="checked"</code>, which might also be causing issues (or could potentially cause issues in other contexts).</p>
