<p>Having the data in a binary tree sorted by <code>data</code> is just like having it in an array with no specific order with respect to queries based on <code>count</code>. Thus you can not do anything better than linear for a single query. If you plan to perform the query multiple times it may be worth it to have an alternative structure ordered by counter. If all you need to support is query for top 10 a binary heap will do just great. If you plan to only perform a few queries you can not improve the performance too much. </p>
