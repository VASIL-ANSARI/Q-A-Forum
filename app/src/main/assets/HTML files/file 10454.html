<p>If this is a test for a MovieList class, create a class called MovieList.</p>

<p>Then in your constructor for that class, make sure it takes in a parameter called track_number, in your test that's the 2.</p>

<p>Then create a method called forward to do whatever you need it to do?</p>

<p>Here's a good example of where I'm going with this:

<p>This may sound ambiguous, but so was the question.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
This is a rough idea of how to create a new MovieList class and initialize it with a parameter called track_number.</p>

<pre><code>def MovieList
  attr_accessor :track_number

  def initialize(track_number)
    @track_number = track_number
  end

  # You can define all your class methods below, you 
  # can start with forward.

  def forward
    # do something...
  end 

end
</code></pre>
