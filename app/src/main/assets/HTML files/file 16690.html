<p>You are kind of right. By overriding the sendEvent: method, and then getting the GSEvent from the UIEvent, you can get the underlying sytem information you are looking for. You could watch the "infoSize" field in the GSEvent record, which should tell you how many touches are involved in the event... But why use GSEvent? You could just put one big UIView in your application, set it's multiple touch interaction property as YES, override it's sendEvent method, and you should get every touch in there, even the 4 and 5 finger gestures. You can forward touches that are not important for you, and don't forward the ones that are not.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
