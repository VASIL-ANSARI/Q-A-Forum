<p>Here's your optimized query. The idea is to get rid of the <code>OR</code>s and the <code>CAST()</code> function on hit_date so that MySQL can utilize a compound index that covers each of the subsets of data. You'll want a compound index on (<code>location_id</code>, <code>target_id</code>, <code>hit_date</code>) in that order. </p>

<p>If your selection size is so large that this is no improvement, then you may as well keep scanning all rows like you're already doing.</p>

<p>Note, surround aliases with back ticks, not single quotes, which are deprecated. I also fixed your <code>CASE</code> clauses which had <code>count</code> instead of <code>1</code>.</p>
