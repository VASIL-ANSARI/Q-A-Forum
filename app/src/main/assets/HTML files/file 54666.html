<p>I have figured out the problem : the parameter LDA given in the documentation of blas (the parameter that comes right after the matrix) corresponds to what they call the "leading dimension of the matrix". You must pass the number of rows of the matrix as LDA only in COLMAJOR system (used by Fortran), if you are using cblas in C or C++ you must pass the number of columns as LDA since the ROWMAJOR system is used. </p>

<p>Hope this may help someone in the future</p>
