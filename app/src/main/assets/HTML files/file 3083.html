<p>I'm not familiar with TF/IDF, but the process can go wrong in many stages generally:</p>

<p>1, Did you remove stopwords? </p>

<p>2, Did you apply stemming? Porter stemmer for example.</p>

<p>3, Did you normalize frequencies for document length? (Maybe the TFIDF thing has a solution for that, I don't know)</p>

<p>4, Clustering is a discovery method but not a holy grail. The documents it retrieves as a group may be related more or less, but that depends on the data, tuning, clustering algorithm, etc.</p>

<p>What do you want to achieve? What is your setup?
Good luck!</p>
