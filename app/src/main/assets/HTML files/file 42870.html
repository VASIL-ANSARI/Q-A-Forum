  <p>One caveat: the read() method, if the size argument is omitted or
  negative, may not read until the end of the data stream; there is no
  good way to determine that the entire stream from a socket has been
  read in the general case.</p>

<p>Maybe the lzma.open trips on huge size/connection errors/timeout because of the above.</p>
