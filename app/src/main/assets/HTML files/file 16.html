<p>It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha blending</a>.</p>

<p>In psuedocode, assuming the background color (blend) always has 255 alpha. Also assumes alpha is 0-255.</p>

<pre><code>alpha=argb.alpha()<br>r = (alpha/255)*argb.r() + (1 - alpha/255)*blend.r()<br>g = (alpha/255)*argb.g() + (1 - alpha/255)*blend.g()<br>b = (alpha/255)*argb.b() + (1 - alpha/255)*blend.b()<br></code></pre>

<p><em>note: you probably need to be a bit (more) careful about floating-point/int math and rounding issues, depending on language. Cast intermediates accordingly</em></p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong></p>

<p>If you don't have a background color with an alpha of 255, the algebra gets alot more complicated. I've done it before and it's a fun exercise left to the reader (if you really need to know, ask another question :). </p>

<p>In other words, what color C blends into some background the same as blending A, then blending B. This is sort of like calculating A+B (which isn't the same as B+A).</p>
