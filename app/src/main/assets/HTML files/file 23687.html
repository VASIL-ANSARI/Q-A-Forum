<p>What you basically want to do is to use a custom adapter, most likely derived from <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter.html" rel="nofollow">BaseAdapter</a>. You will need to override <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter.html#getViewTypeCount%28%29" rel="nofollow">getViewTypeCount()</a> and return the number of different kinds of list items that you have in the list. In your case it's 2 since you have menu names and normal list items.</p>

<p>You will also have to override <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter.html#getItemViewType%28int%29" rel="nofollow">getItemViewType(position)</a> and return either a 0 if the item at the specified position is a normal list item or a 1 if it's a menu name.</p>

<p>Finally you'll also have to override <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Adapter.html#getView%28int,%20android.view.View,%20android.view.ViewGroup%29" rel="nofollow">getView()</a> and return a list item of the appropriate type (menu name or normal list item), based on getItemViewType().</p>

<p>There should be several snippets of code that already does this if you Google a bit. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/britzl/androidutils/blob/master/src/se/springworks/android/utils/view/SectionedAdapter.java" rel="nofollow">SectionedAdapter</a> that does this as well. It's a generic class and it handles sections/heading of a certain type (can be String or some specific class such as Section, Header or MenuName) and section contents as another type. Subclass it and implement the getSectionView() and getItemView(). Add sections and items using addSection() and addItem().</p>
