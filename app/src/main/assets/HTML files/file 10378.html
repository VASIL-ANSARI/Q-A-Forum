<p>Override onReceivedSslError and onReceivedError of your WebViewClient. I'm guessing it is an issue with 2.2 not trusting certain CAs, or a bug that causes problems wildcard domains in SSL  certificates - both of these specific errors will be caught in onReceivedSslError.</p>

<p>If either of these methods gets called, the page might not get finished loading.</p>

<p>If there aren't any errors, your server might be doing something different because of the device's User-Agent - which you might have to manually set.</p>
