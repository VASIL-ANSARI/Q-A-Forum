<p>Ok, the problem is that you're doing a HEAD request. This is what this line does: <code>curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 1);</code> (basically removes the body). Also, later on in the file you also call <code>curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1);</code>, which returns the Headers that the server returns. Looking at your code, it looks like you actually want to just get the XML from the URI that you're requesting, not the headers. So remove those two lines and you should get the XML that you're expecting</p>
