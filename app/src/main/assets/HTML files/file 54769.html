<p>Order of lexer rules is very important in grammar, as the first applicable rule found will be used. You can read more <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35580245/understanding-antlr4-tokens/35664385#35664385">here</a>.</p>

<p>So if you have lexer rules:</p>

<pre><code>ID: [a-zA-Z]+;
FOR: 'for';
</code></pre>

<p>based on its order input "for" will be marked as FOR token or as ID token, because for both it is correct. </p>

<p>As a result, grammars very often contains rule 'ambigous' where all keywords are mentioned so when another token contains keyword it would pass. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>alfaNum: (ALFA | NUM | ambigous | '_' )+?;
ambigous: SELECT | WHERE | FROM | WITH | SET | AS;
</code></pre>

<p>this way if there is alfaNum token "selection", it would pass. If ambigous would not be specified, it would fail over lexer rule <code>SELECT: 'select';</code></p>
