<p>The code does not test if a <em>particular value</em> exists; it tests if an [Array] index was <em>assigned</em> a non-undefined value. (It will also incorrectly detect some false-positive values like <code>null</code> due to using <code>==</code>, but that's for another question ..)</p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>L = ["hello","world","bye"]
a = L["bye"]
b = L[1]
</code></pre>

<p>What is the value of <code>a</code> and what does it say about "bye"? What is the value of <code>b</code> and how does <code>1</code> relate to any of the values which may (or may not) exist as elements of L?</p>

<p>That is, <em>iterating</em> an Array - to find a value of unknown index? to perform an operation on multiple values? - and <em>accessing an element by index</em> are two <em>different</em> operations and cannot be generally interchanged.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the flip side, object properties can be used to achieve a similar (but useful) effect:</p>

<pre><code>M = {hello: 1, world: 1, bye: 1}
c = M["hello"]
</code></pre>

<p>What is the value of <code>c</code> now? How does the value used as the key relate to the data?</p>

<p>In this case the <em>property name</em> (used as a <em>lookup key</em>) relates to the data being checked and can say something useful about it - yes, there <em>is</em> a "hello"! (This can detect some false-positives without using <code>hasOwnProperty</code>, but that's for another question ..)</p>

<hr>

<p>And, of course .. for a small sequence, or an infrequent operation, iterating (or using a handy method like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some" rel="nofollow"><code>Array.indexOf</code></a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some" rel="nofollow"><code>Array.some</code></a>) to find existence of a value is "just fine" and will not result in a "performance impact".</p>
