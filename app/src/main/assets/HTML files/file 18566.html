<p>Your thinking is right in that if a certain set of queries will only ever be run together, they should belong to the same method in the model. Free-standing queries should be in methods of their own, this way you can call them from the controller when required.</p>

<p>To combine multiple queries, you can either make multiple calls from the controller like this:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;your_model-&gt;doQuery1();
$this-&gt;your_model-&gt;doQuery2();
$this-&gt;your_model-&gt;doQuery3();
</code></pre>

<p>Or (and this is what I would do), create a wrapper method in the model that runs those three queries.</p>

<p>So you can do</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;your_model-&gt;runQueries();
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>function runQueries() {
  $this-&gt;doQuery1();
  $this-&gt;doQuery2();
  $this-&gt;doQuery3(); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it more malleable to later change.</p>

<p>Finally, as for your statement 'as much of the logic should be in the controller as possible', this actually goes against the school of though of <code>skinny controller, fat model</code> that some people subscribe to. As any other school of thought, it is not set in stone.</p>
