<p>I would expect <code>string.IndexOf</code> compared to your first code sample to run at least twice as fast (besides any other optimizations that might be done there) since you check for <em>both</em> start and end character in each of your iterations. Your implementation with <code>string.IndexOf</code> on the other hand will check for the end character only after it has successfully found a start character. This cuts the number of operations on each iteration down significantly (one less comparison).</p>
