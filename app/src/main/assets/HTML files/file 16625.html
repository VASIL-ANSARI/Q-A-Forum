<p>It seems to me that it would be fairly straight forward to extend Ext.form.field.Picker and use the jQuery date picker as the picker part.  I've wrapped the FCK editor in an Ext component and it was very easy to do.  Picker involves a few more moving parts, but I think it's worth a try.  </p>

<p>That being said, the idea of picking a few parts of ExtJS to use in a non-Ext app and then trying to marry other things into Ext is going to be painful.  I strongly advise fully embracing ExtJS and then choosing very carefully where you stray away.  Another approach might be to use a different grid system (sorry Evan) that plays nicer with jQuery.</p>
