<p>The real types in Java are implementations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008" rel="nofollow">IEEE754 single and double precision floating point notation</a>. These are approximations of real numbers rather than exact representations. Some real numbers like 0.8 cannot be represented accurately.</p>
