<p>First, continue to investigate if Spatialite is what you need.</p>

<p>However, you need to cut down the number of points that the query is considering:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM track_points 
WHERE segmentId = '22' 
ORDER BY (ABS(latitude - 25.312005) + ABS(longitude - 91.730433))
WHERE latitude BETWEEN 25.31 AND 25.32
      AND
      longitude BETWEEN 91.73 AND 91.74
</code></pre>

<p>You want to set the boundaries as narrow as possible but wide enough to be sure you get at least one result. If your lattitude and longitude are a regular lattice then this is trivial.</p>

<p>You can use <code>BETWEEN @value - @tolerance AND @value + @tolerance</code> to detrimine the values on the fly.</p>
