<p>I think your problem is that there is no Activity for handle the Intent.ACTION_VIEW and Intent.ACTION_WEB_SEARCH actions, to check if there is an Activity for handle your intent you could check this before:</p>

<pre><code>PackageManager packageManager = getPackageManager();
List&lt;ResolveInfo&gt; activities = packageManager.queryIntentActivities(intent, 0);
boolean isIntentSafe = activities.size() &gt; 0;
</code></pre>

<p>if the number of Activity in List <strong>activities</strong> is 0 that means that there is no Activity for handle your Intent by the moment, before trying to start an Activity you should check this first..</p>

<p>EDIT: as we know those Actions are common to android device (maps and web browser), due to this you should check if the URI you are pasing are correct.</p>
