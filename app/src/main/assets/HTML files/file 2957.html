<p>I think you need to have array <code>$thrownNumbers</code>, which holds every number previously thrown. And every new throw (OMG... the word), you check if it's in array. If yes, throw again. Simplest possible solution.</p>

<p>Edit: As for keeping the array during moving to another page, you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li>$_SESSION</li>
<li>cookies (hm)</li>
<li>have serialized array as hidden value in form</li>
</ul>

<p>There.</p>
