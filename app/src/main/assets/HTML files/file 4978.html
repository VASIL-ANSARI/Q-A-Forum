<p>Make an inline table with the hours and left join it to your log_events table:</p>

<pre><code>select
  dummy_hours.hour,
  log_aggregate.METRIC,
  log_aggregate.MINIMUM,
  log_aggregate.MAXIMUM
from (
  select to_char(trunc(to_date('08-NOV-10', 'DD-MON-YY'))+(level-1)/24, 'DD-MON-YY "-" HH24":00"') HOUR
  from dual connect by level &lt;= 48
) dummy_hours, (
  select to_char(day,'DD-MON-YY "-" HH24":00"') AS HOUR,
  round(avg(duration), 2) AS METRIC,
  round(min(duration), 2) AS MINIMUM,
  round(max(duration), 2) AS MAXIMUM
  from log_events
  where day between to_date('08-NOV-10', 'DD-MON-YY') and to_date('08-NOV-10', 'DD-MON-YY') + 2
  and day &gt; to_date('08-NOV-10', 'DD-MON-YY')
  and day &lt; to_date('08-NOV-10', 'DD-MON-YY') + 2
  and company = 'company A'
  and component = 'api layer'
  and event_label = 'execution request'
  group by to_char(day,'DD-MON-YY "-" HH24":00"')
) log_aggregate
where dummy_hours.hour = log_aggregate.hour(+)
order by dummy_hours.hour;
