<p>The form shows twice because you are calling <code>ShowDialog</code> twice but not doing anything with the first call's result.  Change to:</p>

<pre><code>  using(Form1 form = new Form1())
  {
      if(form.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
      {
          using (Game1 game = new Game1())
          {
              game.Run();
          }
      }
  }
</code></pre>
