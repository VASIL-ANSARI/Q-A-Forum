<p>I think you're the control is not getting focused, for some reason. I tried it, too, and the event wouldn't fire for me, either. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/347724/how-can-i-capture-keydown-event-on-a-wpf-page-or-usercontrol-object">This post might offer some insight.</a> Manually setting focus to the user control in the Loaded event didn't work for me, though.</p>

<p>The only thing that did work for me was doing all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>changing the TextBlock to a TextBox and moving the event there (focus is pretty evident with a TextBox)</li>
<li>changing the cast in the event to FrameworkElement (which is where the Name property comes from) instead of Grid</li>
<li>changing the case to the TextBox's name (instead of the grid's name)</li>
<li>changing the event to a PreviewKeyDown (to get the cursor keys to register)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, this only got the event to fire and register properly, the values don't seem to show up (even before I changed the code), but it handles the specific issue of the event not firing.</p>
