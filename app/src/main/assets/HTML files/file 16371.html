<p>You can create a persistent connection to database using <code>PDO</code>. From the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.connections.php" rel="nofollow">manual</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many web applications will benefit from making persistent connections to database servers. Persistent connections are not closed at the end of the script, but are cached and re-used when another script requests a connection using the same credentials. The persistent connection cache allows you to avoid the overhead of establishing a new connection every time a script needs to talk to a database, resulting in a faster web application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$dbh = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', $user, $pass, array(
    PDO::ATTR_PERSISTENT =&gt; true
));
?&gt;
</code></pre>
