<p>Unless there is something not shown here, then I suspect that the matter of making <code>Utility</code> a <code>static</code> method largely comes down to style.  In particular, if you are not injecting the <code>Utility</code> instance rather than instantiating it on demand within, then it is rather pointless.  As it is written, it cannot be overridden nor can it be more easily tested than <code>static</code> method. </p>

<p>As for <code>transient</code>, you are right that it is unnecessary. I wouldn't be surprised if the original developer was using Serialization somewhere in the inheritance or implementation chain, and that they were avoiding a compiler warning by marking the non-serializable instance variable as <code>transient</code>.</p>
