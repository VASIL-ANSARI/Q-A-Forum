<p>From your SQL I assume that you are listing product based on 1 supplier (supplierID = 1) only.</p>

<p>Best practice is do your <strong>known filter at begin of sql</strong> to eliminate record, then use inner join to join other without filter table.</p>

<pre><code>select p.pID, brandname, description, p.EAN, RetailPrice, LowestPrice, min(price), min(price)/lowestprice-1 as afwijking
from 
(select p.pID, p.BrandID p.EAN, Max(t.StartTime) AS maxstarttime
FROM tproducts p INNER JOIN tresults t on supplierID=1 and p.pID=t.pID
group by tresults.pID
) p 
inner join tresults res on (res.websiteID = 1 and p.pID = res.pID and res.starttime = p_max.maxstarttime)
inner join tsupplierproducts sp on (sp.pID = p.pID)
inner join tbrands b on (b.brandID = p.BrandID)
group by p.pID, brandname, description, p.EAN, RetailPrice, LowestPrice
</code></pre>

<p>from above code, I eliminate all supplierID != 1 from tproducts before join tresults. </p>

<p>let me know if the above sql help, and what is the EXPLAIN function result</p>
