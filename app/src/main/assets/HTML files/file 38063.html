<blockquote>
  <p>Supported image formats are PNG, JPG and GIF, including animated GIFs of up to 3MB . This data must be either the raw image bytes or encoded as base64.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can only upload images - not <em>links</em> to images.  Save an image locally and add it to <code>media</code> as a base64 encoded string.</p>

<p>You <strong>can not</strong> send links - even to Twitter images.</p>
