<p>What the formal W3C specifications call an interface is not what you usually think of when you work with an object-oriented language. The specifications describes what a <em>web-browser</em> needs to implement in its Javascript library to fulfill the specification. Unless you are developing your own web-browser, you don't implement anything. You just use the implementations provided by the web browsers.</p>

<p>As of now (April 2014) the W3C speech API you linked to is just an experimental recommendation. <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=web-speech" rel="nofollow">The only browsers which supports it partially are Chrome and Safari</a>. The experimental implementation prefixes all text-to-speech objects with <code>webkit</code>, so <code>SpeechRecognition</code> becomes <code>webkitSpeechRecognition</code>. Any other browser does not implement it at all at the moment, and it is not yet sure they will ever do. For that reason you should try to find a different solution for your problem.</p>

<p>When you still want to experiment with it, you can <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html" rel="nofollow">find an example for the web speech API</a> on Googles Chrome demos (the interesting parts start at line 288 of the sourcecode). But as I said, it isn't ready for any productive use.</p>
