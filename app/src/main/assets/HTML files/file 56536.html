<p>Seems likely your <code>alertLabel</code> hasn't actually been assigned.<br>
First, just double check to make sure you actually linked the outlet to the nib. </p>

<p>What actually seems like the issue here is that your custom view is being created, but the nib isn't. What's going on in your <code>connectNibUI()</code> function?  If that's where you're loading in the nib, all you may need to do is set the label text after that function.</p>
