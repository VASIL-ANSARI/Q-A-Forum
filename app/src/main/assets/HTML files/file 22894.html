<p>This is because HTML5 audio played once and its state is playing so it won't play again.</p>

<p>You may try this:</p>

<pre><code>var audio = document.getElementsByTagName("audio")[0];
var played = false;

buttonPlaySound.onclick = function () { 
    if (played) {
        audio.pause();
    }
    audio.play();
    played = true;
};
</code></pre>
