<p>The only difference when it matters if you use <code>class</code> or <code>id</code> is if you multiple instances of that element. Say, you had a header/content and footer, you know you're going to have only singleton instances of these and so I'd use an <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>However, if you have two headers, so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="header&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="header&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This does not comply with HTML standards, and so I'd use:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="header&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="header&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In base, if it's a single instance of that element, use an <code>id</code>. If you know you're doing the same operation more than once on an element, use a <code>class</code>. This is also the standard rule for CSS, to a degree.</p>
