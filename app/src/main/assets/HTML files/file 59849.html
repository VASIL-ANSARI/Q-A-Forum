<p>The <code>Form.Activated</code> event is only fired when the form is visible. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.activated(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the application is active and has multiple forms, the active form is the form with the input focus. <strong>A form that is not visible cannot be the active form</strong>. The simplest way to activate a visible form is to click it or use an appropriate keyboard combination.</p>

<p>If your form is already visible when the presenter is being created, then the activated event has already fired. You could call <code>Form.Activate()</code> once the presenter is created and the eventhandler is hooked up.</p>
