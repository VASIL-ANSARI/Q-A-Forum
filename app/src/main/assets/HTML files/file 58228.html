<p>Maybe an easy fix is to just import it as normal... then do an UPDATE to get the first name from the already existing Full Name column. The append or INSERT statement should have worked so something is going on to create the additional records. But if you are not into figuring out why these additional records are being populated, or are just in a rush then the UPDATE Query should do what you need.</p>
