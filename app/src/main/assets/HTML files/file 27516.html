<p>It appears like the <code>Service</code> is stopped in one of the three <code>Fragment</code>s and when you try to stop the <code>Service</code> in other two <code>Fragment</code>s you get this error.</p>

<p>From Android documentation it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that multiple calls to <code>Context.startService()</code> do not nest (though they do result in multiple corresponding calls to <code>onStartCommand()</code>), so no matter how many times it is started a service will be stopped once <code>Context.stopService()</code> or <code>stopSelf()</code> is called; however, services can use their <code>stopSelf(int)</code> method to ensure the service is not stopped until started intents have been processed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, check whether one of the <code>Fragment</code> is stopping the <code>Service</code>, or you can start and stop the service in the <code>FragmentActivity</code>s! Let the <code>Activity</code> handle this and pass a reference to the <code>Fragments</code> if they need the <code>Service</code> too. </p>
