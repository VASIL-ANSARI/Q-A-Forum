<p>The short answer - use <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">the Reflection API</a>.</p>

<p>The long answer - you'll need to obtain access to the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Field.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Fields</code></a> of the desired Context <code>Class</code>. Once you gain access to the Field instances, you can set their values using the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Field.html#set%28java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Object%29" rel="nofollow">set()</a> method; the API call is a bit tricky in that you'll need to pass in the object reference (the context object and not the context class) whose field you wish to modify.</p>

<p>It is necessary that your <code>Context</code>, <code>choice</code> and <code>something</code> parameters to the method, contain the necessary information to make this operation as simple as possible. In other words, the Context class might have to contain the actual <code>Class</code> object (or provides a way to get one) that contains the field.</p>
