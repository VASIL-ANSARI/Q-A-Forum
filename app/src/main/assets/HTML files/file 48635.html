  <p>I have to return nul in a function but I'm not allowed to include any library.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem is far simpler than you're making it; you've actually asked a form of <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem">XY problem</a>.</p>

<p>You won't find the NUL character defined in any standard library; the best way to return that will be using the constant <code>'\0'</code> or <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>If your professor is teaching you to avoid using <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code> to find <code>NULL</code> then he/she has set a silly exercise which involves using something other than the most appropriate tool for the job, a tool which is guaranteed by the standard to exist, by the way... I would be raising this as a concern.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, sometimes professors don't care and will teach you to do stupid things anyway. <code>NULL</code> is defined as an implementation-defined null pointer constant, usually <code>0</code> or a conversion of <code>0</code> to <code>void *</code> like so: <code>((void *) 0)</code>. That may not be the implementation-defined value your <code>NULL</code> resolves to; in that case, adjust to suit :)</p>

<p>You could add a preprocessor definition such as <code>#define NULL ((void *) 0)</code> and then you would be able to <code>return NULL;</code> from your functions. Ta-da! Stupid exercises deserve stupid solutions.</p>

<p>If your professor says you're not allowed to use <code>#define</code>, either, I would be tempted to ask him what you <em>are</em> allowed to use. Changing requirements on the fly is not fair. Most compilers will allow you to set preprocessor constants using a command line argument, for example <code>cc -DNULL='((void *) 0) ...'</code>. This is useful for exposing compile-time configuration options, but again, using this to define <code>NULL</code> is dumb.</p>

<hr>

<p>The question in your title is different to the rest of your post. <code>__DARWIN_NULL</code> could also be defined using either of the above, providing it isn't already defined, but I really don't think that's required to answer your actual question.</p>
