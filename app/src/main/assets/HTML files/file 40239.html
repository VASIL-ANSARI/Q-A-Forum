<pre><code> while (loopagain) {
 ...


 ...
       JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Have a Nice Day!");

       // end of args test //
 }
</code></pre>

<p>this needs to be</p>

<pre><code> do{
 ...


 ...

 }while(loopquery());

 JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Have a Nice Day!");

  // end of args test //
</code></pre>

<p>what you did was set loopagain to true and never change it so it would loop infinately
also the exit message was in the wrong place</p>
