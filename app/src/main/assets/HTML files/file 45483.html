<p>The <code>avi</code> container format isn't supported by JavaFX so won't work - your first example should however play ball ok - I've tried it and it works for me.</p>

<p>You could also try forcing the mp4 container with the same <code>f</code> switch but just before the output file:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -f image2 -i %05d.jpg -r 30 -filter:v crop=4000:2250:0:0 -s 1920x1080 -vcodec mpeg4 -qscale 1 -f mp4 ../Timelapse.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>(Also try the above with libx264.)</p>
