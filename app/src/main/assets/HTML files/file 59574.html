<p>You have <code>WITH</code> keyword in place of <code>AND</code> (I took the query from your <em>stack trace</em>)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Count(a.id)
FROM   entity_listing a
       LEFT OUTER JOIN relation_master d
                    ON d.entity_id = a.id,
       entity_location b
       LEFT OUTER JOIN city_master c
                    ON c.id = b.city_id
                       WITH --Here
                       b.entity_id = a.id
                       AND a.entity_type != 'corporate'
                       AND a.entity_type != 'vendor' 
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure what you are trying to achieve but <code>AND</code> is what expected(should compile now)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Count(a.id)
FROM   entity_listing a
       LEFT OUTER JOIN relation_master d
                    ON d.entity_id = a.id,
       entity_location b
       LEFT OUTER JOIN city_master c
                    ON c.id = b.city_id
                       AND b.entity_id = a.id
                       AND a.entity_type NOT IN ( 'corporate', 'vendor' ) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note :</strong> You can use <code>NOT IN</code> operator instead of multiple <code>!=</code> conditions </p>

<p><strong>Update :</strong> </p>

<p>You have combined explicit <code>JOIN</code> syntax and comma separated old style Join syntax may be that could be the problem. Try this</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Count(a.id)
FROM   entity_listing a
       LEFT OUTER JOIN relation_master d
                    ON d.entity_id = a.id
       JOIN entity_location b
         ON b.entity_id = a.id
       LEFT OUTER JOIN city_master c
                    ON c.id = b.city_id
                       AND a.entity_type NOT IN ( 'corporate', 'vendor' ) 
</code></pre>
