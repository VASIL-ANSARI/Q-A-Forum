<p>Your initial thought is actually perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Since Javascript is single-threaded, you won't get any callbacks while your code is running.<br>
As long as you create all of the requests in the same event handler, you're fine.</p>

<p>If you don't create all the requests at once, you'll either need to know in advance how many requests you're going to create, or handle partial responses.</p>
