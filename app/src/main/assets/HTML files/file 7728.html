<p>If you are using .NET 4.0, here's a post by David Fowler that makes use of the new dynamic type feature to create a DynamicQueryable  and DynamicExpressionBuilder which allows you to reference entity properties dynamically.</p>

<p>Or.. if you rather get straight to it, he's also created a library <a href="http://bitbucket.org/dfowler/dynamiclinq" rel="nofollow">http://bitbucket.org/dfowler/dynamiclinq</a> the encapsulates the functionality. It's also on NuGet :)</p>
