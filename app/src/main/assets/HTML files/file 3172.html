<p>Create MAIN_PAGE setting inside settings.py with primary key. Then create view main_page nad retrieve the main_page object from the database using the setting.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>You can also do it like this: add a model, which will reference a SimplePage and point to the main page. In main page view, you will retrieve the wanted SimplePage and it can be easily changed by anyone in django admin.</p>
