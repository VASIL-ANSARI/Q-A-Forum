<p>The Google GAPI library doesn't have such a method. If you're jQuery averse, it's not too difficult to replace $.ajax with XMLHttprequest.</p>

<p>On sessions, a typical sequence is:-</p>

<p>1/ check your session object to see if it is holding a user object. </p>

<p>1a/ If yes, your user is "logged in"</p>

<p>1b/ If no, use OAuth to discover who the user is, look him up in your user database, and store his user object in your session</p>

<p>To logout, simply remove the user object from your session.</p>

<p>There are many variations and alternatives to this technique for user/session management in an OAuth world. This is just one approach.</p>
