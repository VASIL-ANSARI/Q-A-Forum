<p>Looks like not being logged in was the problem - this model works.</p>

<p>Because this will probably help someone else in the future: when you create a user's account, use Hash::make when you add the password to the database, because when you use Auth::attempt in your log in method, Laravel hashes password the user typed and compares the two, and if they're both not hashed, it won't log the user in.</p>
