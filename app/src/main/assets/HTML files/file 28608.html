<p>It turns out that this can be achieved with a single line of PHP, which I added to the <strong>checkout;payment_method.php</strong> partial, including the above steps to remove the Shipping Method step from the checkout.</p>

<p>First off, I created a table rate shipping option, with the Country, State, &amp; City all set to * (wildcard), and a cost of <strong>0</strong>. Then I gave it an API code of <code>default</code>.</p>

<p>In the <strong>checkout;payment_method.php</strong> partial, I added the following line:</p>

<pre><code>Shop_CheckoutData::set_shipping_method(Shop_ShippingOption::find_by_api_code('default')-&gt;id);
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the Shipping Method step is removed from the customer-facing checkout process, but shipping is still automatically selected and calculated during checkout.</p>
