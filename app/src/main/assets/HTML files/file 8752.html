<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html" rel="nofollow">Android Developer Distribution Agreement</a>. It states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5.4 You grant to the user a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to perform, display, and use the Product on the Device. If you choose, you may include a separate end user license agreement (EULA) in your Product that will govern the user's rights to the Product in lieu of the previous sentence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you're giving the user the right to use the product. If you think it's necessary to include further legal protections, you have the option to include a EULA that describes them.</p>

<p>You've probably noticed that most apps don't have a EULA.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=android+end+user+license+agreement" rel="nofollow">quick Google search</a> shows <a href="http://bees4honey.com/blog/tutorial/adding-eula-to-android-app/" rel="nofollow">this page about how to add a EULA to your app</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and you're not bound by any agreement, like the GPL, to release the source code for your app. So you don't have to do that if you don't want to.</p>
