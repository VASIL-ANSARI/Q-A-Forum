<p>The problem you have is that you cannot have mixed formatting within certain controls. So for instance if this control was rendered as a span you cannot have this one word rendered differently to all of the other text, you would instead need to wrap this one word in it's own tag.</p>

<p>e.g.
<code>&lt;span&gt;Your xyzProductname was developed on the principles of intensive research&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>

<p>Cannot have the formatting you want. Instead you would have to do this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;span&gt;Your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;xyzProductname &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;was developed on the principles of intensive research&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>

<p>This is so that a CSS rule can be applied to the second span. If this was not considered at the start then you will have to go back through and alter the controls to allow this to happen.</p>

<p>This will all depend on what kind of controls you want this done to, buttons, textboxes, labels etc. all require different approaches to get the same effect.</p>
