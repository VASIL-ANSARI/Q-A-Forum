<p>Have you included the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation" rel="nofollow">jQuery Validation plugin</a>?</p>

<h3>Update 1</h3>

<p>Since you said that you have included the jQuery validation plugin. Then, the only thing I can suggest, to you, is to try this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){ $("#question").validate(); });
</code></pre>

<h3>Update 2</h3>

<p>You should add a <code>minlength</code> and a <code>maxlength</code> attribute to your inputs. Validation doesn't work like magic. It should get the properties to validate against from somewhere. So add a <code>minlength="2"</code> for your <code>Name</code> input element, for example.</p>
