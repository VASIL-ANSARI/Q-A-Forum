<p>Yes but I would recommend css over js:</p>

<pre><code>#myelement {
    cursor:pointer
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if you are looking for the most condensed way to do both of these in js, if so then this would be pretty close:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myElement').title('text here').css('cursor','pointer');
</code></pre>
