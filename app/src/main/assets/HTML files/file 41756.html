<p>Check out the tutorial here (<a href="http://mbaas-gettingstarted.ng.bluemix.net/android" rel="nofollow">http://mbaas-gettingstarted.ng.bluemix.net/android</a>).  You can store a Java object in the mobile data service.  Behind the scenes it is storing JSON for you.  If you want you can obviously store straight JSON but it was abstracted a bit so it models more closley how Java dev's use OO to store and access data.</p>

<p>Scroll down to the data operations bit (<a href="http://mbaas-gettingstarted.ng.bluemix.net/android#data-operations" rel="nofollow">http://mbaas-gettingstarted.ng.bluemix.net/android#data-operations</a>), you can store and access data normally as you would through a class in Java.</p>
