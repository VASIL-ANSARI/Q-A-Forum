<p>Since your app is not hosted at Heroku trying to run your <code>rake</code> tasks inside Heroku will not work.  You need to run the <code>rake</code> task from Nitrous.io.  Or if you can run you code locally, since you have your development config setup to point at your Heroku db you may be able to just run <code>rake db:reset</code> on your local machine.</p>
