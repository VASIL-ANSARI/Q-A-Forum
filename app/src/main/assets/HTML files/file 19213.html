<p>CSS supports active and hover states which would suffice for all except button release.</p>

<pre><code>#myButton {
width: 90px;
height: 20px;
background: url(defaultstate.png);
}

#myButton:hover {
background: url(overstate.png);
}

#myButton:active {
background: url(downstate.png);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It may be likely that you wouldn't need a button release state. If the button is submitting a form or otherwise sending the visitor to a new browser page, they aren't likely to notice the button release before the page starts to refresh/load.</p>
