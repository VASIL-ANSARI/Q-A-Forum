<p>I don't know if this will help you but is just another idea...</p>

<p>Use one text control with transparent background so you can select all the text at once. Then you have to draw rectangles behind the text blocks. Like an optical ilussion.
The challenge here is calculating the exactly size of the text rectangle box and the text allignment. My idea is having a predefined sizes and positions design (left text box, right text box, date, etc) so the size and positioning calculations are easier.</p>

<p>Another idea is play with the mouse and/or selection events. During the user text selection replace it programatically with your own selection. The user will think that is he who is selecting the text but is the application who is doing it. Another illusion...</p>

<p>I hope you could resolve it.</p>
