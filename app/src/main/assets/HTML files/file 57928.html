<p>I've written mine by hand and honestly not sure how you can automate it on the server without application knowledge. The exception would be something with just static routes, as most applications use a variety of parameter-based routes (e.g. /item/{id}). Nancy doesn't know or care about the id value, so you can't ask it to provide a list of valid urls. As you mentioned, aside from writing a custom module in Nancy you can also use an external tool to crawl the site to generate it for you.</p>
