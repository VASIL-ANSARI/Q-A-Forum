<p>To create a notification that is transmitted to connected Android Wear devices, you need to use the NotificationCompat class located in the Support v4-Package.
The detailed documentation how to do this can be found <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/notifications/creating.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The code essentially breaks down to this code snippet (copied from the documentation):</p>

<pre><code>int notificationId = 001;
// Build intent for notification content
Intent viewIntent = new Intent(this, ViewEventActivity.class);
viewIntent.putExtra(EXTRA_EVENT_ID, eventId);
PendingIntent viewPendingIntent =
        PendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, viewIntent, 0);

NotificationCompat.Builder notificationBuilder =
        new NotificationCompat.Builder(this)
        .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_event)
        .setContentTitle(eventTitle)
        .setContentText(eventLocation)
        .setContentIntent(viewPendingIntent);

// Get an instance of the NotificationManager service
NotificationManagerCompat notificationManager =
        NotificationManagerCompat.from(this);

// Build the notification and issues it with notification manager.
notificationManager.notify(notificationId, notificationBuilder.build());
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a notification on the handheld as well as connected Android Wear devices, without even creating a Wear-App. The pairing and transmitting process is handled by the OS.</p>

<p>As a general hint, the Training section of Android Developers is always a good place to start researching.</p>
