<p>Since both pieces of code are correct and would work in most circumstances, I can only think of these reasons why the second one would not work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There's an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag or a form post in the hierarchy that is causing the browser to go to a new page before the results of your code can be seen.</p></li>
<li><p>You have more than one object in the page with <code>id=btn-similar</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>There's a script error right before your second block of code that keeps it from executing.</p></li>
<li><p>You have a typo somewhere and the code doesn't actually match the desired id.  In your question, you show code that refers to <code>id=btn-similar</code>, but the code is <code>id=btn-overview</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>FYI, you can see the second block of code work just fine here: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/8s7rukt3/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/8s7rukt3/</a> so there's obviously some oddity in your page that you haven't disclosed.</p>
