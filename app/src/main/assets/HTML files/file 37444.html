<p>According to <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/vector/" rel="nofollow">cplusplus.com</a>, vectors contain copies of items. You need to declare a public copy constructor to allow this, and a default constructor to allow for memory allocation. It looks like it's complaining about the latter.</p>

<p>To round this out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28C%2B%2B_programming%29" rel="nofollow">make sure to follow the Rule Of Three</a></p>

<p>This can be easily done by changing your existing constructor declaration to the following:</p>

<pre><code>//For the default constructor
Atom(int zv=0, double xcart=0, double ycart=0, double zcart=0);
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: The copy constructor looks like the compiler can figure it out. Scratch what I said about that and adding in <code>copy assign</code> &amp; <code>dctor</code>.</p>
