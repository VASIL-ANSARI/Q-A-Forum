<p>As you get more experienced, you will have to look things up less and less. However, I can tell you that you will never stop looking things up altogether. I've been using Java for about 8 years now and still use Google to look up code snippets and answers to questions all the time. There's no shame in it, it's just part of being a programmer.</p>
