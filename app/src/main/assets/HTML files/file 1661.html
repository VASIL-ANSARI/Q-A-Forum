<p>Instead of directly investigating your dependencies in python, and if you are running in Linux/Unix, you can wrapper your program with <CODE><a href="http://benno.id.au/blog/2008/06/06/memoize-build-framework" rel="nofollow">memoize.py</a></CODE>.  <code>memoize.py</code> uses <CODE><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace" rel="nofollow">strace</a></CODE>, or "system trace", to watch all system read and write commands that your program generates and then stores these dependencies to a file.  <code>memoize.py</code> may also be use as a library, so you can use its functions internally within your program and get the dependencies in a python data structure.</p>
