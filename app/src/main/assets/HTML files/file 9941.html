<p>Maybe you can let the controls be public or use friend methods to save the getter, setter writing. This I think should be accepted in an ui class hierarchy because you don't design your custom controls to be reusable, so they shouldn't be encasulated that hard. They are specific to that single window you are designing anyway.</p>

<p>So accessing it from the top of hierarchy might be done like this (and also I think it would be better to keep all the event handlers in one class at the top):</p>

<pre><code>class CMainWnd
{
private:
    CCtrl1 GetCtrl1();
    CCtrl2 GetCtrl2()
    {
        return m_leftPane.m_lDlg1.m_ctrl2;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And declare GetCtrl2 friend function in the CLeftPane and CDlg1 classes</p>

<pre><code>class CDlg1
{
    friend CCtrl2 CMainWnd::GetCtrl2();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or alternatively make all control members public</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I meant the custom dialog class have the friend function not the control. </p>
