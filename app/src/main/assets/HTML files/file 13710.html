<p>The <code>..._once()</code> functions don't care WHERE the include/require occured. Once a file has been included, it'll never been include_once/require_once again anywhere during that particular script execution run.</p>

<p>If you need to include it multiple times in different locations, then don't use the _once() variants.</p>
