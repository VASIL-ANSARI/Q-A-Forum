<p>In your specific question about <code>main()</code>, you will need the arguments inside the parentheses when you want to refer to the command line args that were passed in. You might be confused about the different ways to declare functions. As a starting C programmer, you should always use <code>int func(int a, int b)</code> declaring your return type, function name, parameters, and parameter types on the same line. Don't let the other syntaxes confuse you- most are there for historical reasons, and when you know enough to answer know why they're there, you'll know enough to answer this question on your own :)</p>
