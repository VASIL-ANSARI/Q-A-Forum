<p>assuming you're talking about libtorrent-rasterbar (as in libtorrent.org); no, it does not come with a tracker.</p>

<p>I would recommend taking a look at <a href="http://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/" rel="nofollow">OpenTracker</a> or <a href="https://github.com/arvidn/utrack" rel="nofollow">utrack</a> (udp only).</p>
