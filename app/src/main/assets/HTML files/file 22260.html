<p>Commands without a path are always <em>only</em> looked up on the <code>PATH</code>. You cannot cd to a directory and have <code>subprocess</code> (or your shell for that matter) find a command located in that  directory without specifying at least a relative path. This is standard command lookup behaviour.</p>

<p>If you want to run a command in the current working directory, you <em>must</em> specify a path of <code>./</code> to make it explicit the <code>PATH</code> search semantics are not to be used.</p>

<p>Relative paths in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable are also not supported everywhere; adding <code>.</code> to PATH is considered a security risk and some systems explicitly filter out <code>.</code> from the PATH. You must have migrated away from a system that allowed this, to a system that does disallow <code>.</code> in the <code>PATH</code>.</p>
