<p>SQL Server does provide full text search tools for data contained in a table.  It does not support full text search for external data. </p>

<p>If you don't want to use another library for your file based search I suggest stuffing the data into tables and using the full text search tools sql server provides, they are not hard to use, not expensive (esp. since you already have sql server) and should be quite quick to integrate.  The only downside is increased disk space usage.</p>

<p>Disks tend to be cheap so this should not be an issue, unless you are using an expensive hoster.</p>
