<p>As DelightedD0D commented, <code>.val()</code> is the correct way to retrieve a value from a text input.</p>

<p>Here's a working snippet: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/tuywqucb/3/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/tuywqucb/3/</a></p>

<p>One other thing to look out for.. if the <code>td</code> isn't correctly wrapped in a <code>tr</code> and a <code>table</code> tag, many browsers will omit it from the DOM which will make your element and thus your id disappear and thus not be found by jQuery.</p>
