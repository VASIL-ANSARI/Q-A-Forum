<p>What you have is actually a pretty good way to do it, but you should add some checking that ensures that match() actually returns an array (meaning the string was found) and not null, otherwise you'll get a type error.</p>

<p>example:</p>

<pre><code>var index = $(":input:last").attr("name").match(/\[(\d+)\]/);
if (match) { index = match[1]; }
else { /* no match */ }
</code></pre>
