<p>You don't have the right architecture for what you are describing, but what you have is right.</p>

<p>If you are calling web services from the client side (using jquery) then your web service must be public facing.</p>

<p>What you are describing is a web or WCF service in a service oriented architecture. That service would most likely live on a different server and be on an internal network, etc. Even if it's on the same server your requirement is that it is not publicly accessible - thus none of your jquery would work since that request is being initiated by the user and users can only make requests to public facing services.</p>

<p>The comments about using forms authentication to protect your service calls are right. jQuery will include the forms authentication cookie for you when it makes AJAX calls so you shouldn't have to change much on the client side.</p>
