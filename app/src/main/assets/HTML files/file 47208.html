<p>All my solutions are based on assumptions as question is not clear. </p>

<p>1] It seems your js conflict with other js. According to me update the jquery above 1.6. It might solve your issue. <a href="http://api.jquery.com/attr/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/attr/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method returns undefined for attributes
  that have not been set. To retrieve and change DOM properties such as
  the checked, selected, or disabled state of form elements, use the
  .prop() method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2] Put <code>jQuery.noConflict();</code> at the end of your jquery file.</p>

<p>3] If error occur in your custom js. As you have not posted the file or code in which you get an error. So according to me the attribute you are searching for isn't set on the element you're searching for it on. Due to this,<code>.replace</code> is failing because undefined doesn't have a replace method. You'll need to make sure it isn't undefined first.</p>

<pre><code>var attribute = $(this).attr('rel'); //Maybe you're getting error here. Change it like this.
attribute = attribute ? attribute.replace('attributeremove_', '') : '';
</code></pre>
