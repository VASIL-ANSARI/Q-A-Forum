<p>After 4 days of googling and trying different solution 
finally I find that because I have both VS2010 and VS2013 on my computer, deploying with vs2010 use .net 4.5 SDK that it has different <em>PublicKey</em> then setup can't verify the installation file an installation fail.
<strong>Finally uninstalling .net 4.5 SDK did me a trick.</strong></p>
