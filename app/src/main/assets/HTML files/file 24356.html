<p>You say that the third image appeared, but the the other two are still in the view and they still receive touch events. There are two two scenarios for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>You've already added the third image view somewhere else, and your method is never called, or the condition is never met.</li>
<li><code>self.imgView1</code> and <code>self.imgView2</code> are not set to the actual objects in your view stack. They're probably just nil. you can debug that by <code>NSLog(@"%@ %@", self.imgView1, self.imgView2);</code> in that method, before the condition, or in <code>viewWillAppear</code> or <code>viewDidLoad</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The reasons that support my opinion:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>In that method, you call <code>removeFromSuperview</code> to the two image views you want to disable, yet they are still visible and receiving touch events. That means that this method is not executed. Which means they're <code>nil</code> or some other objects, that are different than the visible ones.</li>
<li>The condition in the start of the method is a bit strict. It's hard to be easily met. Yet the method is executed as the third image view is added to the view. This can happen when the object is nil, so the values returned by methods are the default values.</li>
</ol>
