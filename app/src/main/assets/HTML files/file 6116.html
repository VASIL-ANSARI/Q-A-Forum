<p>The clue is "the database principal 's2\killian' does not exist"</p>

<p>Any connection uses context change on the database side (eg <code>SETUSER</code>, <code>EXECUTE AS</code> etc) requires that the impersonated user exists in sys.server_principals and/or sys.database_principals.</p>

<p>Assuming you use an AD group, not individual logins, then this will cause the same error as above. Outside of any permissions. If you are db_owner, then you can impersonate at the database level. If you can't, then it's because of the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>I've always thought that this is an idiotic option for SSRS to have. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms160330.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN says it uses SETUSER</a> which is also deprecated. Ideally, you'd impersonate <em>before</em> connection which is possible for asp.net apps but don't know for SSRS (which is an asp.net app of course)</p>

<p>Sorry for lack of "do this and it works" answer...</p>
