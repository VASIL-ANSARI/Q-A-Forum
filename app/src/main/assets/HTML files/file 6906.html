<p>This is what I did:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
   $(document).ready(function() {
      $(".class").trigger('click');
   });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It's probably not the best solution but it worked for me. .class has to be the class of the link you'll replicate with trigger. This way you fake a click on that anchor when you load the page to make quicksand believe that you actually clicked there. </p>
