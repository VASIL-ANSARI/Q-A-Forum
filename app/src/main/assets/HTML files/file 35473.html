<p>As for me, it is kind a strangely to use such methods (uploading files directly to third party resource). Why don't you just use bundle like : <a href="https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpGaufretteBundle" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpGaufretteBundle</a> . You may configure as many adapters as you need. But in this case, you'll be able to test your entire application/project by just changing the addapters configuration for test/dev env. </p>
