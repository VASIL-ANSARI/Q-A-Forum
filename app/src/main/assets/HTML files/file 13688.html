<p>No it is not true. This is the correct way to avoid null pointer exceptions. An operand is evaluated and the next one is evaluated only if the expression's value is still not clear.</p>

<p>This means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>if you have an and operator (&amp;&amp;) and the first operand evaluates to false the second one will not be evaluated.</li>
<li>if you have an or operator (||) and the first operand evaluates to true the second one will not be evaluated.</li>
</ul>
