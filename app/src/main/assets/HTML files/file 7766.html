<p>I don't think you can do it the way you want but here is a potential workaround if it is suitable for what you want to do</p>

<p>Create <code>Synonyms</code> for the objects that are reference in the <code>Beta</code> databases</p>

<pre><code>USE [Alpha]
CREATE SYNONYM [dbo].[BetaMyTable] FOR [Beta].[dbo].[MyTable]
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>USE [Alpha_dev]
CREATE SYNONYM [dbo].[BetaMyTable] FOR [Beta_dev].[dbo].[MyTable]
</code></pre>

<p>so your procs can now use:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM BetaMyTable
</code></pre>

<p>in SQL Compare, there is an ignore rule option in <code>Edit Project... -&gt; Options</code> called <code>Database and server name in synonyms</code>. I believe it is checked by default but it is there if you want to change it</p>
