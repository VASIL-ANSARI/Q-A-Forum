<p>Make sure your trailing slashes match, so if there is a slash at the end of <code>window.location</code>, there needs to be one in your <code>href</code>. It might also help if you check if the links have a full domain in them or not. </p>

<p><strong>http//www.example.com/one/two</strong> is not going to match a link with href <strong>/one/two</strong></p>

<p>Might be worth looking into using <code>window.location.pathname</code> and match on that instead of the full URL.</p>
