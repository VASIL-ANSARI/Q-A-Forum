<p>I believe that <a href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/javadoc/com/smartgwt/client/widgets/form/fields/ComboBoxItem.html#setPickListHeight%28int%29" rel="nofollow">setPickListHeight()</a> would do something like you want to do. The problem is that is not an entry height, it is a height in pixels so you ought to know the height of the entries you are adding. Also this height will be the height before putting on scrollbars, not sure if that is what you want.</p>

<p>For further customization you might want to look at <a href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/javadoc/com/smartgwt/client/widgets/form/fields/ComboBoxItem.html#setPickListProperties%28com.smartgwt.client.widgets.grid.ListGrid%29" rel="nofollow">setPickListProperties()</a> method. </p>
