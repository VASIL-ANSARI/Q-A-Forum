<p>Store the object in session.
I give you a link if you don't know how to do this.</p>

<p>Exemple:</p>

<pre><code>//start session
session_start();

$obj = new Object(...);
//do something
$_SESSION['object']= $obj;
</code></pre>

<p>Now your have your object in session, and you can use it everywere in your application.
You can also serialise the object for pass it in GET or POST.
