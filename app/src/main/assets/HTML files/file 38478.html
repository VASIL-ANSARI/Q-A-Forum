<p>You are including</p>

<pre><code>lis_config.h
</code></pre>

<p>after</p>

<pre><code>lis.h
</code></pre>

<p>wich is per se an error(you have to include it before). Also if you touched anything in lis_config you have to rebuild the whole library (using most same compilers flag of your project, for example "-msee2" if you used SSE2). Before rebuilding just swap headers only to see if that is enough..</p>

<p>A few more words: a library can easily detect headers included in wrong order, make a ticket to lis developers for that.</p>
