<p>You have to basically :<br/>
1) Perform a form sending to some server side script(PHP in your case) when there is a change in the dropdown selection (use <code>onchange</code> event for the dropdown) and fetch the values from the db , 
<br/>2) Tell the server side script to spit out an html string which contains the table containing the desired information.3) <br/>3) Output the string on your page.</p>

<p>This will do a page refresh.</p>

<p>If you donot want to have a page refresh, resort to using Ajax. 
P.S. I recommend using some framework such as jQuery in case you need to use Ajax</p>
