<p>You should be able to do this with ASP.NET MVC's default template, I'm doing something similar. Just build your routes as {language}/{controller}/{action}/{id}</p>

<p>Just set a default route that goes to a controller that checks for the language cookie, and redirects the user based on that cookie.</p>
