<p>that's because debounced functions are called asynchronously - you can't return a value from them, although you can call another function passing the result:</p>

<pre><code>var originalFunction = function() {
    console.log('some value');
    // or something like: callback(result)
};

var debouncedFunction = _.debounce(originalFunction, 3000);

console.log('debouncedFunction() result: ', debouncedFunction());
</code></pre>
