<p>The <code>lib[something].so</code> trick is old and easy. This is a way to unpack any BLOB from your APK into a read-only file at install time. It may be some non-executable data (encrypted or not).</p>

<p>On the other hand, I would not exclude the possibility that the file is really an encrypted library. Some custom decryption mechanism will then read it and write the output elsewhere. The decrypted library can be <strong>System.load</strong>ed (from Java), or <strong>dlopen</strong>ed from any location on the filesystem, including the 'external storage'. Even the file name may have no traces of <strong>lib</strong> or <strong>.so</strong>.</p>
