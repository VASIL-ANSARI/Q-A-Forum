<p><code>scanf</code> takes the address of the variable to write user input to the variable. You are only passing the variable name (value) and not the address. <code>&amp;</code> is the operator, which when prefixed to the variable name, gives address of that variable.</p>

<p>So correct way of using <code>scanf</code> is as below and this would solve your problem. Use the same for other <code>scanf</code> statements in your program.</p>

<pre><code>scanf("%c", &amp;confirm1);
</code></pre>
