<p>It looks like neither of these libraries have such feature out of the box. You can, however, provide your own implementation.</p>

<p>One way to do this with Glide using Square's OkHttp is implementing <code>com.squareup.okhttp.ResponseBody</code> like in <a href="https://gist.github.com/fbis251/cfa169fd9e1e142e042c" rel="nofollow">this</a> example.</p>

<p>This is not an answet to your questing, but if you're not limited to Picasso or Glide, <a href="https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader" rel="nofollow">Android Universal Image Loader</a> has simple <code>ImageLoadingProgressListener</code>.</p>
