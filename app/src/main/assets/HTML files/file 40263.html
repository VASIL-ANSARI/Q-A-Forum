<p>Yeah, java does that unfortunately. That's one of many weird "features" in its type system.
.readObject was first created before the notion of generics existed, so it is not  paramterized, and is declared to return Object. 
If the warning bothers you, you can suppress it by adding an annotation <code>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")</code> before the function declaration.</p>

<p>BTW, re: "everything is in try/catch", you may want to add a <code>finally</code> clause and move closing of <code>oi</code> there, to avoid leaving it open in case of an exception in <code>.readObject</code> </p>
