<p>I can't explain this very well, so I'm just going to use code:</p>

<pre><code>$fixedArr = array();
$idCount = 1;

foreach($myArr as $title=&gt;$subArr)
  foreach($subArr['linktypes'] as $metric=&gt;$val) {
    if(!array_key_exists($metric)) {
      $fixedArr[$metric] = array();
      $fixedArr[$metric]['id'] = $idCount;
      $fixedArr[$metric]['metric'] = $metric;
      $idCount += 1;
    }
    $fixedArr[$metric][$title] = $val;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>That should do it.</p>

<p>But I should say that the comments are right, a better way to structure your array would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>Array {
  [url_*] =&gt; Array {
    [metric] =&gt; someValue;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the same way you have it originally, but with fewer dimensions. This is all that you need for the data you have provided.</p>
