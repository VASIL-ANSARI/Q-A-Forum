<p>This isn't really how Chef is designed to be used. You would be better off putting all your files in something like a git repo or remote tarball and using things like the <code>git</code> or <code>remote_file</code> resources to download them. <code>cookbook_file</code> is really only a hack for small, one-off things. Honestly I don't really use it much, I would recommend you do the same.</p>
