<p>You can't because you are using dynamic memory allocation; meaning the elements will not be stored in a continuous memory location. </p>

<p>But maybe that is not what you want....notice that table[10] and &amp;table[10] are different things.</p>

<p>Since you are using  pointer to pointer you can use offsets to get the index of any &amp;tab[index] element. They are the columns  in your 2D array, allocated by <code>table = new tab*[n+1]</code>, stored in an continuous memory location. Each of these locations holds a tab*, so rows of your matrix.</p>
