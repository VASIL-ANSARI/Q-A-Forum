<p>If you look at, say, the definition of <code>std::begin</code>:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt; class C &gt; 
auto begin( C&amp; c ) -&gt; decltype(c.begin());
</code></pre>

<p>You see that all it does is reference the <code>begin()</code> anyway.  I suppose a decent compiler will make the difference nil, so I guess it comes down to preference.  Personally, I'd use <code>cont.begin()</code> and <code>cont.end()</code> just so that I wouldn't have to explain it to anybody :)</p>

<p>As Mooing Duck points out, however, <code>std::begin</code> also works on arrays:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt; class T, size_t N &gt; 
T* begin( T (&amp;array)[N] );
</code></pre>

<p>... so there is that to consider.  If you are <em>not</em> using arrays, I'd go with my suggestion.  However if you are unsure if what is passed is going to be an STL container, or an array of <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>, then <code>std::begin()</code> is the way to go.</p>
