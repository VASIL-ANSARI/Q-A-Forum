<p>So that is super weird. It looks like there's a bug in the version that ships with <code>Ruby 2.1.6</code> that is causing it to do weird things. Probably related to the <code>platforms</code> update in <code>rubygems 2.3.0</code>.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is a binary version of <code>gtk3</code> available but you have to update <code>rubygems</code> Try doing <code>gem update --system</code> and install <code>gtk3</code> again.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> You can check the available versions of a gem using the <a href="https://rubygems.org" rel="nofollow">rubygems</a> site. Here are the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/gtk3" rel="nofollow">available <code>gtk3</code> versions</a>.</p>
