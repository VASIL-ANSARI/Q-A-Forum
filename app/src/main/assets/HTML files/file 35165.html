<p>When you use:</p>

<pre><code>raw.put(0, 0, data);
</code></pre>

<p>you would normally be setting all the channel values for pixel at point (0,0); so if you have a 3 channel image, then you would provide a byte array of three values like:</p>

<pre><code>byte data[] = {1,2,3}
</code></pre>

<p>You are allowed to set more than one pixel at a time but the key point is that your data array needs to be multiple of the channels as otherwise opencv won't know what to see all the pixel values to. So, for example, again for a 3 channel Mat, you are allowed:</p>

<pre><code>byte data[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}; 
</code></pre>

<p>this will set pixel value (0,0) to (1,2,3) and (0,1) to (4,5,6)</p>

<p>but not:</p>

<pre><code>byte data[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
</code></pre>

<p>as this as 7 elements,which is not a multiple of 3.</p>

<p>You get the error you are seeing as your data array length is not a multiple of the number of channels.</p>

<p>You should check what format your data array is actually in. From my experience on my devices it tends to be YUV which has different dimensions to RGB so there will be some conversion required.</p>
