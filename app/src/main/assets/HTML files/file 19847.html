<p>Your html worked fine for me (with HEIGHT, WIDTH and VIDEOID substitutions) as-is, loaded in a UIWebView on iOS 6, in both Simulator and device (iPhone 5).</p>

<p>Could the problem have been an intermittent YouTube or network problem?  Have you tried again since or tried a different video ID?</p>

<p>Cheers,
Chris</p>
