<p>It is not perfect, but I think follows does what I want:</p>

<pre><code>    // OK, I do not hack other's code, but I do if need
    var originalFinishRequest = A4J.AJAX.finishRequest;
    A4J.AJAX.finishRequest = function(C){           
        originalFinishRequest(C);
                // do your stuff here
    };
</code></pre>

<p>I have not go into all source of A4J, so this is only a quick dirty trick.</p>
