<p>The named scope has to be used directly on products like so:</p>

<pre><code>def index
  @my_products = current_user.products.my_products
end
</code></pre>

<p>A named scope doesn't change the default behavior of the 'products' relation. It has to be called by its name when you want to use it.</p>
