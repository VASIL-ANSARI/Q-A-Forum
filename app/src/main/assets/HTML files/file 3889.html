<p>Nope.</p>

<p>You need to have a column for this.  </p>

<p>Imagine how big the meta-data would be if you needed to keep a record for each record for creation!  Would you also want to keep meta-data on your meta-data so you know when the meta-data was updated?  The space use can quickly escalate.</p>

<p>SQL Server keeps some stats but something this specific will need to come from a user-defined field.</p>

<p>As a side note, you can make it more difficult to tamper with the date on your created field if you use a lookup table.  Create a table "TableName_CreateDate" and use the PK from your actual table and a date value.  Your date is in a separate location and less likely to be modified but you can still <code>JOIN</code> on it to get your order.  You would need to create a trigger to update this with new values.</p>

<p>If you only want the <strong>DATE</strong> and don't need a datetime value, you can go one step further and just have a table of dates and a lookup table that joins to that.  I.e.:</p>

<p><code>Table-&gt;Table.PK + Date.Pk -&gt; DateTable</code></p>

<p>This would save a lot of drive space if you have a lot of rows (4 bytes per row I think).</p>
