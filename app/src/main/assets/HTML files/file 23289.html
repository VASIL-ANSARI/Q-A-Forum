<p>No, there is not. And in addition to that, you shouldn't <code>import *</code>, but in the <code>__init__.py</code> import explicitly. This way of splitting up modules is common and good practice, by the way.</p>

<p><code>import *</code> is acceptable if you also define an <code>__all__</code> attribute in each module, but there is no real benefit of doing so, and it tends to break code analyzers.</p>
