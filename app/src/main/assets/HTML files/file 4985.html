<p>You can totally do that, it's just an ordering issue:</p>

<pre><code>[ unicode(x.strip()) if x is not None else '' for x in row ]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this actually uses a different language construct, a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions">conditional expression</a>, which itself is not part of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#displays-for-lists-sets-and-dictionaries">comprehension syntax</a>, while the <code>if</code> after the <code>forâ¦in</code> is part of list comprehensions and used to <em>filter</em> elements from the source iterable.</p>
