<p>This conversion is undefined and therefore not portable.</p>

<p>According to C99 Â§6.3.1.4 footnote 50:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The remaindering operation performed when a value of integer type is converted to unsigned type need not be performed when a value of real floating type is converted to unsigned type. Thus, the range of portable real floating values is (â1, Utype_MAX+1).</p>
