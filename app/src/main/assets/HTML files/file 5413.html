<p>It could be a dumb idea but how about doing a string search after <code>class="tgProductPrice"&gt;</code>? then extract the followign char until you hit the end tag <code>&lt;/span&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>You don't need to load any html, you alraedy have it in the Description.</p>

<p>Will that work for you?</p>
