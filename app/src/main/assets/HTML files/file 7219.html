<p>You are going to have to choose a data access technique to retrieve the records from the DB to create data that you can bind to.</p>

<p>The most modern approach is to use the EntityFramework - excellent concept - It will save you a lot of development time in the long-run but has a huge learning curve.</p>

<p>Not wanting to tackle that, you can use DataSets by connecting to a datasource from the Server Explorer of visual studio, right clicking on the tables that you link and creating a data-bound grid on your WPF page.</p>

<p>Either way, there is more learning to do but hopefully you have more of an idea where to start learning.</p>
