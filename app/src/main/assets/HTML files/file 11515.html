<p>3 days to find this out: as I used password protection (password being attr_accessor), it's impossible to update a user, without adding the password field in the form.</p>

<p>Trying to edit the profile picture without entering the password does not work, and no error message that could have me made me think about this was generated.</p>

<p>So, in the edit view, don't forget to add the password field in the form to be able to update user's picture</p>
