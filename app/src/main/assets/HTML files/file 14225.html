<p>Be careful!!! if u r making such text editor which supports PHP,JS,CSS &amp; HTML using PHP that it will be as Online tool, it may create some security issue, if someone get access to this editor it can be dangerous. But if you don't allow anyone to edit any php file present in your server or even dont allow to use any php function. </p>

<p>And if you concern only about syntax of PHP,JS,CSS just to check &amp; let user know about this than you need to write a lexical parser which will analyze the code with the syntax database for that language. </p>

<p>Due to this Security issue only there are client-side applications like Eclipse,Netbeans,Notepad++ like editors. So just think of this concern also. it should not harm u.</p>
