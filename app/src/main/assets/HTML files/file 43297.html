<p>If your merge method is Ok (I don't test it), you forget to merge left and right to input, edit your code as shown below and re-try:</p>

<pre><code> // This is called recursion. Calling a method again within the  
 //method until the value of left and right becomes 1.
 left=mergeSort(left); 
 right=mergeSort(right);

 merge(left,right,Input);
</code></pre>

<p>hope helped you!</p>
