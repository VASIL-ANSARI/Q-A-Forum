<p><code>IValidatableObject</code> is an interface for verifying whole object level errors. It is your responsibility to implemts it by verifying data annotations or other techniques. MVC has native support for data annotations so you can just use them without any further support.</p>

<p>On the contrary wpf ONLY SUPPORTS <code>IDataErrorInfo</code>. It has no support for <code>IValidateObject</code> or DataAnnotations.</p>

<p>However I implemented a wrapper object that add DataAnnotation support in Wpf to the wrapped object. It furnishes also an implementation of <code>IPropertyChanged</code>.
