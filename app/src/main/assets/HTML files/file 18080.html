<p>Doing that is in conflict with unit testing idea. Tests are in isolation. You don't pass any states between them. Use <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.2/en/fixtures.html" rel="nofollow">fixtures</a> for setting the environment. If you test a Model don't use ControllerTestCase. Use PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase instead.</p>
