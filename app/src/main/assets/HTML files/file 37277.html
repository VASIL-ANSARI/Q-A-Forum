<p>It is not necessary that you should use % in the place of hostname or IP and not specifically in WordPress environment.</p>

<p>In most of the cases people use wildcard (%) to grant the access to remote servers, but it is only advisory when your application is distributed across multiple servers, therefore those servers will be having multiple network IP addresses.</p>

<p>WordPress does not have that much wide distributed architecture. Only single connection will be created through single IP address or machine to access the data from the remote database.</p>

<p>Most of the cases people use local database or intranet network database where infrastructure management have taken care of the network security and network attacks such as brute force etc.</p>

<p>If you are using remote Mysql server with WordPress, you must configure you access as follows:</p>

<pre><code>DBUser@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
</code></pre>
