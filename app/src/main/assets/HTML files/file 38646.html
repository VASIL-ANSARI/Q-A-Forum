<p>The difference is that in the first case, <code>Arr</code> is declared on the stack; until the function is called, that array doesn't exist. The generated binary contains code for creating the array, but the array itself isn't in the binary.</p>

<p>In the second case, however, <code>Arr</code> is declared outside of any function (aka at file scope). Therefore, it <em>always</em> exists, and is stored in the binary. Because you appear to be working on an embedded platform, this otherwise insignificant difference causes your "RAM overflow" error.</p>
