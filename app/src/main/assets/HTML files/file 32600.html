<p>A bit of a late update, but after having this issue for a couple of days, the solution that worked best for me was creating a CustomDrawerLayout. Then, casting the Context from the constructor as an Activity, called the Activity onTouchEvent from onInterceptTouchEvent. </p>

<pre><code>@Override public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent( MotionEvent ev )
{
    getActivity().onTouchEvent( ev );
    return super.onInterceptTouchEvent( ev );
}
</code></pre>

<p>I find the code to be a lame hack... but works for me. Good luck!</p>
