<p>You need to initialize your <code>threads</code> variable like this:</p>

<p><code>threads = JSON.parse(page)['threads']</code></p>

<p>The root node in the JSON response you received is "threads". All of the content you want to access is contained within the array of this node.</p>

<p>Each <code>thread</code> contains many <code>posts</code>. So to iterate through all of the posts, you will need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>threads.each do |thread|
  thread["posts"].each do |post|
    puts post["com"]
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Overall I would rewrite your code like so:</p>

<pre><code>require 'httparty'
require 'json'

page = HTTParty.get("https://api.4chan.org/b/0.json").body
threads = JSON.parse(page)["threads"]
count = threads.count

if count &gt; 0
  puts "You have #{count} new threads."
  threads.each do |thread|
    unless thread["posts"].nil?
      thread["posts"].each do |post|
        puts post["com"]
      end
    end
  end
else
  puts "You have no new threads."
end
</code></pre>
