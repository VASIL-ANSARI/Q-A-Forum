<p>Your site shouldn't need more than one global-header, if you opt to even use headers to begin with. If it does, just include jQuery on all pages. It's a small cached file, it won't hurt the browsing experience.</p>

<p>By using the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/documentation/#jquery" rel="nofollow">google-hosted version</a>, it may be the case that many of your uses already have it cached before they even reach your site.</p>
