<p>You'd need to do the exact same thing you do if you weren't using Guice... declare any parameters the parent constructor requires as parameters to each child's constructor as well, and pass those to <code>super</code>.</p>

<p>So if your abstract parent class's constructor takes a <code>Foo</code>, a child class's constructor needs to look like:</p>

<pre><code>@Inject public ChildClass(Foo foo, Bar bar) {
  super(foo);
  this.bar = bar;
  ...
}
</code></pre>
