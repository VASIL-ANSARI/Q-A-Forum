<p>Well the question has to be whether we see the password as a resource in its own right, or not.</p>

<p>In my user dbs, I store all my passwords (salted and stretched) in their own table, so I can easily present the password as a separate resource.  But just because you don't have that fine grained control doesn't mean you can't do the same - but I wouldn't consider implementing a GET for the password, ultimately you need an authentication service for that, which should follow some kind of protocol.</p>

<p>A rest service is free to represent its data however it wishes, with no real regard for the underlying structure so, given that, I think you're free to do it as a separate resource if it makes sense in your case.</p>

<p>You could include in your user data a uri to be used for changing the password.  The client would have to know the type of data to send (so yes you will need a dedicated resource type to handle the change request), and that the uri should be triggered with a POST request.</p>
