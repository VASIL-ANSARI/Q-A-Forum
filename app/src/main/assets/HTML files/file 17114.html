<p>I would use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">AsynkTask</a>.  </p>

<p>And on <code>onPostExecute</code> I would start the activity.</p>

<p>That networking mixed with UI it to mess for me, does it run in Android 4 at all? - you should get an exception there with no network on UI thread or something like that, forgot the exception name. Anyway, try to separate the network and UI layers.</p>

<p>Also calling an asmx, I needed to se somewhere - forgot where - a param to true: isDotNet or similar the prope name.</p>
