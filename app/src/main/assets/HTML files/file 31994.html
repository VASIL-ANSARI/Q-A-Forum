<p>My guess: </p>

<ul>
<li>you have a main navigation menu </li>
<li>and a secondary navigation menu, like a submenu, this one
related to the main content of that page which is placed aside BUT
related directly to the main content of the page &rarr; use nav not
aside</li>
</ul>

<p>even if it's placed aside, respectively in the left side, it is not aside content; 
aside tag applies to less relevant content from the relevant content ("relevant content" = the content within your main tag and so is your menu related to this main content)</p>

<p>see <a href="http://w3-video.com/Web_Technologies/HTML5/html5_aside_tag.php" rel="nofollow">aside</a>  for more infos</p>
