<p>Regarding the API it seems that the only supported actions are:
- check if AF is supported on the device (iPhones 3GS an 4 only I think)
- enable/disable AF
- set the point-of-interest that is NOT the distance, but only a point in the camera view.</p>

<p>Certainly not what you want to do.</p>

<p>Might be supported in private API... but that would not pass the validation process.</p>
