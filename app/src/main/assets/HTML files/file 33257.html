<p>There is something they call responsive design it might help you out ;)</p>

<p>it changes because of the fact that screen width isn't the same on every screen + if you scale down the browser window it also changes.</p>

<p>the solution is doing this:</p>

<p>you can fix this by using @media query's and a viewport in your css , and add this meta tag to your html:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale = 1.0,maximum-scale = 1.0â&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and with the @media query's and viewport you declare what size you have per screen width using this media query + viewport in css:</p>

<pre><code> @media screen and (min-width: 820px) and (max-width: 920px) {
  @viewport { width: 820px; }   
</code></pre>

<p>// your css for screens between 820 and 920 pixels in width goes here</p>

<pre><code>  }
</code></pre>

<p>i mostly use the value's : from 20 - 600 , 600-700 , 700-820 , 820 - 920 , 920 - 1200,   @media screen and (min-width: 1200px){  @viewport { width: 1200px; }(this last one will set the size for any screen bigger than 1200 px in width so  your code for the biggest version goeds here}</p>

<p>So this means you will have 6 times your css code which is adapted will be adapted to the size.</p>

<p>This is called adaptive or responsive design and is pretty easy to do</p>
