<p>Not being the an expert in Jasper I can suppose that the problem is in the text encoding. I performed a short search and found this resource: <a href="http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/misc/tools/jasper/java.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/misc/tools/jasper/java.html</a></p>

<p>Please take a look in the template example and pay attention on line <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</code> on top of the file. Does your file <code>report2.jasper</code> contain such line? Check it and include it if it is missing. </p>

<p>Additionally add line </p>

<p><code>exporter.setParameter(JRExporterParameter.CHARACTER_ENCODING, "UTF-8");</code></p>

<p>I hope now all will work. </p>
