<p>Sure.  You can simply use an insert with a select statement from the other table.  It is not the same logically as iterating over each row, but will get the same results (and perform much better)</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO tags (post_key, name)
  SELECT post.id, 'mytag' 
  FROM posts
  WHERE post.type = 'user'
</code></pre>
