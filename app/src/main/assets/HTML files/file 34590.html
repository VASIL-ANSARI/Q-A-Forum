<p>First, you need to define the requirements of your application. Then you need to clarify which data needs to be sent. Then you need to create and specify a data format. Then you need to define a network protocol. Then you need to implement this network protocol. And each of these steps is intrinsically non-trivial.</p>

<p>These are the general steps for this kind of problems. I did this many times in the past. I fear there is no easier way to do this. However, maybe you find a network protocol, a data format, or a library that already deals with the kind of data that you are trying to transfer. Without details of your particular application, however, its impossible to give a more detailed answer!</p>

<p>Hope this helps...</p>
