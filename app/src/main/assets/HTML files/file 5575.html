<p>If you installed an unofficial rom, perhaps it changes the usb VID/PID meaning you need a new driver.  You should ask the authors of your unofficial rom which driver to use for that rom on windows 7.  If you were using an OEM driver, perhaps you now need the vanilla SDK one.</p>

<p>Also look in the device manager (or boot from a linux CD or something) and see if plugging in the phone results in an additional unknown USB device showing up.  </p>

<p>Ideally you'd use another computer with a more user-friendly operating system to verify that the phone's usb interface is working after the upgrade - it's also possibly that something isn't right with your unofficial upgrade and you don't in fact have a working USB/ADB interface on the phone right now.</p>

<p>Did you re-enable USB debugging in the settings menu after the upgrade?</p>
