<p>In the event someone else finds this as yet unanswered question. </p>

<p>I encountered this today, and after searching, the best I've found is switching AutoScaleMode on all controls to Inherit (Find and Replace for designer files), and then after the generated InitializeComponent (probably just after ResumeLayout), Set AutoScaleMode to Font (or None... or Inherit). The common statement of set AutoScaleMode to DPI on everything didn't work, and actually failed more spectacularly then anything else.</p>

<p>From what I've found, it sounds like WPF fixes most/all of this by embracing it as part of the framework. Doesn't help for old winforms though.</p>
