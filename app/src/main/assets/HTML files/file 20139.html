<p>In the flex-direction-nav (<code>flexslider.css</code>:54), you set the following style:</p>

<pre><code>.flex-direction-nav .flex-prev {
    left: -36px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since the element is at the very left, that makes the site larger. Remove the flexslider, put it farther to the right, or change/delete that (questionable) CSS rule.</p>
