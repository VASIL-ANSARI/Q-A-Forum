<p>If you're interested in painlessly using Python with NumPy on Linux, Mac, or Windows, I'd highly suggest using the <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html" rel="nofollow">miniconda</a> distribution. Once it's installed, just open a terminal and run</p>

<pre><code>$ conda install python=3.5 numpy
</code></pre>

<p>and you'll be ready to go. It also makes the rest of the scientific Python ecosystem similarly easy to install.</p>
