<p>If I'm understanding your question correctly you are trying to get a count of user actions per day. </p>

<p>To accomplish that you are going to use a group by in conjunction with an aggregate function: <code>count</code></p>

<pre><code>Select Date("datetime"), "user", count("action")
From tablename 
Where Date("datetime") &gt; Curdate()
Group By Date("datetime"), user
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to offset it by 12 hours you'll need to do som date math.

<p>Writing this from my phone so you may have to clean this up, but replacing every <code>Date("datetime")</code> with something along the lines of the following should work</p>

<pre><code>Case 
    When `datetime` between Date_Add(Cur_Date(), Interval -7 -12 Day_Hour) And Date_Add(Cur_Date(), Interval -6 -12 Day_Hour) Then '7 days ago'
    When `datetime` between Date_Add(Cur_Date(), Interval -6 -12 Day_Hour) And Date_Add(Cur_Date(), Interval -5 -12 Day_Hour) Then '6 days ago'
    ....
End 
</code></pre>

<p>There's probably more elegant/efficient solutions, but that should get you going in the right direction</p>
