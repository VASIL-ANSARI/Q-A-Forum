<p>It seems you are trying to implement <strong>Master/Detail</strong> binding.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c12c1kx4.aspx" rel="nofollow">this example</a>, I think that this part of code only is wrong:</p>

<pre><code>_customerBs.DataMember = "CustomerOrderRelation";
</code></pre>

<p>Just try to set the relation in <code>DataMember</code> to the correct <code>bindingsource</code> (the detail bindingsource), and this should work:</p>

<pre><code>_orderBs.DataMember = "CustomerOrderRelation";
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
