<p>I cannot find any convert.php in the standard simple machines forum package. What conversion are you running exactly? Are you sure it is built to be used as a command line script?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> you could try <code>nohup php5 -f convert.php -- $OPTIONS &amp;</code> if you cannot use screen.</p>

<p>nohup -> don't kill the process after the current session dies</p>

<p>&amp; -> run in the background</p>
