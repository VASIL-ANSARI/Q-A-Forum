<p>This somewhat erratic behavior, where the <strong>entitymanager</strong> persists uncommitted changes without explicitly being told so, arrises because application-manged entity managers are always extended. The JPA specification (in section 3.3) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scope of the persistence context
  of an application-managed entity
  manager is extended. It is the
  responsibility of the application to
  manage the lifecycle of the
  persistence context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when the bean in question is already in persistence context and you perform a <strong>transaction.commit</strong> any uncommitted changes will be persisted even without a explicit <strong>entitymanager.persist</strong>. You can verify this behavior for yourself by clearing the entitymanager (<strong>entitymanager.clear</strong>) prior to committing the transaction. This will remove the entity from the tx-commit and will cause the transaction to perform no changes to the database.</p>
