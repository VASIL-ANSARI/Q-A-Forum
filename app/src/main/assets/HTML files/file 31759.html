<p>The webbrowser control has a loadedevent (which you have): 
LoadCompleted: fires when the dom is fully loaded.</p>

<p>Bind the event and in the event method get the document instead of right away.</p>

<pre><code>    //root is a grid element identified in the XAML
    public WebBrowser webb;

    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        webb = new WebBrowser();
        webb.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Hidden;
        root.Children.Add(webb);
        webb.LoadCompleted += webb_LoadCompleted;
        webb.Navigate("http://www.google.com");
    }

    void webb_LoadCompleted(object sender, NavigationEventArgs e)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Completed loading the page");

        mshtml.HTMLDocument doc = webb.Document as mshtml.HTMLDocument;
        mshtml.HTMLInputElement obj = doc.getElementById("gs_taif0") as mshtml.HTMLInputElement;
        mshtml.HTMLFormElement form = doc.forms.item(Type.Missing, 0) as mshtml.HTMLFormElement;

        webb.LoadCompleted -= webb_LoadCompleted; //REMOVE THE OLD EVENT METHOD BINDING
        webb.LoadCompleted += webb_LoadCompleted2; //BIND TO A NEW METHOD FOR THE EVENT
        obj.value = "test search";
        form.submit(); //PERFORM THE POST ON THE FORM OR SEARCH
    }

    //SECOND EVENT TO FIRE AFTER YOU POST INFORMATION
    void webb_LoadCompleted2(object sender, NavigationEventArgs e)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Completed loading the page second time after post"); 
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You need to do doc = wb.Document as mshtml.HTMLDocument; in the loadcompleted event. Because until the load is complete you cannot get the document.</p>
