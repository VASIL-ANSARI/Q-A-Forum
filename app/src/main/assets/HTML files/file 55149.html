<p>I expect the list which you have is already sorted ...</p>

<p>Then iterate with a loop from one link to the next. While iterating you store the previous node. When you find the first node which is worst than the node you want to insert. change the previous node next to the inserting node and the inserting node references the current node.</p>

<pre><code>// Pseudocode
Node previousNode = root;
while (previousNode.next != null) {
    Node current = previousNode.next;
    // Check current node
    if (current.value &lt; insert.value) {
        previousNode.next = insert;
        insert.next = current;
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to handle also the case insert at the end</p>
