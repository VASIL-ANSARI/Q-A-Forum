<p>If you can write javascript to the file and reuse it later on than it is not really dynamic isn't it?</p>

<p>Just create a js file and link it from the page.</p>

<p>In most cases the only 'dynamic' part of javascript are ids of the controls. Such javascript can be easily rewritten as functions that take control ids as parameters. You can that store the static script in js file (minified, gzipped, versioned and cached) and only embed invocation on the pages.</p>
