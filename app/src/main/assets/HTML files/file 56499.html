<p>To create an application that is server agnostic, you need to <strong>strictly</strong> adhere to Java EE specification. Meaning, use only those jars that are bundled as part of the Java EE version you are using. Then too, there are certain deployment descriptors specific to a given application server that would need to be used in some cases. For example - <code>jboss-deployment-structure.xml</code>, <code>ibm-application-bnd.xml</code>, etc.</p>

<p>In your case, <code>xlxpScanner.jar</code> is not a part of the Java EE spec, so making the application server independent is not possible with the current settings. You could look for a replacement of the part of this jar you are using with something Java EE has. In short, get rid of this jar alongwith <code>xlxpScannerUtils.jar</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want jboss to run the application properly, add all the jars in a module and give it to the EAR/WAR using <code>jboss-deployment-structure.xml</code>.
