<p>As mentioned by dirn in the comment, problem was click doesn't take affect when elements added to the page after it was called. </p>

<p>Solution is mentioned in one of the answers in this post 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7434685/event-when-element-added-to-page">Event when element added to page</a></p>

<p>a jQuery.on() approach would be more appropriate, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$("#myParentContainer").on('click', '.removeItemButton', function(){
      alert($(this).text() + ' has been removed'); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have dynamic content that should respond to clicks for example, it's best to bind events to a parent container using jQuery.on.</p>
