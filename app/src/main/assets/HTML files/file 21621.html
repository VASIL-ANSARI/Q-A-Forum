<p>I can't quite run your example right now, but from what it looks like, you're loading multiple jPlayer instances on the same page by looping through all of your audio files on the server side and writing out a bunch of html/js to the page.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I've used jPlayer, so please excuse me if I'm misremembering this, but there may be some built in functionality to allow you to queue audio files within it. </p>

<p>If I'm wrong, you could easily replicate this functionality by using some of the supplied events that fire when audio files start/finish. Basically, create some kind of Javascript array with the URLs of your audio files. Start playing the first audio file in the list. When that file finishes playing, jPlayer should fire some kind of finished event. When that happens, remove it from your list and move on to the next.</p>

<p>This should keep you from having songs playing on top of each other and allow you to play them in whatever order you prefer.</p>

<p>And remember, you should only be using your PHP code to create that JS list of URLs, either by writing out the JS to the screen or via some kind of AJAX call to retrieve the URLs. What it looks like you're doing now is looping over your HTML and creating many different jPlayer instances that are all playing on top of each other.</p>
