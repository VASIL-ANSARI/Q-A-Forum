<p>If you have limited checkboxes and radio buttons and you don't have any privacy about the elements values, you could use GET, but if controls are more or data being transfered is secured or private then you should use POST or REQUEST....
and then use GET,POST or REQUEST to get value on next form using some scripting language..and set the form 2 controls value according to that....</p>
