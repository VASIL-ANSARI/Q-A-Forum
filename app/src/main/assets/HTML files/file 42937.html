<p>Well, usually someone would use <code>arff</code> because it's a very simple file format, basically a <code>csv</code> file with a header describing the data and it's the usual way to save/read data using Weka.</p>

<p>The sample code to read arff file is exactly the one you provided, if you want to make use of the instances loaded you should work with your data. To print them:  <code>System.out.println(data);</code> You could check a lot of examples on how to work with the data (classification, clustering, etc) <a href="https://weka.wikispaces.com/Use+WEKA+in+your+Java+code" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The code you are using loads the arff file in a standard BufferedReader, then creates an ArffReader instance (arff) which reads the data completely from the reader, after that you use the getData method to return the data in a <a href="http://weka.sourceforge.net/doc.dev/weka/core/Instances.html" rel="nofollow">Instances</a> object (called data). Finally, you set which attribute is the class (the last one in your arff file).</p>

<p>If you want to iterate the Instances object and retrieve each instance:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt;= data.numInstances - 1; i++) {
    Instance instance = data.getInstance(i);
    System.out.println(instance.stringValue(0)); //get Attribute 0 as String
}
</code></pre>

<p>You are talking about batch and incremental read from an arff file. Batch mode reads the arff file completely and the incremental mode gives you the chance to read each instance (line) of the arff file and add it manually.</p>

<p>Code for incremental mode:</p>

<pre><code> BufferedReader reader =
   new BufferedReader(new FileReader("/some/where/file.arff"));
 ArffReader arff = new ArffReader(reader, 1000);
 Instances data = arff.getStructure();
 data.setClassIndex(data.numAttributes() - 1);
 Instance inst;
 while ((inst = arff.readInstance(data)) != null) {
   data.add(inst);
 }
</code></pre>
