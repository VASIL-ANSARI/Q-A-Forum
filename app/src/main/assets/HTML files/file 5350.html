<p>I think you really answered your own question.</p>

<p>Use redirect() when a simple flash message at the top of another page is an appropriate response, use $this->load->view() when you're providing an entire page worth of feedback for whatever the incoming request may be.</p>

<p>So for example, when a new user signs up the "Success" page would be a loaded view and perhaps when a user edits something in their account a flash message "Changes saved" or soemthing similar on the same page is sufficient.</p>
