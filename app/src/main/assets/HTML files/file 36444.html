<p><code>this.name = "Jill"</code> doesn't declare a variable named <code>name</code>. Instead it defines a key named <code>name</code> on the object instance (created by the <code>new</code> operator) and sets its value to <code>Jill</code>.</p>

<p>If you want your expected result, change <code>console.log(name)</code> to <code>console.log(this.name)</code> or change <code>this.name = "Jill"</code> to <code>var name = "Jill"</code>.</p>
