<p>Blogger parses the XML templates as XML, so they need to be valid XML to work with Blogger's backend.</p>

<p>However, when Blogger serves the resulting page to the browser it says that the Content-Type is <code>text/html; charset=UTF-8</code> (which is wrong, because it is XHTML (but see below)).</p>

<p>HTML and XHTML are different languages so when the browser parses the XHTML as HTML it doesn't do anything special with <code>&lt;![CDATA[</code> and just passes it to the JavaScript engine.</p>

<p><code>&lt;![CDATA[</code> isn't valid JavaScript, so this throws an exception.</p>

<p>By prefixing it <code>//</code>, you change the invalid JavaScript into a valid JavaScript line comment.</p>

<p><em>aside</em>: XHTML and HTML are similar enough that you can get away with pretending your XHTML is HTML if you <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/" rel="nofollow">follow the compatibility guidelines</a>.</p>
