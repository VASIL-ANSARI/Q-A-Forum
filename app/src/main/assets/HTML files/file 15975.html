<p>It can, but the invocation is a bit different:</p>

<pre><code>auto result_reverse = std::async([&amp;str]() mutable {
        std::reverse(str.begin(), str.end());
    });
</code></pre>

<p>This is because <code>std::reverse()</code> is not a function, rather a function template that turns into a function when it is invoked as a function.</p>

<p>The above reverses a copy of the string and throws away the result. To pass the string by reference the lambda expression should be changed to start with <code>[&amp;str]()</code>.</p>
