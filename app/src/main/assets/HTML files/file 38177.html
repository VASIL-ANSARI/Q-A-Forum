<p>z-index requires certain things to work. First, you need to create a stacking context on an element that is a "root" of both elements that need re-ordered. You can create a stacking context by adding <code>position: relative;</code>. in css (or use something in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context" rel="nofollow">this list</a>).</p>

<p>Then add a z-index to each branch off the root that needs to be set. and give them <code>position: absolute | relative;</code>. For example, this fiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/6fy1rccm/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/6fy1rccm/</a></p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong>
Given the website you linked, it works if you add</p>

<pre><code>z-index: 1;
position: relative;
</code></pre>

<p>to the role=banner css class.</p>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>position: relative;
z-index: 0;
</code></pre>

<p>to the container css class.</p>

<p>And I encourage you to read the first link I posted, lots of good stuff on stacking contexts in there without being too long or boring.</p>
