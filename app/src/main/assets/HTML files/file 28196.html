<p><code>attr_accessor</code> creates two methods that would look roughly like this if you were to write them by hand:</p>

<pre><code>def price
  @price
end

def price=(new_price)
  @price = new_price
end
</code></pre>

<p>You are never calling any of those methods, so it is irrelevant whether they exist or not.</p>
