<p>You can't rely on <em>any</em> ordering in SQL database tables. Insertion takes place in an implementation-dependent manner, and where rows end up depends entirely on the storage implementation used and the data that is already there.</p>

<p>As such, no reversing takes place; if you are selecting data from the table again and these rows come back in a reverse order, then that's a coincidence and not a choice the database made.</p>

<p>If rows must come back in a specific order, use <code>ORDER BY</code> when selecting. You could order by <code>ROWID</code> for example, which <em>may</em> be increasing monotonically for new rows and thus give you an approximation for insertion order. See <a href="http://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid" rel="nofollow"><em>ROWIDs and the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</em></a>.</p>
