<p>There are built in methods for detecting changes in Active Record.</p>

<p>The API has good documentation on the tracking changes: <a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Dirty.html" rel="nofollow">http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Dirty.html</a>.</p>

<p>In your case, it should simply be a matter of detecting which fields have changed in the Article, and then creating a new Revision from that. </p>

<p>Something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>article= Article.find(id)
article.attributes = params[:article]
if article.changed?  
  //new revision
end
</code></pre>
