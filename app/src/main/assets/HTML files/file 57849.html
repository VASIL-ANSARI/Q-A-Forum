<p>In my experience with such errors, it occurs when there's a multiple requests to read the file through socket, so at some point during the loop it cannot find the certificate and creates an error.</p>

<p>A bad way to fix it is to add <code>sleep(1)</code> before each call, to give it time to load the cert on each request.</p>

<p>A better way to fix it, is by sending a json list of 1000 users to the API or using a mailing list (I did it on other providers than SES though). One request, 1000 users, much more efficient and CPU friendly for both machines in interaction.</p>
