<p>To answer my own question, I think it's due to the webview not having any explicit reference frame to work with initially while it's loading contents, so it can't layout the contents correctly as seen when I suddenly made it the controller's view after the animation.</p>

<p>As a fix, all I had to do was give it a frame in viewDidLoad: <code>webView.frame = self.view.frame;</code></p>

<p>And  I got lucky above; the frame was already set for self.view by the time <code>viewDidLoad:</code> since it was specified in the nib.  If I dynamically generated the views in say <code>loadView:</code> without setting any frames there, I'd have to defer that frame assignment to <code>viewWillAppear:</code>.  (Wasted a little more time reminding myself of that the hard way!)</p>
