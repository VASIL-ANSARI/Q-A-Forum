<p>I guess the most important thing are the requirements i.e. without requirements you cannot do anything. So, it is quite difficult to answer your question the way it is.</p>

<p>Some Pointers from my side are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get all the functional requirements clear. (i.e. what is your software intended to do?)</li>
<li>Then decide and who all will be the users</li>
<li>Depending upon the users and environment, chart down non-functional requirements like performance, size, internationalization etc</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you are clear with these things, you can categorize your software like Gaming Software, Utility Library, Compiler etc. Once you are at this stage, if you post a query or search in google, you'll find plenty of help.</p>

<p>All the Best. : )</p>
