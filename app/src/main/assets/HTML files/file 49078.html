<p>You should have the following:</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent imageReturnedIntent) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, imageReturnedIntent);

        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
            if (mFileUri != null) {
                String mFilePath = mFileUri.toString();
                if (mFilePath != null) {
                    Intent intent = new Intent(mContext, SecondActivity.class);
                    intent.putExtra("filepath", mFilePath);
                    startActivity(intent);
                }
            }
        }               
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Please read my answer with sample code at the following question (I use Android Studio, not Eclipse, however I think it's easy for you to understand):</p>
