<p>It should be this simple because UNION already removes duplicates</p>

<pre><code>SELECT sender AS service FROM messages
UNION
SELECT receiver AS service FROM messages
ORDER BY service;
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/union.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL docs for UNION</a> agree with this and my sort here</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, provide a column alias in the first SELECT statement and refer to the alias in the ORDER BY</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On SQLFiddle my query works <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/c64e4/7" rel="nofollow">http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/c64e4/7</a> and does the OPs <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/c64e4/8" rel="nofollow">http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/c64e4/8</a></p>
