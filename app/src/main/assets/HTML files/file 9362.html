<p>Personally I prefer surrogate keys in most places; The two biggest reasons for this are 1) integer keys are generally smaller/faster and 2) Updating data doesn't require cascades.  That second point is a fairly important one for what you are doing; If there are several many to many tables referencing the tag table, then remember that if someone wants to update a tag (eg, to fix a spelling/case mistake, or to use a more/less specific word, etc), the update will need to be done across all of the tables at the same time.</p>

<p>I'm not saying that you should never use a natural key -- If I am certain that the natural key will never be changed, I will consider a natural key.  Just be certain, otherwise it becomes a pain to maintain.</p>
