<p>I think the simplest way to do this is to see which version of mscorlib.dll a given assembly references.  You can use the public key / version number of mscorlib to classify which version of the .Net framework it is as it's tied directly to the CLR.  You can use the assemblies reference to mscorlib to get the version information.</p>
