<p>I would probably make a RegExp test on the searchBoxLower. I'm not at home right now to test the code but I think this article might interest you. </p>

<p>Most of the time when I need autocomplete search I am working with Ajax and a database and I replace all accent characters with their original form if I may say this like that. Ex. all the Ã©Ã¨ÃªÃ Ã¢Ã´Ã¶, etc.. with 'e','a','o'. This makes the searching process a lot easier but it will give you more results.</p>

<p>I hope the article will help you.</p>
