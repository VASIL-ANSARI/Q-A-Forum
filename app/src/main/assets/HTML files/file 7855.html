<p>You might want to look into the maths behind this problem. It's not necessary to actually iterate through all routes. (In fact, you'll never make the 1 minute mark like that).</p>

<p>I can post a hint but won't do so unless you ask for it, since I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Yes, the algorithm you're using will never really be optimal since there's no way to reduce the search space of your problem. This means that (as pg1989 stated) you'll have to look into alternative means of solving this problem.</p>

<p>As sverre said looking over here might give a nudge in the right direction:
