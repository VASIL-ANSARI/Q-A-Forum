<p>If you want primitive types, then most compilers should offer <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> (or <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>), which contains types such as <code>uint8_t</code>, <code>uint16_t</code>, <code>uint32_t</code>.</p>

<p>If you want obscure sizes (like e.g. <code>uint13_t</code>), you're probably best just using a larger standard size.  If you need to save space, you might look into <code>std::bitset</code>, but this will probably be substantially slower for most operations.</p>
