<p>I'm gonna take a stab at this one even though the behavior you describe (as you've described it) isn't possible.</p>

<p>If you create a list, you need to make sure that each sublist is a different list.  Consider:</p>

<pre><code>a = []
b = [a, a]
</code></pre>

<p>Here I've created a list where both of the sublists are the exact same list.  If I change one, it will show up in both.  e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [a, a]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b[0].append(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
[[1], [1]]
</code></pre>

<p>you'll frequently see this behavior with a list initialized using the <code>*</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>a = [[None]*7]*7
</code></pre>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [[None]*7]*7
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[[None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0][1] = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[[None, 3, None, None, None, None, None], [None, 3, None, None, None, None, None], [None, 3, None, None, None, None, None], [None, 3, None, None, None, None, None], [None, 3, None, None, None, None, None], [None, 3, None, None, None, None, None], [None, 3, None, None, None, None, None]]
</code></pre>

<p>The fix is to not use the <code>*</code> 7 on the outer list (the inner list is OK since <code>None</code> is immutable):</p>

<pre><code>a = [[None]*7 for _ in range(7)]
</code></pre>

<p>e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [[None]*7 for _ in range(7)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0][1] = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[[None, 3, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]
</code></pre>
