<p>Create ssh key pairs for each server, use ssh-copy-id to copy public keys from server A to Server B, and from Server C to Server A.</p>

<p>All you have to do then is to tell your script to ssh to remote server A and then execute scp to copy files over to Server B.</p>

<p>Edit: You have to setup your ssh keys without a passphrase ! (Or use ssh-agent on server C and server A)</p>
