<p>The client should have versions on its Import-Package statements (or Require-Bundle) statements, like:</p>

<pre><code>Import-Package: com.services.payments;version="[1.0,2.0)"
</code></pre>

<p>And the service will export package as:</p>

<pre><code>Export-Package:  com.services.payments;version="1.0.0"
</code></pre>

<p>After you stop the first bundle and install second one, the client will not be resolved resolve (since the required constraint, <code>com.services.payments;version="[1.0,2.0)"</code> will not be satisfied.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you have two API packages, one with package versioned as "1.0.0" and second one with version "2.0.0", and client importing "1.0.0" API, the client will not "see" service implementing API version "2.0.0" at all.</p>
