<p>I dont think you can pass through refs to components in such a way,
certainly it would not work in <code>React</code> and I dont think it would work
in such a way in <code>React-Native</code> either.</p>

<p>I'm not clear why you are trying to <code>.open</code> the <code>Drawer</code> from the
<code>Map</code> component as it looks like the <code>Map</code> component can only be
accessed when the <code>Drawer</code> is open, but, if you want to access parent
behaviours from children a good pattern is to pass through functions
for children to execute (you could argue that this is actually bad
and that passing events around is a more robust pattern).</p>

<p>I've never used the library so I'm not totally clear on its usage but
you can pass functions through like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Application extends Component {

  closeControlPanel = () =&gt; {
    this.refs.drawer.close()
  };
  openControlPanel = () =&gt; {
    this.refs.drawer.open()
  };
  render () {
    return (
      &lt;Drawer
        ref="drawer"
        content={&lt;ControlPanel /&gt;}
        &gt;
        &lt;Map onMenuClose={ this.closeControlPanel.bind( this ) } /&gt;
      &lt;/Drawer&gt;
    )
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p>In this case <code>this.props.onMenuClose</code> should be attached to an action, which, when executed will trigger the function from the parent and execute the <code>this.refs.drawer.close</code> function.</p>
