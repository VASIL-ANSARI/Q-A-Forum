<p>I'll assume you are asking about GCC/G++ compiler.</p>

<p>The flag is <code>-l&lt;libName&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;libName&gt;</code> is the name of the library you want to link against. For example, <code>-lGL</code> links against the GL library.</p>

<p>The reason some libraries require multiple flags in certain order is simply the way they depend on each other (the libraries your library depends on might also depend on some other ones, and so on). The library's documentation should solve the problem in most cases.</p>
