<p>Besides the fact that you 'don't want to use a responsive menu', I see no other way (besides shrinking the images "manually" with fixed width values via css).</p>

<p>So for the responsive solution: By using following code</p>

<pre><code>.theimagesclass {
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>(got it from Bootstrap), you can make those images responsive and thus make them smaller on smaller devices.</p>

<p>If the images will behave strangely on bigger devices you can add a media query for the lower resolutions, for example:</p>

<pre><code>@media screen and (max-width:767px){
    .navclass img {
        display: block;
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is just targeting the images inside the .navclass element, if the screen resolution is lower than 768px.</p>
