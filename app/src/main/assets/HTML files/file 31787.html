<p>Because anonymous types have other very important feature - they provide you compile time type safety.</p>

<p>And because <code>dynamic</code> and anonymous types are just different concepts. The first one gives you ability to dispatch object members at runtime, the second lets you create statically typed objects with some base functionality (equality, hashcode, etc) without creating corresponding POCO classes. Why should they be implemented in the same way then?</p>

<p>btw. I use them quite a lot and really rarely needed to use <code>dynamic</code> to deal with them. Are you sure you're using these language features correctly?</p>

<p><em><strong>Update</em></strong></p>

<p>I think that's very important part of anonymous types tutorial:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you must store query results or pass them outside the method boundary, consider using an ordinary named struct or class instead of an anonymous type.</p>
