<p>Why don't you just store the value of each in memory after the first file read or just store them in the code.</p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>static class Globals
{
    public static string DB2ConnStr = String.Empty;
    public static string MSSQLStr = String.Empty;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can read and write these from anywhere and they will persist as long as the server is up (i.e. the app is running in an app domain)</p>

<p>You should also (hopefully) be aware of the security concerns of storing plain text credentials either in code or text docs and (if this is for production) provide some form of encryption / security / reduce user permissions of the account that is being used to access the database ;)</p>
