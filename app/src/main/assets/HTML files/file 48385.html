<p>You could use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-srf.html" rel="nofollow"><code>generate_series</code></a> to create a list of all the chapters between <code>chapter_start</code> and <code>chapter_end</code>, and then just group by them and count:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT   book, chapter, COUNT(*)
FROM     (SELECT book, GENERATE_SERIES(chapter_start, chapter_end) AS chapter
          FROM   mytable) t
GROUP BY book, chapter
</code></pre>
