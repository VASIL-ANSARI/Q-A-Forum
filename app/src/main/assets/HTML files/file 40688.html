<p>From your table structure it would seem you want a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  d.date, 
  CONCAT_WS(' ', p.Firstname ,p.Lastname) AS "Person", 
  v.status,
  CONCAT_WS(' ', s.FirstName, s.LastName) AS "Seenby",
  c.centername

FROM visit v 
JOIN person p ON v.PersonID = p.ID
JOIN seenby s ON v.seenbyID = s.ID
LEFT JOIN date d ON v.dateID = d.id 
LEFT JOIN center c ON v.centerID = c.id
</code></pre>

<p>The last two joins should maybe be normal inner joins and not left joins, adjust as appropriate.</p>

<p>The<code>CONCAT_WS()</code>function concatenates its parameters into a string, using the value of the first parameter as separator (a space in this case).</p>
