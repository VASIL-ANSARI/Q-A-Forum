<p>The fastest and easiest thing to do would be to provide the gray scale plane directly into libvpx compression function vpx_codec_encode with VPX_IMG_FMT_I420.  You'll have to input two 2x2 subsampled color planes with it though - 320x240 in your case - make all the octets of those planes have the value 128.</p>
