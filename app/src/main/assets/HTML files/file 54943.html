<p>The thing is when you are using function declaration you can place it wherever you want. It doesn't matter if you call function before you declare it, it will be available in memory, and you will not get errors. That's how JavaScript is interpreted.</p>

<p>That's not the case with the expression. Expression needs to be executed before it's called (it's expression, so it makes sense). So for example you <strong>can</strong> do this:</p>

<pre><code>  (function (ns) {
      'use strict';

      test();

      function test() {
          console.log('Test');
      }

  }(window.myProject));
</code></pre>

<p>But you <strong>can't</strong> do this:</p>

<pre><code>(function (ns) {
    'use strict';

    test();

    var test = function() {
        console.log('Test');
    }

}(window.myProject));
</code></pre>

<p>I think that's the only difference between those two. 
Javascript interpreter will find and move all declarations at the top of the scope (in your case <code>(function (ns) {...</code>) and that's why JSHint is complaining.</p>

<p>Conclusion, when JSHint see that you are using <code>this</code> inside function declaration it will warn you because interpreter will maybe move that function to different context and you will maybe have different value for <code>this</code>.</p>

<p>That's just a warning and theoretically it's possible that something similar can happen, but in most of the cases you are pretty much sure about your namespaces and contexts, so just ignore it ;)</p>
