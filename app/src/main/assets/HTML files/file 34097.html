<p>I would use ViewModels for the Views and the Api. This viewmodel is used to return to the browser as JSON or to build the View. </p>

<p>I would then use a library for the code handling and redirect to the libray in the Action methods in the view controller.</p>

<p>The View controller will recieve the ViewModel from the API or normal Action methods. It could pass this viewmodel along to the library or possibly translate it to a datamodel and then pass it to the library. In the same action method the view controller will get a model back from the library and rebuilds the viewmodel.</p>

<p>If you use a ViewModel the Api can easily translate it to and from JSON.</p>
