<p>You're really close to the mark - the problem lies here:</p>

<pre><code>        var query = rally.sdk.util.Query.and(['Iteration.Name != ""', 'Iteration.State = "Committed"']);

        if (ownerDropdown) {
            var ownerQuery = ownerDropdown.getValue();
            if (ownerQuery != 'ALL') {
                query = '(' + query + ' AND Owner.Name = "' + ownerQuery + '")';
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Rally's query syntax requires another nested set of parentheses when adding another AND condition. So when you concatenate on your third condition, you are ending up with a query clause that looks like this:</p>

<p><code>((Iteration.Name != "") AND (Iteration.State = "Committed")) AND (Owner.Name = "user@company.com")</code></p>

<p>When it needs to look like this:</p>

<p><code>(((Iteration.Name != "") AND (Iteration.State = "Committed")) AND (Owner.Name = "user@company.com"))</code></p>

<p>I slightly modified your refreshCardboard() function's query logic as follows, and your code seems to work now for me.</p>

<pre><code>    ....        
    var queryArray = new Array('Iteration.Name != ""', 'Iteration.State = "Committed"');                                       
    var query;

    var selectedOwner = ownerDropdown.getValue();

    if (ownerDropdown) {
       if (selectedOwner != 'ALL') {
          var ownerClause = 'Owner.Name = "' + selectedOwner + '"';
          queryArray.push(ownerClause);
       }
    }

    query = rally.sdk.util.Query.and(queryArray);

    cardboardConfig.query = query;
    ....
</code></pre>
