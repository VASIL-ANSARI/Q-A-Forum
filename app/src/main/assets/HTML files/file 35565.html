<p>If you want to Resize the Progress bar in GridLayout, then it may help here : </p>

<pre><code>barPanel.setLayout(new GridLayout(0 , 4,10,10));//Change Horizontal and Vertical gap like this
</code></pre>

<p>but may not give size what you want exactly it simply increase the gap between components.</p>

<p>Or other way</p>

<p>If you really interested in making ui, more better then create panel which will keep the progressbar only and set the label and new panel with existing barpanel. Still the size of the  Progressbar will be streched becs default layout of the panel is FlowLayout , and you can resize it using <code>setPreferredSize( new Dimension (width, height))</code>. You need to use the utility of Layout manager to design effectively.</p>

<p>Your modified Code should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>    barPanel.setLayout(new GridLayout(0 , 4));
     JPanel newPanel=new JPanel();

     healthBar = new JProgressBar (0,100);
     healthLabel = new JLabel ("Health: ");
      newPanel.add(healthBar);
      healthBar.setPreferredSize( new Dimension (width, height));
     //healthBar.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(width,height));
     //healthBar.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(width, height));

     barPanel.add(healthLabel);
     healthLabel.setForeground(Color.white);

 barPanel.add(newPanel);
</code></pre>
