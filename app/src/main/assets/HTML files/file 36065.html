<p>Month is defined as an int, yet you are trying to update the table and set Month to a varchar, like 'First Quarter'.  You can either change Month to store a varchar, and then modify your insert statement and WHEN Month IN pieces, or add an additional column that can store the quarter.</p>

<p>The query below shows the second option (adding an additional column).</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE q5
(
    UserID INT,
    Month INT,
    Score INT,
    Quarter varchar(20)
)

INSERT INTO q5(UserID, Month, Score)
VALUES (1,1,10), (1,2,5), (1,1,6), (2,8,6), (3,1,9), (3,4,11), (3,6,9), (4,9,10), (5,1,2);


UPDATE q5 
SET 
Quarter = CASE WHEN Month IN (1, 2, 3) THEN 'First Quarter'
             WHEN Month IN (4, 5, 6) THEN 'Second Quarter'
             WHEN Month IN (7, 8, 9) THEN 'Third Quarter'
             ELSE 'Fourth Quarter'
END 
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on how this is being utilized, you might be better off adding a View which would calculate the Quarter.  This way, you wouldn't have to maintain that additional column, which is entirely dependant on the Month column.</p>
