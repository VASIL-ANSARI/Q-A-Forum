<p>It is possible if you create your own sockets, as one of the <code>Socket</code> constructors allows you to specify the local address as well as the remote address.  You might have to construct your own HTTP request and parse the response, though.</p>

<p>As best I can tell, the <code>HttpUrlConnection</code> class does not allow you to specify its local address, perhaps because it manages connections itself behind the scenes, so unfortunately it looks like you won't be able to take advantage of its HTTP and URL related convenience methods.</p>
