<p>Not sure if I completely understand your question, I think you are asking something like: "If I'm using Spring AOP, why do I see references to AspectJ?"</p>

<p>If that's the case, you should know that Spring is not in <em>competition</em> with AspectJ, but rather <em>leverages</em> AspectJ for AOP.</p>

<p>See Spring documentation: <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html</a></p>
