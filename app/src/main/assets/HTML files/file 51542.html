<p>No they're not the same.</p>

<p>The first one has enough memory allocated to accommodate a full structure, and the second only has enough memory for a pointer. By doing <code>head2-&gt;value</code> you're accessing unallocated memory and will cause undefined behavior.</p>

<p>In fact you could "use" <code>head2-&gt;value</code> without allocating any memory (and without assigning any value to <code>head2</code>). You won't get a compile time error, and you might even not notice that at runtime, but if you have a large enough application you will eventually see weird things start to happen.</p>
