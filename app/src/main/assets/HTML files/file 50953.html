<p>A transaction - or a statement within a transaction - can affect many tables.</p>

<p>What's the "current table" in the query:</p>

<pre><code>select x.a, y.b
from x inner join y on (x.id = y.x_id);
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Or in the transaction:</p>

<pre><code>begin;

select * from x;

insert into y select a, b from x;    

update z set a = 42 where b = 7;
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Your question doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>The only time there's any concept of a "current table" or anything resembling that is when you're inserting into, updating or deleting from a table, in which case the target table is clearly more significant. Even then though, table inheritance, views with <code>on update do instead</code> triggers, etc mean it might not be simple.</p>

<p>Whatever you're trying to do, you need to find another way to do it. I suspect there's a deeper misunderstanding at work here and you need to post a new question with the "why" behind this "how", i.e. why you want to be able to do this, what the underlying problem you're trying to solve is.</p>
