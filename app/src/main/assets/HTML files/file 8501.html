<p>What about this: (describes algorithm only, not written in code)</p>

<p>Imagine you have the two strings written out on two sheets of paper. Place the two sheets so that one is above the other. Move the top sheet off to the left, so that its last letter is on top of the bottom sheet's first letter. Now, do the two overlapping letters match? If so, you have a match of length 1. Record that as your longest match. Then, move the top sheet one character to the right. Now two letters overlap. Do they match? If so, you have a max match of size 2. Keep moving the top sheet over 1 character to the right, and each time, find the largest section of matched, overlapping characters. Always keep track of your biggest match. Keep going until your top sheet is so far over to the right that its first character overlaps with the other sheet's last character.</p>

<p>I don't know how easy this would be to implement in javascript, but as an algorithm, I think it is sound.</p>

<p>PS- for the bit where you need to find the "largest section of matched, overlapping characters", you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>/* Note: str1 and str2 are the two overlapping portions of the strings */
var largestMatch = 0;
var currMatch = 0;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; str1.length; i++) {
    if (str1[i] == str2[i]) currMatch++;
    else currMatch = 0;
    largestMatch = Math.max(largestMatch, currMatch);
}
// largestMatch is the size of the largest section of matched characters
</code></pre>
