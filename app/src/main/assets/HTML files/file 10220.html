<p>You create a new <code>ArrayList C4</code>, you never put anything in the <code>List</code>, and then you ask it for the element at index <code>0</code>. This element does not exists since the List is still empty, and it throws an exception.</p>

<p>You can avoid this exception by adjusting your method</p>

<pre><code>public static EntityC4 getitemfromnumber(int num)
{
  EntityC4 entity = null;
  if ( num &gt;=0 &amp;&amp; num &lt; C4.size ){
    entity = (EntityC4)C4.get(num);
  }
  return entity;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will avoid the exception, but you will get stuck in your loop since you never find the element (which isn't available in the list)</p>
