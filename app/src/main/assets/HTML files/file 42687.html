<p>Please check the statusbar on your pc. Make sure the WampServer logo is green, and also make sure you have saved the file in the WWW folder within your wamp folder. The code above looks fine! Also if you have the file within a seperate folder in WWW be sure to navigate to it properly: input "localhost/NameofYourFolder" without quotes into your address bar!</p>
