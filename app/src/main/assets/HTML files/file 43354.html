<p>There's still not enough information to say anything for sure, but I believe you can try using @Autowired to wire up your needed component:</p>

<pre><code>@Autowired
private DocumentDao documentDao;
</code></pre>

<p>You got the error:</p>

<pre><code>org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'com.roler.res.test.ApiBackendTests': Injection of autowired dependencies failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field: private com.roler.res.mongodb.dao.DocumentDao
</code></pre>

<p>That means Spring isn't aware of the DocumentDao bean yet. There are several ways to do that, but I think the easiest way is putting this in your configuration context:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;context:component-scan base-package="package.contain.your.dao"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It will tell Spring to scan the package in search for components with annotation.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: since you don't use XML configuration, <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-javaconfig/docs/1.0.0.M4/reference/html/ch06s02.html" rel="nofollow">@ComponentScan</a> is the way to go</p>
