<p>If you're using mysql, then I think you just want to match on the day, not the time right? Stated another way, you want all records from Dec. 1st. Between 12:00am and 11:59pm on Dec. 1st is implied if you just search on date.</p>

<pre><code> scope :today, lambda { 
    where("created_at = ?",
           Time.now.strftime("%Y-%d-%m")
  } 
</code></pre>

<p>Something like that should work</p>
