<p><code>hidesBottomBarWhenPushed</code> is only relevant when you're pushing the view controller onto a <code>UINavigationController</code> stack. What you're doing with the <code>addSubview:</code> is that you're just adding the view of <code>game1</code> into the current view controller's view. That is not right at all and UIKit won't handle that at all.</p>

<p>You should put a <code>UINavigationController</code> as the view controller for your tab, then push the <code>game1</code> view controller with something like:</p>

<pre><code>[self.navigationController pushViewController:game1 animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>instead of <code>addSubview:</code>. That will then work with <code>hidesBottomBarWhenPushed</code>. Note however that it's probably best to set <code>hidesBottomBarWhenPushed</code> in the your <code>init</code> method of whatever class <code>game1</code> is, rather than in <code>viewDidLoad</code>.</p>
