<p><code>malloc()</code> is allowed to waste as much space as it wants to - the standard doesn't specify <em>anything</em> about the implementation.  The only guarantee you have is about alignment (<strong>รยง7.20.3 Memory management functions</strong>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object and then used to access such an object or an array of such objects in the space allocated (until the space is explicitly deallocated).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your implementation appears to return you minimum-8-byte-aligned pointers.</p>
