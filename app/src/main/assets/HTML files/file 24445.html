<p>Does the select <code>from:</code> need the select fields name or the ID? 
Try it with the ID instead (assuming standard form style):</p>

<pre><code>select student.name, from: "assignment_student_id"
</code></pre>

<p>If you inspect source on the select element you can confirm the fields ID.</p>

<p>Does it use the value of the option element rather than the text? Again, inspect and see what the value of "John Doe" is and see if it works by using student.id.</p>

<pre><code>select student.id, from: "assignment[student_id]"
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, have you tried the syntax in the documentation that includes the page?</p>

<pre><code>page.select student.name, :from =&gt; 'assignment[student_id]'
</code></pre>
