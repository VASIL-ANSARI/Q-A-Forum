<p>You have to make your <code>Vector2D</code> class a subclass of <code>object</code> otherwise a lot of things won't work properly. The things that won't work include <code>__new__</code> and <code>super</code>.</p>

<p>This should work just fine:</p>

<pre><code>class Vector2D(object):
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kw):
        print "Testing new"
        return super(Vector2D,cls).__new__(cls)


    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y


    def __str__(self):
        return "X:" + str(self.x) + ",Y:" + str(self.y)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the arguments used when you construct the instance are passed both to <code>__new__</code> and <code>__init__</code> so you have to be prepared to accept them in <code>__new__</code>, but your superclass (<code>object</code>) doesn't take any parameters in its <code>__new__</code> method so don't pass them up the chain.</p>
