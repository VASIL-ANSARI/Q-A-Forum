<p>You can't solve it directly, because you have conflicting mappings. But you can have spring read the html file and output it to the user.</p>

<p>A suggestion, though, is to use <code>.html</code> for the static files and thus not have any conflict.</p>

<p>Along with this also you need to put the resource handler so that the static content gets skipped from the dispatcher servlet.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mvc:resources location="/resources/" mapping="/resources/**" /&gt;
</code></pre>
