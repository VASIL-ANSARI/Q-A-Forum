<p>When you call the super constructor, you need to use <code>apply</code>, not call it as a simple function.</p>

<pre><code>var subClass = function() {
    baseClass.apply(this);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise your sub-classes new <code>this</code> object is passed as the first argument to the super constructor and <code>this</code> will refer to the global object (or null in strict mode).</p>

<p>A small thing, it common to Capitalise constructor functions so that its clear that they should be called with <code>new</code> and not as regular functions.</p>
