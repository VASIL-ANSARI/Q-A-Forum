<p>Backbone.js implements <code>fetch()</code>, <code>save()</code>, <code>destroy()</code> etc. methods on models automatically performing appropriate AJAX requests and parsing response. So it has a strong <em>support</em> for backend via REST services, but it is optional. </p>

<p>You can still use models, views, routers and events without any server-side code. Just don't call REST methods (or override them at your wish).</p>
