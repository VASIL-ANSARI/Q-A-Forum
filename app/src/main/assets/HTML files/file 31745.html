<p>You can achieve this result using by various means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Include Excel tables in Word.</li>
<li>Use VBA or VSTO as described above. There are various articles described already how to add code.</li>
<li>A (free) version of Invantive Composition as an add-in to Word (but I work there).</li>
<li>Maybe even RTF generation on a Samba share that automatically fills the RTF using the magic statement. Sorry, it is really called that way! See <a href="http://oreilly.com/openbook/samba/book/ch08_02.html" rel="nofollow">Samba book</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The option chosen depends on some variables I can think about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Roll out to how many client PCs?</li>
<li>Size in pages of the filled out document, such as 1 page or 1.500?</li>
<li>Controlled environment or PC's somewhere else in the world using a web frontend?</li>
<li>Number of document templates to be set up?</li>
<li>Support for both 32 or 64 bit Word?</li>
<li>Are database drivers available at all PC's?</li>
<li>May all users access the database (credentials)?</li>
<li>How frequently does the result of the SQL change?</li>
</ul>

<p>I can further pin down options when you provide some more background or an example of what the document should look like?</p>
