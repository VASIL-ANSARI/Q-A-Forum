<p>The result you want - <code>"s:27:\"[\"bob\",\"dave\",\"mark\"]\";"</code> - is a JSON string <code>["bob","dave","mark"]</code>.</p>

<p>What you insert back to serialize is just a string. In this exact case, doing this will work:</p>

<pre><code>var sernew = serialize(JSON.stringify(("bob,dave,mark").split(",")), "string");
</code></pre>

<p>But it might not work in all cases if you're not just having a simple array.</p>

<p>Can you show the full path of what are you doing with the string. Something might be incorrectly done.</p>
