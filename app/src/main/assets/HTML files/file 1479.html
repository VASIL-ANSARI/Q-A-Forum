<p>If you want to call an instance method you need an instance to call the method on.</p>

<p><code>self</code> is a reference to the instance that is being messaged.  Thus <code>self</code> in a class method is the class and <code>self</code> in an instance method is an instance of the class.</p>

<p>So, naively, you might do:</p>

<pre><code>+(id)barWithFoo:(NSFoo *) {
    [[[self alloc] init] foo]; //Raises compiler warning. 
}

-(void)foo {
//cool stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, that'd leak memory in a non-GC application (since the instance isn't being released or autoreleased).  Instead of explaining why, I will point you to the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html">Objective-C intro documentation</a>.  It is some awesome stuff, covering both Objective-C and general object oriented programming patterns.</p>
