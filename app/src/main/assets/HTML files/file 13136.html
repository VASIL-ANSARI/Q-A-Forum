<p>I know this isn't what you're hoping to hear but the problem is that you should be letting ActiveRecord do this work for you.</p>

<p>What you really want to solve this problem is to have these three files:</p>

<pre><code># user.rb
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = 'people'
  has_many :post_subscriptions
end
# post_subscription.rb
class PostSubscription &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :post
end
# post.rb
class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :post_subscriptions
  has_many :subscribers, :through =&gt; :post_subscriptions, :source =&gt; :user
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then you won't have to write any SQL at all. Just call <code>@post.subscribers</code> to get the full list of subscribed users.</p>
