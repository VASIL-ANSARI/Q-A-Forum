<p>The primary reason of using jQuery is to circumvent browser compatibility issues. The original purpose of jQuery was to provide a consistent set of objects and methods which abstracted the differing browser APIs. And using jQuery 2.0 won't solve that issue as it has dropped down support for IE 6, 7 and 8. </p>

<p>Besides that, there will be more bugs in jQuery 2.0 which is inevitable.</p>

<p>These are the two main reasons what makes Google choose jQuery 1.10.2 over the latess 2.x</p>

<p>Also, if jQuery 1.10.2 is supporting all browsers, why would anyone use 2.x which simply doesn't. It just needs some time but not right now for sure. </p>
