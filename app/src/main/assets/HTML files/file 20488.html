<p>This might be because the <code>imageView</code> is referring to the image, and before you setting a new background image, you are recycling the previous image (which is still referred by the <code>imageView</code>), and hence its throwing the exception.</p>

<p>Try following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the previous background by <code>BitmapDrawable bg = ((BitmapDrawable)llayout.getBackground());</code> </li>
<li>Now set new background</li>
<li>Garbage collect the previous background.</li>
</ol>
