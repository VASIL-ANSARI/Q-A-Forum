<p>You should be using instance variables instead of class variables. So set up your class something like this, and modify the rest of your code to fit it:</p>

<pre><code>class Event:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.people = []
</code></pre>

<p>The important difference here is just as you described: instance variables are set for a specific instance of the class, whereas class variables are set for <em>all</em> instances of that class.</p>
