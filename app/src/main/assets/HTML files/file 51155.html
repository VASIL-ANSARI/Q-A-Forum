<p>In Oracle odd things can happen when you use reserved key words.</p>

<p>I see you have a table column called TYPE which is a key word.  You could try the double quote trick like this</p>

<pre><code> INSERT INTO TEST (EMPLOYEE_ID, TRANSACTION_DATE, TRANSACTION_ID, "TYPE", ... 

%(TYPE)s, %(INDIRECT_ID)s, %(HOURS_WORKED)s, %(GOOD_QTY)s, %(BAD_QTY)s, %(SHIFT_ID)s, %(SETUP_COMPLETED)s, %(PASS_FAIL)s, %(CREATE_DATE)s, %(REASON)s, %(USER_ID)s, %(OPEN_OP)s)
</code></pre>

<p>If you still get odd errors I suggest renaming the column TYPE to something that is not a key word.</p>
