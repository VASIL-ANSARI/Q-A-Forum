<p>It looks ok as far as I can tell from what you posted. The only thing fishy is the <code>line</code> and <code>lineX</code> variables. They don't seem to be used. Also if you want to iterate through the first dimension of the 2D array, you will likely have to use nested for loops.</p>

<p>The rest of the post is a code review, rather than an answer:</p>

<p>The code posted is not a lookup table. Consider doing it like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>const uint16_t COLOR_TABLE [COLORS_N] = 
{
  RGBBlack,      // 0x0
  RGBBlue,       // 0x1
  RGBRed,        // 0x2
  RGBGreen,      // 0x3
  RGBCyan,       // 0x4
  undefined,     // 0x5
  RGBYellow,     // 0x6
  RGBKaneGreen,  // 0x7
  undefined,     // 0x8
  undefined,     // 0x9
  undefined,     // 0xA
  undefined,     // 0xB
  undefined,     // 0xC
  undefined,     // 0xD
  undefined,     // 0xE
  RGBWhite,      // 0xF
};

...

uint8_t line_iterator=0;

for(uint8_t i=0; i&lt;LINE_LENGTH/2; i++)
{
  uint8_t nibble;

  nibble = (uint8_t) ((GraphicsFrame[line][i]) &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 0x0F);
  lineBuffer[line_iterator] =  COLOR_TABLE[nibble];

  nibble = (uint8_t) (GraphicsFrame[line][i] &amp; 0x0F);
  lineBuffer[line_iterator + 1] =  COLOR_TABLE[nibble];

  line_iterator += 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Comments on the above:</p>

<ul>
<li>This lookup table will significantly improve both readability and program speed. If this is for an ISR you definitely must use a table like this.</li>
<li>Since it is an embedded system, you should use the integer types from stdint.h.</li>
<li>Beware of implicit integer promotions.</li>
<li>Keep for loops simple and avoid obfuscating them. Use self-explaining variable names for the iterators if you need more than one.</li>
<li>Don't use "magic numbers" like 30.</li>
</ul>
