<p>You should try <a href="http://express-io.org" rel="nofollow">express.io</a>.</p>

<p>It's a realtime-web framework that makes it easy to combine express &amp; socket.io.  Which means that your regular web and realtime web components should play nicely together.</p>

<p>It has session support and routing features.  Also, there is a lot of documentation and example code.</p>

<p>It's way simpler to setup a basic app, then using both libraries separately.</p>

<pre><code>app = require('express.io')
app.http().io()

// your game code goes here :)

app.listen(7076)
</code></pre>

<p>For mongo, my favorite is <a href="https://github.com/kissjs/node-mongoskin" rel="nofollow">mongo-skin</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose" rel="nofollow">mongoose</a> is also very popular.</p>

<p>Best of Luck!</p>
