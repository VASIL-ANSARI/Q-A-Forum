<p>I've ever doing this topic.</p>

<p>I suppose the screen is stable.
I think you can follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a background. Use HSV color space.</li>
<li>subtract image between your "destination frame"(any include object frame) and background.</li>
<li>After step 2 you'll get a different image, and set a threshold at channel H and V to binary image.</li>
<li>Remove noise by contour area size.</li>
<li>Smooth binary image use Gaussblur (maybe filter size 15*15). you'll get a more complete object image.</li>
<li>Make object image as mask you can delete the object and recover use background image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck!</p>
