<p>You are experiencing dupe rows because you are not tracking what has already been entered into the database. If you want to ensure this doesn't happen you can add a unique key to the email column of the database, this will ensure only unique email addresses are added.</p>

<p>However  you will have to add some sort of error handling otherwise your script will halt when it attempts to insert a dupe.</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE `my_table` ADD UNIQUE KEY (`email`);
</code></pre>
