<p>The error is basically telling you that maven is looking for the dependency "com.sun.jersey:jersey-grizzly:jar:1.0" in the repository "<a href="http://download.java.net/maven/glassfish" rel="nofollow">http://download.java.net/maven/glassfish</a>" that is your pom.xml and it can not find it.</p>

<p>Do you try it with the Maven Central Repository?? </p>
