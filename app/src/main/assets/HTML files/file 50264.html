<p>This is the php code that my app uses to send C2DM messages where $data is your data array. Please note that the Content-Length is necessary and is is the length of your data.</p>

<p>Something you may also find useful a class for php that makes sending messages a little nicer.</p>

<p>PS : You can change the links to your server so that you can use your server details.</p>
