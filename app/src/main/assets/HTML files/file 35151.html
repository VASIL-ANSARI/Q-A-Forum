<p>Play 2.2 is compatible with Java 6 and 7. Play itself doesn't ship with Java so your build will be picking up a version of Java that's already on your system.</p>

<p>Here's the logic inside the <code>play</code> command. As you can see, <code>play</code> uses the version of Java in the path or the version within <code>JAVA_HOME</code>.</p>

<pre><code>if [ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ]; then
  JAVA="java"
else
  JAVA="$JAVA_HOME/bin/java"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>Since you're getting a runtime error with a Tomcat class, I think it's most likely not a Play compile problem. My guess is that you're using a version of Tomcat that requires Java 7 or higher, such as Tomcat 8. See <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html" rel="nofollow">Apache Tomcat Versions</a> for more info.</p>

<p>By the way, you can configure SBT/Play to make sure it always generates Java 6 bytecode by giving the Java compiler some options:</p>

<pre><code>javacOptions ++= Seq("-source", "1.6", "-target", "1.6")
</code></pre>
