<p>This was a little bit tricky in OCIâitself. For BLOBs it's obvious - bytes. Just beware Oracle LOBs start with the 1st byte. (not from zero). For CLOBs it returns chars.</p>

<p>But OciLobRead/OciLobWrite return number of bytes written regardless on lob type. There were new functions introduced - OciLobRead2/OciLobWrite2 they return both positions(in bytes, in chars).</p>
