<p>You could create a generic view which simply lists the relevant columns from each plus the message type and then join to that from your messages table.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW ExampleView
AS
begin
    SELECT 
        firstname,
        lastname,
        1 AS MessageType
    FROM 
    dbo.Users
    union ALL
    SELECT 
        firstname,
        lastname,
        2 AS MessageType
    FROM 
    dbo.Clients
    union ALL
    SELECT 
        firstname,
        lastname,
        3 AS MessageType
    FROM 
    dbo.Workers
END
</code></pre>

<p>Query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
     a.MessageText,
     isnull(b.Firstname,'')+ISNULL(b.lastname,'') AS Name
FROM Messaging a
INNER JOIN ExampleView b ON a.MessageType = b.MessageType
</code></pre>

<p>If space isn't a massive issue you could store the message type directly on the Users,Clients and Workers table and just join to that column... Better performance but not really as nice database design.</p>
