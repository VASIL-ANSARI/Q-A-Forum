<p>It is hard to evaluate the correctness of your code without seeing the main method. Your 'main' class is set up in such a way that it appears the method mousePressed() is intended to poll the buttons and set the drawing mode based on their state.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to know if you are polling the buttons correctly, however, without viewing the main method.</p>

<p>If you are looking to use an Object-Oriented approach, you are going to want to use the <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/DesignPatternObserver/article.html" rel="nofollow">Observer pattern</a>. In essence, your buttons will all have a reference to the 'main' object which has a buttonClicked(Button btn) method. When a button is clicked, it runs the 'main' object's buttonClicked(Button btn) method. The argument provided will be a reference to the button that is clicked so that the main can choose the appropriate mode to use. Demo code follows:</p>

<p>In Main class:</p>

<pre><code>//Give the button a reference to the main object
button1 = new button(this);

//receive notifications from the button
public buttonClicked(Button btn) {
    if(btn.equals(button1))
        mode = 1;
    if(...)
        ...
}
</code></pre>
