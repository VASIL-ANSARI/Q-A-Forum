<p>First of all, it's important to <em>understand</em> what the <code>-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code> exactly does. It is a Sun/Oracle JVM-specific setting (which thus don't necessarily work in all other JVMs!) which basically instructs the JVM to read the Java <code>.class</code> files using the given encoding instead of the platform default one. So, setting this would only solve any possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake" rel="nofollow">Mojibake</a> problems which is caused by using "special characters" in Java class/variable names or hardcoded <code>String</code> values in Java classes (yes, you read it right: only Java classes, not other files, thus definitely not properties files or JSF XHTML files, etc).</p>

<p>In all honesty, I can hardly imagine that this is the right solution to your concrete problem. Why would one ever use special characters straight in Java classes? Class/variable names should be in all English and localized text should be placed in resource bundle files. Every self respected Java developer adeheres this convention.</p>

<p>Given that fact, and assuming that you are also not using special characters in Java classes at all, I thus believe that your concrete problem is caused by something else. The problem symptoms are not specific enough described (at which step exactly does it fail? which characters exactly do you expect and get instead? etc) to see the possible root cause of your concrete problem. I can at least tell that the URL pattern of your Spring filter is completely wrong. It must be mapped on <code>/*</code> </p>

<pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;filter-mapping&gt;
    &lt;filter-name&gt;encoder&lt;/filter-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><i>(by the way, you don't necessarily <em>need</em> Spring for this, just <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9634230/typing-chinese-with-primefaces-peditor-component/9839362#9839362">a custom <code>Filter</code></a> with only 2 or 3 lines in <code>doFilter()</code> implementation is already sufficient)</i></p>
