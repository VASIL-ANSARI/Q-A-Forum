<p>you probably need to do:</p>

<pre><code>int index=Convert.ToDouble(input);
</code></pre>

<p>and use in the for loop something like</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0;i&lt;index;i++)
</code></pre>

<p>since as it stands you retrieve an input but don't use it, in for loop in fact you're trying to set it to zero -> for(input=0;....)
which can't be done since input is a string and not a number</p>

<p>in case 3 you're using total as an index and as the total variable in the calculation you can't do that
you need another variable to use as a index:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i&lt;= 6; i++);
    {
        Console.WriteLine(total + "" + temp);
        total = total + Convert.ToDouble(temp);
    }
</code></pre>
