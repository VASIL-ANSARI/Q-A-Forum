<p>You have set up your database in an overly complicated way here.</p>

<p>You should have:</p>

<ul>
<li>an EventType table which defines each of your events</li>
<li>an EventLog table which registers each individual event, with "EventTypeId" foreign-key and timestamp.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything else you want to do will then be possible using database functions in queries.  Trying to store all of this information in tables is redundant because it already inherently exists in your other tables.  It should be the job of the program accessing your database to call the proper queries instead of the job of the database to save redundant information.</p>

<p>It is usually only a good idea to do this the way you have it set up now if you are making the same query over and over on static data (as in it very rarely updates).  You would use it in that case only because you are worrying about optimizing the runtime of the query.</p>
