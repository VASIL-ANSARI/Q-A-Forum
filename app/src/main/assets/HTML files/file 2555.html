<p>Somebody with more knowledge in this topic might jump in later, meanwhile my humble explanation is this:</p>

<p>What you say is right, generics have <strong>type erasure</strong> which means that generic information is not available at runtime. <em>It is</em> however available at <em>compile</em> time and that's how the compiler can figure out that you're mixing types.</p>

<p>Hope that helps! </p>
