<p>A programmer can create a separate application for managing contacts that has the features that you seek.</p>

  <p>I want to customize the contacts or phone application on Android mobile.</p>

<p>There are ~1.5 billion Android devices in use, spanning thousands of device models from hundreds of manufacturers. There will be dozens, if not hundreds, of built-in "contacts or phone applications" on those devices. You cannot extend any of them, unless they happen to have some API to allow for that. I am not aware of any that do.</p>
