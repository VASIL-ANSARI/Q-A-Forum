<p>If the tables have a (combination of) columns that is unique, you can build a list of ids in a subquery.  Then you can use two outer joins to simulate a full outer join:</p>

<pre><code>select  *
from    (
        select  col1
        from    t1
        union
        select  col1 
        from    t2
        ) ids
left join
        t1
on      ids.col1 = t1.col1
left join
        t2
on      ids.col1 = t2.col1
</code></pre>
