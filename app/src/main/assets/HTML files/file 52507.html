<p>The problem is that you check the return value of a procedure, which must be null, since a procedure does not return any value. It maximum returns a resultset.</p>

<p>Possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the procedure to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-procedure.html" rel="nofollow">function</a>, that returns the staffid.</li>
<li>Add an out parameter to the procedure and use that to retrieve the staffid. The above link also describes how to do this.</li>
</ol>
