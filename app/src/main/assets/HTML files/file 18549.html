<p>Attaching your listener to the button has is probably not what you want. You probably want to add it to the <code>JPanel</code> that has the focus. And their is the catch ... the one that has the focus. Seems to be different on different platforms, and very unreliable to get your listener triggered.</p>

<p>Better is to opt for key bindings. The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/keybinding.html" rel="nofollow">Swing keybindings tutorial</a> contains enough sample code to illustrate how to use them.</p>

<p>The rest of your logic seems in order. Changing the position when the action is triggered and scheduling a repaint.</p>
