<p>To easily (and efficiently) generate a deck of cards in a list format you can type:</p>

<p><code>deck = [str(x)+y for x in range(1,14) for y in ["S","H","C","D"]]</code></p>

<p>-</p>

<p>When you <code>print(deck)</code> you will get an output like this:</p>

<p><code>['1S', '1H', '1C', '1D', '2S', '2H', '2C', '2D', '3S', '3H', '3C', '3D'.....</code></p>

<p>-</p>

<p>To change the output from <code>"3C"</code> to something like <code>"3 of Clubs"</code>for example, then change</p>

<p><code>["S","H","C","D"]</code> to <code>[" of Spades"," of Hearts"," of Clubs"," of Diamonds"]</code></p>

<p>-</p>

<p>This will make your list look like: <code>['1 of Spades', '1 of Hearts', '1 of Clubs', '1 of Diamonds', '2 of Spades', '2 of Hearts'.....</code> and so on.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p><em>Note: The initial example is probably the shortest that you can get it...</em></p>
