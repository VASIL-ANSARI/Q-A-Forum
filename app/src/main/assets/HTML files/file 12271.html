<pre><code>            // resize the dgv and columns
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; languageTabs.TabCount; i++)
            {
                Control[] ctrls = languageTabs.TabPages[i].Controls.Find(languageTabs.TabPages[i].Name + "Grid", true);
                DataGridView dgv = ctrls[0] as DataGridView;

                dgv.SetBounds(14, 14, this.Width - 70, this.Height - 150);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>The problem was the ammont I was sizing by ( -70 , -150). Before it was too little so the scroll bar was hidden to the right.</p>
