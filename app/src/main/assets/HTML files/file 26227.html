<p>I'm actually doing exactly what you are asking for. What I did was to convert the returned bytes into a base64 string. In C# it's quite easy as there is a convert function to do that.</p>

<p>On the webpage you then have to set the src attribute of a img tag to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="data: image/jpg;base64,PlaceBase64StringHere"...../&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is a little overhead in the converted string, but it's very easy to handle and you use the power of the client browser to render the image.</p>
