<p>IMHO, as you have written <code>struct commandReq_t : public NWK_DataReq_t {</code> and tagged the question as <a href="/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;" rel="tag">c++</a>, you are now in c++ world.</p>

<p>IMHO, the simplest way to initialize an object is then in a constructor:</p>

<pre><code>struct commandReq_t : public NWK_DataReq_t {
    commandReq_t() { // default ctor
        dstAddr = 2;
        options = 8;
        strcpy(newVar, "Hello");
        confirm     = &amp;commandReqConf;
    }

    char       newVar[20];  // initialized at ctor initialization time
} commandReq;
...
static void commandReqConf(NWK_DataReq_t *req);
</code></pre>

<p>as the function <code>commandReqConf</code> is in fact member of a class <code>CzarController</code>, it should be static - but it need not to be qualified if it is contained in same class as is the struct.</p>
