<p>MAybe you should use keypress() instead of change() and put some additional logic in it.</p>

<pre><code>$('input').keypress(function() {
    var val = $(this).val();
    if (val.length &gt; 0){
         g_page_changed = true;
    }else{
         g_page_changed = false;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>With this code you check if the lemgth of the input field is > 0 and then set the variable to true or otherwise (if the user cancelled all he entered) check it back to false. Look around for jquery plugins that check for 'dirtieness' of inputs if the input field has alredy some text in when the pages load.</p>

<p>The change event is triggered only when the input fields lose focus, i think.</p>
