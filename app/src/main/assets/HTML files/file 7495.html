<p>That code doesn't exactly work well in Chrome. The problem that breaks it in Internet Explorer, however, is the trailing comma in the object literal:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).clone().css({
    position: "absolute",
    top: offsetTop,
    left: offsetLeft, // &lt;-- here
}).attr("id", "cloned").appendTo("body");
</code></pre>

<p>That syntax is valid, but causes an error in Internet Explorer before v9.</p>
