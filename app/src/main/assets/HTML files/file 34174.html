<p>You posted code from your app delegate, but what method is that in?</p>

<p>The app delegate can retrieve information about the notification and respond to it in its <code>- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo</code> method. From there you you can do whatever you wish and use the notification to inform your decisions. </p>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application%3adidReceiveLocalNotification%3a" rel="nofollow">UIApplicationDelegate protocol reference</a></p>
