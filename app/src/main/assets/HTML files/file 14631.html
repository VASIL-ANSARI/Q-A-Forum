<p>As stated in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/en/local-variable-scope.html" rel="nofollow">the manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Local variables are in scope only during stored program execution. References to them are not permitted within prepared statements because those are global to the current session and the variables might have gone out of scope when the statement is executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should instead fetch your cursor into <em>user</em> variables and either reference those from the prepared statement (they remain in scope for the duration of the connection), or (better yet) pass them to the prepared statement as parameters:</p>

<pre><code>SET @s=CONCAT('UPDATE ',fname , ' SET connectedDateTime = ?,opid = ? 
WHERE hq_conferee_seqno=? AND (LoggedDateTime &lt;=? AND connectedDateTime IS NULL)');
FETCH cur1 INTO @a1, @ldt1, @b1;
PREPARE stmt FROM @s;
EXECUTE stmt USING @ldt1, @b1, @a1, @ldt1;
</code></pre>
