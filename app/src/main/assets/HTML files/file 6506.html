<p>You aren't adding another member function to <code>ostream</code>, since that would require redefining the class.  You can't add it to <code>myClass</code>, since the <code>ostream</code> goes first.  The only thing you can do is add an overload to an independent function, which is what you're doing in the example.</p>
