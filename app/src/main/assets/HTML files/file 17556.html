<p>I think that there is another exception that is causing this problem, but somehow it gets swallowed. Looking at the stacktrace i would try to set a breakpoint at</p>

<p><code>org.jboss.seam.faces.transaction.UnexpectedExceptionObserver.processEvent(UnexpectedExceptionObserver.java:48)</code></p>

<p>and see what is going on there. After calling UnexpectedExceptionObserver.processEvent Seam is setting transaction to rollbackOnly just like it would after exception e.g. NullPoInterException.</p>
