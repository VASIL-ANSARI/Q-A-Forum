  <p>First question is I apparently don't understand how to call the next function motor inside my first function. It stops there and gives me: AttributeError: motor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is in last line of <em>makerecipe</em> function:</p>

<pre><code>root.motor(argu)
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <em>root</em> is a TK object which does not have a motor function. That's the reason for AttributeError. Changing this line to:</p>

<pre><code>motor(argu)
</code></pre>

<p>Would remove this error.</p>

  <p>Second question is I know how to work with time.sleep, but I read everywhere on this forum that you should not do this. So I am trying to use after, but don't know how to use this properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should use after because Tk has an eventloop running (the <em>root.mainloop()</em> call) to react based on events (like calling your functions when a button is clicked, or a certain time has passed). But if you use <em>time.sleep</em> in your code, you might interfere with this eventloop.</p>

<p>The fix is that you should pass a function reference to <em>after</em>, so Tk eventloop would call that function when the right time comes. But here, you are calling the function right away:</p>

<pre><code>root.after(1000, motor(alfa)) #This goes wrong.
</code></pre>

<p>This line is calling <em>motor</em> (and passing <em>alfa</em> as argument) and then passing the return value of motor (which could be anything) to <em>root.after</em>.</p>

<p>This line should be like this:</p>

<pre><code>root.after(1000, motor, alfa)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we are telling <em>root</em> to call <em>motor</em> with the <em>alfa</em> argument, after 1 second.</p>
