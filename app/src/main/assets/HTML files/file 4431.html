<p><code>(^|\D)(\d{6})(\D|$)</code>. You will find your needed 6 digit match in capturing group 2. <em>Notice that this solution is reliable only for one match. It won't find both numbers in <code>123456,567890</code> (Thank you Alan for pointing this out!). If multiple matches are needed a lookaround solution should be used.</em></p>

<p>With look-arounds:</p>

<p><code>(?&lt;=^|\D)\d{6}(?=\D|$)</code></p>

<p>or with look-arounds and the condition to be a valid number (i.e. the first digit is not 0):</p>

<p><code>(?&lt;=^|\D)[1-9]\d{5}(?=\D|$)</code></p>
