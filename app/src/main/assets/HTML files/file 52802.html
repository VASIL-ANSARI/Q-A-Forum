<p>Why have you declared <code>NSInteger* VIDEOQUALITY;</code> as pointer? It seems like you don't need this, 'cause <code>NSInteger</code> is <em>primitive</em> type and is defined as unsigned <code>int NSUInteger</code>(for example). 
I think if you change you declaration to </p>

<pre><code>{
   NSInteger VIDEOQUALITY;
}
...

@property (nonatomic,assign) NSInteger VIDEOQUALITY;
</code></pre>

<p>and implementation to</p>

<pre><code>-(void)setVideoQual:(NSInteger)quality
{
    NSLog(@"SETTING VIDEO QUALITY %ld",quality);
    VIDEOQUALITY=quality;
}
</code></pre>

<p>you'll get desired behaviour.</p>
