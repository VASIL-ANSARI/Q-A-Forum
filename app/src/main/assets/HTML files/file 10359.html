<p>In many cases, you can link your programm statically against the C runtime library. In this case the redistributable package is not needed because all necessary functions are copied into your application's executable. If you however link against it dynamically, you should deliver the redistributable package with your application. While many other applications do this as well, there is no guarantee that the necessary runtime is available on the target system.</p>

<p>You can change how you link against the runtime in your project's settings dialog under "C/C++ > Code Generation > Runtime Library".</p>

<p>The following MSDN article explains how you redistribute the necessary VC++ files: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235299%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235299%28v=vs.80%29.aspx</a></p>
