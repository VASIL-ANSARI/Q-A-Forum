<p>You probably have an auto created folder for test cases in your project called MyProjectTests.</p>

<p>In there is an m-file that would be importing XCTest.</p>

<p>The error is implying that XCTest.h is not found, which means that the XCTest-library isn't linked. If you don't plan on using tests, you can remove all the test files. Otherwise, make sure that you have linked the XCTest-library.</p>
