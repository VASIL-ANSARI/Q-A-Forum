<p>The eventual solution:
It was not a [Key] problem at all, despite the error message.</p>

<p>I had used [Index] on some columns which were string-types too, and unlike columns with the [Key] attribute, EF does not automagically set these to an nvarchar type of limited length.
Decorate those columns with the attribute [MaxLength(255)], and MySQL is happy.</p>
