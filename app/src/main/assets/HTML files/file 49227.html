<p>There are two ways of stopping a running animation.</p>

<pre><code>Animator.end()     // end the animation
Animator.cancel()  // cancel the animation
</code></pre>

<p>You can use either the <code>end()</code> method or the <code>cancel()</code> method. In both cases the animation will stop and can only be restarted by calling <code>start()</code>.<br/>
The difference between <code>end()</code> and <code>cancel()</code> is the state that the animated objects will be in after the call to the method.<br/>
When calling <code>cancel()</code> the animation will stop in its tracks, leaving the animated objects in an intermediate state.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When calling the end() method the animation will effectively be fast forwarded into the final state of the animation.<br/></strong><br/>
All objects will appear the way they would at the end of the animation.</p>
