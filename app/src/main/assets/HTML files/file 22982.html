<p>I am able to solve the issue.</p>

<p>One of the dll causing reference issue, but build is getting succeed.</p>

<p>Solved by following these steps</p>

<ol>
<li>Checked in the temporary folder(C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files) where VS Creates dlls for each page( i have opted for individual assemblies while publishing)</li>
<li>Before creating dlls, it generates .Compiled files and then converts each file to a dll.</li>
<li>we found one of the page is not getting converted to dll, instead it created a file with .delete extension and halted.</li>
<li>Now we ran our application from VS and tried open the page which is not able getting converted to dll.</li>
<li>Now we got the issue as an exception.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this will help some one else. </p>
