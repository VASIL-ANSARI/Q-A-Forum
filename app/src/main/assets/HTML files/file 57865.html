<p>To me it makes sense that if you login as one user and query for another user using the masterKey, that user returned would not have a session token even if they were currently logged in and had a valid session.</p>

<p>Why do you need to "become" that user? </p>

<p>Why not just do what ever query/update you need to do using the masterkey instead of "becoming" that user to do it?</p>
