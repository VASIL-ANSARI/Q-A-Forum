<p>Here is a sample code which I have tried when you drop a file on a shourtcut or an exe. Windows automaticly sends the path of the as an arguments to the main of the program. Simple as that. </p>

<p>Try droping something on this little programs and you will see the path of the file dropped in the console.</p>

<pre><code>class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.Length; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("ARGS&gt;&gt;" + args[i]);
        }

        Console.ReadLine();

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And If you are new to programing and don't have a main for your program where you directly start a form. You can use 
<code>Environment.GetCommandLineArgs();</code> 
it stores the arguments send to the program my friend. Which in this situation it will have path to the whatever dropped on the shortcut.</p>
