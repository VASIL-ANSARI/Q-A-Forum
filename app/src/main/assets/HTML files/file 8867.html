<p>You can't just make a function pointer out of an Objective-C function using the <code>&amp;</code> Operator.</p>

<p>You'll want to look into:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Selector.html" rel="nofollow">@selector</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/reference/Foundation/Classes/NSInvocation_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">NSInvocation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/00_Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">Blocks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these can do what you want. Definitely read about selectors (the <code>@selector</code> compiler directive and the <code>SEL</code> type) if you're unfamiliar with that (it's a basic concept that you'll need a lot). Blocks are fairly new (available since Mac OS X 10.6 and iOS 4) and they'll save you a ton of work where you would have needed target/selector, NSInvocation or callback functions on earlier versions of Mac OS X and iOS.</p>
