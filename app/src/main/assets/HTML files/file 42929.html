<p><code>window</code> is a browser object, so it's not going to be available in Node. If you want to run tests exclusively in the node client (<code>intern-client</code>), you'll need to make sure you're not using (and none of your dependencies are using) any code that references browser objects like <code>document</code>, <code>window</code>, <code>navigator</code>, etc.</p>

<p>If the stack trace line numbers are off, it's probably the code coverage instrumentation. You can disable that by setting the <code>excludeInstrumentation</code> property in your Intern config to <code>/./</code>.</p>
