<p>Sounds to me like you are treating a symptom: poor design with dependencies on static initialization.  Maybe some refactoring is the real solution.  It sounds like you've already done a little refactoring with your <code>staticInit()</code> function, but maybe that function needs to be called from the constructor, not from a static initializer.  If you can do away with static initializers period, you will be better off.  Only you can make this decision (<em>I can't see your codebase</em>) but some refactoring will definitely help.</p>

<p>As for mocking, I use EasyMock, but I have run into the same issue.  Side effects of static initializers in legacy code make testing difficult.  Our answer was to refactor out the static initializer.</p>
