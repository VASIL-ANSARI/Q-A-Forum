<p>i would comment, but i don't have enough reputation. Seeing that your question is from last year ... i wonder what solutions you found and what solution you had chosen.</p>

<p>Edit: Maybe this will help someone.</p>

<p>What i did is : get a list of Types that i want to save from the MEF components and save them via  System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer.
It has a Knowntypes Property that you can set in the constructor.</p>

<pre><code>MEF_ComponenentList.Select(item =&gt; item.GetType());

public static void SerializeSomething&lt;T&gt;(T objToSave, string fileToSaveTo, IEnumerable&lt;Type&gt; KnownTypes = null)
    {
        var ser = new  System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer(typeof(T));
        var settings = new XmlWriterSettings { Indent = true };
        System.IO.File.Delete(fileToSaveTo);
        if (KnownTypes != null)
        {
            var sum = ser.KnownTypes.Concat(KnownTypes);
            ser = new  System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer(typeof(T), sum);
        }
        using (var writer = XmlWriter.Create(fileToSaveTo, settings))
        {
            ser.WriteObject(writer, objToSave);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You have to be carefull with properties you make public etc ... Or you have to use IgnoreDataMember.</p>
