<p>There are ways to do introspection in SQL and pull out table and column names, but you probably don't want to do it that way, and the implementation details of that are highly dependent on your particular RDBMS.</p>

<p>Since the human-readable column name is a <em>display</em> detail, and likely a static value, keep it out of the database and somewhere in the display/rendering portion of your app. (There are exceptions to this, such as if you want the column name to be customizable per-user.) You can keep a hash or dictionary which defines a human-friendly name and uses the actual database column name as its key. This setup can be handy for saving other settings for the display of the column, such as datatype, precision to display (if a number), etc.</p>
