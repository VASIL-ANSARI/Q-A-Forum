<p>First, test if the stand-alone Apple Maps app can actually recognize the address, as entered. If not, play with the stand-alone app until you figure out what confuses the service. Google has hosted their service for aâ¦ longer time and they're, well, a search company -- it's only natural that their expertise includes advanced language processing.</p>

<p>On a second note, I would also suggest that you use the new iOS 6 API for opening Maps. This is how I do routing from coordinates.</p>

<pre><code>// if you know the coordinates:
MKPlacemark * srcPlacemark = 
    [[[MKPlacemark alloc] initWithCoordinate:src 
                           addressDictionary:[NSDictionary dictionary]] autorelease];
MKMapItem * srcObj = [[[MKMapItem alloc] initWithPlacemark:srcPlacemark] autorelease];
// alternatively, if you want to use "user's current location":
// MKMapItem * srcObj = [MKMapItem mapItemForCurrentLocation];

// if you know the address:
NSDictionary * dstDict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
                          self.addressLabel.text, kABPersonAddressStreetKey,
                          self.city ? self.city : @"", kABPersonAddressCityKey,
                          self.country ? self.country : @"", kABPersonAddressCountryKey,
                          nil];
MKPlacemark * dstPlacemark = [[[MKPlacemark alloc] initWithCoordinate:dst addressDictionary:dstDict] autorelease];
MKMapItem * dstObj = [[[MKMapItem alloc] initWithPlacemark:dstPlacemark] autorelease];

return [MKMapItem openMapsWithItems:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:srcObj, dstObj, nil] 
                      launchOptions:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeDriving 
                                                                forKey:MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeKey]];
</code></pre>
