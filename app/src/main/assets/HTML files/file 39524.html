<p>Notice that you specify <code>&lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;</code>. You can use this pattern to apply the security constraint to only those URLs that you want to require authentication. Any URL that does not match this pattern will not have this security constraint applied.</p>

<p>You can also add a second security-constraint with a url-pattern that matches the URLs that you don't want secured. In this case, leave out the auth-constraint tag entirely so everyone is allowed to access those URLs. Look at this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20360377/multiple-security-constraints-in-web-xml-not-working">other question</a> for an example.</p>
