<p>see in method <code>AddNonceForMethod()</code> you are calling another method <code>RemoveNonceForMethod()</code>, and that is where you are getting an exception ( if u look closely at your logcat you'll get that) , now comming back to the exception :-<p>
you are creating database helper instance using <code>this.getWritableDatabase()</code> by using <code>this</code> you are referring to current instance of your class and hence you are using same instance of database in your every method , so when your finally block is called in <code>RemoveNonceForMethod()</code> the instance of database u are using is getting closed. </p>

<p>try creating new object in your method :-</p>

<pre><code> WebServicesDataManager dataManager = new WebServicesDataManager();
 SQLiteDatabase db = dataManager.getWritableDatabase();
</code></pre>

<p>by the way you should look at other approach to handle database in Android like singleton approach or wrapping database using contentprovider !!</p>
