<p>Am not telling this is the right answer, but maybe the HR just wanted to check your creativity applied to java language..</p>

<p>something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Number.values()[Number.One.getNumber() + Number.Two.getNumber()]);
    }
}

public enum Number {
    Zero(0), One(1), Two(2), Three(3);
    private final int someIndexThatLooksLikeACardinalButIsNot;

    private Number(int card) {
        this.someIndexThatLooksLikeACardinalButIsNot = card;
    }

    public int getNumber() {
        return this.someIndexThatLooksLikeACardinalButIsNot;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Note before down vote:</h1>

<p>If your Enum would be defined in the exactly order, then there is no need for an int variable for cardinality value, but <strong>IT IS</strong> a good practice not relying to the order of the defined fields in the  enum...(It has to work even if the order changes.)</p>
