<p>I figured it out. Capistrano was one of the gems recently updated (to 2.15.5), and I noticed capistrano was in the stack trace. So I downgraded to the last known working version of capistrano which was 2.12.0, and now things are working splendidly. Before that, my stopgap measure was to add <code>YAML::ENGINE.yamler="syck"</code> to <code>~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/capistrano-2.15.5/lib/capistrano/recipes/deploy/assets.rb:26</code>, similar to what is recommended <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12211307/243500">here</a>.</p>
