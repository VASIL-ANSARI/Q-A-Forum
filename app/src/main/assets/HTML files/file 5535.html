<p>They will never match because you're comparing two separate <code>Date</code> object instances.</p>

<p>You need to get some common value that can be compared. For example <code>.toDateString()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>today.toDateString() == today2.toDateString();  // true
</code></pre>

<p>If you just compare two separate <code>Date</code> objects, even if they have the exact same date value, they are still different.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>today == new Date( today );  // false
</code></pre>

<p>They are the same date/time value, but are not the same object, so the result is <code>false</code>.</p>
