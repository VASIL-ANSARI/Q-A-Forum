<p>You are missing the loop variable declaration, and the declared type was wrong - oh, and you were using the wrong sequence. I think this is what you want:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var guest in booking.tblBookingGuests)
{
    // Do something with guest
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that your line of code</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;tblBookingGuest&gt; guests = booking.tblBookingGuests.ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>is superfluous. It will make a copy of the entire sequence of booking guests.</p>

<p>You should just use <code>booking.tblBookingGuests</code> directly in the <code>foreach</code> <em>unless</em> you are going to modify the list itself rather than the items in it. (If you do that, it won't change the original, of course.)</p>
