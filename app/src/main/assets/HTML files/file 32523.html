<p>As I understand, you can receive user's location using standart Android methods (<a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/location.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/location.html</a>) and set location in AdRequest using this method:
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/AdRequest.Builder.html#setLocation(android.location.Location)" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/AdRequest.Builder.html#setLocation(android.location.Location)</a></p>
