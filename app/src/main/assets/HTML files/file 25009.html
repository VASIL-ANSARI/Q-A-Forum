<p>Nope. Nothing wrong with that. As long as the Linq expression is short and easily readable, I'd say that's the most important thing. Your example is a really good example of when such queries should be use that way. </p>

<p>If it get's much longer than that or if you use query syntax, however, I recommend splitting it into two lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>var names = persons.Select(x =&gt; x.name).Blah().Blah().Blah();
foreach (string name in names)
{
    //Do something with name
}
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>var names = 
    from x in persons
    select x.name;
foreach (string name in names)
{
    //Do something with name
}
</code></pre>
