<p>I believe that code will work and the error message relates to a different statement.</p>

<p>If you want to put that <code>time_t</code> into a dictionary then you'll need to wrap it in an <code>NSNumber</code> object. However you may as well keep it as an <code>NSTimeInterval</code> (<code>double</code>) and cast it when using it:</p>

<pre><code>NSDate *date = self.datepicker.date;
NSTimeInterval start = [date timeIntervalSince1970]
dict[@"startTime"] = @(start);
</code></pre>

<p>However you can also cast it before adding it to the dictionary if you really want to.</p>
