  <p>So how to count the value ? Add ints from last to first, multiplying tens by 10, hundreds by 100 and so on and so on and store it as long ?</p>

<p>I don't think storing it as a <code>long</code> is what you intend.  What would happen if the value gets bigger than <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code>?</p>

<p>If <code>n</code> is a <code>BigInteger</code>, then <code>n.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(i));</code> should return a <code>BigInteger</code> object.  The <code>multiply</code> method should know how to do multiplication with two <code>BigInteger</code> objects without needing to convert them to <code>long</code>.  One way of doing that is to loop through each digit using the multiply-and-carry algorithm that we learned in grade school.  This will be pretty slow if your values are astronomical, but it does have the benefit of being easy to understand and implement.</p>
