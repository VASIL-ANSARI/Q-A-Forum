<p><code>ALTER</code> table isn't used to manipulate data, it's used to modify table structure. Your best bet would be to <code>SELECT</code> into a temp table, <code>TRUNCATE</code>, then re-insert from the temp table.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
INTO #temp
FROM table1
ORDER BY id=05 desc,id;

TRUNCATE table1;

INSERT INTO table1
SELECT * FROM #temp;

DROP #temp;
</code></pre>
