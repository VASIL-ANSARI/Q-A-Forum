<p>https will not matter. HTTPS just says that the data going over the wire is securely encrypted. Rather you need to learn more about how the login actually works. For instance is it Basic Auth (where a popup shows up for user/pass)? you can then make a request like <a href="https://user:pass@foo.com/my_file.gif" rel="nofollow">https://user:pass@foo.com/my_file.gif</a></p>

<p>More likely it is some other authentication, that could do basically anything. You'll need to reverse engineer it to figure out what you need to do to get in. But most likely you'll need to use an HTTPS client library that maintains state (like it keeps cookies, etc).</p>

<p>Good luck</p>
