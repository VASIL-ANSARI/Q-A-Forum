<p>Use <code>event.which</code> instead.  I'm also not 100% sure, but you may want to try <code>.keydown</code> or <code>.keypress</code> instead.  I am looking at some JS code on a site of mine where I trap enter key presses and I only use those two.  I remember having trouble with <code>.keyup</code> for some stuff.</p>
