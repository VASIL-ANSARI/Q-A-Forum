  <p>... to obtain the maximum value of a certain unsigned integer type without including any headers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply assign the value <code>-1</code></p>

<pre><code>unsigned_type_of_choice max = -1;
</code></pre>

<p>Conversion of the <code>-1</code>, which is an <code>int</code>, to any unsigned type results in the value of <em>number that is one greater than the largest value</em> minus 1.</p>

<p>The following does not provide the maximum value of the destination type.  It fails when the destination type range exceed the range of <code>unsigned</code>, which is the type of <code>~0U</code>. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39864070/obtaining-max-of-unsigned-integer-with-bitwise-not-on-zero-value#comment67016236_39864070">@Christopher Oicles</a></p>

<pre><code>// problem
unsigned_type_of_choice max_wannabe = ~0U;
</code></pre>
