<p>This could be a number of different things. There's really not enough information here to properly diagnose.</p>

<p>I've found that the controller template is extremely finicky in the first place. Sometimes if you haven't rebuilt a certain portion of your solution it will fail. Sometimes it will just fail for no good reason. And, it pretty much <em>only</em> works directly with entity classes and <code>DbContext</code>. If you try to use a view model or you'll be working with something like a repository or service rather than <code>DbContext</code> directly, it will fail.</p>

<p>Long and short, you'll find as you continue to use MVC that it's far more trouble than it's worth. I still use "Add > Controller...", but I simply choose "MVC 5 Controller - Empty" and set up everything myself.</p>

<p>However, if you still want the full controller action and view generation functionality, the best thing I can recommend is to first, clean and rebuild your solution. If it still gives you errors, then close Visual Studio complete and then reopen your solution. Sometimes that's enough to get it to work. Also, make sure that all of your projects in your solution are using the exact same versions of Entity Framework and MVC. You can sometimes get weird behavior if there's version mismatches between projects that reference each other.</p>
