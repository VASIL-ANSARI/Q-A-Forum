<p>Your script <code>my_script.sh</code> is probably not in <code>/home/</code> as expected in the code.</p>

<pre><code>   path = "/home/"
   os.chdir(path)
   print os.getcwd()
   cmd=("sh my_script.sh")
</code></pre>

<p>Also it should print the current directory as well with <code>print os.getcwd()</code>. You should change those values based on the real location of your script.</p>
