<p>Your code will work if <code>show_img</code> has a width and height set.
I believe the reason why it is not working for you is because $(document).ready is called when the DOM is loaded and before the page contents. So at that point in time <code>show_img</code> has not been loaded yet, so it can not get the width and height unless you explicitly set it.</p>
