<p>I've managed to solve the issue. For the data I passed a list of objects that I needed to drag, and when handling the drop I would receive the data as a list then do what I needed to do.</p>

<p>The problem I was having was that I couldn't wrap my head around the concept of a "format" not belonging to just one data object. For the format I simply put </p>

<p><code>DragDrop.DoDragDrop((FrameworkElement)sender, new DataObject("System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;object&gt;", _dragSources.Select(x =&gt; x.DataContext).ToList()), DragDropEffects.Copy);</code> </p>

<p>and everything worked out. Even in the MSDN documentation it is mentioned nowhere that the "format" part is really just a key. You can put literally anything and as long as it matches what you are using to get the data (in this case <code>e.Data.GetData("System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;object&gt;") as List&lt;object&gt;;</code>) then you're golden.</p>
