<p>So it turns out, that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the java code.  Other than that the default parser in the JEditorPane HTMLEditorKit is not as flexible as most of today's browsers.  The HTML had to be modified to change the id attribute to a name attribute then everything worked as billed.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="#Intro" id="TOP"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>transformed to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="#Intro" name="TOP"&gt;
</code></pre>
