<p>Here is a concept how it works, also for double-clicks etc.:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Before you call animate you set a flag which indicates that an animation is ongoing.</p></li>
<li><p>If this flag is set you return immediately and don't call animate.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a callback function (e.g. complete) to the animate call which resets the flag, so that the menu becomes responsible again.</p></li>
<li><p>Track the states of the menues somehow (variable or class indicating the state when required anyway for styling), so that you know which one has to be closed or opened.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So you could create a function <code>menuSelected</code> and call it from all menu click functions.</p>

<p>You could just toggle on each click and when one menu is clicked fire a click on the other one too, but that's dangerous, e.g. if you do several clicks at once the events could stack up and you will watch the menu open and close several times.</p>
