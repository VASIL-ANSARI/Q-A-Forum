<p>You've been caught with a common newbie problem, having trouble differentiating between Ranges and Values.</p>

<p>A Range expresses a region of a spreadsheet, with methods that give you access to various characteristics of the object. The contents, or data that you see in a spreadsheet is accessible via the <code>.getValue()</code> method (for one cell) or <code>.getValues()</code> (for more than one cell).</p>

<p>Change:</p>

<pre><code>var mon = sheet.getRange(c, e);
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>var mon = sheet.getRange(c, e).getValue();
</code></pre>

<p>... and you'll have the data that's in that range, as a String, Number or Date, depending on what was there.</p>

<p>The variable names you've selected may lead to confusion, it's worthwhile being careful with that. For example, look at <code>valuerplc</code>. The name implies that it's a value, which can be confused with <code>.getValue()</code> and <code>.setValue()</code>. But the way that it's used is as a Range, as in <code>valuerplc.setValue(mon)</code>, so it's clearly NOT a value.</p>

<pre><code>function Transform() {
  //load spreadsheet data and initialise variables

  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var firstrow = 11;//this is a manual figure
  var d = firstrow;
  var valuerplc = sheet.getRange(firstrow, 38);
  var value =1;

  for(var c=firstrow; c&lt;sheet.getLastRow(); c++){
    for (var e=3; e&lt;33; e=e+6){
      var mon = sheet.getRange(c, e).getValue();
      valuerplc = sheet.getRange(d, 38);
      valuerplc.setValue(mon);
    }
    d++;
  }
}
</code></pre>
