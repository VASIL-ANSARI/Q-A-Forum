<p>You can load cursors from file dynamically like this:</p>

<pre><code>var myCursor = new Cursor("myCursor.cur");
</code></pre>

<p>After you have loaded it, you can set the cursor of any control like this:</p>

<pre><code>myControl.Cursor = myCursor;
</code></pre>

<p>The cursor also accepts a stream as a constructor parameter.  This means that you can load from a resource embedded in your application, rather than from the file system.</p>

<p>Windows will not let you have more than one cursor, but you can draw more than one on your control.  You can use the cursor object's <code>Draw</code> method like so:</p>

<pre><code>myCursor.Draw(g, new Rectangle(...));
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using TCP/IP to send the cursor data between clients, then this should be enough to work.</p>

<p>However, there have been a few applications that have supported multiple input on a single PC.  (For example, <a href="http://www.ragdollkungfu.com/" rel="nofollow">Rag Doll Kung Fu</a>)  For this, you are looking at something that the .NET framework doesn't support.</p>

<p>You will probably have to look into PInvoking some USB calls. (I don't have much experience here, so I can't ellaborate.)</p>
