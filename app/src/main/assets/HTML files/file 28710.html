<p>Put a bit of code in <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching:</code>, check whether there is any file at the destination path (<code>Documents/feed_file</code>), if there isn't then copy the default file out of the bundle. The default file should be part of the Xcode project and copied to the bundle during the build.</p>
