<p>Your problem is you are incrementing <code>i</code> in the for loop and not <code>x</code> in the first for loop. That makes it run forever with <code>x==1</code>. Each time the loop code runs you are changing <code>i</code> which has no effect on the loop condition <code>x&lt;numbers.length</code>.</p>

<p>You'll also want to start <code>x</code> at <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code> since you index arrays starting at <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>also, inside that for loop <code>in</code> is actually <code>System.in</code> since you statically imported it. you should write <code>user_input.nextInt()</code> instead, since that the <code>Scanner</code> you made. This kind of thing should be obvious to you, especially if you are using an IDE that highlights the stuff for you like netbeans.</p>
