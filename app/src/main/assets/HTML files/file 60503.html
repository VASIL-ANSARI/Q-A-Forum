<p>The problem with your code is that you <strong>mock</strong> <code>Foo</code> so your method implementations won't be called by default such that when you call <code>Foo.call()</code>  it does nothing by default which means that it never avtually calls <code>baz</code> that is why you get this behavior. If you want to <strong>partially mock</strong> <code>Foo</code>, mock it using the option  <code>Mockito.CALLS_REAL_METHODS</code> in order to make it call the real methods as you seem to expect, so the code should be:</p>

<pre><code>@PrepareOnlyThisForTest(Foo.class)
@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
public class FooTest {
    @Test
    public void bar() throws Exception {
        PowerMockito.mockStatic(Foo.class, Mockito.CALLS_REAL_METHODS); // prepare
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
