<p>I doubt that you get that error when you only run the project unless you have an error in your code and eclipse debugger try to show the line of code that cause the exception, anyway you may need source files of a library for debugging purpose, to link source to a jar package in eclipse you can follow these simple steps : </p>

<ul>
<li>Find the package which you want to add the source under <em>Referenced Libraries</em> in Package Explorer </li>
<li>Right Click on the library </li>
<li>Select <em>Properties</em> </li>
<li>Go under <em>Java Source Attachment</em></li>
<li>Select the directory or archive where your source is located.</li>
</ul>
