<p>When you have circular foreign keys you need what PostgreSQL calls deferred constraints don't know if mysql has these. But it is also a sign of bad schema design.</p>

<p>Better structure would be:</p>

<pre><code>table person

id name age

1  aa   bb
2  xx   cc

table address

id person lane1 lane2 lane3 
1  1     l2    l2    l3
2  1     v1    v2    v3
</code></pre>

<p>Then you will need only one foreign-key and the inserts shouldn't give you any trouble.</p>
