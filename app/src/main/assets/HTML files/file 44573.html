<p>Yes it may return zero. When the calling of that function will not write any thing then it will return the value zero.</p>

<p>From <code>man</code> page of <code>write</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>zero indicates nothing was written</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>if ( len &gt; 0 )
</code></pre>

<p>This condition is for checking the given bytes are totally written or not.  This condition is for totally write the given bytes when no problem occurs in write function.</p>

<p><code>len</code> is <code>1000</code> , first time write is write  write the bytes as <code>512</code>, but we need to write the 100 bytes to that file descriptor. So that we have to subtract the value of written bytes.</p>

<pre><code>len -= written;
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>len</code> have the value <code>488(1000-512)</code>. Now in next loop, write have to write the 488 bytes. </p>

<pre><code>buf += written; 
</code></pre>

<p>this is for we have written the 512 bytes. We have to write the remaining bytes so for that we have incrementing that pointer position to point out the remaining bytes.</p>

<pre><code>( written == 0 )
</code></pre>

<p>It is for whether the above write function is write something or not. If it doesn't write anything then close for that.</p>

<hr>

<p>As per your update, the above concept will more useful when we are writing into pipes,FIFO,and stream or network devices. In normal file descriptor it may not make any effect.</p>

<p>This will happen for normal file descriptor , when the file system runs out of space or we hit our quota limit. This condition is rare.  This concept is mainly for writing into other than normal file descriptors.</p>
