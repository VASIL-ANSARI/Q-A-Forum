<p>Basically you have three options (or two, depending on how you want to count):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The best thing, which is what you said you didn't want to do: Make the URLs slightly different (perhaps with a query string) and then look at <code>location</code> / <code>location.search</code> in the contact page to see what they clicked.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be as obvious as a bit query string parameter; it could be more subtle, like <code>example.com/contact.html</code> vs. <code>example.com/contactb.html</code>. If you want the same actual page served for both of those URLs, you can configure your server to make one an alias of the other.</p>

<p>Note that this is better not just pragmatically (it works reliably), but because then the URLs of the two pages are different. Since the pages are different, having their unique identifier (their URL) be different makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a variant on #1: Instead of a query string or different page name, use a hash fragment, e.g. <code>example.com/contact.html#A</code> and <code>example.com/contact.html#B</code>. The contacts page can check for that via <code>location.hash. (Make sure you don't have any elements with the</code>id<code></code>"A"<code>or</code>"B"`, so the page won't scroll down to them.)</p></li>
<li><p>Alternately, set information when the link is clicked that the contact page can look for. That could be a cookie with a short expiration, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-sessionstorage-attribute" rel="nofollow">session storage</a>.</p>

<p>Here's how the session storage would look. On the first page, setting the session variable:</p>

<pre><code>// (The value must be a string.)
sessionStorage.contactType = "some value to tell you what contact type";
</code></pre>

<p>On the contact page, retrieving the session variable:</p>

<pre><code>var contacttype = sessionStorage.contactType;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is entirely client-side. See the link above for details.</p></li>
</ol>
