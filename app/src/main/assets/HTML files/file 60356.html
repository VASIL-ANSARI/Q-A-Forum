<p>OK - I worked it out.</p>

<p>To change a website's target framework, you right-click it, click "Property Pages", then change "Target Framework" on the "Build" page.</p>

<p>If you do this, then in will change the "targetFramework" attribute on the "compilation" node under the "system.web" node:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;compilation targetFramework="4.6.1" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this is not enough - you also need to change the "targetFramework" attribute on the "httpRuntime" node under the "system.web" node:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;httpRuntime targetFramework="4.6.1" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And now, both the website under IIS and the console application report back the same thing for ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol.</p>
