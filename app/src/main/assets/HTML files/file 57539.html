<p><code>ÃËÃâ¬ÃÂ¸ÃÂ½ÃÂ°</code> is Mojibake for <code>ÐÑÐ¸Ð½Ð°</code>.</p>

<p>When trying to use utf8/utf8mb4, if you see <strong>Mojibake</strong>, check the following.
This discussion also applies to <strong>Double Encoding</strong>, which is not necessarily visible.</p>

<ul>
<li>The bytes to be stored need to be utf8-encoded.</li>
<li>The connection when <code>INSERTing</code> and <code>SELECTing</code> text needs to specify utf8 or utf8mb4.  (<code>new PDO('...;charset=UTF8', ...);</code>)</li>
<li>The column needs to be declared <code>CHARACTER SET utf8</code> (or utf8mb4).</li>
<li>HTML should start with <code>&lt;meta charset=UTF-8&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To check that the data was stored correctly, <code>SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM ...</code>.  The hex for utf8-encoding of <code>ÐÑÐ¸Ð½Ð°</code> is <code>D098 D180 D0B8 D0BD D0B0</code>.  If, instead, you get <code>C390 CB9C C391 E282AC C390 C2B8 C390 C2BD C390 C2B0</code>, then the <code>INSERT</code> was messed up.</p>
