<p>This works for adding subject and body, I haven't been able to get the file attachment working. This is for an email with html body. For text body change the true to false.</p>

<pre><code>function sendemail(){
    window.plugin.email.open({
        attachments: [],
        subject: 'What ever',
        body:    'Put body in here',
        isHtml:  true
    });
}
</code></pre>
