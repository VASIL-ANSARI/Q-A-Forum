<p>Just don't use the higher frequencies that the analyser calculates. The easy way to do this is to set bufferLength to a smaller value than analyser.frequencyBinCount. The analyser will give you as much data as it can fit in the array, and drop the rest.</p>

<p>The bins are evenly spaced from zero to half the sampling rate, so at typical sampling rates (44kHz) you would want about half of the bins. More generally, <code>Math.ceil(analyser.frequencyBinCount * 10000 / (audioCtx.sampleRate / 2))</code> should give you the number you want.</p>
