<p>Also had the same challenge. From what I can deduce, it is related to PNG file having transparency. CropZoom wants to apply AlphaImageLoader to it, but in many browsers it isn't a supported action, and not even needed.
My error reported on line 163ish of jquery.cropzoom.js, so I took a peek, and did a quick edit from:</p>

<pre><code> if (ext == 'png' || ext == 'gif')
                $image.style.filter = "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='"
                    + $options.image.source
                    + "',sizingMethod='scale');";
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>if ((ext == 'png' || ext == 'gif')  &amp;&amp; $.browser.msie)
                $image.style.filter = "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='"
                    + $options.image.source
                    + "',sizingMethod='scale');";
</code></pre>

<p>And it works.</p>

<p>This may need versioning checking too, I think the intent of this code was if the extension supported transparency, use IE's DXImageTransform to make it appear transparent in the cropzoom tool. I think it's primarily needed for older versions of IE.</p>
