<p>You can use exceptions to cleanly solve the problem. It could be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
   $bookingService-&gt;book($data);
}
catch(BookingException $e)
{
    // redirect as error, possibly using $e-&gt;getMessage()
}

// redirect as success
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to have a hierarchy of exceptions if you want to redirect to different locations. If you're using language strings for localization, you can use the error code in the redirection:</p>

<pre><code>redirect('error_page', ['code' =&gt; $e-&gt;getCode()]);
</code></pre>

<p>Where this gets translated to something like <code>example.com/book/error?code=1234</code> and then you use the code to display the correct, localized message.</p>
