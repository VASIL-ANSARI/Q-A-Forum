<p>You can format a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.networkinformation.physicaladdress.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>PhysicalAddress</code></a> instance as wished by taking the individual bytes and joining them in a string:</p>

<pre><code>string formattedAddress = String.Join(":", 
    adapteraddress.GetAddressBytes()
       .Select(b =&gt; b.ToString("X2"))
       .ToArray()
    );
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you should leave out the <code>.ToString()</code> in your original query for this approach to work. Also, if you are on .NET 4, you can leave out the final <code>.ToArray()</code>.</p>
