<p>Looks like CSS 3D Transforms. Here's the webkit way of doing it, tweak the angle and perspective as needed. You'll have to find something equivalent for other browsers, I don't think it's fully standardized yet.</p>

<p>Just apply this CSS to your div with the background image. I tested this with the lovely stackoverflow logo at the top of this page, which is a div with a background image. </p>

<p>Edit: And here, a red border too. Don't know if its part of the image or you need CSS for it as well.</p>

<pre><code>-webkit-transform: perspective(500) rotateY(-60deg);
border: 3px red solid;
</code></pre>
