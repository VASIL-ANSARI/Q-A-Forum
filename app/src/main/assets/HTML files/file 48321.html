<p>Why not use something like <a href="https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus" rel="nofollow">EventBus</a> to manage passing back info from the request to your activity? This way you can separate your networking code from your activities/views. The basic idea using EventBus and Volley is the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Register a class to receive some type of event, in this case probably
the activity</li>
<li>Create a method in this class to handle this event,
<code>exampleView.setText(setting)</code>.  </li>
<li>Post the event to the bus, post the String or volley error in the
Volley listeners.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a more detailed example checkout this <a href="http://www.jacoboakes.com/2015/06/clean-android-networking-code-with.html" rel="nofollow">blogpost</a> or Eventbus' github page.</p>
