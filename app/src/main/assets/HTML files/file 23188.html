<p>The answer to this question is available in <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.10" rel="nofollow">The JavaÂ® Language Specification</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An assertion is an assert statement containing a boolean expression. An assertion is either enabled or disabled. If the assertion is enabled, execution of the assertion causes evaluation of the boolean expression and an error is reported if the expression evaluates to false. If the assertion is disabled, execution of the assertion has no effect whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if <code>assert</code> were a method then such code:</p>

<pre><code>assert(check());
</code></pre>

<p>will <strong>always</strong> call the <code>check</code> method, <strong>regardless</strong> whether the assertion is enabled or disabled. </p>

<p>Now, since <code>assert</code> is a keyword with a special handling (as described above) the <code>check</code> method will be called <strong>only</strong> when the assertion is enabled as only then the boolean expression of this assert will be evaluated.</p>
