<p>The short answer is, no. You cannot pass any arguments to after_create.</p>

<p>However what your trying to do is a pretty common and there are other ways around it.</p>

<p>Most of them involve assigning the relationship before the object in question is created, and let ActiveRecord take care of everything.</p>

<p>The easiest way to accomplish that depends on the relationship between Roles and Users. If is a one to many (each user has one role) then have your users belong to a role and sent role_id through the form.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;%= f.collection_select :role_id, Role.all, :id, :name %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If there is a many to many relationship between users and roles you achieve the same by assigning to @user.role_ids</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= f.collection_select :role_ids, Role,all, :id, :name, {},  :multiple =&gt; :true %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The controller in either case looks like </p>

<pre><code>def create   
  @user = User.new(params[:user])

  respond_to do |format|
    if @user.save
      flash[:notice] = 'User creation successful.'
      format.html { redirect_to @user }
    else
      format.html { render :action =&gt; 'new' }
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
