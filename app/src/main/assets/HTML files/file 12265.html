<p>You can use <a href="http://docs.mockito.googlecode.com/hg/org/mockito/Mockito.html#RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS">RETURN_DEEP_STUBS</a> to mock a chaining API. </p>

<p>If you know the exact order your builder will be called, here's an example of how you would use it:</p>

<pre><code>Builder b = Mockito.mock(Builder.class, RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS);
when(b.setName("a name").setAddress("an address")).thenReturn(b);
assert b.setName("a name").setAddress("an address") == b; // this passes
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately this won't give you a generic way of mocking "all the various builder methods" so that they always return this, see the other answer is you need that.</p>
