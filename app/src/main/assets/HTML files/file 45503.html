<p>Shadow plugin author here - I was just made aware of this question here. What you are encountering is the fact that the Shadow plugin creates and configures a <code>shadowJar</code> task using a set of defined conventions for that task. </p>

<p>When you are creating your own tasks using that type, you'll need to manually define a number of those configuration options since there is no way for the plugin to know what your intent is with those tasks. </p>

<p>You can reference the configuration that is being applied to the built in task here: <a href="https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/github/jengelman/gradle/plugins/shadow/ShadowJavaPlugin.groovy#L38-L63" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/github/jengelman/gradle/plugins/shadow/ShadowJavaPlugin.groovy#L38-L63</a></p>
