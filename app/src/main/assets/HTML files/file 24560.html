<p>Okay just reading your question again it looks like you want an administrator to have authoritative access to manage a user. In this case you could define something fairly similar in your <code>application_controller</code> </p>

<pre><code>def correct_user
    if !params[:id].nil?
      @user.User.find_by_id(params[:id])
      if current_user.status :admin
        else
        access_denied unless current_user?(@user)
      end
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is allows an administrator to have access to all users accounts and if the user is not an administrator then they are denied access. You can enable this feature using the <code>before_filter</code> in your controllers so that you could do something like <code>before_filter :correct_user, :only =&gt; [:edit, :show]</code> this means that only the correct user can have access to these actions. So should you have a <code>UserController</code> like the following maybe: </p>

<pre><code>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
  load_and_authorize_resource
  before_filter :correct_user, :only =&gt; [:edit, :show]
  ..
  ....
   .....
end 
</code></pre>

<p>This example shows that as a correct user or an admin will have access to edit and show actions. </p>
