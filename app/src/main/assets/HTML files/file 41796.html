<p>Your exception is <code>ClassCastException: net.sf.ehcache.Element cannot be cast to net.sf.ehcache.Element</code> This is an indication of a bigger problem. You most probably have 2 ehcace core or related jars in classpath. Catching the exception is not a solution. The exception should not happen in the first place.</p>
