<p>I was trying to solve the same problem and ended up opening the Open XML SDK 2.0 Productivity Tool and using the <code>Compare Files...</code> feature to compare two spreadsheets, one with frozen panes and one without.</p>

<p>When I did that, I was led to code that looked basically like this:  </p>

<pre><code>WorkbookPart wbp = doc.WorkbookPart;
WorksheetPart wsp = wbp.WorksheetParts.First();

SheetViews sheetviews = wsp.Worksheet.GetFirstChild&lt;SheetViews&gt;();
SheetView sv = sheetviews.GetFirstChild&lt;SheetView&gt;();
Selection selection = sv.GetFirstChild&lt;Selection&gt;();
Pane pane = new Pane(){ VerticalSplit = 1D, TopLeftCell = "A2", ActivePane = PaneValues.BottomLeft, State = PaneStateValues.Frozen };
sv.InsertBefore(pane,selection);
selection.Pane = PaneValues.BottomLeft;
</code></pre>

<p>I added this to my program and it seemed to do the trick.</p>
