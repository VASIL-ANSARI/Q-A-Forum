<p>Try this it sets each span to 14% of the width reducing the spaces that you have been seeing.</p>

<pre><code>.row span{
    float:left;
    border: 1px solid black;
    width: 14%;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The 14% is nothing more than 100% divided by 7 - giving 7 columns at all times.
You need to modify this for the different widths of devices.</p>
