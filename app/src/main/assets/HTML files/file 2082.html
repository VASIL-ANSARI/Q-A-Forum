<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb460184.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>LookUp</code></a> class introduced with Linq in .NET 3.5 - it might be just what you're looking for: a <code>Dictionary</code> like class that supports multiple items per key.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only significant downside is that you have to have all your elements available in one batch, as LookUp is immutable.</p>
