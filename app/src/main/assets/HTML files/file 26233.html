<p>It appears that this method for displaying a progress bar that's thinner is indeed invalid, my experiments have led me to the same conclusion. 
There are some third party implementations of progress bars available, some appear to be more popular, namely <a href="https://github.com/mperovic/KOAProgressBar" rel="nofollow">KOAProgressBar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ddeville/DDProgressView" rel="nofollow">DDProgressView</a>, but none of which seems to enable really small progress bars. </p>

<p>I Ended up implementing my own 'progress view' that's just a rectangle with two types of fills (needed it for a thin progress line under an internal browser's address bar, similar to the loading indicator at the new YouTube webapp or the chrome browser iOS app). Once i'm done i'll make sure to publish it <a href="https://github.com/nimast/NAProgressView" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
