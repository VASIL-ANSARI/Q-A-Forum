<p>As @tcaswell noted, when embedding, you can't use <code>plt.figure</code> or <code>plt.show</code>.</p>

<p>The reason you're only getting a single click to work is that you're calling <code>plt.show()</code> in your "on-click" callback.  <code>plt.show()</code> will try to start <em>another</em> Tk mainloop inside your application's mainloop, locking things up in the process.</p>

<p>Also, you're creating two <code>canvas</code>es and attaching them to the same figure.  </p>

<p><code>plt.figure()</code> creates a figure, a canvas, and a figure manager, then registers them with the global <code>pyplot</code> state.  You only want one of those things to happen, so you should call <code>fig = matplotlib.figure.Figure(...)</code> instead. (or <code>Figure</code> in your case, as that's how you've imported it)</p>

<hr>

<p>The good news is that this is a two-line fix.  Change <code>plt.figure(...)</code> to <code>Figure(...)</code> and don't call <code>plt.show()</code> in your on-click event.  </p>
