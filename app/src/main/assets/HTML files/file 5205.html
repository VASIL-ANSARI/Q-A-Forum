<p>You can scale your emulator window, to more closely match the actual device size. This is an option when you run the emulator from the Android SDK and AVD Manager. This is the window you get from running the <code>android</code> command, or from Window|Android SDK and AVD Manager in Eclipse.</p>

<p>Not only will this give you an emulator window closer in size to what the actual device is (so you do not assume people can necessarily click on too-small buttons, etc.), but it will also fit your screen.</p>
