<p>You don't have to (can) use <code>prototype</code> here. As you have only <strong>one</strong> instance of something (one object), you can set the functions directly on the object.</p>

<p>FWIW, ECMAScript 5 defines <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getPrototypeOf" rel="nofollow"><code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code></a> with which you can get the protoype of any object (only available in "modern" browsers).</p>
