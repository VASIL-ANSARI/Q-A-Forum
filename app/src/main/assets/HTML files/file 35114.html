<p>As mentioned in this interesting reading: Ayende - <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/4367/eagerly-loading-entity-associations-efficiently-with-nhibernate" rel="nofollow">Eagerly loading entity associations efficiently with NHibernate</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the things that seems to pop up frequently is people wanting to load an entity with all of its associations eagerly. That is pretty easy to do when the associations are many-to-one (that is, there is only one of them for each root entity). Example of those would be things like Owner, Site, etc.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>The problem starts when you try to do the same for multiple collection associations. NHibernate allows you to do so, but the result is probably not what you would initially expect...</p>

<p>There are some common ways, please check: </p>

</ul>

<p>NOTE: if you have fetched <em>child</em> and other <em>child</em> and... the <em>distinct root transformations</em> won't do the job, because it does it only for one root...</p>

<p>My preferred way is: Create simple query only joining <code>many-to-one</code> references. Let collection to be loaded lazily, using <code>batch-size</code> feature (<a href="http://nhforge.org/doc/nh/en/index.html#performance-fetching-batch" rel="nofollow">19.1.5. Using batch fetching</a>)</p>

<p>xml:</p>

<pre><code>// class
&lt;class name="ParentEntity" batch-size="25" lazy="true"&gt;
// collection
&lt;bag name="Children" lazy="true" batch-size="25"
</code></pre>

<p>fluent:</p>

<pre><code>.BatchSize(25)
</code></pre>
