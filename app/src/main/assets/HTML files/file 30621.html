<p>The direct but highly technical answer to your question is that the two's complement is taken for an integer value when it is operated on by the negation operator.</p>

<p>More informally: The two's complement of an integer is <strong>exactly</strong> the same thing as its negation.</p>

<p>If you write</p>

<pre><code>-9
</code></pre>

<p>you get the two's complement of <code>9</code> which is <code>-9</code>.  If you write</p>

<pre><code>-(-9)
</code></pre>

<p>you get the two's complement of <code>-9</code> which is <code>9</code>.</p>

<p>Since you mentioned the the tilde operator (<code>~</code>) in your question, let's look at that.  The tilde operator is the <strong>one's complement</strong>, which is what you get when you "flip every bit".  Notice:</p>

<pre><code>~(-3) = 2
~(-2) = 1
~(-1) = 0
~0 = -1
~1 = -2
~2 = -3
</code></pre>

<p>In general</p>

<pre><code>~x = -x - 1
</code></pre>

<p>They're different.  Use <code>-</code> for two's complement and <code>~</code> for one's complement.</p>

<p>Many people like to rewrite this as</p>

<pre><code>-x = ~x + 1
</code></pre>

<p>which gives a hint about how to design a circuit for negation.  It means "to find the negation of a number (i.e., its two's complement) you <em>flip every bit then add 1</em>".</p>
