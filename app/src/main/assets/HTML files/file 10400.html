<p>Not sure a web server in your C++ application is the best idea. I would implement a simple external web server in php/java/choose your poison. I would put the web server in some hosting service on a domain I would purchase. And then of course use HTTP to manage the communication between the two. The C++ application would upload images via HTTP to the web server, and the iphone app would download them via HTTP.</p>

<p>Also, if you don't want to purchase a hosting service / domain, take a look at services like Google AppEngine which is free as long as you don't overuse it.</p>

<p>Check this question for making HTTP requests from C++: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1011339/how-do-you-make-a-http-request-with-c">How do you make a HTTP request with C++?</a></p>
