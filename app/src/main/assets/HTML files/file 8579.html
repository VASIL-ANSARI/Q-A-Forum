<p>I don't think you can do it with regexps alone, as they are not very good at looking around in the text for duplicates.  I'm sure it can be done, but it won't be pretty at all.</p>

<p>What you might want to do is parse the string character by character and store the current character in an array, and while you're parsing the string, check to see if that character has already been used, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>function test_text(string) {
    // split the string into individual pieces
    var arr = string.split(',');
    var used = [];

    // look through the string for duplicates
    var idx;
    for (idx in arr) {
        // check for duplicate letters
        if (used.indexOf(arr[idx])) {
            return false;
        }

        // check for letters that did not have a comma between
        if (1 &lt; arr[idx].length) {
            return false;
        }

        used.push(arr[idx]);
    }

    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to make sure that the browser you are running this on supports Array.indexOf by including this script somewhere: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf#Compatibility" rel="nofollow">Mozilla indexOf</a></p>
