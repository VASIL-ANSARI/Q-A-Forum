<p>The idiomatic approach would be to just use <code>EventHandler</code>. Pass in an appropriate sender if you have one or <code>null</code> otherwise, and <code>EventArgs.Empty</code>.</p>

<p>I know it's somewhat crazy, but that's the convention. Bear in mind that plain <code>EventArgs</code> has no useful information in it, so <em>any</em> <code>EventHandler</code>-based event is basically saying "I may get a sender, but that's probably all."</p>

<p>However, with delegate variance as of C# 2, there is a benefit to this: you can use the same event handling method for <em>all</em> events which follow the convention... so you can have (say) logging event handlers which use reflection to dump whatever information they <em>are</em> given in the <code>EventArgs</code>, even if they don't know about it at compile-time.</p>

<p>It's not the greatest argument in the world for a convention, admittedly - but it's a reasonably strong one. Of course <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742806.aspx">routed events</a> are slightly different in how they're subscribed, but even so the delegates follow the same pattern.</p>
