<p>I would suggest, that your best bet would be to write a separate program (eg. Windows service or console app and schedule job), that will run once daily, on your preferred hours, and this should run your method. You can either program it to make HTTP request, or call method from your DLL. </p>

<p>From the top of my head, you could also try some tool that can make HTTP GET request to your aspx page, and schedule it to run once a day. </p>

<p>For this however you need a computer that runs every day (can you do that on your web server?). </p>
