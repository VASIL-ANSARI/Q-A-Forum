<p>Ideally, if you would do this kind of queries often, you should <em>restructure your data</em> to fit the use case better. For instance, have a dictionary where the keys are amounts and dates are values. Then, you would have quick <code>O(1)</code> lookups into the dictionary by key.</p>

<p>But, in this state of the problem, you can solve it with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow"><code>next()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {
... 'date': ['06/08/2016', '06/09/2016', '06/10/2016'],
... 'close': [ 923.13,  914.25,  909.42]
... }
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 914.25
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(date for date, amount in zip(d['date'], d['close']) if amount == a)
'06/09/2016'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if the amount would not be found, <code>next()</code> would fail with a <code>StopIteration</code> exception. You can either handle it, or you can provide a default beforehand:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 10.00
&gt;&gt;&gt; next((date for date, amount in zip(d['date'], d['close']) if amount == a), 'Not Found')
'Not Found'
</code></pre>
