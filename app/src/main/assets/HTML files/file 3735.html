<p>I don't know about plug-ins for Eclipse, but I'd recommend AT&amp;T's graphviz as a terrific tool for easily rendering states and transitions.  The input format is not XML; however, it'd be trivial to read an XML file, generate the required format, and render it using graphviz.  Laszlo Szathmary has a nice Java class that lets you do it right inside a Java class - very nice.</p>
