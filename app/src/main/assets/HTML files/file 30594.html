<p>Simply by typing in <code>GetWindowF</code> in Firefox' Google search field, it autocompleted (others have evidently searched for this) to <strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633558%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>GetWindowFromPoint</code></a></strong>.</p>

<p>I suggest that you train on googling.</p>

<p>It is an important skill, will save you much work.</p>
