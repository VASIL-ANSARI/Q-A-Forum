<h2>Possible solution:</h2>

<p>Double check the paths and php configuration - you might have the imagick.so file in another directory, not the one php is looking for extensions in ? </p>

<p>1) Locate the proper php.ini file - in your phpinfo() page it is pointed which php.ini is actually in use. </p>

<p>2) Make sure you have imagick.so in proper extension dir (the one php really uses). To check the actual path use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>php-config --extension-dir</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) if (1) and (2) are OK, enable the extension in php.ini </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>extension=imagick.so</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4) restart web server, the imagick should be present (loaded) in phpinfo()</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the following also apply</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your extension should compatible with your PHP server in three main
  attributes:</p>
  
  <p>1- The Zend API number which your PHP server is configured with ( in
  phpinfo() you can find this number), this number should be the same
  with your extension header file at build time.</p>
  
  <p>2- The compiler version on your PHP server and your extension must be
  the same.</p>
  
  <p>3- Thread safety in your PHP server is important. If you use
  thread-safe server then your extension must be built with php
  thread-safe library and if you use non-thread safe server you should
  build your extension with PHP-nts library.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Remark #2</h2>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12158047/2596503">SO source post</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that if an .so file is corrupt, is improper in other ways (incorrect file structure) or depends on files that are missing or not available for load - the extension will not be loaded and made available.</p>

<h2>Remark #3</h2>

<p>Note that the "php -m" shows modules compiled into php, not the loaded extensions. Try the below for more detailed information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>php -i</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>The provided php error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Module compiled with module API=20090626 <br>
  PHP    compiled with module API=20121212</p>
</blockquote>

<p>clearly indicates that you have the module compiled with improper API version that does not match the php. <strong>You will need to build the PHP extension manually.</strong> The extension you've ended up with seems to be built against a different version of PHP, not your current PHP 5.5. </p>

<p>There are numerous tutorials concerning this topic, just remember to use the proper version of imagick and phpize.
