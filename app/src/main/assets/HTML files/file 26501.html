<p>I would transform this into an array and use the random number as one of the fields.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *result = [NSMutableArray array];
NSMutableDictionary *entry = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];

for (NSString *key in jsonObject.allKeys) {
    entry = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:jsonObject[key]];
    [entry addEntriesFromDictionary:@{@"randomNumber" : key}];
    [result addObject:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithDictionary:entry];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if your data sample is any indication, just throw this key away as it is the same as StockNumber anyway.</p>
