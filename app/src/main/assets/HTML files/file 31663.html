<p>Changing</p>

<p><code>$application-&gt;getBootstrap()-&gt;bootstrap(array('db'))</code></p>

<p>to</p>

<p><code>$application-&gt;getBootstrap()-&gt;bootstrap(array('multidb'))</code></p>

<p>fixes the issue. I am not exactly sure about the <code>mail</code> resource, though, but judging by similar issues other people were having, I want to say it has something to do with what resources you have specified in your /configs/application.ini file.</p>
