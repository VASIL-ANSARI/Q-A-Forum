<p>Let me elaborate a bit more on dari's comment.</p>

<p>Your normal vector is multiplied with a normal matrix derived from the <code>view*model</code> matrix (called <code>modelview</code> in your application). Multiplying vertices with the model matrix transforms them from <strong>local-space</strong> to <strong>world-space</strong> and multiplying vertices in <strong>world-space</strong> with a view matrix transforms them to <strong>view-space</strong> coordinates. In your case, you transformed the normal vector with the model <strong>and</strong> view matrix; this means that your normal vectors are in view-space (their direction, as seen from the viewer's perspective: the camera).</p>

<p>Now, you specified the light's direction vector <code>LightDirection</code> in world-space (its direction is how you want it to be in the global world right? No need to transform it in any way with a model matrix).</p>

<p>When calculating diffuse/specular lighting, you want your direction/position vectors to all reside in the same coordinate space, otherwise you're doing calculations between different spaces which generates weird results. Since your <code>LightDirection</code> is in <em>world-space</em> and your <code>Normal</code> in <em>view-space</em> you get weird results. </p>

<p>What you thus need to do to solve your issue is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transform <code>LightDirection</code> to <em>view-space</em> by multiplying it with the view matrix (not <code>modelview</code> since that contains both the model <strong>and</strong> view matrix).</li>
<li><strong>or</strong> calculate your normal matrix from just the model matrix (not <code>modelview</code>) so your normal vector will end up in <em>world-space</em> just like <code>LightDirection</code> currently is.</li>
</ul>

<p>The important thing is that both vectors are in the same space (can be either world or view, whatever you prefer).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that this applies to when you want to give the impression the camera is moving while the objects are stationary (allowing you to move to unlit sides of your objects); see Reto Koradi's comment below.  </p>
