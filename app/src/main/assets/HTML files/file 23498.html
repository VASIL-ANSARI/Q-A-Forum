<p>This is because <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> doesn't implement <code>INotifyCollectionChanged</code>, so the control doesn't know that the list has actually been updated.</p>

<p>Try to make <code>rows</code> an <code>ObservableColelction&lt;Row&gt;</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: as the OP mentioned, the other problem (empty rows) was due to using fields, not properties, on <code>Row</code>.</p>
