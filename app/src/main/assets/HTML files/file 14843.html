<p>You are absolutely right - it is about the stacking context.</p>

<p>Whenever you put z-index on an element you create a new context, so because the triangles are descendants of the #page_container they are going to belong to the stacking context of the #page_container and no matter what z-index number you choose for the triangles, they only have meaning inside this context, and you will not be able to move them backwards behind this container.</p>

<p>Possible solutions are;</p>

<ul>
<li>move the elements out of the container in the html structure (and
then position them where you want with css)</li>
<li>remove the z-index from the container and set the triangles to z-index -1 to move them beneath the document itself</li>
</ul>
