<p>a single linked list normally is a pointer to the first element (usually called 'head'). every subsequent element of the list is linked over the next-pointer of the actual element. typically, the elements of the list (including head) are malloced.</p>

<p>so initialy head is NULL. you have an empty list.</p>

<p>add one element, you point head to that element, and the next points to NULL.</p>

<p>Now you have two implementation options. Append or prepend the next object. </p>

<p>If you append, you run thru the linked list to the end and let the last next-Pointer point to the new element. Here you have to consider that you are "appending" the very first element (having an empty head).</p>

<p>or you prepend (like in the example) the new element, making it the new head. so new's elemet next points to the old list (which starts with head, even if head is empty) and the new head bekomes the new element. Sideeffect, you reverse the order of elements.</p>

<p>when I work with lists, it is a good visualization for me, to paint boxes (malloc) and arrows (helping pointers like head, prev or last) on paper and connect the boxes with arrows (next-Pointer)</p>
