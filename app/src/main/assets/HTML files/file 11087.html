<p>You never need to use <code>malloc</code> in C++.</p>

<p>Ok, now that I've said <em>never</em>, one exception is when you are using C code that for some reason or another takes ownership of a block of memory you give it and later calls <code>free</code> on a pointer to that memory to deallocate it.</p>

<p>I have never seen that before (I don't usually use C libraries and I don't know how common that scenario is), it's just a contrived situation that I can think of where using <code>malloc</code> would <em>not</em> be optional, because it's undefined behaviour to call <code>free</code> on a piece of memory created by <code>new</code>.</p>
