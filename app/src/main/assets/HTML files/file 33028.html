<p>That looks like something for the standard <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Math/H" rel="nofollow">Ardunio math module</a>, available by doing</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You will have to adapt the syntax, e.g. <code>Math.Abs()</code> becomes just <code>fabs()</code>.</p>

<p>If you're not doing this on Arduino but using the AVR directly, it's exactly the same since Ardunio just inherits the C header and functions here.</p>
