<p>A quick way I have used in the past is to create an integer variable or property in the parent, and have your SomeMethod1,2 &amp; 3 include a call to Interlocked.Increment(intProperty); at the beginning, and in a finally block call Interlocked.Decrement(intProperty). You can use that property to check how many threads you currently have running.</p>

<p>Your class would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyThreadingClass
{
   int threadCount = 0;
   public void DoLotsOfWork()
   {
      Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; SomeMethod());
   }
   public void SomeMethod()
   {
      Interlocked.Increment(threadCount);
      try
      {
         // Some Code
      }
      finally
      {
         Interlocked.Decrement(threadCount);
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>
