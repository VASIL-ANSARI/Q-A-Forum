<p>The short answer is: a handle to a Memory DC.</p>

<p>More specifically: <code>CreateCompatibleDC(NULL)</code> returns a handle to a memory device context whose format is same as the device context that would be returned by <code>GetDC(NULL)</code>.  But it is not the same context.  Drawing to it doesn't actually show anything on the screen.</p>

<p>Memory DCs are usually used to for things like creating bitmaps in memory.</p>
