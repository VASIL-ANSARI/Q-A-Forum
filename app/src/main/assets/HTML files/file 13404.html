<h1>There is no way to read an .mkv file with JMF</h1>

<p>But, yes, you could convert it with a tool like <a href="http://ffmpeg.org" rel="nofollow">FFmpeg</a> or <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" rel="nofollow">VLC</a>.  Frankly, JMF is more than just outdated...it's dead in the water and not going anywhere.  You might want to consider an alternative approach.</p>
