<p>You should re-validate/repaint when you add Components after the parent container has been validated - this includes not only when you add the JButton (add this prior to setting the JFrame to visible) but also when you add the JLabels</p>

<pre><code>            frame.add(label[i]);
            frame.revalidate();
            frame.repaint();
</code></pre>

<p>I would also recommend not using a null layout, rather choose the appropriate LayoutManager: see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html</a> . If you wish to continue using a null layout, then you should set the added Labels to different positions or they will just overlap each other. </p>
