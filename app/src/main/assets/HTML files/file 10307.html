  <p>Should I serialize my protobuf object and pass it in the child activity? The child activity will have to deserialize the protobuf object. </p>

<p>Yeah this is the way to go, :) ... or you can use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcel.html" rel="nofollow">Parcelable</a>. Another option is to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/708317/68805">extend the Application class</a> and have it store the <code>protobuf</code> data. This data will be accessible in all of your Activities. </p>

  <p>Or should I provide some kind of accessor for my child activity to modify private fields of the parent activity? </p>

<p>No this is a bad idea </p>
