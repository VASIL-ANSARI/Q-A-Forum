<p>No, Tomcat and web apps have a pretty well-defined CLASSPATH.  You shouldn't have to specify anything if you package your app properly:</p>

<ol>
<li>All the packages and .class files in WEB-INF/classes are in CLASSPATH.</li>
<li>So are all the JARs in WEB-INF/lib</li>
</ol>

<p>You should figure out how to put your JARs in the right place - that's WEB-INF/lib of your WAR file.  Maybe Ant or Maven can help you.</p>
