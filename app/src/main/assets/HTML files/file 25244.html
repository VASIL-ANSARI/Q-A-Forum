<p>You're not accounting for numbers that are both multiples of 3 <strong>and</strong> 5</p>

<p>If I were you, I'd have something like the following</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=1; i&lt;1000; i++)
{
    if(i is a multiple of 15)
        //account for 15
    else if(i is a multiple of 3)
        //account for 3
    else if(i is a multiple of 5)
        //account for 5
}
</code></pre>
