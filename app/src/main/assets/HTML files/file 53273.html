<p>It seems like you are assuming that the results are not going to change while you are parsing the results, but this may not be the case.  If a new posting comes in, it may appear at the beginning of the list, and push the rest of your results down one.  This causes the last item on a page to be duplicated on the next page.</p>

<p>Also, there doesn't appear to be a firm order to the query you are making.  It is possible the existing results are changing order while you are searching through.  Again, if items shift around in the search, it may lead to either duplicates or skipped items.</p>
