<p>What you want to do is possible, but not in the way you're imagining it... </p>

<p>If you want your standard operating system's window decorations (i.e. window border, close, maximize, minimize buttons), it's impossible. Transparency cannot be applied to 'decorated' frames.</p>

<p>However, this can be done by using Java's default window decorations. Try out the code below:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    JPanel panel = new JPanel() {
        @Override
        protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
            g.setColor(Color.RED);
            g.drawRect(32,32,32,32);
        }
    };

    JFrame.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(true);
    JFrame f = new JFrame();
    f.add(panel);
    f.setSize(256,256);

    // The following two statements cause the window-transparency:
    f.setUndecorated(true);
    f.setBackground(new Color(0,255,0,0));

    f.setVisible(true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I personally don't find the Java window decorations very nice looking... Apart from that, OS-specific features (such as Window's Snap feature by 'half-maximizing' a window by moving it to the side of the screen) don't work... To me this is a deal-breaker, but depending on your needs, it could be an acceptable solution. :)</p>
