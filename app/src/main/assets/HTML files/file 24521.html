<p>I assume what you mean is that you want to run the <code>initialize</code> function in a click event handler, and you're currently attempting to do so like this:</p>

<pre><code>TheObject.initialize();
</code></pre>

<p>If that's the case, the problem is that <code>TheObject</code> actually refers to the return value of <code>initialize</code>, since you called <code>initialize</code> on the return value of the immediately-invoked function expression. And the chances are that <code>initialize</code> is returning <code>undefined</code> (most likely, it has no explicit <code>return</code> statement).</p>

<p>To solve this, you probably want to remove the immediate call to <code>initalize</code>, which will allow you to use the line shown above both on page load and anywhere else.</p>
