<p>According to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javame/config/cldc/ref-impl/midp2.0/jsr118/javax/microedition/lcdui/Ticker.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The direction and speed of scrolling are determined by the
  implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are using LCDUI Forms there is not much you can do, but if you are using Canvas you can implement your custom ticker using Graphics.</p>
