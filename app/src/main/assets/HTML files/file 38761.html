<p>Addressing the <code>for</code> loop misunderstanding:</p>

<p>If I understood you correctly, you tried to do this:</p>

<pre><code>grade = 0.7;
for (int i = 63, i &lt;= score; i++)
{
    return grade + 0.1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this variant is that <code>return</code> does not wait for the <code>for</code> loop to finish returning the value, but will rather return the value directly when called. The solution to this problem is moving the <code>return</code> to the end of the statement to actually return the fully calculated value.</p>

<hr>

<p>Well we can even skip the for loop by calculating the value directly:</p>

<pre><code>else if(score &gt;= 63 &amp;&amp; score &lt;= 94)
{
    return 0.7 + (0.1 * (score - 62));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise this is really just counting:</p>

<pre><code>else if(score &gt;= 63 &amp;&amp; score &lt;= 94)
{
    grade = 0.7;
    for (int i = 63, i &lt;= score; i++)
    {
        grade += 0.1;
    }
    return grade;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As pointed out by others, I am also interested in where you read that it is impossible to use a <code>for</code> loop in an <code>else if</code> statement...</p>
