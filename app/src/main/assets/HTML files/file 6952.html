<p>"buffer overflow detected": you are writing to a zone which wasn't allocated.  gcc 4.4 apparently generated code which didn't trigger a problem (or had a problem which didn't revealed itself as a crash but just as wrong results undetected now as such), gcc 4.5 generate code which detect the problem and warn you about it.  The only solution is to find the source of the problem and fix the code.</p>
