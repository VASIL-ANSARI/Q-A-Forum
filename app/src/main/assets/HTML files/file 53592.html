<p>Create an rscript called appLauncher.R that loads the rshiny package, then calls the following function, being sure to fill in the directory for your app:</p>

<pre><code>runApp(appDir = , launch.browser = TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a shortcut on your desktop to <code>Rscript c:\aDirectory\appLauncher.R</code>, updating the path to the script to be appropriate to where you saved it.</p>
