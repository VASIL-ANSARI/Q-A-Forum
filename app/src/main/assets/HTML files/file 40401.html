<p>Multiple processes can output to the console at the same time, at least under Windows and Linux.  </p>

<p>The reason you may see all of one process before all of the other is due to the way your particular OS schedules threads. A better way to see this behavior is to change son_function to look something like the code below, where each child sleeps for a different amount of time.  The reason who lines get interleaved (as noted before) is because printf buffers lines of output.</p>

<pre><code>void son_function()
{
    srandom(getpid());
    int sleepTime = random() % 4; // random sleep between 0 and 3 seconds
    printf("pid [%d] sleep time is %d\n", getpid(), sleepTime);

    printf("my pid = %d\n", getpid());
    sleep(sleepTime);
    printf("alpha = %d\n", getpid());
    sleep(sleepTime);
    printf("beta = %d\n", getpid());
    sleep(sleepTime);
    printf("charlie = %d\n", getpid());
    sleep(sleepTime);
}
</code></pre>
