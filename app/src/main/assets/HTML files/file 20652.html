<p>Look at the <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/org/jfree/data/xy/XYSeries.html#add%28double,%20double%29" rel="nofollow">docs for XYSeries</a>. There is no <code>add</code> method for handling a <code>double</code> array of input data as your compilation error indicates.</p>

<p>As the name suggests <code>XYSeries</code> is comprised of a series of X &amp; Y co-ordinates. Your double array would suggest that you only have one set of points, probably the <em>Y</em> coordinates.</p>

<p>If this is the case you could change your array from a 1D to a 2-dimensional array of size <em>n</em> X 2. Use the first and second columns of the array for the X &amp; Y co-ordinates respectively. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>double[][] xyValues = new double[100][2];
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to add, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; xyValues.length; i++) {
   graph.add(xyValues[i][0], xyValues[i][0]);
}
</code></pre>
