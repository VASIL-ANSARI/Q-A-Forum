<p>Sure: that block returns the new value for the memo object. That is, the next value of <code>max_sub</code> that is yielded to the block will be whatever that block returned the last time.</p>

<p>And the <code>inject method of Enumerable</code> is used to apply a binary operation or an arbitrary block, if provided, to an <code>Enumerable</code>.</p>

<p>For each element of the <code>Enumerable</code>, <code>inject</code> will apply the operation or pass the <em>memo object</em> and the current element to the block.</p>

<p>The memo object is either the parameter or, if absent, the first element of the block. It is typically accumulated via a block. Each yield to the block results in a new value of the memo. The last value of the memo object is then returned.</p>

<p>It's a structured and potentially functional way to reduce a data structure to a summary result.</p>
