<p>Rahul is right. When you visit a web address in your browser, you're making a GET request. Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>resources :transactions do
  collection do
    get :detail
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If that's the only route you're nesting, it can be shortened to:</p>

<pre><code>resources :transactions do
  get :detail, on: :collection
end
</code></pre>
