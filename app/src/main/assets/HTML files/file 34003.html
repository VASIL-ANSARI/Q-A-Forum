<p>You already know the value of <code>website</code> because it's one of the object's attributes. So, just reference it in your <code>url_exist?</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>validates :website, presence: true, if: :url_exist?

# ...

def url_exist?
  url = URI.parse(self.website)
  puts url
  # ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>I should also note that it seems like you're missing some code towards the end of the snippet you posted, so right now your <code>url_exist?</code> function will always return false.</p>
