<p>I'd recommend reading that PEP the error gives you.  The problem is that your code is trying to use the ASCII encoding, but the pound symbol is not an ASCII character.  Try using UTF-8 encoding.  You can start by putting <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> at the top of your .py file.  To get more advanced, you can also define encodings on a string by string basis in your code.  However, if you are trying to put the pound sign literal in to your code, you'll need an encoding that supports it for the entire file.</p>
