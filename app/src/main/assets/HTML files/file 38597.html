<p><code>import</code> is for proper <em>compilation</em> of code. Suppose you are using an ArrayList, you have to tell the compiler which <code>ArrayList</code> you are using by specifying <code>import java.util.ArrayList;</code> or you can directly use </p>

<pre><code>java.util.ArrayList al = new java.util.ArrayList(); 
</code></pre>

<p>Without importing anything.</p>

<p>ClassLoaders are used at runtime. If a class is needed during runtime, then it is loaded into the runtime environment(JVM) by <code>ClassLoaders</code></p>

<p>Note : The import statement says - <em>I am using this class</em> to the compiler. ClassLoaders are used to dynamically <em>load</em> the class (ArrayList or any other class) into the JVM.</p>

<p>Edit :</p>

<p>Assume you have 2 shirts (shirts =classes) one red with black stripes and another red with white stripes. Now, you tell your mom (compiler) , please iron the red shirt, your mom asks <em>which red shirt</em> you tell - <em>the red shirt with white stripes</em>. Note that you are not actually <em>using</em> the shirt, you are merely telling <em>which</em> red shirt you will use. 
The next day, you need to go to college so you tell your dad get me the red-shirt with white stripes (dad is like ClassLoader) and you wear the shirt. (class is loaded and being used)</p>
