<p>Considering that you are also trying to parse out nested SELECT's, I don't think you'll be able to avoid writing a fairly complete SQL parser. Fortunately, there is a more complete example on the Pyparsing wiki Examples page, <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/file/view/select_parser.py/158651233/select_parser.py" rel="nofollow">select_parser.py</a>. I hope that gets you further along.</p>
