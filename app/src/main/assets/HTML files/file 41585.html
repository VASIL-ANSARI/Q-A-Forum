<p>I beleive it is customary to keep the version number in a dedicated header file. Some tools can autogenerate this for you. For example here is how you do it with CMake:
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/</a>
See the section "Adding a Version Number and Configured Header File"</p>
