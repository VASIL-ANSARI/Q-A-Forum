<p>I had a similar problem as your, I had to load some Translation Text Files in my game.</p>

<p>You can save the text file in the <code>Resources</code> folder. Then load it at runtime with <code>Resources.Load("folderInsideResourcesFolder\textFile")</code>. The <code>Resources</code> folder will be packaged in the APK.</p>
