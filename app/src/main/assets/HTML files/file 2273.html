<p>You won't be able to test apps built with 3.2 on your devices until a firmware is released.
Until then you have to use the simulator or build your apps with 3.1.2 SDK.
You can have several SDK version installed and choose which one to build for.</p>

<p>EDIT: AFAIK, there isn't anything new or changed regarding to the "iphone" in SDK 3.2 so there isn't really any point using it unless you want to develop for the iPad.</p>
