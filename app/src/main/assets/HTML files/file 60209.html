<p>I believe your emulator is complaining because you don't have enough ram to give to the emulator. </p>

<p>I think you go to tools > Android > AVD manager and then select the emulator you want to use. Once selected you should be able to reduce the amount of ram to 1024m like it's asking you to do. I'm not on my pc at the moment so I hope my memory serves me well!</p>

<p>If that doesn't work hopefully this android document can help: <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html</a></p>
