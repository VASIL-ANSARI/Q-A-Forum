<p>According to official documentation you have to include all description of files in the section:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;software_screenshots&gt;
        &lt;software_screenshot display_target="iOS-3.5-in" position="1"&gt;
              &lt;size&gt;11630&lt;/size&gt;
              &lt;file_name&gt;pr_source.png&lt;/file_name&gt;
              &lt;checksum type="md5"&gt;8ccc2a3bb16c4e1c808d5811c0d47b48&lt;/checksum&gt;
         &lt;/software_screenshot&gt;
....
&lt;/software_screenshots&gt;
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>If you include new file in this section or change the checksum, then checksum won't be equal and iTunes connect change or add this file in the position defined in  software_screenshot->position. In this way the new files should be in root of folder.</p></li>
<li><p>If you doesn't define any description of files, then all files will be removed from the store.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't want to change any files, you will have to describe these files in this section. But you don't want to include these files in the root of folder. The iTunes connect will ignore this files in this way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope it will help you to solve your problem.</p>
