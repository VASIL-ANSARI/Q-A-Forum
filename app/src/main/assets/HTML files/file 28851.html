<p>Your data is a little corrupt, I think that's breaking CKEditor in this interesting way. Look at your image data closely. The image tags end with this:</p>

<pre><code>...AAElFTkSuQmCC"  21px; height: 24px;"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That is not a valid tag (the style attribute is broken). Try something like this for both images and it works</p>

<pre><code>...AAElFTkSuQmCC" style="height:24px; width:18px" /&gt;
</code></pre>
