<blockquote>
  <p>The function waitKey() waits for key event for a "delay" (here, 30
  milliseconds). As explained in the OpenCV documentation, HighGui
  (imshow() is a function of HighGui) need a call of waitKey reguraly,
  in order to process its event loop.</p>
  
  <p>Ie, if you don't call waitKey, HighGui cannot process windows events
  like redraw, resizing, input event etc. So just call it, even with a
  1ms delay :)</p>
