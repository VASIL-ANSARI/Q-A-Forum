<p>The following should work for you:</p>

<pre><code>  UPDATE Images, Credits  
    SET Images.image_restorer = Credits.credit_restorer 
    WHERE  Images.image_media_file = Credit.credit_file_name
</code></pre>

<p>This will toss an error if there is more than one <code>credit_restorer</code> for a distinct <code>credit_file_name</code> since MySQL won't know which <code>credit_restorer</code> it should use for the update. But it sounds like that might not be a problem in your case.</p>
