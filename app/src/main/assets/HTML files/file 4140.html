<p>In an expression, an <em>lvalue</em> to <em>rvalue</em> conversion refers to looking at the value of an object and is used where you need an object value (e.g. in <code>a + b</code> you need the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to determine the result you don't need to know where - if anywhere - the original objects came from).</p>

<p>In the <em>address-of</em> operator you need to have the object itself (i.e. an <em>lvalue</em>), the value of the object is irrelevant so an <em>lvalue</em> to <em>rvalue</em> conversion would be unhelpful, it would lose the identity (location) of the object itself which is what is important for taking an address.</p>
