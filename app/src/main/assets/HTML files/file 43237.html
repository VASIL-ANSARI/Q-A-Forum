<p>you'll need to sepcify some sort of separator in your textbox, then in your PHP handler you just need to execute a query that sums Carbs for the specified food items.
Example:</p>

<pre><code>//considering your separator is a ','
//also need to make sure the user enters exactly 2 food names, otherwise use implode to build the WHERE part of the query
$food_items = explode(',', $_POST['food']);
$q = "SELECT SUM(Total_Carbs) AS carbs FROM myTable WHERE Food_name= $food_items[0] OR Food_name=$food_items[1]";
//execute ...
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you'll need to adapt this to your exact variable names...</p>
