<p>different browser show attribute in different way </p>

<p>here you made attribute <strong>control</strong></p>

<p>without assign any value so some browser initialize with default value like in  <strong>mozilla</strong> assign by  <strong>controls=""</strong>  and some not like in <strong>ie</strong> or others assign by  <strong>controls</strong></p>

<p>so it is good use attribute with some value and use in your code as your requirement</p>
