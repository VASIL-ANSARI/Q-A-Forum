<p>What is on screen won't be a floating point buffer - it's typically RGBA8 unorm 32-bit per pixel.</p>

<p>Capture via glReadPixels to fetch the raw RGBA data - you'll have to supply the raw to PNG save functionality, that's not part of OpenGL ES itself.</p>

<p>Note that this is a relatively expensive operation, especially at high screen resolutions, so don't expect to do this at interactive frame rates.</p>
