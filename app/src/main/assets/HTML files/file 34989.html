<p>A macro is a name given to a fragment of code. Wherever the name occurs in the source file, it is replaced by the code fragment. Macro definitions are directives to the C preprocessor. They are not statements in the sense that they are not <code>executed</code>. They are not even there after the preprocessing stage and hence generate no assembly code.</p>

<p><code>MAXSTR</code> is a macro which is replaced by the string literal <code>"Maximum number reached"</code>. String literal are read-only and it's undefined behaviour to try to modify them. Therefore, you should make the pointer <code>const</code> qualified.</p>

<pre><code>#define MAXSTR "Maximum number reached"

const char *str = MAXSTR;  // make the pointer const
</code></pre>
