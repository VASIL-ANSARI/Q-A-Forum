<p>Short answer: no
Long answer: If you have a publicly accessable IP you can start your local mysql server on that IP and connect to it from your live server. You'll need to change the relevant settings in your my.cnf file to allow remote connections and create a user that is allowed to access the database from the remote host.</p>
