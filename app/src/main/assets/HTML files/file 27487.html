<p>Yes, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext%28v=vs.103%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">DbContext</a> should only live for a very short time. It is effectively your unit of work</p>

<p>You should definitely create it each time you're going to use it. (Well, you should inject it but that's another discussion :-))</p>

<p>Update : OK, I accept that 'create it each time you're going to use it' could be misleading. I'm so used to context being an instance on a class that is injected and so lives only for the life of a request that I struggle to think of it any other way... @wiktor's answer is definitely better as it more correctly expresses the idea that you should "dispose sooner rather than later"</p>
