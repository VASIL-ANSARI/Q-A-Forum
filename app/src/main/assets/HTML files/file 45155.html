<p>The question is bit unclear. My understanding of your problem is as follows: You have a dictionary, a value of the dictionary is a list, and you have trouble adding an item to that list. Since you didn't explain your notation I'm using more general names, just to give you an idea what has to be done:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;int, List&lt;string&gt;&gt; myDict = new Dictionary&lt;int, List&lt;string&gt;&gt;();
if (myDict.ContainsKey(myKey))
{
    myDict[myKey].Add(myVal);
}
else
{
    myDict[myKey] = new List&lt;string&gt; { myVal };
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the key is not in the dictionary you create an entry together with the list and initialize the list with the new value. If the key is there you just access the list (by using <code>myDict[myKey]</code>) and add the new value to the list. Since the list is always created for a new key you don't have to worry that it's not initialized when adding a value for an existing key.</p>
