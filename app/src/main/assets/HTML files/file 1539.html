<p>Whilst there's not a tremendous amount of information to go on, what you've listed should be fine. (The 'tag' being the 'description' field in the industry table, etc.)</p>

<p>As you might imagine, all of the real work is done outside of SQL, where you'll need to...</p>

<ol>
<li>(Potentially) add new tag(s) that don't yet exist.</li>
<li>Associate the industry with the supplied tag(s).</li>
<li>(Potentially) prune previously used tags that may no longer be in use.</li>
</ol>

<p>...every time you edit an industry.</p>

<p>That said, the key limitation of your proposed setup is that each company can only belong to a single industry. (i.e.: It can only have a single industry tag associated with it.)</p>

<p>As such, you might want to consider a schema along the lines of...</p>

<pre><code>Company
    id
    ...
    countryOfOrigin

Industries
    id
    description

CompanyIndustriesLookup
    companyID
    industryID
</code></pre>

<p>...which would let you associate multiple industries/tags with a given company.</p>

<p><strong>Update...</strong></p>

<p>For example, under this setup, to get all of the tags associated with company ID 1, you'd use...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Industries.description FROM (CompanyIndustriesLookup, Industries)
WHERE companyID=1 AND industryID=Industries.ID
ORDER BY Industries.description ASC;
</code></pre>

<p>On a similar basis, to get all companies tagged with an industry of "testing", you'd use...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Company.name FROM (Company, Industries, CompanyIndustriesLookup)
WHERE Company.id=CompanyIndustriesLookup.companyID
AND Industries.id=CompanyIndustriesLookup.industryID
AND Industries.description="testing"
ORDER BY Company.name ASC
</code></pre>
