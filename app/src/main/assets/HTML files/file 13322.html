<p>What I've found so far:</p>

<p>Things that fire the <code>shouldOverrideUrlLoading</code> method will launch an external browser if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the URL is not white-listed</li>
<li>some schemes (<code>sms:</code>, <code>tel:</code>, <code>geo:</code>, <code>mailto:</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>But, the <code>shouldOverrideUrlLoading</code> method is not always fired -- on Android 2.2 and previous (and maybe 2.3?) Javascript techniques to trigger a page load (such as <code>window.open()</code> or <code>document.location.href =</code>) do not fire the method, and therefore load in the WebView regardless. </p>

<p>Links physically clicked by the user seem to always fire the method. Using the JS event mechanism to fire a click event on a link may also work, I haven't tried it.</p>
