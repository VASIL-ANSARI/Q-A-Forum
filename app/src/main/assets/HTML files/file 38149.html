<p>@cmorrissey provided a great solution...</p>

<p><code>$last_insert_id = $conn-&gt;insert_id;</code></p>

<p>This returns the last inserted id (I think primary key that is auto incremented is the most correct explanation.) This is better to use than OUTPUT. I'm not sure why OUTPUT is incorrect to use as I have seen it so many places and this only once from the user.</p>
