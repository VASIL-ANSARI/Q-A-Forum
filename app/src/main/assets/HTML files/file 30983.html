<p>Look for vertices, or corners.  A corner pixel is surrounded by fewer pixels than an edge pixel.  A square will have 4 corners, a triangle fewer, and a circle may have either many or none, depending on how you detect the corners.  Also, your minimum size and minimum angle guarantee that no two corners will be close together.  Fun problem.</p>
