<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, asynchronous I/O, or non-blocking I/O is a form of input/output processing that permits other processing to continue before the transmission has finished.</p>

<p>Non-blocking and asynchronous are synonyms, and this is how all the standard node.js web servers work.</p>
