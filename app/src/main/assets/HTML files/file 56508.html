<p>The problem is that any call to 
<a href="https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/project_id/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https://www.googleapis.com/bigquery/v2/projects/project_id/jobs/</a>* will cause the same problem</p>

<pre><code>{
  "error": {
    "errors": [
   {
    "domain": "global",
    "reason": "required",
    "message": "Login Required",
    "locationType": "header",
    "location": "Authorization"
   }
  ],
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Login Required"
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So it is a problem with my browser auth, python auth is good.</p>

<hr>

<p>And root cause is that I my CSV Schema and data do not match.</p>

<pre><code>Errors:
Too many errors encountered. (error code: invalid)
</code></pre>
