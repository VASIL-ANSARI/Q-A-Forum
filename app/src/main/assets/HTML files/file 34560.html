<p>Since <code>allPlaces</code> is an instance field, it is initialized during construction of a <code>Places</code> object. So you create a <code>Places</code> object, which creates a <code>List&lt;Places&gt;</code>, which creates another <code>Places</code> object in its collection initializer, which creates another <code>List&lt;Places&gt;</code> of its own... a never ending recursion.</p>

<p>You probably wanted to create a static <code>allPlaces</code> field, which would create only one list. Add the <code>static</code> keyword to the field as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public static List&lt;Places&gt; allPlaces = ...
</code></pre>
