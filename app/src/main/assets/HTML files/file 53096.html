<p>You get this error because your <code>IN</code> clause is too large. According to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/ms177682.aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Including an extremely large number of values (many thousands) in an
  IN clause can consume resources and return errors 8623 or 8632. To
  work around this problem, store the items in the IN list in a table.</p>

<p>As suggested in the comment, you should really be storing theses ids in a (temporary) table and join on them instead.</p>
