<p>Yes, with a StoredProcedureItemReader, the whole batch is fetched.  This is because many drivers (including some of Oracle's) do not support batching CallableStatements.  Some will fail, and some will silently ignore you.  Thus to be consistent, Spring Batch allows no batching for stored procedures at all.</p>

<p>Some database drivers, like the IBM Informix driver, allow automatic batching based on parameters in the connection string; in other words, it will batch if possible without having to explicitly control it, but there are caveats to that.  If in your use case, you absolutely NEED to batch stored procedures and you don't want to write a custom ItemReader or ItemWriter, then this might be an option for you.</p>
