<p>Hm, try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Select t1.id, t2.id, t3.id from table as t1
inner join table as t2 on t1.id = (t2.id + 1)
inner join table as t3 on t2.id = (t3.id + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>X would be the number of joins</p>

<p>For a dynamically sql-query depending on x you could build something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SET @SQLQuery1 = 'Select t0.id ';
SET @SQLQuery2 = '';
x=10;

while x &gt; 0
begin
@SQLQuery1+=',t'+x+'.id';
@SQLQuery2+='inner join table as t'+x+' on t1.id = (t' + x + '.id + x)';
x= x-1;
end
@SQLQuery1 = @SQLQuery1+ 'from table as t0 ' + @SQLQuery2;
EXECUTE(@SQLQuery1);
</code></pre>

<p>Can not test this right now, so maybe you must modify this a bit till it works, i hope this works in your environment, i dont use oracle 11g</p>
