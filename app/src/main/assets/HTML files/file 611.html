<p>In MySQL 5.0 (and MySQL 5.1 with statement based binary logging), only the calling query is logged, so in your case, the INSERT would be logged.  </p>

<p>On the slave, the INSERT will be executed and then the trigger will be re-run on the slave.  So the trigger needs to exist on the slave, and assuming it does, then it will be executed in exactly the same way as the master.</p>

<p>In MySQL 5.1, there is row-based binary logging, which will log only the rows being changed, so the trigger would not be re-fired on the slave, but all rows that changed would still be propagated.</p>
