<p><code>System.Net.HttpWebRequest</code> and <code>System.Net.WebClient</code> work on most platforms supported by Unity. However when you want to build for the Unity Web Player or WebGL you will run into problems since Unity does not support most of the System.Net networking stuff since javascript does not have direct access to IP Sockets.

<p>As you already mentioned <code>UnityWebRequest</code> or the legacy <code>WWW</code> object from Unity is your best bet. With Unity 5.3 <code>UnityWebRequest</code> work on most platforms including WebGL and the Unity Web player. But as you also already mentioned the complete <code>UnityWebRequest</code> is still experimental but is under constant development and will probably improve in every new update.</p>

<p>The only downside, using the <code>WWW</code> or <code>UnityWebRequest</code> object is (<strong>as far as I understood</strong> the <code>UnityWebRequest</code> object) that they need to run in the Unity main thread so you will have to use <code>Coroutines</code> instead of pushing the request into a different thread. As long as you do not have millions of webrequest this should not lead into any performance issues of your app. And is probably less error prone.</p>
