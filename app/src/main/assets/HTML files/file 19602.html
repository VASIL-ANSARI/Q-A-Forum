<p>If you check the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/select.html#select.epoll.poll" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> you will see that the epoll <code>poll</code> function takes a <code>timeout</code> parameter, which defaults to <code>-1</code> which means wait indefinitely. If you set the timeout to zero it will return immediately.</p>

<p>As for the delay in <code>connect</code> it's probably because <code>connect</code> has to do a DNS lookup of the hostname to find the IP address.</p>
