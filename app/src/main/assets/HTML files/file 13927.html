<pre><code> jint i = 1/0;
 throw "C++ Message : Hey ! Can't Divide By Zero";
</code></pre>

<p>This exception is not caught by your <code>try/catch</code> block, as the program crashes before the throw statement. And a division by <code>0</code> is not an exception you can catch.</p>

<p>Perhaps something that might help:</p>

<pre><code>int d = 0;
jthrowable exc;
try 
{
    if ( d == 0 )
        throw "C++ Message : Hey ! Can't Divide By Zero";
    jint i = 1/d;
} catch(char *str) 
{
    jclass excClass = env-&gt;FindClass("java/lang/Exception");
    if(excClass == NULL) 
    {
       return;
    }
    env-&gt;ThrowNew(excClass,str);
}
</code></pre>
