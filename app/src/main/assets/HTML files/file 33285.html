<p>Based on Your Comment, i would like to clarify.</p>

<p>Web service is a concept in which you expose a utility or functionality to the world.</p>

<p>Any one in the world can access the same by first establishing ground rules as in SOAP via WSDL.</p>

<p>The Services can serve any number of requests from any application provided it sends the proper input request needed by your service.</p>

<p>In case you have built an application A with a utility functionality X,</p>

<p>Then application B,C,D and so on can access the Web Service.</p>

<p>All it needs is:</p>

<ul>
<li>the URL for the Service which is exposed through network to the consuming application</li>
<li>The requested parameter format</li>
<li>and the Proper Response format.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once this is setup, any application, not just in java, can access the service so even .Net applications or PL/SQL applications can access the Web Service Utility.</p>
