<p>The <code>async</code> keyword transforms the method and constructs the returned <code>Task</code> instance. There is nothing returned from the <code>async void</code> method because it returns <code>void</code>; this lack of a <code>Task</code> is one reason why you should avoid <code>async void</code>. <code>async void</code> is not a <em>natural</em> asynchronous method signature; it is only supported so that event handlers may be <code>async</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to return a <em>value</em>, then you should have the method return a <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>, e.g., <code>Task&lt;int&gt; BlahAsync()</code>, and then you can just return the value directly, e.g., <code>return 13;</code> The number of <code>await</code>s in the method has nothing to do with it. When the method executes the actual return (e.g., <code>return 13</code>), the <code>async</code> keyword interprets that as <em>completing</em> the <code>Task&lt;int&gt;</code> that was already constructed.</p>

<p>I have an <a href="http://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/02/async-and-await.html"><code>async</code> intro on my blog</a> that you may find helpful.</p>
