<p>office 2010 runs on wpf and its major portion is build on dotnet framework. And there is always connectivity between office and vs coz vs can make office apps also. If you use office 2010 as your default for aspx page editor and vs is also opened with the same project. it will sometimes hang due to lack of resources and also vs 2008 was made for 32bit os, so if ur running it on 64bit os with office 2010 64bit it can sometimes cause problem of resouce management. Already wpf uses hell lot of resouces and then 32bit vs 2008' connection to it will use more resouces.</p>

<p>So what i suggest is try to use 32bit 7, 32bit office 2010 ans vs 2008.</p>
