<p>Finally the best I can do is to use the Task Lock feature introduced in Android 5.0.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#startLockTask()" rel="nofollow">startLockTask</a>.</p>

<p>The issues of this method:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unless you have a helper app that grant lock task permission to your full screen app, the user will be asked if (s)he allows the lock.</li>
<li>Once locked, the user can still use physical buttons (home, back, volumn, etc.).</li>
</ol>

<p>Since my intention is not to have a kiosk mode, I don't really care about point 2.</p>

<p>Point 1 is also acceptable, but a bit annoying since it will (and should) be asked every time <code>onResume</code> is called.</p>

<p>This can be solved by setting a service app as device owner, which grants permission to apps that demand it. But the user has to do this him(her)self (c.f. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/27909315/3250971">this answer</a>), which is reasonable, otherwise an app would be able to totally kidnap your device.</p>
