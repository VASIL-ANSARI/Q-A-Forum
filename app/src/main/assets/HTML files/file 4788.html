<p>You mention you can't use .htaccess files but can you make modifications to httpd.conf and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory "c:/wamp/www/dev/"&gt;
    Php_value auto_prepend_file c:/wamp/www/dev/prepend.php
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> - just realised this doesnt work when running as CGI. I think though that one thing that will work is if you create a copy of your php.ini file, place it in the directory,  and put your prepend directive in there like:</p>

<pre><code>auto_prepend_file = c:/wamp/www/dev/prepend.php
</code></pre>
