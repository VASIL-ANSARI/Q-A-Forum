<p>.x is an ascii format so it shouldn't be very hard to parse/convert.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use Blender 2.4x which has a .x importer and you can export an .obj that you can convert to json or another format that suits you.</p>

<p>By default in Blender 2.5x there is only an .x exporter that you can activate in the preferences. Maybe there's an importer available somewhere.</p>
