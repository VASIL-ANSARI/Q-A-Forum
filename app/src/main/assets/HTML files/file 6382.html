<p>Ive never had to use multiple bin folders - not sure why you would want to.  IIS will load all the dll's it finds in there and Ive never had any perforamnce issues - even with things like sharepoint that has heaps.</p>

<p>Having multiple config files is quite useful and valid.</p>

<p>HTH</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
