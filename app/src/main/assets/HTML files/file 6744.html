<p>Easy to fix! In your add function, you assign the new head to the <code>head</code> variable -- which is restricted to the scope of the function, and will dissapear when it returns!</p>

<p>You have to set the value of <code>self.head</code>, the attribute of the current instance.</p>

<p>Edit: when you assign <code>head = self.head</code> you are making them both point to the same object. But they are separate references: whether they happen to reference the same thing or not, changing one won't change the other.</p>
