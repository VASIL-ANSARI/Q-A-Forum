<p>My bet is that the success response from the transaction commit command was not sent (or not sent fast enough) causing an exception in your code. A kinda crazy edge case. Exceptions of this kind dont necessarily mean that the actual execution of the command failed just that there was <em>A</em> failure.</p>

<p>In the same way if there was a problem sending the response from a webservice call it wouldn't necessarily imply that any side effects of that call were not applied.</p>
