<p>You could simulate it. You store the current value of <code>window.location.hash</code> in some variable H. In handler for <code>onhashchange</code> you pop any alert you want, and then, depending on users response, either save new value to H (if user confirms) or reset it to previous value from H (if user cancels). Did you want such behaviour?</p>
