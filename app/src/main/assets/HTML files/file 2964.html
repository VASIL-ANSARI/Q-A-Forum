<p>First, given your rules ("I'd like my custom View to be aligned on the top of the screen and the TextView to be aligned at the bottom of the screen"), I would recommend a <code>RelativeLayout</code>, as it will be simpler. Just use <code>android:layout_alignParentTop="true"</code> on the <code>CustomView</code> and <code>android:layout_alignParentBottom="true"</code> on the <code>TextView</code>, and dump all the <code>gravity</code>/<code>layout_gravity</code> stuff.</p>

<p>If your <code>CustomView</code> still misbehaves, temporarily replace it with a <code>Button</code> or something. If the <code>Button</code> then lays out as you expect, then there is something wrong in the implementation of your <code>CustomView</code>. If you are inheriting from a real <code>View</code> (e.g., <code>CustomView</code> is a subclass of <code>TextView</code>), you should inherit all the right functionality for laying things out. If your <code>CustomView</code> is simply a subclass of <code>View</code>, there might be some things you need to override or call that you aren't. I haven't made a custom <code>View</code> subclass, only subclasses of stuff like <code>LinearLayout</code>, so I'm not 100% certain what you would be missing.</p>
