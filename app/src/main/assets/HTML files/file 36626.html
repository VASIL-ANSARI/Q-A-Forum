<p>I recommend reading <a href="http://12factor.net/">The Twelve-Factor App</a> document, inspired by <em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em> and <em>Refactoring</em> books by Martin Fowler. It suggests the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>There should be one <a href="http://12factor.net/codebase">codebase</a> (version control system) per app, and many deploys of the app in different environments (development, staging, production).</li>
<li><a href="http://12factor.net/dependencies">Dependencies</a> should be explicitly declared and isolated (never relying on the implicit existence of system-wide packages or system tools).</li>
<li><a href="http://12factor.net/config">Config</a> (everything that is likely to vary between deploys) should be stored in the environment, never in the code.</li>
<li><a href="http://12factor.net/backing-services">Backing services</a> (including other apps) should be treated as attached resources, accessed via locators/credentials stored in the <a href="http://12factor.net/config">config</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://12factor.net/build-release-run">Build, release and run</a> stages should be strictly separated from each other.</li>
<li>The app should be executed as one or more stateless and share-nothing <a href="http://12factor.net/processes">processes</a> (state should never be stored in "sticky sessions", but in  a datastore that offers time-expiration).</li>
<li>The app should be completely self-contained (typically adding a webserver library to the app), exporting HTTP as a service by <a href="http://12factor.net/port-binding">port binding</a>.</li>
<li>Due to the partitionable nature of the twelve-factor app <a href="http://12factor.net/processes">processes</a>, adding more <a href="http://12factor.net/concurrency">concurrency</a> should be simply and reliably achieved via the process model.</li>
<li>The app should treat <a href="http://12factor.net/disposability">disposability</a> by achieving fast startup and graceful shutdown.</li>
<li>Development, staging, and production environments should be as similar as possible (<a href="http://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity">Dev/prod parity</a>).</li>
<li>The app should treat <a href="http://12factor.net/logs">logs</a> as event streams, never concerning with its routing or storage.</li>
<li><a href="http://12factor.net/admin-processes">Admin processes</a> should run as one-off processes.</li>
</ol>

<p>There's also the article on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Microservices</a> by James Lewis and Martin Fowler, that states some of the ideas enumerated above.</p>

<p>Regarding packaging and deploying, the latter article recommendations are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#ComponentizationViaServices">Componentization via Services</a></p>

<p>Apps (and their microservices) should be implemented as out-of-process components (rather than in-process libraries) that can be independently replaced, upgraded, and deployed. Components provide a more explicit component interface by using explicit remote call mechanisms.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#OrganizedAroundBusinessCapabilities">Organized around Business Capabilities</a></p>

<p>Each component should be organized around business capability, for a specific business area, taking a road-stack implementation of software including user-interface, persistent storage, and any external collaborations. This approach also allows a cross-team project to work together on the same component (and own the product over its full lifetime).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#SmartEndpointsAndDumbPipes">Smart endpoints and dumb pipes</a></p>

<p>Apps built from microservices should be choreographed using simple RESTish protocols. The two most commonly used protocols are HTTP request-response with resource API's, and lightweight messaging over a dumb bus (such as <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> or <a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#InfrastructureAutomation">Infrastructure Automation</a></p>

<p>The operational complexity of building, deploying and operating microservices can be reduced by automation with <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html">Continuous Delivery</a> or it's precursor, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous Integration</a>.</p></li>
