<p>The thread pool is a convenient choice if you have <em>light weight</em> sporadic processing that isn't time sensitive. However, I recall reading on MSDN that it's not appropriate for large scale processing of this nature.</p>

<p>I used it for something quite similar to this and regret it. I took a worker-thread approach in subsequent apps and am much happier with the level of control I have.</p>

<p>My favorite pattern in the worker-thread model is to create a master thread which holds a queue of tasks items. Then fork a bunch of workers that pop items off that queue to process. I use a blocking queue so that when there are no items the process, the workers just block until something is pushed onto the queue. In this model, the master thread produces work items from some source (db, etc.) and the worker threads consume them.</p>
