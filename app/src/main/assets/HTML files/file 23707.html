<p>You could devide the page into 2 tables</p>

<pre><code>page
- id
- other info that is generic

part
- id
- part_id
- page_id
- language
- content
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can say get the contents of page x with the language y. Also you can "easily" (need to translate a lot :P ) add new languages, just throw them in the part table</p>

<hr>

<p>I added the part_id to part. This way you can say something like i want from page x the part id y, with language q. </p>
