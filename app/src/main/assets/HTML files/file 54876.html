<p>It doesn't appear that the methods you are calling on the <code>Zend_File_Transfer</code> object will throw an exception.  </p>

<p>Without a thrown exception, you won't be able to "catch" anything in your try block.  Instead, you should check the return values of the functions you are calling to determine if there was a problem.</p>

<p>See the API reference which will tell you which methods throw exceptions:
