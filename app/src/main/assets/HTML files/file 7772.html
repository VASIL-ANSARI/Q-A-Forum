<p>I believe your problem is with this line: </p>

<pre><code>// bind the submit handler to unobtrusive validation.
$(container).data("validator").settings.submitHandler = callback(container);
</code></pre>

<p>Here you are <em>intending</em> to assign a <em>function reference</em> to the "submitHandler" property... but, what you are actually doing, is <em>calling the function</em> "callback" with a parameter "container", and assigning the <em>result</em> of that evaluated expression to the "submitHandler" property... which, I don't believe you were intending to do. </p>

<p>You might try this instead (keep in mind, I really don't know the specifics of your situation, i'm just going off what I can deduce): </p>

<pre><code>// bind the submit handler to unobtrusive validation.
$(container).data("validator").settings.submitHandler = function() { callback(container); };
</code></pre>
