<p>If you can control the source of the applications you are monitoring, do what Daniel has suggested in the comments to the question. But if you can't - try executing <code>dumpsys activity activities</code> and see if you could find the info you are looking for there. Take a look at the <code>Running activities</code> section and see if your activity disappears from the list when finished.</p>
