<p>You want to set the <code>lpstrDefExt</code> member:</p>

<p>From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646839%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type: LPCTSTR</p>
  
  <p>The default extension. </p>
  
  <p>GetOpenFileName and
  GetSaveFileName append this extension to the file name if the user
  fails to type an extension. This string can be any length, but only
  the first three characters are appended. The string should not contain
  a period (.). If this member is NULL and the user fails to type an
  extension, no extension is appended.</p>
