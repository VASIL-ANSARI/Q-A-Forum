<p>I'm assuming you're hosting the service in IIS.</p>

<p>Like any other web-based application, the AppDomain in which the service runs can be recycled for several reasons. One possible reason is an idle timeout.</p>

<p>If you don't want it to time out due to idleness, you can change the IIS settings appropriately.</p>
