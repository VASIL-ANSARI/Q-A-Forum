<p>The onlu way to do this with CSS is to set them all a fixed height. Instead of your <code>min-height : 100%</code> use something like <code>min-height: 300px</code>. But since you do not know how much data each of the <code>uls</code> will contain, this is a very inflexible solution.  </p>

<p>Now, If you want all your columns to have the same height, than i supose you want them all to be as tall as the tallest one.</p>

<p>This jQuery code should do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>var equalHeight = function ( group ) {
    var tallest = 0;

    group.each(function() {
        var thisHeight = $(this).height();
        if( thisHeight &gt; tallest ) {
            tallest = thisHeight;
        }
    });

    group.height( tallest );
}
</code></pre>

<p>And than just call it on document ready with your group of elements</p>

<pre><code>$(function () {
    equalHeight($('.rows'));
});
</code></pre>
