<p>I was doing this in work today and it is not that easy. </p>

<p>1) saving the file is not difficult any normal file code will work for a pdf file.</p>

<p>2) showing the pdf you have two options you can display a pdf in a webview if the device has internet access by displaying a Webview and loading google docs with you pdf file at the end of the url</p>

<p>3) or you can create an intent and see if the device has an application that will display the file, you will need to use a FileProvider to get it to run but there is a good post</p>
