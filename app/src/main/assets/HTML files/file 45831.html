<p>You don't show your expression but SpEL uses JavaBean semantics when accessing bean properties. It knows nothing about the internals of the referenced bean. When it encounters a property request...</p>

<pre><code>"x.foo"
</code></pre>

<p>it tries to find the getter <code>getFoo()</code> (any return type) and if that's not found, it looks for <code>isFoo()</code> if it returns boolean.</p>

<p>I suspect you are trying to use <code>x.isVerified</code>. There is no such getter; you need to use <code>x.verified</code>, or you can invoke the method itself <code>x.isVerified()</code>.</p>
