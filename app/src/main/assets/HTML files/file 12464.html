<p>I suggest you to decrease communication speed, because there is no reason to use 115200bps (only if your module demand this speed, then it's ok). Also you are sending string "download" which is not good, rather use markers something like "#D" which internally for your Arduino device means, send data to computer. In this way you are sending only two bytes instead eight, and you will decrease probability of error, and Arduino code will be better.</p>

<p>Now, let's try fix the problem. First try use something like this when you are reading data from Arduino device:</p>

<pre><code>ArayList dataReceaved=new ArrayList():
while(serialPort.BytesToRead&gt;0 &amp;&amp; serialPort.IsOpen){
                dataReceaved.Add(serialPort.ReadByte());
            }
</code></pre>

<p>So I suggest you to read byte by byte, in this or similar way. Also you shold be careful if you are sending numbers from Arduino device. If you are, then use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Serial.print(temperatureValue,BYTE);
</code></pre>

<p>With this code you explicitly say that data you are sending is byte long. If this not help, please let me know, so we can try something else.</p>
