<p>A session cookie holds the unique identifier that PHP generates when <code>session_start()</code> is called, so that each client can be associated with a session, and no two sessions can have the same ID <em>at the same time</em>. </p>

<p>The session cookie is usually destroyed when the browser window is closed, or can be done manually using <code>session_destroy()</code>.</p>
