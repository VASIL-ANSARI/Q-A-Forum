<p><strong>Is it considered bad form to include a subclass in the same .java file as the superclass?</strong></p>

<p>Having the sub class in same .java file that contains a super class is not considered as bad but not recommended. But this opinion varies from person to person so everyone has own opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Any inherent advantages or disadvantages of this as opposed to separating them into their own files?</strong></p>

<p>You know that a single .java file can have only one public class. As from <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.6" rel="nofollow">JLS</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This restriction implies that there must be at most one such type per
  compilation unit. This restriction makes it easy for a Java compiler
  to find a named class within a package. In practice, many programmers
  choose to put each class or interface type in its own compilation
  unit, whether or not it is public or is referred to by code in other
  compilation units.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so yes definitely, it can effect the inheritance if you want the sub class to be public as well.</p>
