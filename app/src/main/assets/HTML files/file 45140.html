<p>What you need to use is the cookie store in Ruby on Rails or the Session. You set these in your controllers and they are available globally after that. </p>

<p>The cookie stores in your clients browser and is ever available after the browser is closed and your connection to the client is gone. This is great for persistent data you wan't between logins, but can be a security risk since the client and anybody with access to their computer can read the cookie values. </p>

<p>The session on the other hand is set for the current time the browser is open on the site. When the browser closes, the session data gets deleted along with it.</p>

<p>So, to store your ID or whatever you need, in your controller you can put it in the session which every controller will have access to from that point on until the browser is closed. Or you can put it in the cookie and you will have access to it as long as the user doesn't clear their cookies mid session or you delete it yourself.</p>

<p>I would suggest the session for sensitive data. You can set it every time you login the user so it should fit your needs.</p>

<pre><code>session[:user_id] = "whatever you want"
</code></pre>

<p>The session hash is available in any controller in your website so by setting a new key such as :user_id, it will add it to the session right away. So, you can create as much as you need wherever you need. Then to access it again, just pull the value.</p>

<pre><code>user_id = session[:user_id]
</code></pre>
