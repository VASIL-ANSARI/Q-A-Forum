<p>basically when you successfully delete an article, in the SAME request (don't make another one, is not necessary) you retrieve also (if any) next article after the last in page (by id, publication date or other) and return the HTML code to append </p>

<p>to be clear: if we suppose you are looking to articles 16,17,18,19,20 you know that last element in page is 20. If you delete article 17 then you retrieve element 21, append in page  and set this value 21 as last value in page (and so on)</p>
