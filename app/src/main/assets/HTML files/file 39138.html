<p>I found the error in the call to scatterv.</p>

<p>The call must use different vectors for input and output. In the code above I was using the same vector:</p>

<pre><code>double_gid_m
</code></pre>

<p>Now I defined a new vector gid.m, and everything is going well (... however the code is giving errors in subsequent parts!!!). The code is now:</p>

<pre><code>gid_m.resize(2*total_half_gid_size);

MPI::COMM_WORLD.Scatterv(&amp;double_gid_m[0], &amp;vect_double_gid_size_processors[0], &amp;double_gid_size_displacement[0], MPI::INT, &amp;gid_m[0], vect_double_gid_size_processors[my_id], MPI::INT, 0);
</code></pre>
