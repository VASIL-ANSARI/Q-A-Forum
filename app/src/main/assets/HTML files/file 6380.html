<p>The mailbox is called "Journal Mailbox", looks exactly like an ordinary mailbox from the API point of view. By default it's off and you must enable it. Instructions are totally different depending on Exchange Server version (2003, 2007 or 2010). The mailbox will contain exact copies of all the emails going in/out/inside the company, however they're not just references (if you understand the email flow process, you can figure out why they are not possible to have). I suppose your CRM system can periodically check the mailbox, index messages, and delete them from the journal.</p>

<p>I'd suggest you consult with Exchange administrator in your company, because it may already be enabled.</p>

<p>P.S. Exchange is optimizing it's database store not to store duplicate messages (at least beginning from 2003) so you shouldn't really worry about that.</p>
