<p>The <code>CAST()</code> operator in the context of character encodings translates from one method of character storage to another â it does not change the actual characters, which is what you are after. An Ã© character is what it is in any character set, it is not an e. You need to convert accented characters to non-accented characters, which is a different issue and has been asked a number of times previously (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2302813/normalizing-accented-characters-in-mysql-queries">normalizing accented characters in MySQL queries</a>).</p>

<p>I am unsure if there is a way to do this directly in MySQL, short of having a translation table and going through letter by letter.  It would most likely be easier to write a PHP script to go through the database and make the translations.</p>
