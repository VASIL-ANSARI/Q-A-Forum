<p>I think you're conflating two concepts:  1) order of parameter evaluation (in a function call), and order of argument pushing.  In the first, it is unspecified (implementation-dependent) what order parameters are evaluated before being passed to a function.  In the second, it depends on the calling convention for the function, with cdecl pushing arguments from right to left, and almost all other conventions (e.g., pascal) pushing from left to right.</p>
