<p>Make sure to create a <strong>Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</strong>  which describes the  complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed. It includes a set of use cases that describe all the interactions the users will have with the software</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pxisa.org/Spec/PXISWSPEC21.pdf" rel="nofollow">Sample</a> </p>

<p>If not your clients may change the requirements time to time  which will lead to project failures and etc. a SRS will define the scope of the system and your work </p>
