<p>I am not sure if this is what you want but you can give it a try.</p>

<p>Select your project and (clean &amp;) build it. Then click the Files tab , select your project and check under the <code>dist</code> folder. There you will find, among others, a <code>.jar</code> file. click the file and your application will run.</p>

<p>I am using NetBeans 8.0 and have loaded one of the samples for JavaFX:DigitalClock</p>
