<p>Your iPad allows permissions that may have 
Been initiated, unlike iPhone.  I am so done 
With the pad I think I will burn it.  Load new 
iOS and run SOPHOS TRACE MODULE,  my 
Feeling is the auto access of many apps available 
Is a bit more secure than the old iOS. Failure to connect by a few previous "wide open doors "
Will halt the new iOS.  Remove all of your suspicious permissions from apps that have no 
Valid use for access to your personal data. Reload the iOS and give it a try....TP7</p>
