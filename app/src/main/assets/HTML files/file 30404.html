<p>The <code>[]</code> vs <code>{}</code> simply uses an Array vs an Object as the namespace.  The former will often work, but is almost always wrong; it pollutes the namespace with the Array prototype properties.  (<code>{}</code> does the same with the Object prototype properties, but there are far fewer of those -- and they are less likely to have desirable names.)</p>
