<p>The default (=most commonly used) file structure for a c++ class called <code>Foo</code> consists of a header file called <code>foo.h</code> which will contain the class definition of <code>Foo</code>, and a <code>foo.cpp</code> which contains the definition of the methods of <code>Foo</code>.</p>

<p>Often all the header files are put into a seperate folder called <code>include</code>.</p>

<p>So the general approach to have the same file/folder structure, which can be used for more than one IDE is:</p>

<ul>
<li>create the folder structure manually (e.g. <code>include</code>, <code>src</code> and <code>make</code> folders inside your project folder <code>MyProject</code>, the project files for IDEs would go into make, .h files into include, and .cpp files into src)</li>
<li>create the .h and .cpp files for your classes manually using the explorer/finder/...</li>
<li>use "add existing file" or something equivalent to add those files to the project file of your IDE.</li>
<li>as Rup pointed out, for Visual Studio, one should use the "empty project" preset, or it will add some header files you dont want</li>
</ul>
