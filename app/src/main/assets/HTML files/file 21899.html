<p>I strongly recommend you check out <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">composer</a>.  It really simplifies managing dependencies  between a ton of modern PHP libraries, as well as autoloading.</p>

<p>For instance, if you were starting you project, and you knew you wanted to pull in zend-db, you'd do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php   
$ ./composer.phar require zendframework/zend-db:2.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>That last line will cause composer to spring into action.  It will create a directory called "vendor" where it keeps all the libraries it manages.  It then will check out version 2.1.1 of zend-db in there, and set up an vendor/autoload.php which you'll require in your project.</p>

<p>Then you can test it out.  Create myproject/index.php like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

$adapter = new Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter(array(
   'driver' =&gt; 'Pdo_Sqlite',
   'database' =&gt; 'path/to/sqlite.db'
));
</code></pre>

<p>And it just works.</p>

<p>Later, if you decide you need Zend\Mail too, you just:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./composer.phar require zendframework/zend-mail:2.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>and composer will install it, along with a couple of dependencies, and make sure it's available to the autoloader.</p>

<p>Composer is not ZF-specific, either.  There's a whole ecosystem of code to explore.  <a href="https://packagist.org/explore/">Packagist</a> is a good place to start.</p>
