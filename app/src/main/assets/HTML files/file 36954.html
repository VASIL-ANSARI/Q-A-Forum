<p>Picture resolutions and preview resolutions are not the same thing. The former is for pictures. The latter is for the preview frames.</p>

<p>Yes, you can. Android will happily stretch or shrink your preview frames to match the size of the <code>TextureView</code> or <code>SurfaceView</code> that you are using for the preview. In fact, such stretching or shrinking is pretty much unavoidable, since it is rather unlikely that the camera will support some arbitrary preview resolution, one that happens to match whatever you are choosing for your preview <code>View</code> size.</p>
