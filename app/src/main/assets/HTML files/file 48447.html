<p>ry to keep your CMakeLists.txt file simple by using </p>

<pre><code>find_package(ITK REQUIRED)
include(${ITK_USE_FILE})
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, moving a built version of ITK is not so straightforward, you should not move the build directory but create an install directory .
In brief you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the cmakegui, set cmake_install prefix to some folder where you have permission to write (NOT the default C:/Program Files)</li>
<li>set the other options in the cmake gui, open ITK.sln in Visual Studio and build</li>
<li>from Visual Studio, select the project INSTALL in ITK.sln and "Build only this project". In the output you'll see that a bunch of files get copied
You have to decide if you want to install the debug libraries or the release libraries, you can't install both in the same folder because they have the same name and will get overwritten</li>
</ul>
