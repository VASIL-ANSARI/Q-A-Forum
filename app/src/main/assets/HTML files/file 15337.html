<p>The problem is you're not actually decorating anything. That is, you're not "wrapping" a Component with a Decorator.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern" rel="nofollow">Decorator pattern</a>.</p>

<p>An excellent example of this pattern is in the book: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596007124" rel="nofollow">Head First Design Patterns</a>. I really like this book and highly recommend it if you dont already have it.</p>
