<p>I think this is the sequence of events causing your webservice to be fired at page load.</p>

<ol>
<li>In design mode this checkbox1 is checked.</li>
<li><p>In run mode when this window gets loaded, it calls InitializeComponents() 
(method which initializes controls on window. Don't know real name of this method in SL but in Winforms and WPF its InitializeComponents).</p></li>
<li><p>There it checks the checkbox because that's the way its in design mode. This causes the event to be fired which call your service.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>First don't save value in database as <code>1</code> or <code>-1</code>. </p>

<p>Save as <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. These are <code>int</code> values and directly convertible to bool's <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> which can further be assigned to your checkbox. </p>

<p>In UI don't check your checkbox. In Window Load when data is retrieved from database, do this</p>

<pre><code>void Windows_Loaded(....)
{
    bool i = value_from_database(); //------- Line No. 1
    checkBox1.Checked -= new RoutedEventHandler(checkBox1_Checked); //Line No. 2
    checkbox1.Ischecked = i; //------- Line No. 3
    checkBox1.Checked += new RoutedEventHandler(checkBox1_Checked); //Line No. 4
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you assign database value to checkbox, its checked event will not fire (since it has been removed by Line No. 2). </p>

<p>Now when it assigns that value to it. (Line 3)</p>

<p>We will again add that event to our checkbox. (Line 4)</p>
