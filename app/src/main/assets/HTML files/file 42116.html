<p>This is a quirk of IE8 event model. MSDN makes a remark on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms536343(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">attachEvent</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you attach multiple functions to the same event on the same object, the functions are called in random order, immediately after the object's event handler is called.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you can overcome it by registering only one event handler instead of three.</p>

<pre><code>function fun() {
  var ele = document.getElementById("tt");
  bindEvent(ele, "click", function() {
    one();
    two();
    three();
  });
}
</code></pre>
