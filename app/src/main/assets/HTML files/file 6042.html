<p><code>Credentials</code> is for basic/etc http security - <strong>not</strong> forms-based security.</p>

<p>It would be better to use an API if one exists. HTML forms are meant for humans, not computers. It looks like there is a <a href="http://data.london.gov.uk/apibeta" rel="nofollow">beta TfL API here</a>.</p>
