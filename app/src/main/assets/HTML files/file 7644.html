<p>C# does not run on the client side.</p>

<p>The only way to do it is through javascript.</p>

<p>You need to find some way to call it from javascript, just use a callback function or method to run once you have completed the rest of the work.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>You could always use a hidden field as well, set this on the postback using C#, then pick it up front end using javascript check for a particular value in there or something?!</p>

<p>or, use a script manager and let the c# call javascript through this.</p>

<p>This is another couple of methods you could use.</p>
