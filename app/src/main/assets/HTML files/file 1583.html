<p>You can omit lots of braces in your code, that's one of Python's benefits. E.g. when putting braces around conditions, like</p>

<pre><code>if (depth &lt;= 0) or ((r &gt; Ratio) and (not (entry))):
</code></pre>

<p>just write</p>

<pre><code>if depth &lt;= 0 or (r &gt; Ratio and not entry):
</code></pre>

<p>And I think there are a couple of redundant calls, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>this_atom = str(this_atom)
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>this_atom</code> will already be a string, and building strings is always expensive, so just omit this line)</p>

<p>or the call to the <code>object</code> constructor</p>

<pre><code>object.__init__(self)
</code></pre>

<p>which isn't necessary, either.</p>

<p>As for the <code>Node.__init__</code> method being the "bottleneck": I guess spending most of your time there cannot be avoided, since when constructing trees like this there's not much else you'll be doing but creating new Nodes.</p>
