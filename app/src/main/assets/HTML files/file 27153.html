<p>No, it's not OK. From C99, 6.7.8.2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Constraints</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>No initializer shall attempt to provide a value for an object not contained within the entity being initialized.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In my read, this means that providing excess initializer elements is a <strong>constraint violation,</strong> so it invokes undefined behavior.</p>
