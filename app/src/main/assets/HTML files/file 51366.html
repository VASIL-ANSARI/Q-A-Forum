<p>When your input comes from standard input, you have to let your program know when the input ends. Otherwise it will keep waiting for the next input to be entered.</p>

<p>Therefore you should decide on some character or String that would mark the end of the input.</p>

<p>For example, here typing <code>done</code> would end the loop :</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {       
   try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {                               
            for (String nextLine, line = br.readLine(); line != null &amp;&amp; !line.equals("done"); line = nextLine) {                
                nextLine = br.readLine();
                // Work with "line"
            }
   }
   catch (IOException ex) {         
        System.exit(-1);
   }
}
</code></pre>
