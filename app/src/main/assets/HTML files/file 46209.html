<p>The bootstrap modal has events you can watch for. </p>

<p><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals" rel="nofollow">http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals</a></p>

<p><strong>hidden.bs.modal</strong> This event is fired when the modal has finished being hidden from the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).</p>

<p>This will fire when the modal is completely gone. </p>

<pre><code>$('#myModal').on('hidden.bs.modal', function (e) {
  // do something...
});
</code></pre>

<p>Something else you can do is to setup your method that's doing the work to close the modal. So remove <strong>data-dismiss="modal"</strong> from the modal button and watch for a click event, run your upload stuff, then close the modal with <strong>$('#myModal').modal('hide');</strong></p>
