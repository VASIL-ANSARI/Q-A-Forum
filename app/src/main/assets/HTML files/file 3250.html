<p>It sounds to me like you're talking about <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Filters/ClassMethods.html">filters</a>.</p>

<pre><code>class MyController &lt; ActionController::Base
  before_filter :execute_this_for_every_action

  def index
    @foo = @bar
  end

  def new
    @foo = @bar.to_s
  end

  def execute_this_for_every_action
    @bar = :baz
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can put the filter on the ApplicationController, too, if you want every controller to run it.</p>
