<p>You can't have "code" outside of a function. You need to put the call to <code>new</code> inside a function - you only have one in your code: <code>main</code>, but as long as it is a function that is executed before you access the array, it's fine. </p>

<p>You can also, as the comment says, do <code>int *arr = new int[10];</code> - as long as it's part of the initialization, and not on a separate line.</p>
