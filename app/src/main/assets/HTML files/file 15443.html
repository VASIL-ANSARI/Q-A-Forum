<p>I should note my server works like this: accepts connection, receives some data, sends some data, once the data is sent closes the connection. JMeter docs say TCP Sampler closes the connection unless "reuse socket" is checked, so I guess this is not SO_REUSEADDR. I assume in some cases the client sends data, receives data, and before the server closes the socket, the client tries to send data again, then the server closes the socket and JMeter thinks the request failed.</p>

<p>So, the solution is to not check "reuse address". Closing the socket each request is expected behavior, as my clients communicate relatively infrequently.</p>
