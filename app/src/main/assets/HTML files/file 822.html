<p>If you need an exact number, then you are going to have to loop over all of the pixels.  Probably storing the color and a count in a hash is the best way to go because of the sparseness of the colors.  </p>

<p>Using the Color.ToArgb() in the hash instead of the color object would probably be a good idea too.</p>

<p>Also, if speed is a major concern, you don't want to use a function like GetPixel(x, y) -- instead try to process chunks at a time (row a time).  If you can, get a pointer to the beginning of the image memory and do it unsafe.</p>
