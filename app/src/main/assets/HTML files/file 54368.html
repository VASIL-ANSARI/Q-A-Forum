<p>I solved the problem. 
I added a check before the for loop that crashed. </p>

<pre><code>if(getInnerParentNode() &amp;&amp; getInnerParentNode()-&gt;getChildNodes())
{
   for(int j =0; j &lt; getInnerParentNode()-&gt;getChildNodes()-&gt;getLength(); ++j) //was crashing here on first pass if xmlfile is empty
    {

        //code that was not being reached
    }
}
</code></pre>
