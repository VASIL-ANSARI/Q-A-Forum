<p>You can have a pointer to <code>B</code> as a member, or a smart pointer. The reason you cannot have a member variable of type <code>B</code> and have it defined outside of <code>A</code> is that if the compiler have not seen the definition of a class it does not know its size therefore cannot figure out layout for <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>Another approach to the whole thing is to use a pimpl idiom, I think it would be ideal here.</p>
