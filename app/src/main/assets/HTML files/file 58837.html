<p>Start with a correct implementation of binary search.  Then replace each recursive call with an inline version of the whole search (minus any initialization), i.e expand the binary search code in place as if it were a macro expansion [change variable names as necessary].  I believe if you do it right you will then have a quarternary search procedure.</p>
