<p>Turn on socket option SO_KEEPALIVE on the socket. This will enable a heartbeat feature built into the TCP protocol.</p>

<p>Here's a simple way to turn this on.</p>

<pre><code>Socket socket = ...; // Your socket on the client side
socket.setKeepAlive(true);
</code></pre>

<p>If the other side of the connection stops responding to the heartbeats, you will get an <code>IOException</code> on your call to read from the socket.</p>

<p>However, the timeout for this is 2 hours. This may be too long for your needs (you didn't specify)</p>
