<p>From the <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#details" rel="nofollow">Qt documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The widget is the atom of the user interface. (...) A widget is
  clipped by its parent and by the widgets in front of it.</p>
  
  <p>A widget that is not embedded in a parent widget is called a window.
  (...)</p>
  
  <p>A widget without a parent widget is always an independent window
  (top-level widget).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
