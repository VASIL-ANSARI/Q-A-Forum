<p>I would have separate web.config files for staging and live regardless.</p>

<p>There are frequently many settings which need changing for development purposes, e.g. Cache lengths, security settings, urls etc.</p>

<p>From my experience, using the same config is a recipe for disaster - it takes 1 developer to change the settings to get something working locally, and then check the updated file in, and you end up with a broken staging server (or possibly live)!</p>

<p>If you use a build then it is simple to substitute web.config with web.live.config or web.staging.config during the build process.</p>

<p>Your problem then goes away.</p>
