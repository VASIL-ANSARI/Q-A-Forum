<p>Your problem is related to decoding of your public key (which you copied from Google Play).</p>

<p>I would suggest to change a bit Google's code, namely function: </p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] decode(String s) throws Base64DecoderException {
    byte[] bytes = s.getBytes();
    return decode(bytes, 0, bytes.length);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Weak point here's <code>getBytes()</code> which supposed to translate your Base64 encoded string into byte array. <code>getBytes()</code> is using default system charset, which is for all Android devices is UTF-8. </p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7273868/sencha-touch-openlayers-geoserver-wrong-encoding-on-devices-using-android-2-2">Probably there's a bug in Galaxy Tab 10.1 related to default charset</a>. Please try to use explicit charset UTF-8 like:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] bytes = s.getBytes("UTF-8");
</code></pre>
