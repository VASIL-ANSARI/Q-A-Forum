<p>Are you using the Login Button or FB.login()?</p>

<p>If you are using FB.login, you can track the response and whatever choice people make, the browser returns to the app and the response data indicating whether they connected or cancelled is sent to your app. You can handle it exactly the way you want it to behave. </p>

<pre><code>FB.login(function(response) {
 if (response.status === 'connected') {
   // Logged into your app and Facebook.
 } else if (response.status === 'not_authorized') {
   // The person is logged into Facebook, but not your app.
 } else {
   // The person is not logged into Facebook, so we're not sure if
   // they are logged into this app or not.
 }
});
</code></pre>
