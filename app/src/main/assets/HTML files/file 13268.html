<p>The problem is that the <code>cron</code> job, which uses the command-line PHP executable is running with the current directory as the location of the PHP executable, or the home folder of whichever account is running the job.  Therefore, any relative paths in the script are resolved relative to that location, rather than the directory containing the script.</p>

<p>By adding the the <code>chdir()</code> call you're setting the current directory to the location expected by the script, and therefore your relative paths resolve correctly.</p>
