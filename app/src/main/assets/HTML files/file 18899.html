<p>PortAudio is for device I/O only, such as speakers, microphones, line inputs and similar devices. To do file I/O you need another library designed for that. For example, <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/" rel="nofollow">libsoundfile</a>, <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/libsox.html" rel="nofollow">libsox</a> or <a href="http://audiofile.68k.org/" rel="nofollow">libaudiofile</a>.</p>
