<p>I have not used the <a href="http://www.aspose.com/categories/java-components/aspose.cells-for-java/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">Java edition of Aspose Cells</a> but I've used the .NET edition and it is really nice. Over there it says that it can open and save XLSX. It's not free nor open source, though.</p>
