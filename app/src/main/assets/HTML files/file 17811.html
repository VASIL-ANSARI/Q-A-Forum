<p>I put the LIMIT clause in the sordOrder parameter, I've also seen the same thing done by others but not sure if its 100% correct:</p>

<pre><code>final Cursor c = resolver.query(
        MyTable.CONTENT_URI,
        MyTable.PROJECTION,
        null,
        null,
        " limit 1 offset 2");
</code></pre>
