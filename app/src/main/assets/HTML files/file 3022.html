<p>You can</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Import the schema file to your database prior to deploying the application</p></li>
<li><p>You can have a script that creates the schema</p></li>
<li><p>You can have a script that makes any changes to the current schema (for upgrades)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For a small CMS, I'd just keep the SQL in a schema file and import it when I need it.</p>

<p>You could also do a database copy from your dev -> live system. So you make the changes in the dev database as you need them and then push them to the live database. Something like SQLCompare for SQL Server works well.</p>

<p>Wordpress does the install.php route, where you have to enter your credentials and such for the target database and it then pushes the changes to it.</p>
