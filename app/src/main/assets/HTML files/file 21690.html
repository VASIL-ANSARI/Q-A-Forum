<p>ios6 introduced new ways to deal with orientation changes - I'd guess your friend's iphone is running ios5. See the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIViewController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIViewController/supportedInterfaceOrientations" rel="nofollow">UIViewController docs</a> to see how to deal with both versions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Handling View Rotations</strong></p>
  
  <p>In iOS 6, your app supports the interface orientations defined in your
  appâs Info.plist file. A view controller can override the
  supportedInterfaceOrientations method to limit the list of supported
  orientations. Generally, the system calls this method only on the root
  view controller of the window or a view controller presented to fill
  the entire screen; child view controllers use the portion of the
  window provided for them by their parent view controller and no longer
  participate in directly in decisions about what rotations are
  supported. The intersection of the appâs orientation mask and the view
  controllerâs orientation mask is used to determine which orientations
  a view controller can be rotated into.</p>
  
  <p>You can override the preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation for
  a view controller that is intended to be presented full screen in a
  specific orientation.</p>
  
  <p>In iOS 5 and earlier, the UIViewController class displays views in
  portrait mode only. To support additional orientations, you must
  override the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method and return
  YES for any orientations your subclass supports. If the autoresizing
  properties of your views are configured correctly, that may be all you
  have to do. However, the UIViewController class provides additional
  hooks for you to implement additional behaviors as needed. Generally,
  if your view controller is intended to be used as a child view
  controller, it should support all interface orientations.</p>
  
  <p>When a rotation occurs for a visible view controller, the
  willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:,
  willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration:, and
  didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation: methods are called during the
  rotation. The viewWillLayoutSubviews method is also called after the
  view is resized and positioned by its parent. If a view controller is
  not visible when an orientation change occurs, then the rotation
  methods are never called. However, the viewWillLayoutSubviews method
  is called when the view becomes visible. Your implementation of this
  method can call the statusBarOrientation method to determine the
  device orientation.</p>
