<p>It appears that you need to brush up on what classes and instances are. Understanding classes and instances is fundamental if you're going to do object-oriented programming, which is what you do when you use Objective-C.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we change view and then go back to the menu it adds another loop of sound</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That phrase suggests that when you "go back", you are not actually <em>going back</em> to the <em>already existing</em> Meny instance - instead, you are creating <em>another</em> Meny instance. So now, you see, you have two of them! Well, each Meny instance has its own AVAudioPlayer, which starts playing when the Meny instance is created â so now you have two audio players, and that's why you hear two loops playing simultaneously.</p>
