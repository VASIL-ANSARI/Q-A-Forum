<p>The problem is that the dll was not in the same dir as where the .exe was being executed.  However, since I didn't want to manually copy the dll each time, and since it was being used by other .exes, the better solution was to add a post-build event.</p>

<p>One more important note: Afraid of getting nicked with another -1 for asking a bad question, I spent a couple of hours coming up with the magic potion/incantations needed to do such a post-build copy.  Here it is.  Note the use of the macros, the /Y, and especially the quotes around the whole mess of each pathname.</p>

<pre><code>xcopy /Y "$(SolutionDir)x64\Release\mcDll.dll" "$(SolutionDir)stream\x64\Release"
</code></pre>
