<p>If you look at the rails code then you will find that execute method runs the passed sql, so it should essentially run all your queries as long as they are ';' separated and valid.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry! No it won't because it will add ';' in between your query string and complain about wrong syntax</p>
