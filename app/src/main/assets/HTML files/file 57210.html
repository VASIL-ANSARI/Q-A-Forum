<p>The problem is that you are creating only one list and then duplicating it.</p>

<p>So your code is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>def build_lists():
    l = []
    return l, l, l
a, b, c = build_lists()
</code></pre>

<p>So the following would work as that would be creating new lists for each iteration:</p>

<p><code>a, b, c = [[] for i in range(3)]</code></p>
