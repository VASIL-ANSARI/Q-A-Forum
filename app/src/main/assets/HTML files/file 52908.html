<p>Can you trying doing:</p>

<pre><code>$('#container').append($(obj.content));
</code></pre>

<p>That should work. As you are just trying to append text and not DOM elements</p>

<p>Another change being the response JSON, as it has <code>p</code> tags and <code>htmlescaped</code> elements. So, you might have to change the response a bit too, For instance,</p>

<ol>
<li>Changing the stylesheet link to a <code>style</code> tag, attached to the <code>div</code>.</li>
<li>send the response back as unescaped, which will help reduce the clutter.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
