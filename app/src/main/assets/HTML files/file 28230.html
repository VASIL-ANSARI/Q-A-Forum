<p>I am not aware of the plugin, but one problem I see in your code-snippet in general is that you are not operating on a specific object <code>@question</code>, but on the class <code>Question</code>. If I had to take a guess, I would say that this is the source of your problem.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>So, I just checked out the documentation for the gem and I found this code-snippet directly there:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% tag_cloud(@tags, %w(css1 css2 css3 css4)) do |tag, css_class| %&gt;
  &lt;%= link_to tag.name, { :action =&gt; :tag, :id =&gt; tag.name }, :class =&gt; css_class %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this is pretty much what I just told you. Instead of working on the class you have to work on a specific object or, like in the shown case, a collection of objects.</p>
