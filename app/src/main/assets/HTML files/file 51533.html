<p><strong>On a side note is android studio recommended for use with parse, I do not see any instructions to add it to eclipse on there website, just android studio</strong></p>

<p>Android Studio is recommended for Android Development ,Google doesn't recommend to use Eclipse for Android Development , I would suggest you to switch from eclipse to Android Studio , Then will be much easier to solve the problems quickly you are facing now .</p>

<p>You can solve your problem in Eclipse too ,follow below steps :</p>

<p>1 . Download jar file from <a href="https://github.com/ParsePlatform/Parse-SDK-Android#download" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>3 . Rebuild project .</p>
