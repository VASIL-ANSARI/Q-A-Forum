<p>It looks like you are not completing the OAuth flow.</p>

<p>Leave off access_token in your initializer, this token is unique to the user that is logging in/authorizing your application with Instagram.</p>

<p>The redirect_uri should be your callback uri:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
</code></pre>

<p>This is where the temp code is exchanged for a access_token. It should not be result/index. The redirect_uri must also match the one entered for your OAuth Application on the Instagram Developer page.</p>

<p>Everything else seems about right. I recommend visiting the Instagram Ruby Gem github page, there is some great information there.</p>
