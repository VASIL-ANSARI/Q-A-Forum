<p>The reason that objects weakly retain their delegates is to avoid retain cycles. Imagine the following scenario: object <code>a</code> creates <code>b</code> and retains it, then sets itself as  <code>b</code>'s delegate. <code>a</code> is released by its owner, leaving a retain cycle containing <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. This is actually a very common scenario. Consider a view controller that owns a view and acts as that view's delegate. In this case, the view should not retain the controllerâas a mater of proper MVC architecture and to prevent retain cycles.</p>
