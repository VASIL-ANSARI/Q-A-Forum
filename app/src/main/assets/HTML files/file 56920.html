<p>This is not an API that dapper exposes, because it never needs that. To do what you want, you could borrow liberally from the dapper source code to get what you need, but also consider: you cannot create a <code>DbParameter</code> in isolation - it is an abstract type. You need to either know in advance what type you actually want, or ask the connection to create the parameters for you.</p>
