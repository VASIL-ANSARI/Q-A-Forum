<p>Let's pretend there are only 2 elements.  You array starts as</p>

<pre><code> {0, 0}
</code></pre>

<p>In the first step, you set the first element of the array to a random value, let's say 2, and your array is</p>

<pre><code> {2, 0} 
</code></pre>

<p>You then sort the array and get</p>

<pre><code> {0, 2}
</code></pre>

<p>You then move on; you're putting a random element in the second position in the array, let's say 3.  Your array is now</p>

<pre><code> {0, 3}
</code></pre>

<p>and you're done.</p>

<p>Sorting the array always moves the 0s to the beginning, and then you're overwriting the previously suggested elements.  There are a couple solutions -- only sort the filled part of the array; insert elements in reverse order even if you sort in ascending order -- but that's your problem there.</p>
