<p>This sounds really like some memory leaks or not releasing memory which is not used anymore by your app.</p>

<p>There is no general solution to be given, because the cause of those problems could be anywhere and be anything.</p>

<p>What you could do is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>ensure that you have defined <code>didReceiveMemoryWarning</code> methods in your classes and that you try to free not used memory there;</p></li>
<li><p>running your app under the Leaks and Memory Allocation profiling tools and see what you can to about what they report to you;</p></li>
<li><p>if you do not have memory leaks, try and use <a href="http://useyourloaf.com/blog/2011/03/08/using-heapshots-to-find-abandoned-memory.html" rel="nofollow">snapshot analysis</a> to find abandoned memory.</p></li>
</ol>

  <p>In this process I came across ": CGBitmapContextInfoCreate: unable to allocate .. bytes for bitmap data". Is my memory problem related to this error?</p>

<p>If you fill up the memory, the allocation call can fail... this is rather an effect, more than a cause.</p>
