<p>Thatâs how painting works â you have to handle its <code>Paint</code> event and keep painting the same thing each time it needs repainting.</p>

<p>What you can do is draw on top of your original image:</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap b = new Bitmap(picture.Image);

using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(b)) {
    using (Bitmap drawnpic = new Bitmap(pathofpic)) {
        g.DrawImage(drawnpic, 0, 0, b.Width, b.Height);
    }
}

picture.Image = b;
</code></pre>

<p>Then youâd save the original image somewhere and probably use it instead of <code>picture.Image</code> in the <code>new Bitmap</code> line.</p>

<p>And <code>PascalCase</code> for method names, please. ;)</p>
