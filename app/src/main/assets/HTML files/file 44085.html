<p>A couple things to try</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure there is not a duplicate site in IIS that is capturing the request</li>
<li>Restarting IIS is never a bad option</li>
<li>Make the web.config itself is set to target framework 4.0 and not 2.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually when this happens where it works fine locally but not when deployed it always turns out to be the third item, a web.config configuration mis-match. Hope this helps!</p>
