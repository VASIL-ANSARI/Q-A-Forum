<li>I suppose your <code>"app/Console-babababa/../LaravelPackage/src/MyCompany/"</code> case is not a bug but a feature ;)</li>
<li>About <code>"../app/LaravelPackage/src/MyCompany/"</code>, it's probably just how Composer is designed.</li>

<p>You could have a look at this recently implemented way of defining a repository: <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path" rel="nofollow">Repositories > Hosting your own > Path</a>. Though, it should be considered as a "last pick" solution, as it's very quick to set up but lacks flexibility.</p>

<p>You should consider the other options listed in the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md" rel="nofollow">Hosting your own</a> section. For local development, Toran Proxy is very easy to set up and use.</p>
