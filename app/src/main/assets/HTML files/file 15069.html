<p>The logic you have in viewDidLoad that builds your array should be moved to its own method (reloadTableViewData), and then you would just call that method in viewDidLoad.</p>

<pre><code>[self reloadTableViewData];
</code></pre>

<p>You would also call that same method when you do the pull to refresh.</p>

<p>Make sure you are rebuilding that array and not just adding objects to the existing one.</p>
