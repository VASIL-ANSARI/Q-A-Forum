<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp" rel="nofollow" title="w3schools background">w3schools - css - background</a>.  You need to use background-repeat, otherwise you will be forcing the users to download a huge image.  So make your gradient of any size, then crop a piece off that is the same height, but a small width (&lt; 10 pixels).  Use this as your background with the css <code>background-repeat: repeat-x;</code>.</p>
