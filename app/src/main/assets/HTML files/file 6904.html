<p>I know this is somewhat late, but google sent me here while trying to solve a similar problem. 
Any attempt to delete a particular symlink failed with the confusing message "directory not empty" 
I dug a little deeper, and found that the target file did not exist. I created one and rm worked :-).</p>

<p>Seems to me like a bug in Android, but I am too new to Android to be sure.</p>
