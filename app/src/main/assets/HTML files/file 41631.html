<p>For customising your request and refer this url <a href="https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/7996717" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/7996717</a>, you can prepare the hook <code>post-merge</code> as below</p>

<pre><code>#/usr/bin/env bash

# git hook to run a command after `git pull` if a specified file was changed
# Run `chmod +x post-merge` to make it executable then put it into `.git/hooks/`.

changed_files="$(git diff-tree -r --name-only --no-commit-id ORIG_HEAD HEAD)"

check_run() {
    echo "$changed_files" | mailx -s "changes found on production server!" your.mail.box@mail.com
}

# In this example it's used to send mail if there are any files changed.
check_run 
</code></pre>
