<p>Not entirely certain about what you're asking but the following might work.</p>

<p>1)  Disable <code>onfocusout</code> for the one field or the entire form.  Not sure what you'd need as I cannot see the rest of your code.  The idea here is to stop the normal events from triggering validation on your field.  (Maybe you'll need to disable <code>onkeyup</code> validation as well?)</p>

<p>2)  Then when you're ready to validate this particular field, you can can trigger it yourself with the <code>.valid()</code> method.  <code>$('#myField').valid()</code> will trigger validation on only this one field and return a boolean indication for pass/fail.</p>

<p>Note that all rules are applied the same and that you still need to call the <code>.validate()</code> method to initialize the plugin on your form.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Based on OP's edit:</p>

<pre><code>onfocusout: function(element) {
    if ($element.attr('id') === 'myInput') {
       setTimeout(function() {
            this.element(element);  // trigger validation after the delay
        }, 1000);
    } else if ( !this.checkable(element) &amp;&amp; (element.name in this.submitted || !this.optional(element)) ) {
        this.element(element);  // otherwise, trigger validation normally
    }
},
</code></pre>
