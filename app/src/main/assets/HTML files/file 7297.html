<p>Is "auto" a valid generator class?</p>

<p>It is not listed on the O/R mapping part of the docs and from what it looks like you are doing you are not generating an ID in code or in the database:</p>

<p>I would look at native if you want to assign ids, or do an identity generator to let MySQL handle it.</p>
