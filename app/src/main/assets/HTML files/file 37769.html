<p>If the image is not in the same folder as your js file, you'll have to navigate to the image folder to retrieve the image.</p>

<p>From what you say, your folder structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>/root/ 
   /js/myJSFile.js
    /css/myCSSFile.css
    /img/closed.gif
</code></pre>

<p>You can access your <code>closed.gif</code> image using a relative link like so:</p>

<p><code>ddtreemenu.closefolder="../img/closed.gif"</code></p>

<p>The <code>../</code> tells it to exit the current folder, <code>/js/</code>, and then it can navigate to the <code>closed.gif</code> file the rest of the way. </p>
