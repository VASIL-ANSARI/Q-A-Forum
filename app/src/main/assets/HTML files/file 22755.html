<p>This is covered in the <code>SqlTransaction</code> documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dispose should rollback the transaction. However, the behavior of
  Dispose is provider specific, and should not replace calling Rollback.</p>

<p>I guess it all depends how paranoid you are about trying to force broken implementations to work properly when you think they might not.  The first code sample is definitely the simplest and it's only going to fail if your provider isn't working as it should.  </p>

<p>EDIT complexity example - Should your last snippet be:</p>

<pre><code>try { /*...*/ 
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(sSQL, reportConnection, trans)) {
        /*...*/ }
    trans.Commit();
} catch { try { trans.Rollback(); } catch {} throw; }
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>try { /*...*/ 
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(sSQL, reportConnection, trans)) {
        /*...*/ }
} catch { try { trans.Rollback(); } catch {} throw; }
trans.Commit();
</code></pre>
