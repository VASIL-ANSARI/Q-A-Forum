<p><code>AES</code> is a block cipher algorithm so it requires you to have the text to be a multiple of 16 bytes. your message <code>"The answer is no"</code> is of 16 bytes.But the input wouldn't be so
you can use the <code>MOD_CFB</code> of the <code>AES</code> to get around this.</p>

<pre><code>from Crypto.Cipher import AES
# Encryption
encryption_suite = AES.new('This is a key123', AES.MODE_CFB, 'This is an IV456')
cipher_text = encryption_suite.encrypt("A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.")

# Decryption
decryption_suite = AES.new('This is a key123', AES.MODE_CFB, 'This is an IV456')
plain_text = decryption_suite.decrypt(cipher_text)
</code></pre>

<p>this would work for user input.</p>
