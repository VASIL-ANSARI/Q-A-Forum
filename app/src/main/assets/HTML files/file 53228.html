<p>Yes, <code>area</code> is only being passed into the displayData function once, so there is only one value in the loop. One possible solution is to pass in an area array and then loop through that as you loop through the rooms, but I think the better solution is to just display one room at a time in displayData (so remove the loop from displayData, and move the function call into the loop in main) and move the totalSF display to another function (if you don't want to show a running total of totalSF).</p>
