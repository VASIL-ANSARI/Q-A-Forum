<p>Annotations in Python 3 can be any valid expression, not just a type, and are not actually used for anything internally (for more on annotations, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107" rel="nofollow">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107</a>). There are no guidelines or standards as to how to use these annotations so they can be used in whatever way is easiest for the coder (See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008#programming-recommendations" rel="nofollow">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008#programming-recommendations</a>). </p>

<p>In your specific case you could use a string or global variable to indicate your type, or perhaps the <code>types.GeneratorType</code>, although there is no way to indicate that the generator produces <code>int</code>s.</p>
