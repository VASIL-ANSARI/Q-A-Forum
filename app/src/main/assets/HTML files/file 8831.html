<p>No it may be a setting in php.</p>

<p>In you local server, output_buffering is enabled in your php.ini file.</p>

<p>You can disable it by setting :</p>

<pre><code>output_buffering = off
</code></pre>

<p>To Ensure that the content is sent to the browser each time a echo-like statement is used, add :</p>

<pre><code>implicit_flush = on
</code></pre>

<p>You also can set the buffer size by giving output_buffering a value.</p>

<pre><code>output_buffering = 4096
</code></pre>

<p>here the buffer size would be 4KB.</p>

<p>Output buffering tells php to keep in memory all data to be sent to the browser until it encouters a flush() instruction in your code, the buffer happens to be full, or it is the end of the script.</p>

<p>Here is the full reference for output buffer from php.net : <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/outcontrol.configuration.php" rel="nofollow">php output buffer</a></p>
