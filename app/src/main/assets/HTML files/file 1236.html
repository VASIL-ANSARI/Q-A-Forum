<p>If you're running under Windows, before calling traceview first run traceview.bat (in /tools) to set some environment variables, among other things. </p>

<p>Also, you need to call it with an absolute path to your trace file. At least in my environment, a relative path gives me an error.</p>

<p>I write my trace files to the emulator's SD card, then when I want to examine them first copy them to my machine:</p>

<pre><code>adb pull /sdcard/app.trace /app/traces
traceview.bat c:/path/app/traces/app.trace
</code></pre>
