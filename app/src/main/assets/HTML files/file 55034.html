<p>This code has worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import shutil
import tarfile

with tarfile.open(fname, "r|*") as tar:
    counter = 0

    for member in tar:
        if member.isfile():
            filename = os.path.basename(member.name)
            if filename != "myfile": # do your check
                continue

            with open("output.file", "wb") as output: 
                shutil.copyfileobj(tar.fileobj, output, member.size)

            break # got our file

        counter += 1
        if counter % 1000 == 0:
            tar.members = [] # free ram... yes we have to do this manually
</code></pre>

<p>But your problem might not be the extraction, but rather that your file is indeed no .tar.gz but just a .gz file.</p>

<p>Edit: Also your getting the error on the with line because python is trying to call the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1984325/explaining-pythons-enter-and-exit"><code>__enter__</code></a> function of the member object (wich does not exist).</p>
