<p>You cannot add more than one component to a <code>BorderLayout</code> region and you are doing it in the end. You need to change your <code>northpanel</code> to be a <code>BorderLayout</code>, then put your welcome text and <code>northtestpanel1</code> inside it, like this:</p>

<pre><code> northpanel -&gt; BorderLayout, JFrame's NORTH position
 welcome -&gt; northpanel NORTH position
 northpanel1 -&gt; FlowLayout, northpanel CENTER position
</code></pre>

<p>You may have problems about put <code>welcome</code> in the center (I'm just guessing, maybe it will working fine). If you don't have any solution to it, just wrap it into a new <code>JPanel</code> and use the <code>FlowLayout</code> with <code>FlowLayout.CENTER</code>.</p>
