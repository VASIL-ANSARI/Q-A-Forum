<p>I'm successfully using JadClipse with Eclipse 3.4</p>

<p>Eclipse 3.4.0.I20080617-2000<br>
JadClipse 3.3.0  </p>

<p>It just works!</p>

<p>EDIT:
Actually, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/122110/is-there-a-way-to-get-jadclipse-working-with-eclipse-3-4/224779#224779">OlegSOM's answer</a> below for the additional steps that you might need to remember to take, if like me you forget to read documentation sometimes!</p>
