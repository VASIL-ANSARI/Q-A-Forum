<p>If your constructor is not being inject with a class, you must tell Laravel what class will be used when it needs to instantiate a particular interface:</p>

<p>Put this in your filters or bindings file:</p>

<pre><code>App::bind('PlaneSaleing\Repositories\Advert\AdvertRepository', function()
{
    return new PlaneSaleing\Repositories\Advert\EloquentAdvert;
});
</code></pre>
