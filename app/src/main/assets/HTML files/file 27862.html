<p>Static methods are black boxes of functionality where you explicitly define everything going in (parameters) and out (return value). As such, they are not tied to an object - and you shouldn't call them using an object reference. <code>static_method()</code> should only ever be called using <code>HasStatic::static_method()</code>, or <code>self::static_method()</code> from within the <code>HasStatic</code> class.</p>

<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with static methods - I strongly disagree with tereÅ¡ko saying they should be avoided. If a method doesn't need an object's context, it may as well be static.</p>

<p>The parse error occurs because there's no reason to use the scope resolution operator (<code>::</code>) on a property. Variable class names do mean the following will work:</p>

<pre><code>$foo = 'HasStatic';
$foo::static_method(); // equivalent to HasStatic::static_method()
</code></pre>

<p>However that variable cannot be a property - you'll have to assign it to a temporary variable if you want to call the method in this way.</p>
