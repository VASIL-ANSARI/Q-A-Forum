<p>This is a typical communication problem error.
Before to connect, try to check the connectivity:</p>

<p>What is the instance port? default is 50000, but you did not specify one in the connect statement.</p>

<p>What is the ip address / hostname? if your case it seems it is 172.16.1.35</p>

<p>Try a telnet in that port</p>

<pre><code>telnet 172.16.1.35 50000
</code></pre>

<p>If you can establish a connection, you will get a message like this:</p>

<pre><code>Trying 172.16.1.35...
Connected to hostname.
Escape character is '^]'.
</code></pre>

<p>If you have connection problems, you will see </p>

<pre><code>Trying 172.16.1.35...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I see, you have to check the instance port, and the connection settings prior to execute your program.
There could be a firewall problem, have you checked the opened ports?
Try a netstat -nato in the server, to see if the DB2 instance is active and listening the port (currently unknown)</p>
