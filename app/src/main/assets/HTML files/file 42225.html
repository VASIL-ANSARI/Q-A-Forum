<p>If you want an up-to-date tally of all completed tasks, you can add a <code>then</code> to the point where you save the task:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.listWithTotal.$save(task).then(function() {
  $scope.tallyCount = $scope.listWithTotal.getTotal();
});
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>then</code> block executes after the task has saved and adds the tally of completed tasks to the current scope.</p>
