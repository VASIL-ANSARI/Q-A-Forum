<pre><code>txtEmailFrom.Text = "john@huno.com|james@domain1.com"
Dim brokened() As String
dim email as string
dim emailSplit() as string
brokened = Split(txtEmailFrom.Text, "|")

for email in brokened
   emailSplit = Split(email, "|")
   if emailSplit(1) = "domain1.com" then
      Console.WriteLine(email)
   end if
next
</code></pre>

<p>I am writing this without IDE &amp; this could be VB6 style.<br>
Hopefully, it should give you an idea of converting to VB.net</p>

<p>EDIT: Ofcourse, it will be better to add checks for array bounds before this line <code>if emailSplit(1) = ...</code>.</p>
