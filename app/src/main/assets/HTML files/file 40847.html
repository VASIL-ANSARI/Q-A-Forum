<p>This isn't a cross product; it is a recursive/hierarchical query.  Assuming that you have no cycles in the relationships, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>with cte as (
      select id, id as groupmember
      from table t
      where parent is not null
      union all
      select cte.id, t.id as groupmember
      from table t join
           cte
           on cte.parentid = t.id
    )
select *
from cte;
</code></pre>
