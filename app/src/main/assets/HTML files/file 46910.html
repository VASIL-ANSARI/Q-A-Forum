<p>You should use DataContract and DataMember attributes as below, so that you don't need to give property a same name and also you can follow coding standards.</p>

<pre><code>    [DataContract(Namespace = "")]
    public class YourClass
    {
        [DataMember(EmitDefaultValue = false, Name = "myVariable")]
        public string MyVariable { get; set; }
    }
</code></pre>
