<p>Due to my limited experience with webView; from the snipped of your code I cannot tell exactly what issues your code have, but I have some ideas on what MIGHT be happening.</p>

<p>I think your issues come from changes in API, if you want your app to work on target sdk version 17 and up add <strong>@JavascriptInterface</strong> right before the public method(or class) which you want to make available for webview (and which your compiler couldn't find on kitkat). You may find an example on the following link in Binding JavaScript code to Android code section: <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview.html" rel="nofollow">android webview guide</a>. This will run your code on newer versions, but you will get errors for earlier versions. If you want your app work for older and newer target sdk I would look into "Simon" answer on the following question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16380368/javascriptinterface-annotation-for-jelly-bean-and-below">JavascriptInterface annotation for JELLY_BEAN and below</a></p>

<p>If my previous suggestion doesn't work I would recommend either to post more code or to look into tutorial about changes in new version of Webview(starting from 19-kitkat) on the following link: <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/migrating.html" rel="nofollow">migrating to target sdk 19 and higher</a>. It describes the issues you might encounter in newer webView and how to fix them. </p>
