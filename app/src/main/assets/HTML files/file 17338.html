<p>While not in the UI itself, there is a way to do this that they have set up. You give them a domain mapping against the accept-language header (yes I do think it's best to use accept-language as all I'm going to change on the site is language and language dependent settings) and an engineer on their end will configure it to automatically redirect, at the Edge, to the right domain based on that header. Plus they'll give the guy a cookie to detect that they redirected him. That way if he uses the language selector or follows another language specific link it doesn't automatically redirect him again, but now lets him go where he wants - so it doesn't force the option on him.</p>

<p>Apparently the only down side is that if I need to change it then I have to go back through everything to get it fixed instead of being able to do it myself - unless I'm forgetting something.</p>
