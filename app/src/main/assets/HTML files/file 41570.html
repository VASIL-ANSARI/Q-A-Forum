<p>Everything looks fine except for the strong parameters</p>

<p>It should be <code>params.require(:found).permit(:floc, :ftitle, :fdescription, :fcontact)</code></p>

<p>You are telling Rails that the params coming in must have the <code>:found</code> key, nested under which are the params you actually care about. Of those parameters, only the ones that are permitted will get through. Params that are not permitted will not get through but not throw an error.</p>
