<p>There's nothing special about enums here. You'll see the exact same behaviour if you use strings or <em>any</em> type, basically.</p>

<p>Your two <code>Test</code> objects are entirely separate. When you write:</p>

<pre><code>t2.enumValue = TestEnum.THREE;
</code></pre>

<p>you're changing the value of the <code>enumValue</code> field within the second object to be a reference to the object referred to by <code>TestEnum.THREE</code>.</p>

<p>The two <code>enumValue</code> fields (one via <code>t1</code> and one via <code>t2</code>) are entirely separate. Changing one field doesn't change another.</p>

<p>Now, if instead you made your enum mutable (which I would <em>strongly</em> discourage) and changed your code to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>t2.enumValue.someMutableField = "a different value";
</code></pre>

<p>... then that <em>would</em> be visible via <code>t1.enumValue</code>, because they both refer to the same object.</p>

<p>It's really important to differentiate between changing a field within an instance of <code>Test</code>, and changing a field within an object that you happen to <em>reach</em> via an instance of <code>Test</code>.</p>

<p>Again, this really isn't about enums. You may well find it's simpler to get your head round the idea by changing the <code>enumValue</code> field to a <code>String</code> field, and experimenting that way.</p>
