<p>Have you thought about using a response file which is deployed to each of the test devices, or accessible via a central network location?</p>

<p>The response file could be read in and parsed in the setUp() method in your Espresso test to configure any parameters that you require for individual tests.</p>

<p>The format of the response file could be plain text or XML formatted.</p>

<p>If you have many test case classes for example ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2() you could create a base class that implements the parameter parsing and derive all your test classes from that.</p>
