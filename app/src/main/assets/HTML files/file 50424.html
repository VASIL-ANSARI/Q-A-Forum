<p>The following SQL statement gives you the latest timestamp/action per team:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT MAX(timestamp) as latestTimestamp, homeTeamId
  FROM test_results
  GROUP BY homeTeamId
</code></pre>

<p>It can be joined with the other 2 tables</p>

<pre><code>SELECT teamName, tt.userID, tt.timestamp AS signup, sponsorship, tr.latestTimestamp, stadium, win+draw+lose AS games 
FROM test_teams tt
INNER JOIN test_profile
  ON test_teams.userID = test_profile.userID
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT MAX(timestamp) as latestTimestamp, homeTeamId
  FROM test_results
  GROUP BY homeTeamId) tr 
  ON test_teams.userID = tr.homeTeamId 
</code></pre>
