<p>If your app is in a sea of icons anyway, everything starts to look the same.  I actually propose that you not bother with this, and create shortcuts on the desktop for them instead.  They can even have a "Steve H's apps" folder on the desktop with all shortcuts there.  When you deploy, have NSIS or IS or whatever installer you use create the shortcuts as well.</p>
