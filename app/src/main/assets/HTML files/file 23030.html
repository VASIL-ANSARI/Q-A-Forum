<p>when you are getting the foreground mask, are you setting a learningRate? In the java version of OpenCV that I'm using for an Android app, I produce the foreground mask as follows:</p>

<pre><code>subtractor.apply(mRgb, mFGMask, 0.1);
</code></pre>

<p>This learning rate of 0.1 works very quickly. I'm thinking that it takes 10 frames to completely dim my output mask to a black screen.</p>
