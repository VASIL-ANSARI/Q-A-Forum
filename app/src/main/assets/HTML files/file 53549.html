<p>You're looking at it the other way around. Notice that only your first element has a specific <code>top</code> property set to it:</p>

<pre><code>li:first-child a&gt;span{top:-5px}
</code></pre>

<p>The others do not.</p>

<p>Just align the others, and have the first one adjusted. </p>

<p>In this <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/seyenaz/ja37tkqc/1/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a> I gave a margin-top to all spans and removed the special treatment for the first child. Might only be working on this fiddle and your exact measurements might need some adjustments, if so correct the fiddle.</p>

<pre><code>span {
        color: black;
        position: absolute;
        background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);
        display: none;
        padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;
        border-radius: 3px;
        vertical-align: middle;
        margin-top: -8px;
}
</code></pre>
