<p>I can't quite tell but I think you want to know how to launch another activity called <code>SearchByCode</code> from your current activity.</p>

<p>To do this you need to create an Intent object, optionally add flags or bundles to the intent, then call <code>startActivity(Intent)</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a code sample:</p>

<pre><code>Intent i = new Intent(this, SearchByCode.class)
i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP)
startActivity(i);
</code></pre>
