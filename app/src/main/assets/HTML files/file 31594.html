<p>Looks like you store a dictionary in a stringified version in a text file and then fail to parse it properly because on saving you remove vital information (where values start and end for example).</p>

<p>I propose to use a library for keeping the values intact.  You should consider using JSON for a task like this then you won't have to parse everything yourself and can still read the test file:</p>

<pre><code>import json

# store your value:
with open('file.txt', 'w') as outFile:
  json.dump(dWord, outfile)

# read your value:
with open('file.txt') as inFile:
  dword = json.load(inFile)
</code></pre>
