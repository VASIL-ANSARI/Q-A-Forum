<p>In any case you need a variable to store the state of your menu i.e., big or small.</p>

<p>If you want to do it with PHP you can use session variables and use ajax to update that value when the menu is resized.</p>

<p>OR you can set a cookie with Javascript for the same purpose. I would go for this option.</p>

<p>Either way you will need to check the value of the cookie / session var and change the class of your menu depending on it.</p>

<p>---EDIT---</p>

<p>Or as our respectful fellow programmer says, it might be a good idea to use localStorage since the information doesn't need to be sent to the server.</p>
