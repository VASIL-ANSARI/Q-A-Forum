<p>Often people don't tell their server to the the browser that the JSON string they are sending is to be interpreted as a json object. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that <code>dataType:'json'</code> is supposed to sort it out, it is not always the case. </p>

<p>in PHP</p>

<pre><code>header("Content-type: application/json");
</code></pre>

<p>ASP</p>

<pre><code>Response.AddHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
</code></pre>

<p>Failing that, </p>

<pre><code>success: function(data){
    if (typeof data!='object') data=$.parseJSON(data); // make sure it's an object
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out why jQuery doesn't fix it but the response headers, even with dataType:'json' set can appear as <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8</code> and the object doesn't get created.</p>
