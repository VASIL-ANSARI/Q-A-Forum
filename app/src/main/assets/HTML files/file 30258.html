<p>It all depends on how 'safe' you want to make things. Just because your parameter specifies that a protocol is required doesn't actually mean that the passed instance implements that protocol. All the compiler requires is for you to promise that it does when calling (a cast).</p>

<p>Generally, if you're writing all of the code then it is relatively 'safe' to just use the protocol and not check at runtime.</p>

<p>If other people are using the code, and in particular if you are releasing the code as a library or something like that then checking becomes much more prudent as you can't make any assumptions about what other people are going to do. In this case it is much better to fail early.</p>
