  <p>Why is that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Characters aren't the same as strings. A string is a <em>sequence</em> of characters. The type of <code>expression[i]</code> is <code>char</code>, not <code>string</code> - so you want to compare it with a <code>char</code> literal:</p>

<pre><code>if (expression[i] == ')')
</code></pre>

<p>Note the single quotes (<code>')'</code>) instead of the double quotes you were using (<code>")"</code>). Single quotes are used for character literals; double quotes are used for string literals.</p>
