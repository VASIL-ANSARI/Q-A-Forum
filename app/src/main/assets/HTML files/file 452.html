<p>DataViz offers a program for PalmOS called <a href="http://www.dataviz.com/products/smartlisttogo/index.html" rel="nofollow">SmartListToGo</a>. It hasn't been updated in a while, but if you're basically collecting data, you can design forms/tables with minimal programming knowledge. I've used it to keep track of mileage/car repairs. I've also used it to keep track of health insurance invoices.</p>

<p>It's not open source, and it actually hasn't had an update of significance in a while. You can even write plugins for it if you are unable to get what you need out of the basic functionality.</p>
