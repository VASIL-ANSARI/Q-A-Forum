<p>You could get it by defining its full path like below:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.Partial("~/Views/Shared/_StatisticsPartialView.cshtml")
</code></pre>

<p>Or Alternately</p>

<pre><code>@{ Html.RenderPartial("~/Views/Shared/_StatisticsPartialView.cshtml"); }
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps !!</p>

<p>Edit: As per the new change you must have to pass the correct model as the currently its getting <code>LogModelVM</code> so use instead below:</p>

<pre><code>@{Html.RenderPartial("_StatisticsPartialView", new ASD.Models.StatisticsModel());}
</code></pre>
