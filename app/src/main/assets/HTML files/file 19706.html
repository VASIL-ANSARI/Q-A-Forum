<p>If you want to avoid fixing button size, then I would recommend using different layout than <code>TableLayout</code>, maybe <code>RelativeLayout</code> and <code>TextViews</code> with property <code>alignBaseline</code> or <code>LinearLayout</code> with <code>weight</code> properties could do the trick.</p>
