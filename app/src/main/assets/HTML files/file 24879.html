<p>After a day of going trough the osmdroid sources, i managed to resolve my problems, but haven't found why are they there in the first place. Osmdroid uses an ISafeCanvas interface (and SafeTranslatedCanvas implementation) to wrap a canvas to deal with some high zoom level translate glitches. While I haven't found any straightforward errors in the code, I bypassed the mechanics when drawing my overlays by overriding the ItemizedOverlay's draw method and making my own ISafeCanvas implementation, which only returns the encapsulated canvas in it's getSafeCanvas method, and now everything looks fine.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void draw(Canvas canvas, MapView mv, boolean shadow) {
    drawSafe(new MyCanvas(canvas),mv,shadow);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is far from a best solution, the SafeCanvas is there for a reason, so I suggest a thorough testing  if using this method.</p>

<p>Note: I used only Android 4.1.1, and don't know if this issue is present on other devices.</p>
