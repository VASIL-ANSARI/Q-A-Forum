<p>You can use <code>window.onload</code>:</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function() {
    myFunction();
}
</code></pre>

<p>as soon as the URL has loaded <code>myFunction</code> will execute, but unless some kind of <em>bad</em> server side logic is used, you can not tell a page to execute some arbitrary JavaScript after it has loaded without the page knowing of it.</p>
