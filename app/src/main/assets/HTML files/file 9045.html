<p>The easiest way to do this that would be portable across different platforms would be to just generate stereo audio where the audio is only on the left or right channel, i.e. set all the sample values for the unwanted channel to 0. That way you don't need to worry about manipulating the audio APIs or output hardware on any given platform.</p>
