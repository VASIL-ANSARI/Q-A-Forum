<p>Take a look at <a href="http://simjs.com/random.html" rel="nofollow">SIM.JS random library</a>. It has normal and triangular distributions, while discrete can be simulated using special algorithms like Alastair Walker's method described in his paper "An efficient method for generating discrete random variables with general distributions" (through it seems to be unavailable for public access).</p>
