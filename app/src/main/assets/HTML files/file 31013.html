<p>As noted in the comments, the following command provides more information:</p>

<pre><code>valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all -v ./testLeaks
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you cut out the end of the short output:</p>

<pre><code>==3005== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 2 from 2).
</code></pre>

<p>Either way, it is very likely that it is not a bug in QApplication itself, but some underlying dependency, especially you mentioned that it would happen after a <code>libc</code> update.</p>

<p>I have had several problems with <code>libc</code> and other low-level library where you would think they do not leak memory, and you are surprised in the end of the day.</p>

<p>This could be easily checked by writing an example using that library.</p>

<p>However, since it is just about 320K+ and Qt applications (especially GUI) will require a lot more, I would not consider this as a non-negligible amount.</p>
