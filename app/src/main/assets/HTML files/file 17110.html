<p>I believe there is confusion about the need for credentials to remain "private" in the sense of not broadcasting the information, and the terminology used for OO accessibility "private" in the sense of type scope. The two are not interchangeable and are completely separate ideas.</p>

<p>Your solution of trying to secure sensitive information using C# type accessibility is nonsensical and is definitely the wrong way to go. I would perhaps ask another question about how best to protect sensitive information during user log-in.

<p>I assume that <code>SessionData</code> is a nested class? You cannot have private classes defined in namespaces.</p>

<p>If you define a private nested class, only the type that contains this private class will be able to use it, regardless of constructor accessibility.</p>

<p>So really, if you want to expose <code>SessionData</code>, make it public.</p>

<p>If the code is all in the same assembly, you could also make <code>SessionData</code> internal:</p>

<pre><code>internal class SessionData { }
</code></pre>

<p>Code outside of this assembly will not be able to reference <code>SessionData</code>.</p>
