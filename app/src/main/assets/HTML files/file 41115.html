<p>If I understood your problem correctly you want to find the index of items from pages that is at minimum position in <code>lst</code>(taking duplicates in consideration).</p>

<p>So, for this you need to first reverse the list and then first the index of each item in pages in lst, if item is not found then return negative Infinity. Out of those indices you can find the max item and you'll get your answer.</p>

<pre><code>from functools import partial

pages = [1,3,5,9]
lst = [1,2,5,3,6,3,5,1,2,9,3,2]

def get_index(seq, i):
    try:
        return seq.index(i)
    except ValueError:
        return float('-inf')


lst.reverse()
print max(pages, key=partial(get_index, lst))
#5
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Note that the above method will take quadratic time, so it won't perform well for huge lists. If you're not concerned with some additional memory but linear time then you can use set and dict for this:</p>

<pre><code>pages_set = set(pages)
d = {}
for i, k in enumerate(reversed(lst), 1):
    if k not in d and k in pages_set:
        d[k] = len(lst) - i

print min(d, key=d.get)
#5
</code></pre>
