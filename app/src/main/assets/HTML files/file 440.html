<p>Are you running this over Rails? If so, it's not RSpec's initialization that's slow, it's Rails'. Rails has to initialize the entire codebase <em>and yours</em> before running the specs. Well, it doesn't <em>have</em> to, but it does. RSpec runs pretty fast for me under my small non-rails projects.</p>
