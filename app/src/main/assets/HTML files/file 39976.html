<p>If ORG_NO is within the RF_MERCHANT_ORG table (using aliases consistently would help there) then acting like an inner join would then would be the correct result for the SQL being used.</p>

<p>The join should be this to make it act like a proper left join:</p>

<pre><code>LEFT OUTER JOIN RF_MERCHANT_ORG MO ON ROW_SEG.DEPT_NO = MO.DEPT_NO AND MO.ORG_NO = 100
</code></pre>
