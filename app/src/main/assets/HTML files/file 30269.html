<p>Placing a variable declaration together with an initialiser in the class declaration dies not actually constitute a definition. You can get away without the definition as long as you only ever take it's value and never try to use it as a reference.</p>

<p>'find' takes a reference to the value as an argument. This means you need an actual variable defined somewhere to take a reference to it.</p>
