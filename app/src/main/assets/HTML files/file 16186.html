<p>You are going in the right direction but you haven't mentioned , which delegate method you are trying to make changes in.
you can have your javascript in a .js file as you might make changes to it later and it will be really cumbersome to reflect the changes through code (instead of a js file).Try Using this :-</p>

<p>you have to load the HTML into the view with the correct baseURL parameter to use relative paths or files in UIWebView.</p>

<pre><code>NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath]; 
NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:path];     
[webView loadHTMLString:htmlString baseURL:baseURL]; 
</code></pre>

<p>baseURL accepts an NSURL object as the file reference.You can specify a local URL or a web one as your needs leads you to.Append the css file in <code>webViewDidFinishLoad:(UIWebView *)webView</code> as you have done.</p>

<p>NOTE:-Select the .js file and uncheck the bullseye column indicating it as compiled code.(You will just get a warning if you don't).</p>
