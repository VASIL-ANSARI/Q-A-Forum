<p>I have shortly examined the behavior of your gears in the Mozilla and Chrome browser. (Lovely design, by the way :-) )</p>

<p>In my opinion, the gears stick to the size of your <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> box. This means, if you allow this box to "resize" if the browser zooms in and out, the gears adopt. By setting your <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> to 0,0/100%,100%, the gears cannot adopt.</p>

<p>You have this <code>.limit.tight</code> definition, which is a good sample for how the gear box should behave. So if I alter .my-svg like accordingly this:  </p>

<pre><code>.my-svg {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  max-width: 960px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't change anything else. It works also with Chrome. Here is how the gears appear if I zoom with Mozilla:</p>

<p>I hope this is at last a good start, even if there could be more work for more browsers.</p>
