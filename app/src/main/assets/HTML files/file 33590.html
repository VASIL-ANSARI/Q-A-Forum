<p>This code must be fixed:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; size; ++i)
    autre.table[i] = new Person(*array[i]);
</code></pre>

<p><code>table</code> has fixed size, and it's filled with null-pointers. In your loop, you don't check if the element to be copied is a null-pointer, so you derefence it and try to copy the entity which even doesn't exist.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; size; ++i) {
    if(array[i] != NULL) {
        autre.table[i] = new Person(*array[i]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>PS: It's better to use <code>nullptr</code> instead of <code>NULL</code>.</p>
