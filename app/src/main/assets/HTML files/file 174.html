<p>You are correct, if you use BufferedReader for reading HTTP content and headers you will want InputStreamReader so you can read byte for byte. </p>

<p>BufferedReader in this scenario sometimes does weird things...escpecially when it comes to reading HTTP POST headers, sometimes you will be unable to read the POST data, if you use the InputStreamReader you can read the content length and read that many bytes...</p>
