<p>RequireJS chose a somewhat unreliable, disconnected mechanism for catching errors. It uses a timer to see if what it expected to get it got. Some other AMD loaders use other, more direct mechanisms to detect error conditions during loading.</p>

<p>My preferred AMD loader is <a href="https://github.com/cujojs/curl" rel="nofollow">CurlJS</a>, which is hard-wired to catch the loading / parsing errors.</p>

<p>Because of the architectural choice it is more reliably detecting error conditions and you can attach error handlers directly to each <code>require</code> call. If stuff like error catching is important to you, I strongly suggest looking at CurlJS.</p>
