<p>You can't post a file <strong>and</strong> a form data as x=y&amp;w=z.
They are two different Content Types.</p>

<p>For x=y you should use a content-type like this: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</p>

<p>I suggest you to split your AJAX request in two different or insert these data into the url: myUrl + 'query.php?x=y'.</p>
