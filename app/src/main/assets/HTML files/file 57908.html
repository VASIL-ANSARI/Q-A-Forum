<p>The problem is the test target that comes with the library. In C and C++ you usual have a dedicated command line executable that runs a test suite. On OSX there is target type for that called <em>Command Line Tool</em>. Xcode references target types with a reverse DNS identifier, in this case <code>com.apple.product-type.tool</code>. On iOS you do not have a target type for command line tools because, well, there is no <em>public</em> command line that you could run the executable from.</p>

<p>That being said, you have already found the solution yourself: deactivate the test target generation in CMake for that library if you want to build for iOS.</p>
