<p>You seem to have just not understood how expressions work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the findInventoryItem method's data type is an object, how do I get the quantity of the object to be returned as an integer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>findInventoryItem does return an object, but we then call <code>getQuantity()</code> on that object, which (presumably) returns an integer. As a result, the expression you have evaluates to an int.</p>

<p>The code you have at the moment is really just a shorthand for:</p>

<pre><code>WhateverThatObjectClassIs item = findInventoryItem(partNumber);
item.getQuantity();
</code></pre>

<p>Now (hopefully) you can see that all you need to do is assign the result of your expression to a variable:</p>

<pre><code>int quantity = findInventoryItem(partNumber).getQuantity();
</code></pre>

<p>And you're done.</p>
