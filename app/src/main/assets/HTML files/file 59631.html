<p>My money would be on you not comparing the two class files correctly. I'd bet that you're writing something like this in your bash-like prompt:</p>

<pre><code>md5sum Main.class Main$1.class
</code></pre>

<p>(or some checksumming tool other than <code>md5sum</code>)</p>

<p>This is actually substituting the variable called <code>1</code> in the string - unless you've got that variable defined, that variable is empty, so that is expanding to:</p>

<pre><code>md5sum Main.class Main.class
</code></pre>

<p>which will show as the same file contents.</p>

<p>Try single-quoting the second string:</p>

<pre><code>md5sum Main.class 'Main$1.class'
</code></pre>
