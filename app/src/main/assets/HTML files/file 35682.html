<p>When using ksoap2 you don't have to handle the serialization yourself. If you want to add an entry to the xml like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;tag&gt;string&lt;/tag&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you just have to call this when constructing the <code>SoapObject</code> you are sending to the server:</p>

<pre><code>soapObject.addProperty("tag", "string");
</code></pre>

<p>Also modifying the requestDump is never a good idea. This output is just for debug purposes. That's the reason why you have to set <code>transport.debug = true;</code> for the requestDump or responseDump to even appear. As I said above just use the <code>addProperty()</code> and <code>addSoapObject()</code> methods to construct your request.  </p>
