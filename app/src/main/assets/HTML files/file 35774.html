<p>This is covered in the users guide. You are attempting to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Serializing-and-Deserializing-Collection-with-Objects-of-Arbitrary-Types" rel="nofollow">deserialize a collection of arbitrary types</a> </p>

<p>As noted there, you have 3 options:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Option 1: Use Gson's parser API (low-level streaming parser or the DOM
  parser JsonParser) to parse the array elements and then  use
  Gson.fromJson() on each of the array elements.This is the preferred
  approach. </p>
  
  <p>Option 2: Register a type adapter for Collection.class that looks at
  each of the array members and maps them to appropriate objects. The
  disadvantage of this approach is that it will screw up deserialization
  of other collection types in Gson.</p>
  
  <p>Option 3: Register a type adapter for MyCollectionMemberType and use
  fromJson with Collection&lt;MyCollectionMemberType> This approach is
  practical only if the array appears as a top-level element or if you
  can change the field type holding the collection to be of type
  Collection&lt;MyCollectionMemberType>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a difficult problem when talking about automatic deserialization. In addition, option 3 isn't possible in your case as you're using <code>Object</code> rather than having <code>Dog</code> and <code>Cat</code> inherit from some base class (e.g. <code>Animal</code>). </p>

<p>On top of that ... you're doing something very odd with that array of Objects, sticking <code>String</code>s in it as well. Overall, if that's some response you yourself are generating ... I'd seriously rethink how you're approaching that. </p>
