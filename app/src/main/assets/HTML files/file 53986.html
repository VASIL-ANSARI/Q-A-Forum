<p>The callbacks for your Firebase listeners are indeed executed on the main UI thread. </p>

<p>If you need to do heavy operations in a callback, spin up an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html"><code>AsyncTask</code></a> and do the work there. The <code>AsyncTask.doInBackground()</code> method executes on a different thread, so it won't block the Android UI. But <code>AsyncTask. onPostExecute()</code> executes on the main thread again, so you can update your UI views from there.</p>
