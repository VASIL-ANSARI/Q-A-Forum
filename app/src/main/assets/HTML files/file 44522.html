<p>Depends on the version of the standard you are consulting.</p>

<p>N3337 [dcl.fct.def.default]/p2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An explicitly-defaulted function [...] may have an explicit
  <em>exception-specification</em> only if it is compatible (15.4) with the <em>exception-specification</em> on the implicit declaration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which renders your original code ill-formed.</p>

<p>This was changed by <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html#1778">CWG issue 1778</a> to read (N4296 [dcl.fct.def.default]/p3):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a function that is explicitly defaulted is declared with an
  <em>exception-specification</em> that is not compatible (15.4) with the exception specification on the implicit declaration, then</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>if the function is explicitly defaulted on its first declaration, it is defined as deleted;</li>
  <li>otherwise, the program is ill-formed.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>which means that the constructor is now merely defined as deleted. (The above wording incorporated changes made by <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4285.html">N4285</a>, a post-C++14 paper making some cleanup changes intended to be purely editorial. The N3936 version is substantively the same.)</p>

<p>Presumably GCC implements CWG1778's resolution, while Clang doesn't.</p>
