<p>This is the way I have been using it. It is just a basic concept but you will get an idea. For my case I was using it with constants.</p>

<pre><code>UIView.animate(withDuration: duration, animations: { 

   // Your changes to the UI, eg. moving UIImageView up 300 points

   }) { (success) in

        // This executes when animation is completed
        // Create another animation here. It starts when previous ends

        UIView.animate(withDuration: duration2, animations: { 

            // Your changes to the UI

            }, completion: { (success) in

                  // This executes when animation is completed

            })

})
</code></pre>

<p>Also check other frameworks that could help you, there are a few good ones. I tried <a href="https://github.com/suguru/Cheetah" rel="nofollow">Cheetah</a> which supports chaining animations and works really well.</p>

<p>Just ask if you have any questions.</p>
