<p>I think your best bet is to add a new calculated column which converts the varchar(10) to an int, and sort on that.</p>

<pre><code>myDataTable.Columns.Add("Sorter", typeof(System.Int32), "Convert(TextColumn, 'System.Int32')");
</code></pre>

<p>This will throw exceptions when the string in your varchar column (which I've referred to as "TextColumn" in the code above), but you may be able to work around that using an Iif() function call in the expression.</p>
