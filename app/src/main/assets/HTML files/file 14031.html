<p>An object can be created in any suitable aligned storage using placement new:</p>

<pre><code>void* storage = get_aligned_shared_memory();
T* object = new (storage) T();
</code></pre>

<p>That said â have you considered using a library such as <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/interprocess.html">Boost.Interprocess</a> for this.</p>
