<p>I think you are missing a drawer with id <code>drawer_layout</code> in your <code>activity_log_workout</code> layout.</p>

<p>In order for this approach to work, you must have a DrawerLayout with id <code>drawer_layout</code> in all your activity layouts that should have the drawer.</p>

<p>I also noticed something peculiar with your code. In every activity that extends <code>DashboardActivity</code> you are first setting <code>setContentView(R.id.activity_dashboard)</code>, then calling <code>onCreateDrawer()</code>, then you are changing the content view and creating the drawer again. I think this a very suboptimal approach.</p>

<p>I suggest you create a <code>BaseDrawerActivity</code> class to encapsulate the drawer creation and UI binding logic. Then you just extend it in the activities where you need a drawer. You can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class BaseDrawerActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    // move all your drawer related fields here

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate();

        setContentView(getLayoutResId());

        // the same method you have right now
        onCreateDrawer();
    }


    /*
     * Extending activities use this class to supply the 
     * id of their layout file. This way you can set the view 
     * only once and there is no need to create the drawer twice.
     */
    @LayoutResId
    public abstract int getLayoutResId();

}
</code></pre>
