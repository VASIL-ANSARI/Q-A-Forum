<p>couldn't you return yesVotes/5 as an integer, essentially giving you 1 vote for every 5.</p>

<pre><code>int voteWeighting = 5;    
return (int)yesVotes/voteWeighting;
</code></pre>

<p>if you're looking for when to print it then the generic fizz buzz solution would fix it. </p>

<pre><code>int printWeighting = 5;
if (yesVotes%printWeighting ==0)
{
//print stuff here
}
</code></pre>

<p>this works by using the modulus function "a%b" it will return the remainder when you divide a by b and as such return a number less than "b" but greater or equal to zero. as such if you only ever increment by 1 the number, then when a mod b is 0 you have incremented b times.</p>
