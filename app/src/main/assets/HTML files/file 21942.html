<p>You probably need to enforce data integrity not only on INSERT into Table B, but also on UPDATE and DELETE in both tables.</p>

<p>Anyway options are:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key" rel="nofollow">FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT</a> on Table B</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_trigger" rel="nofollow">TRIGGER</a>s on both tables</li>
<li>As a last resort if for some reason 1 and 2 is not an option <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure" rel="nofollow">STORED PROCEDURE</a>s for all insert, delete update operations for both tables</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>preferred</strong> way to go in most cases is FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT.</p>
