<p>A kind of versioning by date ranges is a common method for records in Enterprise applications. As an example we have a table for business entities (us) or companies (uk) and we keep the current official name in another table as follows:</p>

<pre><code>CompanyID    Name            ValidFrom     ValidTo
12           Business Lld    2000-01-01    2008-09-23
12           Business Inc    2008-09-23    NULL
</code></pre>

<p>The null in the last record means that this is current one. You may use the above logic and possibly add more columns to gain more control. This way there are no duplicates, you can keep the history up to any level and synchronize the current values across tables easily. Finally the performance will be great. </p>
