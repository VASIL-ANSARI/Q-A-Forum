<p>It's not strictly necessary according to the spec, but it is a good idea. </p>

<p>If you don't, what <em>should</em> happen is when the object goes away the connection point should release your event sink interface anyway. However if the connection point is badly implemented they may forget to do that, then your sink object will never be destroyed. </p>

<p>If you call <code>Unadvise</code>, that's one less mistake for other people to make.</p>

<p>It's also one less mistake for you to make: If someone else is holding on to an object reference, then it won't go away when you release it, so you will continue to get events, which you probably won't expect to happen, so may well cause further errors.</p>
