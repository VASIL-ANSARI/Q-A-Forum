<p>I would assume that <code>Servicios</code> has <code>DateTime</code> property which is not being set.</p>

<p><code>DateTime</code>s are not nullable, and when they're not set, they default to <code>{1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM}</code>.</p>

<p>Upon calling <code>db.SubmitChanges()</code>, you're attempting to insert a value into a <code>DateTime</code> column which is a lower value that SQL SERVER supports as seen in your exception.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SqlDateTime overflow. Must be between 1/1/1753 12:00:00 AM and 12/31/9999 11:59:59 PM.</p>
