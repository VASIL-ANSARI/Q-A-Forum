<p>Passing by reference is pretty much the same as C++, meaning you can modify the variable value in the caller. But just like in C++ you still couldn't change the value later unless you stored a pointer to pointer.</p>

<p>In your code you are storing the object, not a reference to the variable so you have to call a removal method to actually remove the value from your array. Editing a variable does nothing for any other reference to that object.</p>

<p>You could of course have an object that contains this delegate. Then if you modify that outer object the inner delegate in the stack also becomes null, but it adds another layer of indirection and is messier than just calling a removal method. </p>
