<p>In this case, you don't need to do more, and you can also use the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers">shoulda-matchers</a> gem to make your code really clean :</p>

<pre><code>it { should belong_to(:organization) }
it { should have_many(:key_performance_intervals) }

it { should validate_presence_of(:name) }
it { should validate_presence_of(:target) }
it { should validate_presence_of(:organization_id) }
</code></pre>

<p>And this is it.</p>

<p>You don't need <code>FactoryGirl</code> in this case, which is used to create valid and re-usable objects. But you could use factories in your model test. A simple example :</p>

<p>Your factory :</p>

<pre><code>FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :user do
    first_name "John"
    last_name  "Doe"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Your test :</p>

<pre><code>it "should be valid with valid attributes" do  
  user = FactoryGirl.create(:user)
  user.should be_valid
end
</code></pre>

<p>Check the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md">Factory Girl documentation</a> to have more informations.</p>
