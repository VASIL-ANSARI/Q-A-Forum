<p>there are a few options, you could use the attribute <code>[AllowHtml]</code> and then check for html server side, and then add model state errors and return, or you could also use a hidden field, and encode it so that the <code>&lt;</code> becomes <code>&amp;lt;</code> a few other options are listed <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/81991/a-potentially-dangerous-request-form-value-was-detected-from-the-client">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3621272/allow-user-to-input-html-in-asp-net-mvc">here</a> on the validation part.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking at <code>HtmlEncode</code>, as there may or may not be a legitimate case for someone to write &lt; or > in a field.</p>
