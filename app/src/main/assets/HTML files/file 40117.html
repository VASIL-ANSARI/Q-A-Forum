<p><strong>Update</strong><br>
As AndersNS was kind to point out, it will be available in RC1 most likely: <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/536" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/536</a>.</p>

<p>To put it simply there's no <code>OutputCache</code> or equivalent in <code>ASP.NET 5</code> currently.</p>

<p>However, please note that <code>OutputCache</code> is just an attribute with minimal logic that talks to a cache provider. You can easily implement your own such <code>attribute</code>, using <code>Memory Cache</code> for example. Or you can use third party solutions.</p>

<p>I am sure that when <code>ASP.NET 5</code> will ship there will be plenty of solutions out on the market. And I'm quite sure that we will have an official <code>OutputCache</code> equivalent too.</p>

<p>Here's the basic <code>MemoryCache</code> usage in case someone finds it useful</p>

<pre><code>MemoryCache cache = MemoryCache.Default;
string cacheName = "MyCache";

if (cache.Contains(cacheName) == false || cache[cacheName] == null)
{
    var data = ... get data

    cache.Set(cacheName, data, new CacheItemPolicy() { SlidingExpiration = DateTime.Now.AddDays(1).TimeOfDay });
}

return cache[cacheName];
</code></pre>
