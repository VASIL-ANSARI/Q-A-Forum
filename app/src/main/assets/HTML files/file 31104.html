<p>Turns out no DOCTYPE name literally means, I had not named my DOCTYPE.</p>

<p>I had</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Where I should have had</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Normally this would not cause a problem but since I was trying to output XML data everything has to be perfect in the Document Tree.</p>
