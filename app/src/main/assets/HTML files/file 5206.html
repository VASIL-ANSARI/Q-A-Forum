<p>Geocoding doesnt work on the emulator on API 8, I dont know why, but it just doesnt, run in on a API7 emulator, if it works there it should work on a real 2.2 device. </p>

<p>I had this exact same problem not so long ago, runs fine on the device (nexus one &amp; G2), does nothing on the emulator.</p>
