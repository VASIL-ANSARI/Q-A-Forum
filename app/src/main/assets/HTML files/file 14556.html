<p>You have a circular dependency between the headers. A includes B and B includes A, but B <em>doesn't</em> really include A because <code>#pragma once</code> was already evaluated for A. (It would be the same with a standard header guard.)</p>

<p>Because the inner inclusion is ignored, it's as if it were never there at all, and you need the forward declaration.</p>
