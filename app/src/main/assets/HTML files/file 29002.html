<p>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To%3a-Require-admin-to-activate-account-before-sign_in" rel="nofollow">Devise Wiki Page on Approvals</a> for the initial set-up of an approval process, which will notify you (or whomever you choose) when new users have registered via an <code>AdminMailer</code> mailer.</p>

<p>Then, by making use of a <code>before_create</code> callback, you can check your custom validations ie:</p>

<pre><code>def approved_via_linked_in?
    # perform logic here...
end
</code></pre>

<p>And, you can set a condition on the email message which would send from your <code>AdminMailer</code> to only send if the user has not been approved yet by your custom validations.</p>
