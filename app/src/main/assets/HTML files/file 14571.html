<p><em>Edit: This answer is for <code>ActionLink</code>. You can still use the parameters to invoke actions (which are invoked directly when you use <code>Html.Action</code>)</em></p>

<p>You can just pass them (as you did in the example). All parameters which are not found in the route are used as query string parameters.</p>

<p>You can catch all of them in another action.</p>

<p>Note that all values should be correct C# declarations, so to pass the second parameter as a string you need to use double quotes (as in regular C# code):</p>

<pre><code>@Html.Action("StringName","ActionName","Controller",new{id=param1,name="param2"})
</code></pre>
