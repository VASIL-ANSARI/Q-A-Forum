<p>I had the same problem when I wanted to load some more content  when the page scrolled to the bottom.</p>

<p>I resolved it by adding an empty element at the bottom of the page (after the last loaded content) and checked if it is visible or by this command:</p>

<pre><code>if($("#LoadIndicator")[0].getBoundingClientRect().bottom &lt; window.innerHeight + 50)
{
    //Processing...
}
</code></pre>

<p>LoadIndicator is the ID of the element, and I considered 50 pixels as the distance to the bottom of the page to load next content.</p>

<p>Hope it help </p>
