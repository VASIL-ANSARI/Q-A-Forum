<p>The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.readdir.php" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for this function explains what you're looking for:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns the name of the next entry in the directory. The entries are
  returned in the order in which they are stored by the filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And depending on the filesystem, the files might retain the order in which they were created (FAT); might be sorted alphabetically (NTFS); might be sorted according to their position in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" rel="nofollow">hash table</a> (ext4); or various other ways.</p>

<p>If you need files in a specific order look at <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.scandir.php" rel="nofollow">scandir</a> which takes a parameter that specifies the sort order.</p>
