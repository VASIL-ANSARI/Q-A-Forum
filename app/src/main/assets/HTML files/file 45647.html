<p>This will hopefully become clear when you read it piece by piece:</p>

<pre><code>new        int *             [5]
^^^        ^^^^^             ^^^
give me    pointers to int   and five of those.
</code></pre>

<p>Then you safe the address of the first of the new pointers in <code>arr</code> and thus have an dynamically allocated array of five pointers.</p>

<p>Note that "in the real world" (i.e. if no teacher/prof forbids you to) you would use an <code>std::vector</code> instead of <code>new[]</code>.</p>
