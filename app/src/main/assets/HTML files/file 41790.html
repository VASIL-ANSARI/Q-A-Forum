<p>I have used google and the very first page that came up had a very nice diagram which pretty much describes all you need/want to know. Next time its worth trying google for these type of questions. </p>

<p>1) New</p>

<p>The thread is in new state if you create an instance of Thread class but before the invocation of start() method.</p>

<p>2) Runnable</p>

<p>The thread is in runnable state after invocation of start() method, but the thread scheduler has not selected it to be the running thread.</p>

<p>3) Running</p>

<p>The thread is in running state if the thread scheduler has selected it.</p>

<p>4) Timed waiting </p>

<p>Timed waiting is a thread state for a thread waiting with a specified waiting time. A thread is in the timed waiting state due to calling one of the following methods with a specified positive waiting time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thread.sleep(sleeptime)</li>
<li>Object.wait(timeout)</li>
<li>Thread.join(timeout)</li>
<li>LockSupport.parkNanos(timeout)</li>
<li>LockSupport.parkUntil(timeout)</li>
</ul>

<p>5) Non-Runnable (Blocked)</p>

<p>This is the state when the thread is still alive, but is currently not eligible to run.</p>

<p>6) Terminated</p>

<p>A thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits.</p>

<p>Hopefully this answers your question :). </p>

<p><strong>Parking:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disables the current thread for thread scheduling purposes unless the
  permit is available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Threads are being parked or suspended if you like to call it this way because it does not have a permission to execute. Once permission is granted the thread will be unparked and execute. </p>

<p>Permits of LockSupport are associated with threads (i.e. permit is given to a particular thread) and doesn't accumulate (i.e. there can be only one permit per thread, when thread consumes the permit, it disappears).</p>
