<p>Issues with your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>You never give the startRace JButton an ActionListener, so how is button going to have any affect, and how is the race ever going to start? Note that you're adding the StartRace ActionListener object to the stopRace JButton, and I'm guessing that this was done in error.</li>
<li>Even if you added that Listener to the startRace button, the action listener will only advance all the horses one "step" and no more -- there are no loops in within your background threads to perform actions repetitively. </li>
<li>You seem to be creating new Horse2D objects needlessly. Why not simply advance the location of the existing Horse2D object?</li>
<li>Myself, I'd use a single Swing Timer rather than a bunch of Threads in order to simplify the code.</li>
</ul>
