<p>If you really want to do it without the <em>/</em> operator and im guessing probably without shifting either the simplest loop method would be to count the number of times you need to subtract ans2 from ans1 without the remainder going below ans1.</p>

<p><strong>Pseudo code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>numtimes init at 0
counter init at ans1
while counter is greater than ans2
    subtract ans2 from counter
    numtimes increase by 1

check numtimes
</code></pre>
