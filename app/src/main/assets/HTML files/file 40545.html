<p>According to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html" rel="nofollow">the MySQL <code>GRANT</code> documentation</a>, wildcard characters <code>_</code> and <code>%</code> need to be backslash-escaped to be used as literals in the database name.  In your attempt at the top, you have escaped one <code>_</code> as <code>\_</code> but not the other.  If you do escape both underscores, you can achieve correct grants.  The trick though, is that you must <em>also</em> escape them later when issuing the <code>GRANT</code> statement as the <code>creator</code> user to the <code>test</code> user:</p>

<p>Login as root (or a fully privileged user):</p>

<pre><code>-- As root:
GRANT CREATE USER, CREATE ON *.* TO 'creator'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
-- Escape both underscores here
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `my\_prefix\_%`.* TO 'creator'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
</code></pre>

<p>Login as <code>creator</code>:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `my_prefix_test`;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
CREATE USER 'test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- Issue the GRANT but escape the underscores.
-- because creator@localhost does not have permission to grant on 
-- a pattern like myXprefixXtest, as the unescaped _ wildcards would allow
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `my\_prefix\_test`.* TO 'test'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>Login as <code>test</code>, the grant works:</p>

<pre><code>USE my_prefix_test;
CREATE TABLE t (id INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>
