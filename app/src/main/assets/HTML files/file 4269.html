<p>As part of the acquisition, are your company taking on the IT support team of the acquisition?</p>

<p>While eventually there are likely to be 'efficiency savings' that they'll want to make from consolidating back office staff, there is a strong argument to keep both teams supporting their 'own' systems in order to keep the lights on.</p>

<p>Then you need to analyse the overlap - do you end up with systems on each stack doing similar things.  If so, look to consolidate onto the preferred platform and remove the other.  Also look at (regardless of current skills), which stack best needs the business needs in the coming years.  LAMP might be perfect right now, but there may be arguments for moving to .net to meet future needs.  Then again maybe not, but needs to be assessed.</p>

<p>Is there a business need for the 2 sets of systems to share data?  If so, at what level?  Creating (web)services to encapsulate shared functionality and make it available to the other system may be one way to go (SOA effectively).  Alternately you may need to share a backend initially and have .NET talking to a MySQL databases or somesuch.</p>
