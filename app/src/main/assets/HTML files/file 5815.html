<p>Most of the time, it all depends on your domain name or server IP. If you are using a shared hosting server where many other domains were used to spam, the spam filters such as Yahoo, Hotmail or Google may remember it and get your IP blacklisted. If you have already sent lots of mail without the double opt-in system, lots of your recipients may just throw your messages into spam or junk folders and that might get your domain blacklisted too.</p>

<p>Hope it helps a bit.</p>
