<p>To add a name to the <code>batsmanName</code> list, you do</p>

<pre><code>batsmanName.append('Mr Batsman')
</code></pre>

<p>If it is a true placeholder, then don't use a list, use <code>None</code> or an empty string. In that case you update it by assigning it:</p>

<pre><code>batsmanName = 'Mr Batsman'
</code></pre>

<p>For your second question (you really should pose separate questions separately) it is unclear what "if batsmanBatting[4] is 'T' then batsmanRun[4] should accumulate according" means, but I guess it means this:</p>

<pre><code>for num, state in enumerate(batsmanBatting):
    if state == 'T':
        batsmanRun[num] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>There are probably better ways of doing that. Or not, I don't know cricket.</p>
