<p>C++ has no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" rel="nofollow">ABI</a>. So what you want doing has a restriction: the plugins and your framework must compile &amp; link by same compiler &amp; linker with same parameter in same os. That is meaningless if the achievement is inter-operation in form of binary distribution because each plugin developed for framework has to prepare many version which target at different compiler on different os. So distrbute source code will be more practical than this and that's the way of GNU(download a src, configure and make)</p>

<p>COM is a chose, but it is too complex and out-of-date. Or managed C++ on .Net runtime. But they are only on ms os. If you want a universal solution, I suggest you change to another language.</p>
