<p>Looks like DataAnnotations are getting official support in MVC 2.0.  Scott Guthrie published a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/01/15/asp-net-mvc-2-model-validation.aspx">good article</a> on doing model validation in 2.0 using DataAnnotations.  Given that the team seems headed this direction, you might consider that a vote in its favor.</p>
