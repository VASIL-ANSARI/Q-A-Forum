<p>In this version of the library, it appears that the specified path must exist before using it. I was able to replicate your experience as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>[chris@little-mac:four-dot-two]$ php artisan generate:model vision
Created: /Users/chris/Projects/four-dot-two/app/models/Vision.php
[chris@little-mac:four-dot-two]$ php artisan generate:model --path="models" vision



  [ErrorException]                                                             
  file_put_contents(models/Vision.php): failed to open stream: No such file o  
  r directory                                                                  



generate:model [--path="..."] [--templatePath="..."] modelName
</code></pre>

<p>To resolve it, I simply created a "models" directory at the framework root.</p>

<pre><code>[chris@little-mac:four-dot-two]$ mkdir models
[chris@little-mac:four-dot-two]$ php artisan generate:model --path="models" vision
Created: models/Vision.php
[chris@little-mac:four-dot-two]$
</code></pre>
