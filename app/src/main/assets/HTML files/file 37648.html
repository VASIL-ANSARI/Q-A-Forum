<p>You are getting the string when the edit texts are created .The obviously are empty at that time. The user has not entered anything yet.
Instead you should be doing this</p>

<pre><code>Button reg = (Button) findViewById(R.id.btnRegister);
reg.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {

       // Fetch strings from edit texts here and check if they are not empty

       new readySQL().execute();
    }
});
</code></pre>
