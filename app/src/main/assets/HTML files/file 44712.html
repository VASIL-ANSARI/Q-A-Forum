<p>My guess is that you are applying the "click" event before the element is created. Try using delegation so that the event will be tied to <code>body</code> and then each time the event triggers the delegator will look to see if its child with class "overlay01" was clicked.</p>

<pre><code>$("body").on("click", ".overlay01", function(){
      setTimeout(
        function() {
            $(".location-modal").toggleClass("active");
        },500);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Another solution is to wait until ".overlay01" is loaded before adding the event by use of <code>$(document).ready(callback)</code> or another method.</p>
