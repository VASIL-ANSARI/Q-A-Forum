<p>To achieve this, I would make that bean implement <code>BeanPostProcessor</code> and then:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)
    throws BeansException {
    return bean == this ? null : bean;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This should cause the ApplicationContext to discard it but only after it has performed the initialization steps.</p>

<p>Note that you also need to implement <code>postProcessBeforeInitialization()</code> and there just write <code>return bean;</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: this does NOT work. But not due to MetroidFan2002's comment (see bellow), but due to another part of the JavaDoc: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ApplicationContexts can autodetect BeanPostProcessor beans in their
    bean definitions and apply them to any beans subsequently created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So obviously you cannot apply a BeanPostProcessor to itself.
Sorry for the false alarm :)</p>
