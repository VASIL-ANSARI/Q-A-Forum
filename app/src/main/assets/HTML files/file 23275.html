<p>Basically, from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.operationcontext.aspx" rel="nofollow">Msdn article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the OperationContext from within a service operation to access the
  <strong>current operation execution environment</strong>. In particular, the operation
  context is used to access callback channels in duplex services, to
  store extra state data across portions of the operations, and to
  access incoming message headers and properties as well as add outgoing
  message headers and properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733816.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OperationContext â This class represents the operation information
  that the runtime gathers for each operation. This includes information
  such as the incoming message headers, the incoming message properties,
  the incoming security identity, and other information. <strong>Extensions of
  this class can either extend the behavior of OperationContext or store
  the state for each operation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you can get some service configurations, that allow you access to OperationContext values (playing with instance management of the service, service mode, ...). But - in this case, if your' service instance mode will be changed in the future - you can break all the functionality, built with this assumption.</p>

<p>I agree with you and prefer to take care of state values (when and if required) by myself.</p>
