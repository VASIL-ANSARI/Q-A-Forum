<p>It's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operator#AND"><em>bitwise AND</em></a> operator.</p>

<p>It operates on each bit position independently; the output bit in position <em>n</em> is only 1 if both the corresponding input bits in position <em>n</em> are also 1.</p>

<p>In this context, the <code>0x7f7f7f</code> is being used as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_mask"><em>bit-mask</em></a>.  By having certain bit positions as 0, it means that the corresponding bit positions in <code>clothes</code> will <em>always</em> be 0.  All other bit positions will take on the same value as produced by <code>random.nextInt(0x1000000)</code>.</p>
