<p>Well, after some more hours of trying and going and testing every single line, I finally found out what was causing the problem. </p>

<p>Checking in </p>

<pre><code>controller(didChangeObject) 
</code></pre>

<p>for </p>

<pre><code>indexPath?.section == 0
</code></pre>

<p>caused the problem. I don't really know why... But at least it works.</p>
