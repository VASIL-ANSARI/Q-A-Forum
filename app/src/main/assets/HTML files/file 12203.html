<p>I ended up finding a solution through the proxy issue.  I had to download the automatic configuration script (.pac file) and find out which proxy host and port were being used for my URL.</p>

<p>I had to set the proxy host and port with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>ProxySelector.setDefault(new ProxySelector() {

    @Override
    public void connectFailed(URI uri, SocketAddress sa, IOException ioe) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Proxy connect failed", ioe);
    }

    @Override
    public List select(URI uri) {
        return Arrays
            .asList(new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP,
                              new InetSocketAddress(proxyHost,
                                                    proxyPort)));
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This was code from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6111050/unknown-host-exception">unknown host exception</a></p>
