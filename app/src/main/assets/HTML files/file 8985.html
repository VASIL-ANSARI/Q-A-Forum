<p>I may know what's wrong and I have a test for you to do. The buy screen runs a finish call after the user cancels the purchase or completes the purchase. For me for some reason the finish call was drifting down into the currently running activity and (CLOSING??? it). </p>

<p>Here's the relevant line from the log:</p>

<p>06-16 11:20:22.774: WARN/ActivityManager(132): Duplicate finish request for HistoryRecord{40ace828 com.android.vending/.billing.InAppBuyPageActivity}</p>

<p>I think I fixed this in my code problem is that I can't remember exactly what I did (maybe didn't call finish in my purchase complete handler...)</p>

<p>I don't know anything about Andgen, but what would happen if a finish call got called on the main Andgen activity? I'd imagine it would stop execution and you might get a black screen and an app crash.</p>

<p>So to test this, create a separate activity for you buy page. Doesn't need to be complicated - maybe have it just buy one canned product after it starts up. Run your code and see if it still gives you the black screen of doom. My bet: it may exit out of the activity back to your game but I think it'll work.</p>

<p>Hope this helps and Good Luck!</p>
