<p>You use static when the function doesn't depend on a specific object that the method is being applied to. How that applies to your application depends on its design.</p>

<p>For instance, if you have a class for dealing with dates and times, and it contains a function to return the current timestamp, it doesn't need to be applied to a specific date object -- it's the same for any date. So it could be a static function.</p>

<p>Static functions may be necessary if you need to run some functions before creating any instances of the class. If you use the Factory pattern, you will use a method to create instances in the first place. This will necessarily be a static method.</p>
