<p>I may not have all the details of what you're asking straight, but if you're running this service via Visual Studio and VPN, take a look at this <a href="http://codebetter.com/jameskovacs/2009/10/12/tip-how-to-run-programs-as-a-domain-user-from-a-non-domain-computer/" rel="nofollow">great article</a>, at CodeBetter.</p>

<pre><code>runas /netonly /user:domain\username âC:\ProgramFiles\Path\to\your\visualstudioâ
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have the computer I have this on in front of me, but I recall that I created a batch file and ran it to start VS and Sql Server Management Studio, and it works like a charm.</p>

<p>If I've misunderstood the issue, sorry for the noise.</p>
