<p>If you are adding new functionality, then you should extend the class.  You'll be able to add your own state, as well as methods to interact with them.  However, you won't be able to add this functionality to existing objects. </p>

<p>If you are simply writing shortcuts that use existing functionality, then you can use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/bb383977.aspx" rel="nofollow">Extension Methods</a> to add functions without needing to extend the class.  For example...</p>

<pre><code>public static class PanelExtensions    
{
    public static void DoSomething(this Panel panel) 
    {
        panel.SomePanelMethod();
        panel.SomeOtherPanelMethod();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then to use this...</p>

<pre><code>Panel myPanel = new Panel();
myPanel.DoSomething();
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that the methods are available to existing panels, and they will be inherited too (so your Canvas objects will receive these methods too).</p>

<p>Note than in order to use extension methods, you need to have a <code>using</code> statement at the top of your file referencing the namespace in which they are defined.</p>
