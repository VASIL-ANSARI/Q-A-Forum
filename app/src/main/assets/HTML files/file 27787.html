<p>What you're describing is a classic case of <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/left-join-right-join-operations-HP001032251.aspx" rel="nofollow">LEFT JOIN</a>. This operator brings ALL records from the left part of the join even if there're no matches in the right part,</p>

<p>In your case it would be something like</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Registration LEFT JOIN Kids ON Registration.MomID = Kids.MomID
WHERE Registration.YearStart = Year(Date())
</code></pre>

<p>Substitute * with only needed fields if you don't need all the fields from both tables.</p>
