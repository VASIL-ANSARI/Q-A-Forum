<p>Edit: initial statement redacted, the standard actually does provide a full definition for the stack adaptor, nothing left to implentors.  see top answer.</p>

<p>You want a container that has a push and pop method and allows you to inspect elements anywhere in the container and uses a <code>std::vector</code> for storage.  There is such a container in the standard template library</p>

<p>it is called <code>std::vector</code>.  </p>

<p>Use <code>std::stack</code> only for bondage purposes</p>
