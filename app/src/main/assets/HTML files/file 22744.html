<p>GreenDAO doesn't support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29" rel="nofollow">Polymorphism</a> for now.</p>

<p>See their docs: <a href="http://greendao-orm.com/documentation/modelling-entities/" rel="nofollow">Modelling Entities</a></p>

<p><em>" [...] Note: currently itâs impossible to have another entity as a super class (there are no polymorphic queries either)</em></p>

<p>Anyway, you could implement it yourself storing the entity type and some interfacing.</p>
