<p>D is a good language <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">and decently popular</a>, but like all languages, it is just another tool. Which tool to use depends on the kind of person you are, how you think, the environment you are working in, what restrictions of the languages apply the the program, and most importantly, the program itself. If you have the time, I would definitely recommend learning D. Worst case scenario, you will never use it. More likely you will learn what aspects of it you like the most, and under what conditions it shines brightest, and take advantage of that for when making new programs.</p>

<p>I would recommend looking at the <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/comparison.html">D comparison chart</a> to see what the features are for the language and see if it sounds right for you.</p>
