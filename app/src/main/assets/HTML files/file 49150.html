<p>Besides the aforementioned stuff (rename your enum!), you simply have to declare the enum outside of your <code>Question</code> class. You don't have to make a new file for this (although you can if you want), simply put it above your class like so:</p>

<pre><code>enum QuestionType: String {
    case Text  = "TEXT"
    case Image = "IMAGE"
}

class Question: NSObject {
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use the <code>QuestionType</code> enum in your <code>MyViewController</code> class.</p>
