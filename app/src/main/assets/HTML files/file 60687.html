<p>Why don't you set their heights to be the same, and then the second container set to vertically align in the center. I would use a plugin like matchHeight.js. It's super easy and you just put a matching data tag on each element and it will set the heights. for example  and . That will match the heights for you and then just use the basic flex box to vertically center them.</p>

<p>here is some flexbox vertical center code.</p>

<pre><code>.vertical_center{
        display:flex;
        flex-direction:column;
        justify-content:center;
        resize:vertical;
        align-items:center;
        min-height:25px;
    }
</code></pre>
