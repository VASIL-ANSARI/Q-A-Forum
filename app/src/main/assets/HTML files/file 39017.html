<p>A simple way would be to score each row by fit, and pick the row with the highest score, to match Bob/Bicycles something like;</p>

<pre><code>SELECT price,
  CASE WHEN "user" = 'Bob' THEN 2 
       WHEN "user" IS NULL THEN 0
       ELSE -10 END +
  CASE WHEN "category" = 'Bicycles' THEN 1
       WHEN "category" IS NULL THEN 0
       ELSE -10 END score
  FROM field
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 1;
</code></pre>

<p>This gives 2 points for a name match, and 1 point for a category match. Any mismatch gives -10 which allows the default to win if nothing else matches well.</p>

<p>If you have a great number of rows, you'll want to add a WHERE clause which finds only rows that match (ie matching name/category or null) and just use the order by on the filtered rows.</p>
