<p>There are many ways you can do this, you can pass a variable into the URL using a GET but that would require you to change your page structure.</p>

<p>Simply add the insert on each page:</p>

<p><em>ADC-Jungle.<strong>php</em></strong></p>

<pre><code>$db = new mysqli('localhost', 'user', 'pass', 'demo');

if($db-&gt;connect_errno &gt; 0){
    die('Unable to connect to database [' . $db-&gt;connect_error . ']');
}


$sql = "INSERT INTO db (column_name) VALUES ('Jungle');

if(!$result = $db-&gt;query($sql)){
    die('There was an error running the query [' . $db-&gt;error . ']');
}
</code></pre>

<p>For your purpose this is the simplest solution, but not necessarily the way I would do it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>As Marc said, these need to be PHP files. </p>
