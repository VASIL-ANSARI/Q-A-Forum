<p>There was a temporary issue with the iFrame Player API that you can read about here: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=4706">https://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=4706</a></p>

<p>As a temporary fix, you just need to add the event listener within the onReady event:</p>

<pre><code>function onReady() {
player.addEventListener('onStateChange', function(e) {
console.log('State is:', e.data);
});
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, as someone mentioned on the Google Code Issue Thread, you set an interval and poll the player for its current state instead of listening for the onStateChange event. Here is an example code snippet for doing that:</p>

<pre><code>setInterval( function() {
var state = player.getPlayerState();
if ( playerState !== state ) {
onPlayerStateChange( {
data: state
});
}
}, 10);
</code></pre>
