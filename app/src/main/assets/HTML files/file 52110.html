<p>I'll focus on Table2 being nil.</p>

<p>It's nil because you're not creating it.</p>

<p>Go into your terminal and type <code>rails g controller table2 create</code></p>

<p>open that file and inside of the empty <code>create</code> method you will create the new Table2 object.</p>

<p>You can do this many ways, but the most important thing to remember when you have associations is that you need to define the association when you're creating it.</p>

<p>I'll give you an example:</p>

<p>Let's say I have a User model</p>

<p><strong>User Model</strong></p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
has_many :posts

end
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's say I have a Post model and I want the user to be able to create many posts.</p>

<p><strong>Post Model</strong></p>

<pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
belongs_to :user

end
</code></pre>

<p>Now this is the important part where we will utilize your table2 controller</p>

<p>When I create a new post, it has to <code>belongs_to</code> a user, therefor we will do this</p>

<p><strong>Post Controller</strong></p>

<pre><code>class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController

  def create
    #store the object that has many posts as a variable
    @user = current_user

    #the important part, when you create a post you need to do this
    @post = @user.posts.create(post_params)
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Whats happening here is, Rails is creating the new post UNDER ownership of the <code>@user</code>. That is how you establish a relationship by association.</p>

<p>I hope this helped clear up relationships a little bit, if not here are some docs that might help too.</p>
