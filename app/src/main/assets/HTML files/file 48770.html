<p>I don't think this is possible, exactly as you are attempting. </p>

<p>You can't pass a variable from javascript, <em>back in time</em>, as an argument to the ruby code,  which was only executed when the <code>.erb</code> template was initially compiled.</p>

<p>I think you'll need to give up on using <code>button_to</code> in this way, and solve your problem with a whole different approach.</p>

<p>Obvious possible approaches, without knowing quite what's going on here: don't render this button client-side: instead get its html from the server via ajax.</p>

<p>Or you could do it with JavaScript still, but only derive the base path from rails. Things like this:</p>

<pre><code>var buttonPath = '&lt;%= remove_favorite_path %&gt;/' + id;
</code></pre>

<p>Will work fine.</p>
