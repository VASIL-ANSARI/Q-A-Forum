<p>Well, you can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744842%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">ChangeInterceptor</a> mechanism, by adding this code:</p>

<pre><code>[ChangeInterceptor("Data")]
public void OnChangeData(Data data, UpdateOperations updateOperation)
{
  if (updateOperation == UpdateOperations.Add)
  {
     //do your job
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately for me, it is too late as the object is alread deserialized here (and I get the exception in the Deserialization phase).</p>
