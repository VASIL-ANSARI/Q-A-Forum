<p>Actually you hardly need to use <code>thunkify</code> here, as your function doesn't take an argument. You can (and should) however simplify it to</p>

<pre><code>yield function(cb) { myDaoObject.load(cb); }
</code></pre>

<p>and possibly even further to just</p>

<pre><code>yield myDaoObject.load;
</code></pre>

<p>which would work if <code>load</code> was not a method that used <code>this</code>. You will have to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind" rel="nofollow"><code>bind</code></a> it to the object you want it get called upon:</p>

<pre><code>yield myDaoObject.load.bind(myDaoObject);
</code></pre>

<p>The same problem was with your <code>thunkify</code> call - which was otherwise fine (albeit unnecessary).</p>
