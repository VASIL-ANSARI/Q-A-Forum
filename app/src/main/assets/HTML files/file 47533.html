<p>Try putting each column into a containing div:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-mde-6 fr cr"&gt;
   &lt;div class="bubble"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;      
    asdasd ad asd asd as
     &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="bubble"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      n in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't loo  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-mde-6 fl cl"&gt;
  &lt;div class="bubble"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div class="bubble"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    rem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
     &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
