<blockquote>
  <p>ActiveRecord use to call after_save
  callback each time save method is
  called even if the model was not
  changed and no insert/update query
  spawned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ActiveRecord executes :after_save callbacks each time the record is successfully saved regardless it was changed.</p>

<pre><code># record invalid, after_save not triggered
Record.new.save

# record valid, after_save triggered
r = Record.new(:attr =&gt; value)

# record valid and not changed, after_save triggered
r.save
</code></pre>

<p>What you want to know is if the record is changed, not if the record is saved.
You can easily accomplish this using <code>record.changed?</code></p>

<pre><code>class Record

  after_save :do_something_if_changed

  protected

  def do_something_if_changed
    if changed?
      # ...
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
