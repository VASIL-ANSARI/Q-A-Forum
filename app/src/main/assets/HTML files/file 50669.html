<p>Make it a singular resource</p>

<pre><code>resource :user
</code></pre>

<p>Then it'll just route to <code>/user</code></p>

<p>In your form you'll need to make the url explicit as rails won't be able to infer it's a singular resource</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= form_for @user, url: user_path %&gt;
</code></pre>
