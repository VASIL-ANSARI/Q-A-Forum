<p>You're requesting for a new path inside the loop, but never creating a new File to test with.  Therefore, subsequent calls to <code>existCheck.exists()</code> will always return false.</p>

<p>You may want to check what string is passed from <code>ConsoleInput.readLine</code>.  It looks like you're not using the core Java libraries to read input, so knowing what you <em>are</em> using will help potentially pinpoint the issue.</p>

<p>I don't have the means to check right now, but could the extra '\' you're adding to the end of the path be another potential problem?</p>
