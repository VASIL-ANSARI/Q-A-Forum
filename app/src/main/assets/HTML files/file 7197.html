<p>Why are these things always so simple?! I had <code>TextFormatString="{1} {2}"</code> in the <code>ASPxComboBox</code> and there are only 2 columns, I had a third before but removed it and forgot to change the <code>TextFormatString</code> I also just removed the <code>ClientSideEvents</code> as they were from the example I posted above, but I wasn't using them.</p>

<p>Everything working now!</p>
