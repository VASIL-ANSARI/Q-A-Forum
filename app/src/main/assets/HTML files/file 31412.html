<p>If it's the "photo" view that you only want to appear in certain cases, then I think you want to add some code to the <code>else</code> block to hide or remove any photo views from the cell.</p>

<p>The problem is that once you start scrolling around, the table view will begin to reuse some of the cells that have scrolled off screen to populate the new cells that are scrolling into view. If one of those cells had a photo visible (via the true branch of your <code>if</code> statement where you are creating a photo view and calling <code>addPhotoToCell</code>), then <code>dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:</code> might return one of these cells with all of its views intact instead of returning a brand new uninitialized cell. If you end up reusing one of these cells for a message row where <code>hasPhoto</code> is not YES, then it looks like you are not doing anything to hide that photo view. Thus, add some code to the <code>else</code> block to hide that photo view if it exists.</p>
