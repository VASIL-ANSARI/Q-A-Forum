<p>You're passing the actual strings "d0", etc, to MySQL, which has no idea what to do with them. Those are Python variables, so you need to pass their values to MySQL instead. You do that with placeholders:</p>

<pre><code>mycursor.execute("""INSERT INTO mobile_spec(android_os, camera, sim, d_size)
                 VALUES (%s, %s, %s , %s)""", (d0, d1, d2, d3))
</code></pre>

<p>Your code can be simplified further, since you get the params in a list in the first place, so you can pass that directly to MySQL without the <code>d*</code> variables at all.</p>

<pre><code>mycursor.execute("""INSERT INTO mobile_spec(android_os, camera, sim, d_size)
                 VALUES (%s, %s, %s , %s)""", my_list)
</code></pre>
