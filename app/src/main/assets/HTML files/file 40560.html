<p>A trick that might work is to surround each image with a container, e.g. <code>div.box</code>, and to give it an additional child, e.g. <code>div.search-text</code>. The container is used to allow the search text to be absolutely positioned on top of the image. The search-text is filled with the text to search on and is styled in such a way that it isn't visible, but does allow to be searched on.</p>

<pre><code>.box {
    position: relative;
}

.search-text {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    opacity: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or see <a href="http://codepen.io/ckuijjer/pen/EaPZZO" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/ckuijjer/pen/EaPZZO</a> where I've enumerated each kitten. Try searching on e.g. <em>Five</em> or <em>Two</em>.</p>

<p>But you probably need to do extensive cross browser testing. I assume that every browser has its own logic to decide when a piece of text can be searched on (Chrome for example didn't like searching when the text had <code>font-size: 0</code> but didn't have any problems with <code>opacity: 0</code></p>
