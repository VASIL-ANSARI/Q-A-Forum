<p>You can't do this without a server to connect to, which would be running a server-side application or service that provided some kind of connection hub that all clients connect to. That takes some server side programming. A browser cannot connect to another browser without some help from the outside.</p>

<p>You would have the server accept input from clients and then send updates to all other connected clients about what happened. Exactly how to make this will be very different depending on what server side technology you use.</p>

<p>What server side technology should you use? There is a near limitless away of choices here, I couldn't possibly recommend one here with any authority. Pick a language you like, and there is most likely a way to write server side code with it.</p>

<p>On the client side, you could use server side events to listen to updates from the server. But again your server would have to be implemented to support that protocol.</p>

  <p>but I just don't know where to begin.</p>

<ol>
<li>You start on the server</li>
<li>Expose some API's on that server to send and receive info from clients.</li>
<li>Connect to those API's from your client (the client side JavaScript)</li>
</ol>
