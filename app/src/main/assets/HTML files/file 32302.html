<p>The latest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_%28C_standard_revision%29" rel="nofollow">C11</a> standard has the <code>max_align_t</code> type (and <code>_Alignas</code> specifier and <code>_Alignof</code> operator and <code>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</code> header).</p>

<p>GCC compiler has a <code>__BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__</code> macro (giving the maximal size alignment). It also proves some  extensions related to <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Alignment.html" rel="nofollow">alignment</a>.</p>

<p>Often, using <code>2*sizeof(void*)</code> (as the biggest relevant alignment) is <em>in practice</em> quite safe (at least on most of the systems I heard about these days; but one could imagine weird processors and systems where it is <em>not</em> the case, perhaps some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor" rel="nofollow">DSP</a>-s). To be sure, study the details of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" rel="nofollow">ABI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention" rel="nofollow">calling conventions</a> of your particular implementation, e.g. <a href="http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf" rel="nofollow">x86-64 ABI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions" rel="nofollow">x86 calling conventions</a>...</p>

<p>And the system <code>malloc</code> is guaranteed to return a sufficiently aligned pointer (for all purposes).</p>

<p>On some systems and targets and some processors giving a larger alignment might give performance benefit (notably when asking the compiler to optimize). You may have to (or want to) tell the compiler about that, e.g. on GCC using <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html" rel="nofollow">variable attributes</a>...</p>

<p>Don't forget that according to <a href="http://www.snake.net/software/imake-stuff/fulton.txt" rel="nofollow">Fulton</a></p>

<p>but <code>intptr_t</code> and <code>max_align_t</code> is here to help you....</p>
