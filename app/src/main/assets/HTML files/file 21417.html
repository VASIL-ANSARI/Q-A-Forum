<p>Ok I figured out. The file pyreadlineconfig.ini was located in the wrong directory.</p>

<p>I followed the fix in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3771837/ambiguous-tab-completion-not-working-in-ipython-on-windows">Ambiguous tab completion not working in iPython on Windows</a></p>

<p>which says to copy this file to %HOMEPATH%. Turns out this environment variable is misconfigured on my PC and the file was copied to e:\pyreadlineconfig.ini.</p>

<p>The right path but should instead be c:\users\username.</p>
