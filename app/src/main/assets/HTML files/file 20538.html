<p>It's hard to imagine what you're trying to accomplish. Anyway, you can observe which editor instance is focused (you can eventually store a reference in some variable):</p>

<pre><code>CKEDITOR.on( 'instanceReady', function( event ) {
    event.editor.on( 'focus', function() {
        console.log( 'focused', this );
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>After all, you can also browse editor instances since they are stored in <code>CKEDITOR.instances</code> object in global namespace. With this, you can find your instance by name, id, anything (i.e. previously associated with your button).</p>
