<p>After you have iterated over the result set in a first loop - there is nothing left and the second loop doesn't even perform a single iteration.</p>

<p>So the first loop terminates with <code>$row = null;</code> and the first iteration of the second loop starts with the same <code>null</code> value which prevents from even entering the second loop body.</p>

<p>So the behaviour you're experiencing is expected.</p>
