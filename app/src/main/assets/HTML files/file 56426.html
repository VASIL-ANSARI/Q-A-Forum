  <p>Is there any way to get the above code to compile?</p>

<p>You need to cast it to <code>T</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static &lt;T extends A &amp; B&gt; T f(boolean b) {
    if (b)
        return (T) new C();
    return (T) new D();
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt; what_should_I_write_here > x = f(&lt; user_inputted_boolean >); </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to assign a concrete type to a variable, indeed don't forget that due to <strong>Type Erasure</strong> the generics don't exist anymore at Runtime they exist only at compile time, such that only concrete type like this can work:</p>

<pre><code>C x = HelloWorld.&lt;C&gt;f(true);
</code></pre>

<p>As you may have noticed, you won't be able to do much with <code>A &amp; B</code> that is why  Multiple Bounds are rarely used in practice, such that you should create an interface that extends <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> and use this interface instead, like this</p>

<pre><code>public interface AB extends A, B {}

public static class C implements AB {}

...
</code></pre>

<p>I know that it is much less flexible but it will be hard to do much better.</p>
