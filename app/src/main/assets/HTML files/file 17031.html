<p>Create two Queues?
Like <code>worktodoA</code> and <code>worktodoB</code> and have your workers idle while they wait for something to be put in the queue and if the item put there is lets say 'quit' they will quit?</p>

<p>Otherwise you should give <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers" rel="nofollow">tMCs comment</a> a shot</p>
