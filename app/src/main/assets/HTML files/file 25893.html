<p>Could be that your the MySQL event scheduler is not running.</p>

<p>Try this to see if it is running:</p>

<pre><code>show variables like 'event_scheduler';
</code></pre>

<p>If you get a value of <code>OFF</code> returned then this is probably the reason. You can switch it back on by running:</p>

<pre><code>SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to know the MySQL current date and time you can run:</p>

<pre><code>select now();
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you can see when an event was last run by the MySQL Event Scheduler using this query:</p>

<pre><code>select event_schema,event_name,last_executed 
from information_schema.events;
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If you need to switch your event_scheduler on by default then head over to your my.cnf file (or my.ini file if you are using Windows) and either comment out <code>event_scheduler=DISABLED</code> or set <code>event_scheduler=ON</code>. Then restart your MySQL server. </p>

<p>There is some more info about it <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/events-configuration.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>
