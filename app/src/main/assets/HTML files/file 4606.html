<p>My two cents:</p>

<p>The wrapper DLL contains the implementations for the native methods in your <code>Epanet</code> class, not for the native method you're calling in your test code (note the class name in the stacktrace). I think you should be using <code>new Epanet().ENopen( "C:\\Red2.inp", "C:\\salaida.txt", "" );</code> instead.</p>

<p>Also, the static initializer for <code>Epanet</code> should be loading your DLL, not the wrapped library (the OS will take care of that if your wrapper was built correctly).</p>
