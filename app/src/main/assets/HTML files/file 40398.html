<p>Your issue is that you're not centering a view INSIDE of something else, you're just trying to draw on top. </p>

<p>One possible solution would be to set the width and height of the <code>TextView</code> to be the same as the dimensions of the <code>ImageView</code>. Then, add this to your <code>TextView</code>'s XML:</p>

<pre><code>android:gravity="center"
</code></pre>

<p>But overall, this is NOT the right way to do this sort of stuff. You'd be much better off just changing the background of your <code>TextView</code> with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>android:background="#ffffd0cd"
</code></pre>

<p>You can also change the background to be a drawable:</p>

<pre><code>android:background="@drawable/my_logo_background_image"
</code></pre>
