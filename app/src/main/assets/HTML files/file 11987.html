<p>First. 
establish a name, id or class for the element you want to change the value of. There are a number of ways of doing this. I would use firebug for firefox, or IE developer toolbar, or just view the source of the page and establish what the name/Id of the  field is. Now if that field does not have a Name or an ID that you can use you might be able to get the containing element and iterate through the Child elements n times until you get the element you want.</p>

<p>For my embedded browser app I did the following in c#:-</p>

<pre><code>// webBrowser is the name of the embedded IE browser in your app
var htmlDocument = webBrowser.Document;
if(htmlDocment!=null)
{
    var field = htmlDocument.GetElementById("...the id...");
    if(field!=null)
    {
        field.SetAttribute("value","...yourfilenamepathonyourmachine...");
    }

    // Now you would need to establish the ID of the submit element and click that
    var submitButton = htmlDocument.GetElementById("...submit button...");
    if(submitButton!=null)
    {
        submitButton.InvokeMember("Click");
    }
   // your code to loop?
}
</code></pre>

<p>So do you have the HTML of the page in question? that might help and a better answer can be given</p>
