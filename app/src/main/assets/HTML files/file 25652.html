<p>The naive and simplest solution is to have two loops, one to check if all three are equal to <code>'O'</code> and if not then run another to check if all three are equal to <code>'X'</code>.</p>

<p>Something like the following pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>winner = check_winner('O');
if (winner != 'O')
    winner = check_winner('X');

if (winner != '-')
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "The winner is " &lt;&lt; winner &lt;&lt; '\n';
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>check_winner</code> will of course do the actual check, and returns the symbol or <code>'-'</code> if no winner.</p>
