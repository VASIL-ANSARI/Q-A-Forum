<p>A simple C++ program such as this has no concept of "clicking the close button". You don't even deal with that until you start playing with GUI toolkits. The different ways of terminating this program depend entirely on how you are running it. Most likely you are running it in some sort of terminal or command line window. If that terminal provides a close button, then clicking the close button is actually triggering some event in the terminal application. It is entirely up to that application how it deals with your still running program. Often, the terminal will force terminate any child processes. This is however very platform specific. (For Linux, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/5546223/150634">Signals received by bash when terminal is closed</a>)</p>

<p>If you're worried about the fact that your resource may not be <code>delete</code>d if your program is force terminated, don't. Any modern operating system will clean up the resources allocated by a process when that process is ended.</p>
