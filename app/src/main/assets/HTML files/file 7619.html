<p>With fadein() you can also provide a callback function that is executed when the fadein is complete. so you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#img1').fadeIn('1000', function(){
    $('#img2').fadeIn('1000', function(){
            //go on as you like

     });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this is only an example and you should create some more complex control method to fade all your images without writing thousands of nested functions. (if you provide your html maybe i can help you)</p>
