<p><a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/13/learning-to-use-the-before-and-after-pseudo-elements-in-css/" rel="nofollow">THIS</a> is a nice article about the :after and :before pseudo-elements.</p>

<p>Given the text (and GCyrillus' comment above), these pseudo-elements are not "accessible" in the DOM, so you wouldn't be able to "click" on them with an HTML or js/jQuery "click".</p>

<p>So I wonder about a plan "B".</p>

<p>Why can't you add them directly as HTML?</p>

<p>If the names are coming from a DB, couldn't you just add "&lt;" and ">" to the php or js?</p>

<p>I probably am missing your point.</p>
