<p>You have to use more data types than just String. As you are working with prices, the best primitive type is <code>float</code> and the best object is <code>BigDecimal</code>. For convenience, lets just work with floats:</p>

<p>You will want to add some values for the prices like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static final float TYPE_LAMINATE_PRICE = 10.0f;
private static final float TYPE_PLASTIC_PRICE = 5.0f;
</code></pre>

<p>You then want a way to detect what the user entered, by doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>float price;
if (customerCoat.equalsIgnoreCase("laminate") {
    price = TYPE_LAMINATE_PRICE;
} else if (customerCoat.equalsIgnoreCase("plastic") {
    price = TYPE_PLASTIC_PRICE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You also need to detect the quantity needed. <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt%28java.lang.String%29" rel="nofollow">Integer.parseInt(String)</a> will do this for you.</p>

<p>This should get you started, I'm sure you'll be able to work out how to get things working how you want them from there.</p>
