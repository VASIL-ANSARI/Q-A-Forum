<p>Use the Benchmark standard library and the various tests available in Rails (unit, functional, integration). Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>def test_do_something
  elapsed_time = Benchmark.realtime do
    100.downto(1) do |index|
      # do something here
    end
  end
  assert elapsed_time &lt; SOME_LIMIT
end
</code></pre>

<p>So here we just do something 100 times, time it via the Benchmark library, and ensure that it took less than SOME_LIMIT amount of time.</p>

Also, if you're into the 'book reading' thing, I picked up the idea for the example from <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails2/agile-web-development-with-rails">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>, which talks all about the different testing types and a little on performance testing.</p>
