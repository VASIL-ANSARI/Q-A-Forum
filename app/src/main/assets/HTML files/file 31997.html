<p>This doesn't look like a coding problem, but a network configuration problem.</p>

<p>Let me try and rephrase what you're saying : Please correct me if I've misunderstood:-</p>

<ul>
<li>You have an "internal" network (192.168.x.y). </li>
<li>You run the client on one PC on your internal network, and the server on another. </li>
<li>It all works so far.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, you're also connected to the internet, via a different 'external' IP address
  - When your client tries to access the server via this address, it fails. (The exact error code from <code>WSAGetLastError</code> is useful here, please)</p>

<p>At this point, it's down to how you're connected to the net. Let's assume a typical home office scenario. You have broadband, with an ADSL router/modem giving you network connectivity. Now, while the router will have an 'external' IP address, PC's on your local network typically do NOT. So, if you try connecting to the 'external' IP, you're actually trying to talk to the router. </p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding" rel="nofollow">Port forwarding</a> comes into play. You need to configure the router to forward port 7777 to the correct IP address for your server on the internal network. You'll find a screen like this on your router somewhere.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/yZnEC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>You would enter port 7777 for both 'from' and 'to', enable TCP, and specify the LAN address of your server. The router will then forward incoming connections on port 7777 to the specified server.</p>
