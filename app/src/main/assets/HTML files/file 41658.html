<p>Twilio evangelist here.</p>

<p>To send a text message from Swift you can just make a request directly to Twilios REST API.  That said, I <strong>would not</strong> recommend doing this from an iOS app (or any other client app) as it requires you to embed your Twilio account credentials in the app, which is dangerous.  I would instead recommend sending the SMS from a server side application.</p>

<p>If you do want to send the message from your app, there are a couple of Swift libraries I know of that simplify making HTTP requests:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire" rel="nofollow">Alamofire</a> - from Mattt Thompson, creator of AFNetworking</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rickyrobinett/SwiftRequest" rel="nofollow">SwiftRequest</a> - from Ricky Robinett of Twilio</li>
</ul>

<p>To make the request using SwiftRequest, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>var swiftRequest = SwiftRequest();

var data = [
    "To" : "+15555555555",
    "From" : "+15555556666",
    "Body" : "Hello World"
];

swiftRequest.post("https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/[YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID]/Messages", 
    auth: ["username" : "[YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID]", "password" : "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"]
    data: data, 
    callback: {err, response, body in
        if err == nil {
            println("Success: \(response)")
        } else {
            println("Error: \(err)")
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
