<p>Assuming <code>date</code> is an actual date column (as it should be), you can use <code>extract</code> to compare the month value, and then the <code>row_number() over ...</code> analytic function to get the latest row per <code>id</code> value:</p>

<pre><code>select date, id, value
  from (select date, id, value,
               row_number() over (partition by id order by date desc) as rn
          from tbl
         where extract(month from date) = 5)
 where rn = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, I assume that your actual date column is called something else, as <code>date</code> is a reserved word.</p>
