<p>This apparently mean that your array was an multi-dimension array. Try to put another foreach loop inside the existing one.</p>

<p>Use vardump or print_r to check how does the current data store in $assoc look like</p>

<pre><code>foreach($assoc as $key)
{
   foreach($key as $value){
    if($ergString=="")
    {
        $ergString = $value;
    }
    else
    {
        $ergString .= $value;
    }

    $ergString .= " ";
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Try this see wether working </p>
