<p>There's no other option. Just the alias via <code>using</code> or a <code>struct</code> wrapper. Personally I'd choose a <code>struct</code> wrapper, because it provides better type safety and you can define overloaded operators as needed. It's more work, but better than copy&amp;pasting a single line of code across the whole code base, which would be a lot more error-prone and less maintainable.</p>

<p>Note that wrapping it with a <code>class</code> would make it a <em>reference</em> type, while a <code>struct</code> is a <em>value</em> type (same as <code>long</code> and other primitive types).</p>
