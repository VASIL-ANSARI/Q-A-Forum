<p>You probably want to use JavaScript <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp" rel="nofollow"><code>localStorage</code> or <code>sessionStorage</code></a> for this. Below is an example of your code using <code>localStorage</code></p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function() 
{  

    if (localStorage.visits)
    {
        //If the value is in local storage increase it's value
        localStorage.visits = Number(localStorage.visits) + 1;
    }
    else
    {
        //If the value isn't in local storage set it to 0
        localStorage.visits = 0;
    }

    //Check if the number of visits is greater than 5 and set the link accordingly
    if(localStorage.visits &gt; 5)
    {
        document.getElementById("link").href = "www.site2.com";
    }
    else
    {
        document.getElementById("link").href = "www.site1.com";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will only work if their browser supports <code>localStorage</code>. One thing to note as well, the value will not reset if they close the browser page. If you want it to reset when the page is closed, that's what <code>sessionStorage</code> is for.</p>

<p>One more thing to note: The user can clear <code>localStorage</code> by clearing the browser data. If you wanted something that would be even more persistent I don't believe there's a JavaScript only solution (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about this!)</p>
