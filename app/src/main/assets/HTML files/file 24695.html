<p>I looked at the multimedia command string reference on MSDN and found out that</p>

<pre><code>TCHAR tch[100];
mciSendString("status [alias] mode", tch, 100, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>will put whether [alias] is playing or stopped into "tch".  If it's stopped, I just use the "seek [alias] to start" command to reload the midi file.  I should mention that this causes a delay while stuff is computing or whatever - so your program will freeze if you don't put this in a separate thread.</p>
