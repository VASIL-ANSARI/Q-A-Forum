<p>Did you configure your JNDI Datasource for the report designer?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit the .pentaho/simple-jndi/default.properties file. The .pentaho
  directory is in the home or user directory of the user account that
  runs Report Designer. If you have multiple copies of Report Designer
  installed to multiple user accounts, each default.properties file will
  have to be edited.</p>
