<p>You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.multicastdelegate.getinvocationlist.aspx"><code>MulticastDelegate.GetInvocationList</code></a> for any delegate, and then just invoke all of the component delegates in parallel. That's probably the easiest way to go.</p>

<p>(It returns <code>Delegate[]</code> but you can cast each instance to the right type. You may even get away with casting the array itself - I can't remember exactly what kind of array it <em>actually</em> creates.)</p>
