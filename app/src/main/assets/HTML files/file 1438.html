<p><em>Usually</em> (not always) a char is 8-bits so all chars would typically have a value of less than 256. So your test would always succeed.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" rel="nofollow">ASCII</a> only goes up to 127, not 255. The characters after that are not standard ASCII, and can vary depending on code pages.</p>

<p>If you are dealing with international characters you should probably use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_character" rel="nofollow">wide characters</a> instead of char.</p>
