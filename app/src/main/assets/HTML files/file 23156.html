<p>If you use polymorphism, then you're determining the connection method when you instantiate the SCL object.  Does that make sense?  Or could an SCL class be connected to the Region in various different ways thoughout its life?  In that case, polymorphism doesn't make sense.  One important aspect that we have no information about is what happens to the parameters of the <code>connect(...)</code> method.  Do they need to be stored in the SCL class, in which case with different parameters polymorphism might again make sense so that each class can store the appropriate parameters. </p>

<p>Another thought is, is the act of connecting an SCL class to a region really a method for the SCL class at all, or should it live somewhere else?</p>
