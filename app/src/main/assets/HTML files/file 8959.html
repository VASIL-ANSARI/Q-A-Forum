<p>If you know the class of the textbox that you are looking for, then you can use the jquery selector:</p>

<pre><code>$('input .className').val();
</code></pre>

<p>But this will only work correctly if the textbox is the only input on the page with the given class. If it is not then you could attempt to wrap the area where the textbox is dropped with a container div that has an id, as such:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id='divTextboxDrop'&gt;
    //Textbox will be dropped here
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then you could do something like this</p>

<pre><code>$('#divTextboxDrop input:first').val();
</code></pre>

<p>It is really contingent upon how much control you have over the injection.</p>

<p>As far as the ajax functionality that you are having difficulty with, I would say look at the jquery ajax specifications that can be found here: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/</a></p>

<p>As per this page the following are some of the attribute values of the ajax function</p>

<p>url - The target url of the page that the ajax call will be targeting<br />
contentType - The format of the content you are posting. So long as you are doing a standard http call then you don't even need to specify this from my understanding. However, if you are posting JSON, then yes this requires a change. <br />
data - The actual data that is being sent along. If, as it looks like in your case, you are posting JSON then the value here should be your stringified JSON object.
success - Function to call if the ajax call succeeds</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
