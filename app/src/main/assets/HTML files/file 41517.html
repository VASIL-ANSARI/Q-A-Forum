<p>As @bennyvnq stated, there are two different references to two different objects declared in your main method (i.e. rentalCar and luxuryRentalCar). Classes are different to objects and you can declare as many objects as you want from a class and they will be completely separate from each other except for any static members which will be shared between all the objects of the class (including derived classes).</p>

<p>Read up on polymorphism and design patterns (<a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596007124" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124</a>) and see if you can change the design of your program. A hint would be to have a RentalCar class that instead of having other classes derive from it, it has fields that are using inheritance and polymorphism to differ behaviour. For example, the RentalCar class might have a DriverType field with DriverType being an interface. You would then have other classes which implement this interface like ChauffeurDriven and SelfDriven that define the differences between the different types of cars. This way, you only have one RentalCar class, and many derived DriverType classes and the design becomes much more robust. In your program you would then have only one RentalCar object which is declared at the beginning of the program and instantiated along with the correct DriverType after user input. </p>

<p>I hope this isn't too confusing but if you can get your head around it and start to use principles like this life becomes much easier!</p>
