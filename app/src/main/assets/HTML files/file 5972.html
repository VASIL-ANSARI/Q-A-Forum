<p><code>IntPtr</code> is a managed object but the object it is pointing to is still not garbage collected. Using unsafe pointers in C# is really something that you should avoid. Code using unsafe pointers might not account for differences in memory addresses between x86 and x64 systems. It allows you to directly manipulate memory addresses easily which is not the case with IntPtr as you would need to marshal between the pointer and the actual structure stored at this memory address. With unsafe pointers you could directly work with the underlying type: here's a <a href="http://www.bratched.com/en/home/dotnet/48-fun-with-matrix-multiplication-and-unsafe-code.html">blog post</a> I wrote illustrating one possible use of unsafe pointers. Another common example is <a href="http://www.bobpowell.net/lockingbits.htm">manipulating image pixels</a> directly.</p>
