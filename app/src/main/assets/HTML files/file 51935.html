<p>This gave me some trouble...and, unless I'd seen examples, I never would have known it was possible, so I'll leave this up.  Anyhow, in order to do what I am asking about, the following code is an easy start:</p>

<pre><code>zarray = np.zeros((10,2,2))
zarray[:,0,0] = 0
zarray[:,0,1] = 1
zarray[:,1,0] = 2
zarray[:,1,1] = 3

def plot_yz_over_x_elementwise(zarray):
    for i in range(zarray.shape[1]):
        for j in range(zarray.shape[2]):
            plt.subplot2grid((zarray.shape[1],zarray.shape[2]),(i,j))
            plt.plot(zarray[:,i,j])
plot_yz_over_x_elementwise(zarray)
</code></pre>
