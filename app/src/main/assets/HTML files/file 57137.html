<p>You may be better to make your context local to the methods that use it, as described in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj729737.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj729737.aspx</a> and several SO answers. I don't know much about await, but my first guess would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>private async void SomeMethodA()
{
    using (var myContext = new Context()) // or, possibly, new Entities()
    {
        await myContext.GetA();
    }
}
</code></pre>
