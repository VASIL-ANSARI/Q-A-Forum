<p>If you want to move your sprite along the polyline then just combine CCMoveTo actions into sequence.</p>

<p>If you want some smooth trajectory - combine CCBezierTo into sequence.</p>

<p>If you want some complex custom move create a CCSprite subclass and add some method as </p>

<pre><code>-(void) myMethod(float dt)
</code></pre>

<p>Then schedule it and make in this method any transformation you want</p>
