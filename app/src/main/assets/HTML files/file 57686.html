<p>Calling <code>Bundle.main()</code> gets you the <em>main bundle</em>âthe one containing the running app. In an app extension, that's not the bundle you're looking for. </p>

<p>To get the bundle for your app extension (or framework, or any other non-app target), use either:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsbundle/1417717-init" rel="nofollow"><code>Bundle(for:)</code></a>, passing a class specific to the app extension, or</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsbundle/1411929-init" rel="nofollow"><code>Bundle(identifier:)</code></a>, passing the identifier for the bundle ("com.example.myapp.myextension", for example)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, make sure the resources you need go into your extension bundle when building. Your extension can't load resources belonging to your app or vice versa. </p>
