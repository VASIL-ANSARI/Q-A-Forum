<p>The approach that I've found works for me is having seperate JS files for each class (just as you would in Java, C# and others). Alternatively you can group your JS into application functional areas if that's easier for you to navigate.</p>

<p>If you put all your JS files into one directory, you can have your server-side environment (PHP for instance) loop through each file in that directory and output a <code>&lt;script src='/path/to/js/$file.js' type='text/javascript'&gt;</code> in some header file that is included by all your UI pages. You'll find this auto-loading especially handy if you're regularly creating and removing JS files.</p>

<p>When deploying to production, you should have a script that combines them all into one JS file and "minifies" it to keep the size down.</p>
