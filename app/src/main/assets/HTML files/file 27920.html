<p>Normal processes close the input stream causing a SIGPIPE. In the man page, it mentions that <code>-m</code> stops reading, and "ensures that standard input is positioned to just after the last matching line before exiting". So it doesn't actually close the stream. You can demonstrate like this:</p>

<pre><code>cat file | (grep -m1 z &amp;&amp; grep -m1 c)
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get the first <code>c</code> after the first <code>z</code>, which is sometimes useful.  After the last grep exits, there is no place for the stream to go, so it's left unread and the whole group of commands exits. You can demonstrate:</p>

<pre><code>(while true; do echo z; sleep 1; done) | grep -m3 z
(while true; do echo z; sleep 1; done) | grep --line-buffered z | head -3
</code></pre>
