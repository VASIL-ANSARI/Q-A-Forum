<p>You can use DirectShow for grabbing images from video stream. For it you must <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/Tanvon_DirectShowFilters.aspx" rel="nofollow">create</a> your own filter node. It is complex task because of filter is COM object that will work within chain (DirectShow filter graph) of other filter nodes - codecs. So after creating you need register your filter in system. As for me i think you can try it because you can use all registered codecs in system and as result get decompressed/final image into your filter. As other solution i think that you can try to use modules from some open source media player. For example try <a href="http://wiki.videolan.org/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">VideoLAN</a> but as i know it is big thing and not easy to use.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
