<p>I don't think current mysql (5.7 VERSION) including such spatial functions (maybe in the future)

<p>There is line: OpenGIS proposes a number of other functions that can produce geometries. They are designed to implement spatial operators. These functions are <strong>not implemented</strong> in MySQL.</p>

<p>Therefore, since you can't do it in the MySQL, the only way to make it happen is on the application side, whatever you are using.
For instance, OpenLayer javascript can do this: (<a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/19964/how-to-merge-two-polygons-in-openlayers">http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/19964/how-to-merge-two-polygons-in-openlayers</a>)</p>

<p>Or, you can use an spatial-oriented database, such as <a href="http://postgis.net/" rel="nofollow">http://postgis.net/</a>, or Oracle Spatial :) </p>
