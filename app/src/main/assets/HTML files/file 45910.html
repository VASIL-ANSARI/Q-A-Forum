<p>Resolved with moment.js
Firefox is in fact giving a different date string, and not simply displaying is differently as stated by Xufox.</p>

<p>The function I am going to use is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>moment(new Date()).format("YYYY MMM D H:mm:ss")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but I will change around the .format, just wanted to get the answer here in case others run into the same problem</p>

<p>EDIT!!!!:
Xufox was right. I was a dummy. I had to manually edit some code in my timeline feed to get it going. I needed to use Date.parse on my generic time string, do my editing to the time, then use new Date. Thanks Xufox.</p>
