<p>Your definition of <code>main</code> is invalid. In C and C++, main has a strict definition (although arguments can be ignored if not used): </p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv)
</code></pre>

<p>A common extension is to also pass in environment variables:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
</code></pre>

<p>and if arguments aren't used at all:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
</code></pre>

<p>The arguments to <code>main</code> are defined as follows <code>argc</code> is the number of elements in the list of arguments. Each of the following <code>argv[0]</code> .. <code>argv[argc-1]</code> contain the arguments to your function. <code>argv[0]</code> is the name of the executable itself. <code>argv[1]</code> with your example would be <code>path1</code>. </p>

<p>So, you know how many <code>cams</code> there are based on <code>argc</code>. Of course, you have to copy the string values in <code>argv[x]</code> into the relevant place in a vector, using, perhaps, <code>std::stoi(...)</code> to make it into an integer value. </p>
