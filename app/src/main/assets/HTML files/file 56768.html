<p>Something like this would do what you're describing:</p>

<pre><code>import {Http} from '@angular/http'

class Picker {
  constructor(private http:Http) {
    document.getElementByID('date-picker')
      .addEventListener('date-picker-event-or-whatever', date =&gt; this.send(date));
  }

  send(date) {
    this.http
      .post('some/rest/api', JSON.stringify(date))
      .map(reposne =&gt; response.json())
      .subscribe(json =&gt; console.log(json));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this isn't a real code, just a principle. You'll have to decide where you want to do this (component, service...), how to catch/trigger events, etc.</p>
