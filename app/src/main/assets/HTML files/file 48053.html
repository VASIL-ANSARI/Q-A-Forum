<p>when i tried your code i got this error</p>

<p><strong>Ignored call to 'alert()'. The document is sandboxed, and the 'allow-modals' keyword is not set</strong></p>

<p>and when i tried after replacing alert's with console.log then it is working fine.</p>

<p>Your code is working fine, replace alert's with console.log()</p>
