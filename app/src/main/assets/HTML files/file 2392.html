<p>It's not clear how you're managing to expose a private class type via a protected property to start with, but as C <em>derives from</em> <code>KeyedCollection</code> it should already inherit the implementation of <code>IEnumerable&lt;B&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>It's not really clear what you're trying to do, but you should still be able to iterate over the collection... if you can even see the property. I suspect your code doesn't compile for other reasons - because <code>C</code> is declared in terms of a private member type, despite being protected, and because you're trying to access <code>C</code> from a different class in the first place (despite it being protected).</p>
