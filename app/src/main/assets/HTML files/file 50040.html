<p>From the IBM article at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1404_vines1/1404_vines1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/1404_vines1/1404_vines1.html</a>, it looks like it is not available and you'll have to go third party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The EJB Timer Service is not supported on Liberty profile or Liberty Core.
  If your application uses the EJB Timer Service, you can select one of these options:
  Deploy this part of your application in the WebSphere Application Server Full profile.
  Use other third-party scheduling libraries.
  Note: Although the second option is listed as a complex approach, its complexity can be simplified if a small number of timers are involved.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>A little further research found this thread which seems to offer a solution (at least there's an accepted answer):</p>
