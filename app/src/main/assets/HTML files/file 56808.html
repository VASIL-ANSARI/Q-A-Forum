<p>Don't use it in <code>viewdidappear</code>! It is a method which is called more than once in a ViewController. Instead use it in <code>viewDidLoad</code> which is executed only <strong>once</strong> that is when the view controller is loaded.<br>
 And you have to call it in the </p>

<pre><code>func didReceiveNotification(notification: NSNotification)
</code></pre>

<p>And after the function use:</p>

<pre><code>deinit {
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().removeObserver(self)
}
</code></pre>
