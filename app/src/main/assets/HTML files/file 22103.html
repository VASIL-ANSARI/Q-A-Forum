<p>That's a rounding error, because on your original sprite sheet, each cell should be 53x53.
But, when you load the bitmap, it makes it a bigger bitmap to fit the resolution of the device  (hdpi)</p>

<p>By converting from mdpi to hdpi, your bitmap grows 50%, and the cells should be 79.5 pixels wide. But of course, this number is rounded down to 79 pixel, thus the offset error for some sprites.</p>

<p>If your sprite sheet is a resource, then you should provide a hdpi version, which will be 735x636 pixels. That way, you'll be able to control the conversion yourself (and you'll discover that 735 is not a multiple of 10, so maybe you'll want to change these dimensions slightly).</p>
