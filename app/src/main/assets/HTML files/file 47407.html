<p>There is no waiter function to get the public DNS name. 2 options I can think of:</p>

<p>1.) Use <code>sleep</code> or some sort of while loop / <code>sleep</code> method until you can get the <code>PublicDnsName</code>. This is kind of hacky and blocks your thread.</p>

<p>2.) A more elegant way is to make this whole thing asynchronous by using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" rel="nofollow">Queuing</a>, or a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/124462/asynchronous-php-calls">PHP implementation of asynchronous</a>.</p>
