<p>The error message is saying that the <code>date_select</code> is trying to assign three values (year, month, and day) to <code>dob</code> but it doesn't know how to handle it.</p>

<p>It sounds like you may have created your <code>dob</code> column as a <code>string</code> instead of a <code>date</code>.  Can you check your migration to see how <code>dob</code> was defined?</p>
