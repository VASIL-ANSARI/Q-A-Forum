<pre><code>var a = {}; // There is one object in memory
var b = a;  // now both `b` and `a` refer to that object

a = {};     // now we create another object and put a reference to it to an `a`
            // we haven't changed `b` so it refers to the former object
</code></pre>

<p>And to summarize: in JS you cannot change the value of another variable. Value of variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the example above is a <em>reference</em>, not the object itself. And the only way to change the value of the variable - is to re-assign another value to it. So you cannot change the value of a variable indirectly in JS, at all (?).</p>
