<pre><code>this.value
</code></pre>

<p>generally you can use it with form elements and it is much faster then wrapping <code>this</code> as a jQuery object and then extracting the value.</p>

<p>However in some cases, specifically with select's, you can run into issues in older versions of IE when options with no explicity <code>value=""</code>, and jquery takes care of this for you with...</p>

<pre><code>$(this).val();
</code></pre>
