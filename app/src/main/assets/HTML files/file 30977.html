<p><em>Don't</em> use <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-gsub-21" rel="nofollow"><code>#gsub!</code></a> chained. (Actually, <em>don't</em> use <code>#gsub!</code> at all for most code.)</p>

<p>Switch the code to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-gsub" rel="nofollow"><code>#gsub</code></a> which doesn't cause side-effects (yay!) and always returns a string (yay!) - simply compare the result with the original (unmodified) string.</p>

<p>Also, one could use the gsub form that accepts a hash (since Ruby 1.9.something). This has a subtle difference that replaced values will not be themselves replaced, although it doesn't matter here.</p>

<pre><code>user_input.gsub(/s|ce|ci|cy/, { "s"=&gt;"th", "ce"=&gt;"th", "ci"=&gt;"th", "cy"=&gt;"th" })
# or since all are replaced with "th" (which I just noticed =^_^=) ..
user_input.gsub(/s|ce|ci|cy/, "th")
</code></pre>

<p>(I still recommend against <code>gsub!</code> because I find side effects upon strings disconcerting. However, it would work reliably when used with the non-chained forms above.)</p>
