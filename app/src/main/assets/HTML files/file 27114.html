<p>You'll need to specify a <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#lmode" rel="nofollow"><code>launchMode</code></a> for <code>DashBoardActivity</code> in your manifest. Choosing the correct mode depends on the behavior that you want. For example, <code>singleInstance</code> will ensure that only one instance of <code>DashBoardActivity</code> ever gets created:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity [...] android:launchMode="singleInstance" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, that also means that you can only use the activity for one purpose. A similar option that's less restrictive is <code>singleTop</code>.</p>
