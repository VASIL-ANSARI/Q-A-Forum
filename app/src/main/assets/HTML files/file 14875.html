<p>Set G_SLICE environment variable to reconfigure the GSlice memory allocator.</p>

<pre><code>G_SLICE=always-malloc ./your_application
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the related part of the <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.30/glib-running.html" rel="nofollow">GLib documentation</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This will cause all slices allocated through g_slice_alloc() and
  released by g_slice_free1() to be actually allocated via direct calls
  to g_malloc() and g_free(). This is most useful for memory checkers
  and similar programs that use Bohem GC alike algorithms to produce
  more accurate results. It can also be in conjunction with debugging
  features of the system's malloc implementation such as glibc's
  MALLOC_CHECK_=2 to debug erroneous slice allocation code, allthough
  debug-blocks usually is a better suited debugging tool.</p>
