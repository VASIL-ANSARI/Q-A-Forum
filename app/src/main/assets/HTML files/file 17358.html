<p>I would do it like this, where <code>day_of_week</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code> define the day and time you want the alarm to occur. You set calSet to the appropriate time for this week. Then, if that time has already passed this week, you add a week so it will be set to the appropriate time for next week.</p>

<pre><code>calNow = Calendar.getInstance();

calSet = Calendar.getInstance();
calSet.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK, day_of_week);
calSet.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, hour);
calSet.set(Calendar.MINUTE, minute);
calSet.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);
calSet.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0);

if (calSet.before(calNow)) {
    nextAlarm.add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_YEAR, 1);
}
</code></pre>
