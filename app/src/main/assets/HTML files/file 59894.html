<p>This is just a guess, because you haven't included enough information in the question for anyone to really know what the problem is.  Whenever you ask a question about code that generates an error, always include the complete error message in the question.  Ideally, you should include a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">minimal, complete and verifiable example</a> that we can run to reproduce the problem.   Currently, you define <code>function</code>, but later you use the undefined function <code>chirplet</code>.  That makes it a little bit harder for anyone to understand your problem.</p>

<p>Having said that...</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html" rel="nofollow"><code>scipy.integrate.quad</code></a> returns two values: the estimate of the integral, and an estimate of the absolute error of the integral.  It looks like you haven't taken this into account in <code>function</code>.   Try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def function(a):
    intgrl, abserr = quad(lambda t: np.cos(a[0])*np.sin(a[1])*t, 0, 3)
    return intgrl
</code></pre>
