<p>The <code>Server.MapPath</code> works only with physical locations that are part of the website. If you want to save the file outside you could use the following:</p>

<pre><code>var fileName = Path.GetFileName(fileurl.FileName);
fileurl.SaveAs(Path.Combine(@"c:\projects", fileName));
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure though that the account under which your application pool is executing is granted write permissions to this folder.</p>
