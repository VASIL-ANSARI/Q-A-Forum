<p>You need to get your appropriate <code>HashMap</code> from your list</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String,String&gt; map = cart.get(n);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>n</code> is the index of the HashMap in your list (remember the first list will be index 0), so if you wanted the first HashMap in your list, you'd do</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String,String&gt; map = cart.get(0);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can simply overwrite the previous value, since a key (e.g. <code>prefernces</code>) can only map to one value, this will overwrite the previous value.</p>

<pre><code>map.put("prefernces", "xtra salt");
</code></pre>

<p>Note that your keys have to exactly match, and in your code you've used "prefernces" and then in your comments you use "preferences", which are different spellings.</p>
