<p>You're dealing with a VB6 application from eons ago. "Thunder" was the internal name for the VB product/project (trivial side note).</p>

<p>You're closer than you realize. If you have the HWND to the control, and I think you do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call SendMessage with that HWND and the message LB_GETCOUNT to get the number of items in the list.</li>
<li>For each index, call SendMessage with LB_GETTEXTLEN and the current item index to get the length of the text, then allocate a buffer accordingly.</li>
<li>Call SendMessage again, this time using LB_GETTEXT message, same item index (zero-based), and the reference to your buffer, and that should get you each item's text.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might consider one more declaration/alias to SendMessage that just returns an int, which should make some of these calls simpler. </p>

<p>If I get a chance, I will clean this up a bit later with a more specific code example (or at least pseudocode), but I get the impression you're very much on the right track already and may only need this basic description to get the rest of the way. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
