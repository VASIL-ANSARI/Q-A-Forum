<p>I'm assuming <code>initgraph</code> takes a <code>char*</code> parameter, and you passed it a string literal, where it decays to a <code>const char*</code>. String literals are immutable, and by accessing it through a <code>char*</code> it would become possible to try to modify it and invoke UB.</p>

<p>I don't see why it would take a string by non-const pointer unless it intended to modify it, so you probably want to save the literal in an array.</p>

<pre><code>char str[] = "blahblah";
initgraph(..., str);
</code></pre>
