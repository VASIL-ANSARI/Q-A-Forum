<p>The <code>require_tree</code> directive in your <code>application.js</code> loads all js and coffee files found in your assets tree. If you remove it it will only load the specified files.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For me, "related to the matching controller here" means that foo_bar.js.coffee should ONLY be loaded when the foo_bar controller is used. Am I right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, files are loaded as specified via "require" directives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also... I would like to know how to conditionally include Javascript files depending on the controller's action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make a <code>foo_bar.js</code> file for each controller, in each require other files as needed, and conditionally include them in your layout</p>

<pre><code># some_layout.erb
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag params[:controller] %&gt;
</code></pre>
