<p>Sounds like you made the module a web project too? That means that they will run in seperate sites and not be able to share information.</p>

<p>You should probably use plugins instead. I've described how you can do it in my blog: <a href="http://blog.gauffin.org/2012/05/griffin-mvccontrib-the-plugin-system/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.gauffin.org/2012/05/griffin-mvccontrib-the-plugin-system/</a></p>

<p>If you only want to access files you have to setup a custom <code>VirtualPathProvider</code> which can access the files from the other library.</p>
