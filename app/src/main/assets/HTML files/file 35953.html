<p>only just saw you'd asked me for help based on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23145371/moving-a-photo-uploaded-with-dropzone-js-and-php">my related question</a> sorry, you've probably moved on by now but here's what I know. </p>

<p>I ended up taking DropZone out of my site during development due to other problems with it, it turns out HTML5 can be used to do everything I needed. In reference to your problem, I found I was unable to move a file using this method to any subfolder of an 'Uploads' directory.</p>

<p>So perhaps try moving the file instead to a completely different directory to see if it works. Also check if you maybe need to include a full path to the file starting with something like 'C://...'</p>
