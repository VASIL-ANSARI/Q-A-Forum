<p><code>attr_accessor</code> is built into Ruby, not rails. You may be confusing it with <code>attr_accessible</code>, which is part of <code>ActiveRecord</code>. Here's the difference:</p>

<h3>attr_accessor</h3>

<p>Take a class:</p>

<pre><code>class Dog
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name

  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    self.first_name = first_name
    self.last_name = last_name
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>attr_accessor</code> creates a property and creates methods that allow it to be readable and writeable. Therefore, the above class would allow you to do this:</p>

<pre><code>my_dog = Dog.new('Rex', 'Thomas')
puts my_dog.first_name     #=&gt; "Rex"

my_dog.first_name = "Baxter"
puts my_dog.first_name     #=&gt; "Baxter"
</code></pre>

<p>It creates two methods, one for setting the value and one for reading it. If you only want to read <em>or</em> write, then you can use <code>attr_reader</code> and <code>attr_writer</code> respectively.</p>

<h3>attr_accessible</h3>

<p>This is an ActiveRecord specific thing that looks similar to <code>attr_accessor</code>. However, it behaves very differently. It specifies which fields are allowed to be mass-assigned. For example:</p>

<pre><code>class User
  attr_accessible :name, :email
end
</code></pre>

<p>Mass assignment comes from passing the hash of POST parameters into the <code>new</code> or <code>create</code> action of a Rails controller. The values of the hash are then assigned to the user being created, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>def create
  # params[:user] contains { name: "Example", email: "..."}
  User.create(params[:user])
  #...
end
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of security, <code>attr_accessible</code> has to be used to specify which fields are allowed to be mass-assigned. Otherwise, if the user had an <code>admin</code> flag, someone could just post <code>admin: true</code> as data to your app, and make themselves an admin.</p>

<h3>In summary</h3>

<p><code>attr_accessor</code> is a helper method for Ruby classes, whereas <code>attr_accessible</code> is an ActiveRecord thing for rails, to tighten up security.</p>
