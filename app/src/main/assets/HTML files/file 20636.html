<p>Play's action method parameter binding mechanism does not accept JSON. You need to bind it manually. In your example, the code could be something like:</p>

<pre><code>public static void putName( String data ) { 
   FullName fname = new Gson().fromJSON(data, FullName.class);
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note, Gson is provided with play!framework distribution, so you are free to use it</p>
