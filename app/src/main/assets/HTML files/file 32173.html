<p>Hide it with css, either inline or by adding classes to said elements.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li style="display: none;"&gt;

<p>You can't solve it with javascript because the flash is happening due to the delay between the element existing on the page and the javascript executing.</p>

<p>this is known as a Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content</a></p>

<p>You can make it less obvious and almost unnoticible in some browsers by moving the javascript out of the dom ready handler and immediately after the element being affected, however, in some browsers even that won't be enough.</p>

<p>You may also want to change <code>jQuery(this).find('ul').slideUp('fast')</code> to <code>jQuery(this).find('ul').hide()</code></p>
