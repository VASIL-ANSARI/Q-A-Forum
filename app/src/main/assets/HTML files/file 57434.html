<p>If your using auto layout you should set the translateAutoResizingMask to false otherwise you will keep getting this error. Instead you should be setting the new location using constraints only before the animation block then call layoutIfNeeded in the animation block. As you are setting the constraints in interface builder that has the effect of setting the translateAutoResizingMaskToConstraints to false automatically. </p>
