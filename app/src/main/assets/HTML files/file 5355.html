<p>You need to set the working directory. Tibia.exe probably expects it to be the same as the executable's directory, so try:</p>

<pre><code>Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo {
    FileName         = Path.Combine(addressToFirstTibia, "Tibia.exe"), 
    WorkingDirectory = addressToFirstTibia 
});
</code></pre>
