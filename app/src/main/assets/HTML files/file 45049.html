<p>Good option is to use <code>Time</code> data type and then just discard seconds if you dont need that.
It will help you in future when you need any kind of calculations on that field.</p>

<p>you can use <code>ADDTIME</code> to your query to add the time in your time column as below.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ADDTIME(YourColumn,'0:20') FROM YourTable;
</code></pre>

<p>you also can use <code>TIME_FORMAT</code> to get the desired output (e.g. discard seconds)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TIME_FORMAT(YourColumn,'%H:%i') FROM TableName;
</code></pre>
