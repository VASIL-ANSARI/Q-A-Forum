<p>If the sorting is a business requirement, I'd write a test for the method producing (and possibly displaying) the sorted results. Pass it an unordered collection of <code>GroceryItem</code>s and verify the order is correct.</p>

<p>Putting a test <em>only</em> on the enum is probably the wrong way to go (though you can do both tests). The reason I say that, is that you're not guaranteeing your code <em>actually</em> sorts by department.</p>

<p>These would all go undetected:</p>

<pre><code>groceryItems.OrderBy(g =&gt; g.Name).ThenBy(g =&gt; g.Department);

groceryItems.OrderByDescending(g =&gt; g.Department).ThenBy(g =&gt; g.Department);

groceryItems.OrderBy(g =&gt; g.Name);

groceryItems.OrderBy(g =&gt; g.Department);
</code></pre>

<p>Even though the enum is correctly sorted.</p>
