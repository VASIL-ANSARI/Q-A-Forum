<p>As jQuery is AMD compatible, if it is already in the page Require.js won't load it again.</p>

<p>In a broader way, Require.js only looks the path configs when a module haven't been defined yet. So as soon you have a module defined, Require.js won't load it again:</p>

<pre><code>define('jquery', [], function() { /* stuff */ });
//        ^ Module 'jquery' is defined here. Require.js won't load it twice.
</code></pre>
