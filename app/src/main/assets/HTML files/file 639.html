<p>I find the best thing usually depending on how much email there is, is to just forward the mail through your ISP's SMTP server. Less headaches. Looks like that's where you are having issues, from your SMTP to external servers, not asp.net to your SMTP.</p>

<p>Just have your SMTP server set to send it to your ISP, or you can configure asp.net to send to it.</p>

<p>EDIT: I use exchange so it's a little different, but it's called a smart host in exchange, but in plain SMTP service config I think it's called something else. </p>

<p>I can't remember exactly the setting name.</p>
