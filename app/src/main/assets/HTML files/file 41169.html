<p><code>getSpecificProduct(...)</code> is accessing an list that is empty. You are passing the position of the Adapter into this empty list that exists on your <code>Pedido</code> object, which is not what it intended within <code>getView</code></p>

<p>I assume that you are trying to actually made a list of Products, in which case, why do you not just have your adapter use an <code>ArrayList&lt;Produto&gt;</code>?</p>
