<p>It is important to note that by starting with <a href="http://txt2tags.org/" rel="nofollow">Txt2Tags</a> you will be able to export your documents into <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" rel="nofollow">LaTex</a>. To my knowledge this is a one-way street, so by starting with Txt2tags you can still have the flexibility of LaTex, but by going with LaTex you don't get the benefits of Txt2tags.</p>
