<p>You didn't start your code block properly. At the end of the <code>for</code> loop declaration, you put a semicolon instead of an opening curly bracket <code>{</code>. Without code, this just looped through and removed the <code>mult3</code> variable from the scope, because it was declared for the loop.</p>

<p>This is the fix:</p>

<pre><code>public class multiples3and5 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        for(int mult3 = 0; mult3 &lt; 1000; mult3 += 3){
            System.out.println(mult3);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
