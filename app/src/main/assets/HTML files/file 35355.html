<p>Since you said that for each function there is a complete different set of controls, it is better to design 3 different dialog forms and use them separately. </p>

<p>One way is to design the dialogs in the Resource View, use single dialog box containing 3 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb774538%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Property Sheets</a>. You can hide the tabs of the property pages if you want so that you have one dialog box with 3 different forms.</p>

<p>Also another way is that you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4x1xy43a.aspx" rel="nofollow">Document-View-Architecture</a> of MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) and create 3 different views derived from CFormView. CFormView takes in the dialog template id (designed using Resource View).</p>

<p>Whenever the user chooses a function from the menu, you can activate a different view. Since you are using views instead of modal dialog boxes, it will appear as if the same view is being updated. But internally, you will have 3 separate document/views handling the processing.</p>
