<p>When you serialize a javascript date object to json it converts to date(time_since_epoch) so that it can easily be converted back with javascript.</p>

<p>.NET on the other hand likes a different format for dates... and that format is dependent on the localization of the machine.  Usually this is "mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ssAM" in the local timezone of the windows machine.  </p>

<p>Your best bet is to either convert this date to a string on the javascript side or to parse the date on the .NET side.</p>

<p>on the .NET side you can convert using the following to convert the string (once again dependent on the local time of the server):</p>

<pre><code> DateTime.Parse
</code></pre>
