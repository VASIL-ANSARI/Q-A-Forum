<p>The answer suggested by KM in a comment is correct.  It is not possible (and there is no reason) to alias the target of an <code>INSERT INTO</code> query.  Instead, it should be</p>

<pre><code>command.CommandText = "INSERT INTO Jobsites (CustomerID, JobsiteName) VALUES ((SELECT c.CustomerID FROM Customers c WHERE c.CustomerName = @cname1 AND c.BranchNumber = @bNumber1), @jName1)";
</code></pre>
