<p>Loading each and every single file as an include will add unwanted bloat and possibly slow down your site. What you might try is class autoloading: <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php</a></p>

<p>It eliminates the need to scatter includes all over the place but only the files you really need will be included.</p>
