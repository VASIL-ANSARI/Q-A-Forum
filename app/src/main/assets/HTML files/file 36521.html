<p>You can use bitmasking to play around bits.</p>

<p>You may find following links useful.<BR>

<p>For example ROL can be done as</p>

<pre><code>unsinged int arg = something;
unsigned int howmanytimes = some_other_thing;
unsigned int answer = (arg &lt;&lt; howmanytimes) | (arg &gt;&gt; (sizeof(arg) * CHAR_BIT - howmanytimes));
</code></pre>

<p>After studying a little about masking, you should be able to understand the example and write the rest of the operations by your own. Still if you don't understand any specific thing, feel free to comment and ask.</p>
