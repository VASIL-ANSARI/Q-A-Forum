<p>If anyone else has this problem, the solution was deceptively simple. All I had to do was add: </p>

<p><code>ember g serializer message</code></p>

<p>and then fill that file with: </p>

<pre><code>import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({
   keyForAttribute: function(key) {
    return Ember.String.decamelize(key);
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Easy enough! For some reason plopping it into <code>application.js</code> didn't work, but this got the job done. </p>
