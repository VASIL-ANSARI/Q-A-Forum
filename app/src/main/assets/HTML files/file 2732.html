<p>Well, separating servers out such that if one is compromised it doesn't lead to a compromise of all your data is a good thing, definitely. That's the main advantage you are getting.</p>

<p>You need to make sure, with the separate layout, that your SQL box doesn't allow connections (to the SQL server) from just any old IP; only the Web server (And, obviously, your external firewall would block that port anyway).</p>

<p>As to what else you can do? Perhaps ask on the networking forums. Many, many things come to mind :)</p>
