<p>If you want to use global variables, you need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>var1 = &lt;some value&gt;
var2 = &lt;some other value&gt;
s1 = &lt;yet another value here&gt;

# then create your classes

class Whatever(tk.whatever_you_want):
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2, whatever_arg):
       global var1   #whis tells the function to use the variable you defined already in the module scope
       local_var_1 = var1 * 100  # 
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, perhaps you don't know this already, global variables are usually considered bad to start with, but I don't think it matters much for you. It's going to matter when you modify and read the variables from waaay too many places to keep track of, but I'm not sure you're building that big of a script.</p>
