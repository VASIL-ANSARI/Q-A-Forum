<p>By your output I see you are using Ruby 2.0.0. Nokogiri doesn't have yet support for Ruby 2.0.0 on Windows x64; according to <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/864">Nokogiri issue 864</a>, this is due to <a href="https://github.com/luislavena/rake-compiler/pull/74">rake-compiler's current inability (as of May 7, 2013) to target the x64-mingw32 platform</a>.</p>
