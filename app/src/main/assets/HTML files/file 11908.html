<p>That can only mean that the generated <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element has an URL with <code>/../</code> inside which made MSIE and Jetty to choke. Please note that your JSP/servlet code wasn't even hit. It was Jetty who blocked the request immediately due to bad URI.</p>

<p>To solve the bad URI, just don't use context-relative URLs with <code>../</code>, but rather use domain-relative URLs. In your case that would be </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="&lt;%= userService.createLoginURL(request.getContextPath() 
    + "/processSignIn.jsp?url=" + request.getRequestURI()) %&gt;"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, I wonder what that <code>userService.createLoginURL()</code> is supposed to do. It seems to do nothing special at all.</p>
