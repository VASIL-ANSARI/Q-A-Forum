<p>The <code>b</code> variable is assigned at the top level the class, so it is a class variable. That means that you always see the same list object regardless of which instance you access it through (or if you access it through the class directly, as <code>a.b</code>).</p>

<p>If you want a separate list in each instance, create the variable with an assignment to an attribute of <code>self</code> in an <code>__init__</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>class a:
    def __init__(self):
        self.b = []
</code></pre>
