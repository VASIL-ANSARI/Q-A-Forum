<p>No you don't need to recompile, but you have to start your application with options like:</p>

<pre><code>-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport= dt_socket,address=1044,server=y,suspend=n
</code></pre>

<p>The port here 1044 of course can be changed.
If you application is running, open the debug dialog and attach the eclipse debugger to the application's JVM using "Remote Java Application" / New </p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that this requires that the precompiled app is start externaly. If you wan't to start it from inside eclipse, you would have to recompile otherwise eclipse can not find the 'Main' class to execute.</p>
