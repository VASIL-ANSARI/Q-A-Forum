<p>Fragment is like a pluggable sub-Activity, and each instance of Fragment must be managed by an Activity, though, each Fragment has its own life-cycle callbacks, but its life-cycle is directly affected and determined by the life-cycle of its host Activity. You can plug as many Fragments into an Activity as you like by using a horizontal-swiping ViewGroup such as the <code>ViewPager</code> , example Facebook app, it has 4 Fragments and they are wrapped in a <code>ViewPager</code> ViewGroup. In one word, each Fragment that you added to a common Activity will have the same UI like ActionBar or Toolbar or whatever. Hope this helps</p>
