<p>Try this: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cm0.User_ID) AS Users 
FROM mytable AS cm0
WHERE cm0.ActionType IN ('A', 'B') AND cm0.Date BETWEEN dateA AND dateB
GROUP BY cm0.User_ID 
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT cm0.ActionType) = 2; 
</code></pre>

<p>The above query will return <strong>the number of users who have done both action A and action B between October and December</strong>, but if you still want to use <code>EXISTS</code> then check below query: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cm0.User_ID) AS Users
FROM mytable AS cm0
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM mytable AS cm1 
              WHERE cm0.User_ID = cm1.User_ID AND cm1.ActionType = 'A' AND cm1.Date BETWEEN dateA AND dateB
             ) AND cm0.ActionType = 'B' AND cm0.Date BETWEEN dateA AND dateB
</code></pre>
