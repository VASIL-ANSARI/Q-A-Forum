<p>First of all if you want some kind of "auto submit" you need to handle the onChange event, so your select could look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select id = "SortBy" name="SortBy" onchange="submitForm()"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>jQuery style</p>

<pre><code>$("#SortBy" ).change(function() {
   //submit the form
});
</code></pre>

<p>Of course all kinds of toolkits like Dojo, jQuery and other (you mentioned jQuery - IMO it's always good to use any of them, at least for the cross-browser support) will help you with this. </p>

<p>Also, think about how do you want to post the data to your server:  asynchronously or not.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" rel="nofollow">MVC</a> and try to implement it this way. Create a controller which will handle the request (it may also validate it, some prefer validate on the model level), create a model which will save the chosen option if you want it persistent and prepare a view to interact with the user. It may be just "Your choice was successfuly saved", but it really depends on how you actually want it.</p>
