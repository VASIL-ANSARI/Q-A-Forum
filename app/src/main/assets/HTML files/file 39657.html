<p>You cannot subtract characters from a string, but you can extract a part of a string using the <code>substring()</code> method, which takes two parameters: the index of the first character you want to include in your "cut", and the index of the first character <em>after</em> the last character you want to include.</p>

<p><strike>However, in this case, you might be better off generating a new <code>String</code> for each line: <code>new String(' ', x)</code> will give you a <code>String</code> that consists of <code>x</code> spaces.</strike> (Sorry, language confusion: that constructor exists in C#, but not in Java.)</p>

<p>For later (when you start writing bigger programs that process larger amounts of data), be aware that string concatenation (<code>+</code>) and <code>substring()</code> are slower the bigger the string is. If you need to gradually manipulate a large string, you should use a <code>StringBuffer</code> or a <code>StringBuilder</code>.</p>
