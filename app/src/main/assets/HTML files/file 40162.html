<p>The only way to globally receive touch gestures is by using an <code>AccessibilityService</code> with the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityServiceInfo.html#FLAG_REQUEST_TOUCH_EXPLORATION_MODE" rel="nofollow">FLAG_REQUEST_TOUCH_EXPLORATION_MODE</a> flag enabled. When such an <code>AccessibilityService</code> is active, "touch exploration mode" will be entered. The result is that (cited from the link above)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this mode a single finger moving on the screen behaves as a mouse pointer hovering over the user interface. The system will also detect certain gestures performed on the touch screen and notify this service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gestures which are detected by the system are listed in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService.html" rel="nofollow">AccessibilityService documentation</a>. Please consider that this has a high impact on using the system in general.
Additionally, the <code>AccessibilityService</code> would have to be manually enabled by the user via the accessibility system settings.</p>
