<p>In short, RestKit now supports the <code>@parent</code> and <code>@root</code> mapping keys as part of the <a href="https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/issues/1327#ref-pullrequest-15281421" rel="nofollow">development branch</a>. This allows access to the parent nodes of the currently mapped object IF it is being mapped as a relationship of its parent entity.</p>

<p>This is very similar to another issue I had, I can provide an answer to the specific case above in more detail if required, otherwise please take a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16957907/1130260">this answer</a>.</p>
