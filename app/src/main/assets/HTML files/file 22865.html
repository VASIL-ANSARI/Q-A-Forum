<p>How about:</p>

<ol>
<li>Iterate though L1</li>
<li>Iterate though L2</li>
<li>If (in L1 and L2) and not in L -> add to L</li>
</ol>

<p>Not particularly efficient, but in code it would look something like this (with repetitions to make the point):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; L1 = [1,2,3,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; L2 = [2,3,4,4,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; L = list()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for v1 in L1:
        for v2 in L2:
            if v1 == v2 and v1 not in L:
                L.append(v1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; L
[2,3,4]
</code></pre>

<p>You avoid deleting from L1 and L2 simply by checking if the element is already in L and adding to L if it is not. Then it doesn't matter if there are repetitions in L1 and L2.</p>
