<p>I found this in the book <em>Learning React Native</em> and thought you might find this quote helpful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you receive a warning about a missing package, run android and check to see if
  that package is listed as âinstalledâ. If not, install it. If it is installed, but React Native
  canât find it, follow the steps above to try and fix any issues with your development
  environment. You should also check to make sure that your <code>ANDROID_HOME</code> environâ
  ment variable is properly set and points to your installation of the Android SDK. For
  example, on my system:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>$ echo $ANDROID_HOME
/usr/local/opt/android-sdk
</code></pre>
