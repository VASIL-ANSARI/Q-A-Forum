<p>Minimum number of streams that can be opened = guarantee that at least so many can be opened</p>

<p>Maximum number of streams that can be opened = guarantee that opening any more will certainly fail</p>

<p>What the wording means that if you have less than FOPEN_MAX streams open, it is guaranteed that at least one more can be opened, and the system does not necessarily provide any hard maximum</p>
