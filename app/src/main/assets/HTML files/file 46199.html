<p>In case of rails, start by looking at Rack:<br>

<p>So effectively when the request hits rails (or sinatra or whatever you are using that conforms to rack) it's in a standard format. Rails only has to worry about that. Not worrying is usually good and means that you can focus on the app. The downside of it is that you have to learn the conventions the framework you are using follows to be effective in using it.</p>
