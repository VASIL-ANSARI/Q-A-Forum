<p>Your problem is right here:</p>

<pre><code>sender.sendMessage("Player:" + " " + arguments[0]);
</code></pre>

<p><code>arguments[0]</code> takes the first element in the arguments array. However, since you only typed /group, there are no arguments, so it throws an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0</code> because its trying to access the zero'th element in the array, but it doesn't even exist.</p>

<p>To fix this you need to first check if there are any arguments in the command. You can do this by getting <code>arguments.length</code> and checking if it is greater than 0 or equal to however many arguments you want there to be.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>if(arguments.length &gt; 0){
    sender.sendMessage("Player:" + " " + arguments[0]);
    //Do other stuff
}else{
    sender.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + "That is not how you run the command!");
}
</code></pre>
