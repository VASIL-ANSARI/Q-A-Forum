<p>This means that it's work on devices which got their resolution beween 420 and 768px, so it wont apply to devices which got lower or higher resolutions than this. If you have web developer tools installed on mozilla press Ctrl+Shift+M and try to resize the window, there you can see the actual resolution on it, if it doesn't apply there in this scale of resolution (420 -> 768), it should be a CSS error, try to validate your code. </p>

<p>PS:Hope i get your question correct.</p>
