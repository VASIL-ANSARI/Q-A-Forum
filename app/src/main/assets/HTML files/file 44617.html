<p>I would use Cloud Code and a Parse.Cloud.afterSave trigger.</p>

<p>You could then either send a Push Notification to all users or flag the data as new and let your clients query for new data regularly.</p>

<p>Note. If you are planning on iOS app development also I don't believe the apple notification service is a reliable way of pushing new data to users. More on that: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6591550/is-apples-push-notification-service-reliable">Is Apple&#39;s push notification service reliable?</a></p>
