<p>This is a security feature. The <code>NamedTemporaryFile</code> is always created with mode <code>0600</code>, hardcoded at <a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/63bde882e311/Lib/tempfile.py#l235"><code>tempfile.py</code>, line 235</a>, because it is private to your process until you open it up with <code>chmod</code>. There is no constructor argument to change this behavior.</p>
