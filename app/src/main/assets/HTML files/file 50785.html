<p>One possible way is to have a year table, a week table (with weeks from 1 to 52) and a table connecting both (like weeks_in_year) where you keep the id of both the year and the week. </p>

<p>Another, quicker way, is to have just one table with two columns: week and year, and just search by the year field when you need to get the weeks.. </p>
