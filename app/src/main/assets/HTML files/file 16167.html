<p>The Dropbox SDK does not support search (it only supports a subset of the Dropbox API). To do what you need effenciently, call the search method of the REST API directly</p>

<p>If you want to stick with the SDK, you can call loadMetadata recursively for each folder level until you find the file you are looking for. But I do not recommend this (imagine if your user is on the cell network as you make tens or hundreds of calls). </p>
