<h2>Possible root cause</h2>

<p>I had the same problem, and figured out it was happening because I wasn't setting the root view controller in my application window. </p>

<p>The <code>UIViewController</code> in which I had implemented the <code>preferredStatusBarStyle</code> was used in a <code>UITabBarController</code>, which controlled the appearance of the views on the screen.</p>

<p>When I set the root view controller to point to this <code>UITabBarController</code>, the status bar changes started to work correctly, as expected (and the <code>preferredStatusBarStyle</code> method was getting called).</p>

<pre><code>(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    ... // other view controller loading/setup code

    self.window.rootViewController = rootTabBarController;
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Alternative method (Deprecated in iOS 9)</h2>

<p>Alternatively, you can call one of the following methods, as appropriate, in each of your view controllers, depending on its background color, instead of having to use <code>setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyle:UIStatusBarStyleLightContent];
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarStyle:UIStatusBarStyleDefault];
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you'll also need to set <code>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</code> to <code>NO</code> in the plist file if you use this method.</p>
