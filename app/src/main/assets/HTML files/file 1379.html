<p>Just use <code>macs.getMacAddress();</code></p>

<p>The function doesn't return anything. It simply writes to the document. If you want it to return the string, replace <code>document.write</code> with <code>return</code> when you define <code>macs</code>.</p>

<p>Also, note that calling <code>document.write</code> after the page is loaded will overwrite the current page (because it implies document.open). If you need to append to the document after it's loaded, use the DOM or innerHTML.</p>
