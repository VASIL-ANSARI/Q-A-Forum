<p>with the bit of code provided it's a bit hard to get to a proper solution fitting your needs. </p>

<p>generally (and as you asked for only an idea of how you could do it) however, I'd go with using the <em>success</em> event from dropzone.js which provides the server response as the second parameter according to there <a href="http://www.dropzonejs.com/#event-success" rel="nofollow">Documentation</a>. </p>

<p>So what you do is reading out the data from the uploaded file using your <strong>upload.php</strong> and returning it so you can use it in the told event.</p>

<p>Easiest way (as always) is using jQuery with it to have full control of the response and assign the provided text/code/whatever to the </p>

<p><code>$('#editor').val();</code></p>
