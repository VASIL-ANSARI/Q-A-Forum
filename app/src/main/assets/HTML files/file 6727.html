<p>You have your degrees to radians conversion backwards. Should be:</p>

<pre><code>x = Math::cos(angle_as_degrees * Math::PI / 180) * @radius
y = Math::sin(angle_as_degrees * Math::PI / 180) * @radius
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you still have problems if any slice is greater than 50%, but that's separate from this question. :)</p>
