<p>Because you corrupted the stream. You shouldn't have had the serialized data in a String in the first place. The round trip back to byte[] is lossy. Just pass the byte[] array around.</p>

<p>Repeat after me. String is not a container for binary data. Write out 100 times ;-)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> 0x54696765 is "Tige". You didn't have a serialized object in the first place. You already had the String.</p>

<p>NB You don't need to close the ByteArrayInputStream if you are closing the wrapping ObjectInputStream, and as that only wraps a ByteArrayInputStream you don't really need to close that either.</p>
