<p>It is <strong>not possible to interact with anything in iframe within different domain</strong>. You must use HTTP PHP proxy that will edit the page you display so all links DO redirect on your site.<br>
So the solution would be to have a PHP script that downloads the site you display in iframe, chang ALL links from <code>http://differentsite.com/path/file.php</code> to <code>http://mysite.com/script.php?path=path/file.php</code> so that if the user clicks the link, he gets in your IFRAME view again.<br>
This is how HTTP proxies do work.</p>
