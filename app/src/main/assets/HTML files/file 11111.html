<p>Regarding this issue, make sure the IDs are unique. You may as well try the jQuery UI datepicker (that automatically binds to all text boxes with a user defined class/ID and has good cross browser support): <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/" rel="nofollow">http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/</a></p>

<p>Add it to your textBox by using:</p>

<pre><code>$(".datepicker").datepicker();
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure the textbox classes include datepicker.</p>
