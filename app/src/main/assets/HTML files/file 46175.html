<p>Ok, so coorasse's suggestion to use create! forced the app to uncover a validation error.  The initial error (Couldn't find Transaction with 'id'= ) was replaced with a new error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Month can't be blank,
  Account code can't be blank</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was confusing because it leads me to think of a model validation error.  Why am I getting a model validation error in a ControllerTest?  Also, the transaction.rb model clearly shows that that I've added validations to satisfy the presence of Month and AccountCode.  </p>

<p>So, I spent some time reading through "A Guide to Testing Rails Applications" on RailsGuides
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html" rel="nofollow">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html</a>
All the way down in Section 8, it shows how to include a block of code before each test.  Here is the new transaction_controller_test</p>

<p><strong>transaction_controller_test.rb (REVISED)</strong></p>

<pre><code>require 'test_helper'

class TransactionsControllerTest &lt; ActionController::TestCase

    # called before every single test
  def setup
    @transaction = transactions(:one)
  end

  test "should get show" do
    get :show, id: @transaction.id
    assert_response :success 
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>After this the test passed!   Unfortunately, the RailsGuides doesn't tell me <em>why</em> I would want to use setup in a controller test.  If any smart Rails gurus has some guidance on this, your comments would be appreciated.</p>
