<p>This question had me confused about quite a few things..</p>

<p>Here is a solution that writes an image file from a <code>Panel</code> of rather large sizes..</p>

<p>One of the limiting factors is the size of the resulting Bitmap. I have tested for sizes of up to <code>12.5k * 25k</code> and found it to work fine; the sizes may depend on your machine, though. I think you need quite some contiguous memory to create such a large <code>Bitmap</code>.</p>

<p>The other problem is, as your title suggests, indeed with the <code>DrawToBitmap</code> method itself. It looks as if it can't reliably write onto large Bitmaps, which is why I had to buffer its results in a temporary Bitmap. Nor can it work if any dimension of the control is over some size, maybe 4k, but maybe not..</p>

<p>The solution first creates a <code>Bitmap</code> of the <code>Panel</code>'s size. Then it creates a temporary <code>Panel</code> to house the large <code>Panel</code>. This container it small enough for <code>DrawToBitmap</code> to work. </p>

<p>Then it loops over the width and height, moving the large <code>Panel</code> up and left, pasting the portions <code>DrawToBitmap</code> brings back, step by step into the large <code>Bitmap</code>.</p>

<p>Finally it writes it back as <code>PNG</code> for best readability and size..</p>

<pre><code>private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(largePanel.ClientSize.Width, largePanel.ClientSize.Height);

    DrawToBitmap(largePanel, bmp);      // the patchwork method

    bmp.Save(yourFileName, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png);
    bmp.Dispose();                      // get rid of the big one!

    GC.Collect();                       // not sure why, but it helped
}


void DrawToBitmap(Control ctl, Bitmap bmp)
{
    Cursor = Cursors.WaitCursor;         // yes it takes a while
    Panel p = new Panel();               // the containing panel
    Point oldLocation = ctl.Location;    // 
    p.Location = Point.Empty;            //
    this.Controls.Add(p);                //

    int maxWidth = 2000;                 // you may want to try other sizes
    int maxHeight = 2000;                //

    Bitmap bmp2 = new Bitmap(maxWidth, maxHeight);  // the buffer

    p.Height = maxHeight;               // set up the..
    p.Width = maxWidth;                 // ..container

    ctl.Location = new Point(0, 0);     // starting point
    ctl.Parent = p;                     // inside the container
    p.Show();                           // 
    p.BringToFront();                   //

    // we'll draw onto the large bitmap with G
    using (Graphics G = Graphics.FromImage(bmp))
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; ctl.Height; y += maxHeight)
    {
        ctl.Top = -y;                   // move up
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; ctl.Width; x += maxWidth)
        {
            ctl.Left = -x;             // move left
            p.DrawToBitmap(bmp2, new Rectangle(0, 0, maxWidth, maxHeight));
            G.DrawImage(bmp2, x, y);   // patch together
        }
    }

    ctl.Location = p.Location;         // restore..
    ctl.Parent = this;                 // form layout &lt;&lt;&lt;==== ***
    p.Dispose();                       // clean up

    Cursor = Cursors.Default;          // done
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have drawn a few things onto the <code>Panel</code> and thrown in a few hundred <code>Buttons</code> and the result looks seamless. Can't post it, for obvious reasons..</p>

<p><strong>*** Note:</strong>  If your Panel doesn't sit on the form you should change <code>this</code> to the real <code>Parent</code>!</p>
