<p>First of all, jquery ready doesn't work very well with window it was designed for document. A frame encapsulates a window.</p>

<p>Also i think you need to load jquery on the page inside your frame to find the body.
Try without jQuery</p>

<pre><code>var doc = window.frames["main"].document;
var bdy = doc.body;
bdy.onclick = function() { alert("your text here") };</code></pre>

<p>The other thing that can also affect you is if your page in the frame is not in the same domain as the frameset. This would block any script from the frameset.</p>

<p>Also you can change to load instead of ready</p>

<p><code>$($('frame[name="main"]')).load(function() { ...</code></p>
