<p>No, there is no better way to do it!</p>

<p>Explanation: "Current era" (and accoridngly "before current era") is the "name of a field"(abstract/meta) of the ISO standard. Of course there is also <strong>no</strong> (standardized) country specific translation for these fields and no pattern which prints this output.(By the standard they are referenced in english only, and by jdk respectively only as <code>CE, BCE</code>). So what the original output shows: </p>

<pre><code>  AD
  Anno Domini
</code></pre>

<p>is correct, and the ISO-conform (english) translation of the era (of a date which is "in  the current era"). </p>

<p>To solve this, I absolutely agree with your approach (of custom date formatting), and going deeper into details: I wouldn't dare to change a single line of it!</p>

<p>The only savings potential I see is in "initialization"(maybe use a EnumMap for the TextStyles...and ... how many languages do you want to support?) ..and "by refactoring".</p>

<p>Thank you for the interesting "problem", and providing a solution to it!</p>
