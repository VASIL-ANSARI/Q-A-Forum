<p>If you don't want your fragment to be recreated and totally affected by the Configuration Changed mechanism of the OS why dont you just set your Fragment as:</p>

<pre><code>fragment.setRetainInstance(true);
</code></pre>

<p>This will prevent your fragment from being re-created when a configuration change is going on the parent activity as per Google's doc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Control whether a fragment instance is retained across Activity
  re-creation (such as from a configuration change). This can only be
  used with fragments not in the back stack. If set, the fragment
  lifecycle will be slightly different when an activity is recreated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope this Helps!</p>

<p>Regards!</p>
