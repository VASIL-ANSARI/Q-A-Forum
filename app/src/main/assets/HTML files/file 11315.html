<p>Instead of referring to the same store use Ext.create() to create a new instance of the same store for the second combo box. Use select or change listeners on comboboxes to trigger filtering from one to the other.</p>

<p>EDIT:
 Here is an example of such a beast :) <a href="http://extjs.wima.co.uk/example/1" rel="nofollow">http://extjs.wima.co.uk/example/1</a> 
This is not mine but sounds exactly what you are doing. Please note the way the stores are setup for each combo box. The first Combo CREATES a new store with the new operator - although this is not the best practice, it will work. The best practice is just to use Ext.create(..).</p>

<p>The second Combo refers to an existing store. In your case since you are reusing the same store definition you want to use Ext.create(...)  on both Combos. </p>
