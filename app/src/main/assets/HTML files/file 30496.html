<p>The way I've done this before, is to test if the difference between the two angles is greater than 180&deg;, and if so, add 360&deg; to the smaller value, and then do your stuff with those two angle values. So in your example, instead of interpolating between 350&deg; and 10&deg;, you interpolate between 350&deg; and 370&deg;. You can always modulo 360 the result if you need to display it.</p>
