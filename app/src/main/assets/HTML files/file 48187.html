<p>try the below.</p>

<pre><code>br = mechanize.Browser()

br.open("https://example.com/page1/")
br.select_form("enter the login form name here")
br["enter user name field here"] = 'username'
br["enter password field name here"] = 'password'
br.submit()  
</code></pre>

<p>I believe that the login form is not being assigned to the br object as you are missing the <em>select_form</em> function</p>
