<p>Have the page respond, so chose the option vale</p>

<pre><code>&lt;option value=""&gt;New value&lt;/option&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>have a script which onclick(); will make an text input box appear. When submitted send to a database and then make it a live dropdown.</p>

<p>Thats what I would do, long method but will get the job done and prevent further issues in the future.</p>
