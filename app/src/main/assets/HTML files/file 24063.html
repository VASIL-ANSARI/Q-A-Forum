<p>I have implemented TreeViews look-a-likes using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ExpandableListView.html" rel="nofollow">ExpandableListViews</a>. They're pretty easy to use and any invalidation required can be triggered very easy with calls to <code>#notifyDataSetInvalidated();</code></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mysamplecode.com/2012/10/android-expandablelistview-example.html" rel="nofollow">Here is a link</a> to get you started with ExpandableListViews.
The advantage of using ListViews and ExpandableListViews is that they take care of the algorithm you tried to implement above.</p>

<p>Hope it helps and it is not too late for a re-factoring! :)</p>
