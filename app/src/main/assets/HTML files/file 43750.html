<p>The 3rd argument of <code>glUniformMatrix4fv()</code> chooses if you want to transpose the matrix as part of uploading it. Since you use <code>GL_TRUE</code> for this value:</p>

<pre><code>glUniformMatrix4fv(modelMatrixID, 1, GL_TRUE, glm::value_ptr(M));
</code></pre>

<p>Your matrix will be transposed during the upload. Swapping the order of the operands for the matrix/vector translation to <code>pos * mM</code> compensates for the matrix being transposed.</p>

<p>If you want to stick to the much more common <code>mM * pos</code> order of multiplication, you simply have to use <code>GL_FALSE</code> for the argument, causing the matrix to be uploaded without being transposed in the process:</p>

<pre><code>glUniformMatrix4fv(modelMatrixID, 1, GL_FALSE, glm::value_ptr(M));
</code></pre>
