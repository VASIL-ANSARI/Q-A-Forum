<p>I would say , that You should not rely  on the  regex patterns  in this  case.  </p>

<p>Basically , you should know number standard you are about to accept  and this  will tell you how much 0-9 digits you expect to consume from user input. Everything that is over or under is discarded and user is informed  with "Please enter valid number".  </p>

<p>To get amount of digits, you need to take user input and remove all non digit characters from it. This will standardize anything user enters :  </p>

<pre><code>+44123 456 789
+44-123-456-789
4412345 6789
44 123-456-789  
</code></pre>

<p>etc..</p>

<p>and even</p>

<pre><code>+44 123-----456----789
</code></pre>

<p>to the same string  44123456789</p>

<p>After this done , if length of the string is matching with international standard  ,  we can start to break it by positions to country code, city  and analyze is there  valid  country , city , etc... </p>

<p>When you use regexp, you actually describing  what symbols you agree to meet on positions from 0 to X. So if you expect to have "+,-,Nothing,[0-9]" as first element, you need to explicitly mention this in regexp expresion <strong>(\+\-[0-9]){0,1}</strong> . </p>

<p>And this is only for the  first position!  </p>

<p>If you expect 15 of those, this will make regexp completely unreadable  not only by other people , but for you as well. </p>
