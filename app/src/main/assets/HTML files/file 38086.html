<p>You really don't want to do things this way. But first I'll explain how to do it, then I'll come back to explain why not to.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" rel="nofollow">Using Pull Requests</a> at GitHub has a pretty good overview, in particular the section "Changing the branch range and destination repository." It's easiest if you use a topic branch, and have the upstream owner create a topic branch of the same name; then you just pull down the menu where it says "base: master" and the choice will be right there, and he can just click the "merge" button and have no surprises.</p>

<p>So, why don't you want to do things this way?</p>

<p>First, it doesn't fit the GitHub model. Topic branches that live forever in parallel with the master branch and have multiple forks make things harder to maintain and visualize.</p>

<p>Second, you need both a git URL and an https URL for you code. You need people to be able to share links, <code>pip install</code> from top of tree, just clone the repo instead of cloning and then checking out a different branch, etc. This all means your code has to be on the master branch.</p>

<p>Third, if you want people to be able to install your 3.x version off PyPI, find docs at readthedocs, etc., you need a single project with a single source tree. Most such sites have a single latest version, not a latest version for each Python version, and definitely not multiple variations of the same version. (You could install completely fork the project, and create a separate <code>foo3</code> project. But it's much easier for people to be able to <code>pip install foo</code> than to have them try that, fail, come to SO and ask why it doesn't work, and get told they probably have Python 3 and need to <code>pip install foo3</code> instead.)</p>

<p>How do you merge two versions into a single package? The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow">porting docs</a> should have the most up-to-date advice, but briefly: If it's at all possible to create a single codebase that runs on both versions, that's ideal; if not, and if you can't make things work by running <code>2to3</code> or <code>3to2</code> at install time, create a parallel directory for the 3.x code (e.g., a <code>foo3</code> alongside <code>foo</code>) and pick the appropriate directory at install time. (You can always start with that and gradually work toward a unified codebase.)</p>
