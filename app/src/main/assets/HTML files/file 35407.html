<p>You don't need Visual Studio to create Wix projects you can use any editor (Notepad) of your choice it's just that you will miss IntelliSense and building from within VS. I believe you can still use VS to edit .wxs/.wxi (xml) files.</p>

<p>To build you just need Wix Toolset and MSbuild (.net).</p>

<p>Working with MSBuild documentation: <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/msbuild/" rel="nofollow">http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/msbuild/</a></p>
