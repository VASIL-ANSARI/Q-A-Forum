<p>You can use your own customized fields as long as the field is serializable , It will work fine in storm with more than one supervisor.</p>

<p>Because storm is a distributed data processing tool and when there exists more than one supervisor, based on grouping, certain bolts will emit the fields to bolts running on different supervisor. In such sutiuations, the output fields will be serialized and sent through network. This serialization can be of regular java serialization or Kryo serialization(to avoid network latency). </p>

<p>Hence you might experience exceptions if your jvm not able to serialize your output fields.</p>
