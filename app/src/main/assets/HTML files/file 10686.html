<p>Is jQuery the embedded resource or some JS that uses jQuery?</p>

<p>Either way, you only need one reference to jQuery in your ScriptReferences.  If jQuery itself is embedded in the control (terrible design) then you should remove it if possible. </p>

<p>Loading jQuery once at the top of the page has many advantages, however the first and foremost is the fact that other areas of the page might require it so relying on it to be loaded within a control is a terrible idea.</p>

<p>In summary, <strong>do whatever you can to not have jQuery (or any script resources) loaded multiple times on the same page</strong></p>
