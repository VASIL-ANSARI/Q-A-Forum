<p>Whenever an iframe or an ancestor of it are disconnected from the DOM, the iframe's contents will be cleared and the iframe will reload when it or its ancestor is reinserted back. This anoying behaviour occurs in Firefox and Webkit, but I think the iframes won't reload on IE.</p>

<p>As a workaround, you will need to find a way to reorder your code so that the iframe is only added <em>after</em> the tab script is done doing its thing to the container.</p>

<p>Chrome also apparently has an option that causes the iframe to not reload if you move it with adoptNode instead of apendChild but I do not believe it is cross-browser.</p>
