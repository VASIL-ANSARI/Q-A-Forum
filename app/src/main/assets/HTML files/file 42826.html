<p>This doesn't really answer your question about why your navigationController is not pushing your VC. But it is a suggestion about another possible approach.</p>

<p>You could instead add a new VC on the Storyboard and simply activate the segue when the <code>userDidSelectNewsNotification</code> method is activated. Then change the information accordingly to the event in the VC, specially since you are initializing it every time anyway.</p>
