<p>For cases like this I have found the best way is to set a variable in the callback to some meaningful value (or values - perhaps one meaning ok, and another failure), then in the body of the test wait for the variable to be set (including a timeout so the test will fail if the variable is <em>never</em> set) and then once the test knows the variable is set - assert that it has the expected value.</p>

<p>This is not a problem specific to JavaScript or any particular unit testing library; but it is  a problem inherent in testing asynchronous code.</p>
