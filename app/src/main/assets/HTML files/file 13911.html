<p>In Vala interfaces can still contain non-abstract properties and methods (but no variables). This means if you want to define an abstract property or method, you still need to use the <code>abstract</code> keyword, just like you would in an abstract class.</p>

<p>Since you did not use the <code>abstract</code> keyword here, the compiler thinks you're trying to define a non-abstract property. However non-abstract properties in interfaces need an explicit body (because the default implementation would need to use variables, which are not allowed). So that's why the error message is complaining about the missing body.</p>

<p>Just add the <code>abstract</code> keyword and it will work fine.</p>
