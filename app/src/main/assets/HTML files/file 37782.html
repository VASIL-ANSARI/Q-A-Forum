<p>Here is the problem: I compiled my code with GCC under Linux with --std=c99. At the link provided by @Joachim Pileborg in his comment to my question, I saw the option --std=gnu99.</p>

<p>Out of pure despair I tried it...and the program ran smoothly. The compiler obviously did something funny there.</p>

<p>Thanks to you all for your comments. </p>
