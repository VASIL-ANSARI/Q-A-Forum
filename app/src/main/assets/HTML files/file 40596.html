<p>You need double underscores for your init method in the Map class. You only have single underscores currently.</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, start_scene):
    self.start_scene = start_scene
</code></pre>

<p>Same thing in the <code>Engine</code> class </p>

<p>Also un-indent all your methods in the <code>Map</code> class one level. They should only be indented in one level from the Class declaration.</p>
