<p>'new' might be a reserved word which prevents from rendering, but I'm not sure about that. Did you set up the route for the controller?</p>

<pre><code>resources :new do
  member do
    get 'testing'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can generate controllers, actions, views and routes by using</p>

<pre><code>rails g controller new testing
</code></pre>
