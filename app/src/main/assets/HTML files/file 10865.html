<p>Please check if your path (including drive name etc) exceeds 260 characters. Because that's the maximum directory length for Windows. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Click here to see the reference</a>.</p>

<p>The reference also states that there is the possibility to create extra-long path names by prepending the path name with "\?\". That should expand the maximum path length to 32767 characters. But I have no idea if this can be used within PHP.</p>
