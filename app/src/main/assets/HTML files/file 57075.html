<p>I suggest you to enable error reporting by configuration.php file.</p>

<p>The lines needs to be added at the very end of the configuration.php file, right before the closing PHP tag ?> if your configuration.php file has one, otherwise just the last line in the file.</p>

<pre><code>$display_errors = true;
$display_errors = E_ALL ^ E_NOTICE;
</code></pre>

<p>After adding the lines and saving/uploading the file, retry the steps that previously led to the blank or partially rendered page and further error information should be displayed.</p>
