<p>you can actually do it using JPanel.. you don't need to do anything else..no need of desktop pane
all you need to do is design a <code>JPanel</code> and put a progress bar inside it that will link to a process and show how much it has been completed.
JPanel doesn't have normal frame functionality like minimize, Close etc and will act exactly as you are trying to make up.</p>

<p><strong>Update :</strong> Just tried doing what you wanted.
You need to start working on JFrame. and set its decoration to false.
in Netbeans, you can just go to Frame properties and set Undecorated to true
or inside code you can just write <code>setUndecorated(true);</code></p>

<p>then you have to design your frame, put a progress bar inside it, link it to a function, set its onTop value to true (which means it will always be on top) and set its position to center of screen. done!! you are ready with your window!!</p>
