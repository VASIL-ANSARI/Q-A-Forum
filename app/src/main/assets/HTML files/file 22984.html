<p>I know that it is a little late to answer this, but the issue is that you can only delete the leftmost table.
For this you need to reorganize your join a little. As you are deleting from 'le' table using left joins, you really only need those values from 'r' and 'l' tables which are joined via inner join, so start from 'le' table then inner join 'r' and 'l' and then continue to 'h'.</p>
