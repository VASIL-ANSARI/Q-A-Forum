<p>Everytime a request goes to the server, it executes the <code>Page_Load</code> event.
<br>
What you need to do is make sure you have a PostBack validation on all your pages:</p>

<pre><code>protectec void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if(!Page.IsPostBack)
    {
        //Not a postBack: Normal page load
        //Init your page here
    }
    else
    {
        //It's a PostBack (from a command).
        //Do nothing or init stuff your all your commands.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you put some breakpoints in your <code>Page Load</code> and your <code>SearchCategoryChanged</code> method, you'll be able to see what the pipeline looks like.</p>
