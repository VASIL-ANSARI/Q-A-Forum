<p>I'm not aware of a library that does this, but you might look at Hibernate's <a href="https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/2964ecbf1b74003fcc337b0574487c724638fe94/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/engine/jdbc/internal/BasicFormatterImpl.java" rel="nofollow">SQL formatter</a>. From my experience it does a pretty good job at prettifying SQL statements, but as always, it might not be exactly what you want.</p>
