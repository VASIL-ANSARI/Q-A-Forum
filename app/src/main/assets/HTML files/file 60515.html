<p>You need to add the PCLStorage NuGet to both your PCL and your platform specific project.</p>

<p>So if you have the following solution:</p>

<pre><code>PCL
Android
iOS
</code></pre>

<p>You would need to add it to all of them:</p>

<pre><code>PCL
    PCLStorage
Android
    PCLStorage
iOS
    PCLStorage
</code></pre>

<p>Why? Because the NuGet uses the bait and switch technique, where the PCL contains a simple facade with the bait. At runtime this gets switched out with platform specific implementation.</p>
