<p>As others have stated in comments, this has to be a memory allocation problem. On Unix, you can check <code>ulimit -s</code> in the Bash shell for your stack size limit, or <code>limit stack</code> in tcsh.</p>

<p>Since this looks like homework, I'll leave it to you and your teacher for a discussion on different memory allocation strategies.</p>

<p>P.S., it would be helpful in the future to indicate what type of failure you're experiencing, as opposed to just "it didn't work".</p>
