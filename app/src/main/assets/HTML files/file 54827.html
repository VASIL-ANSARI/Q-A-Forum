<p>A similar question about this same behavior was asked <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/12948682/1197605">here</a>.</p>

<p>And though I can't find specific mention in the API docs about the differences between full browsers and devices, the aforementioned question links to <a href="http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/map_events/map_events.html" rel="nofollow">a Maps API example</a> specific to events, which illustrates the behavior exactly as you've described.</p>

<p>In non-device mode, <code>center_changed</code> continues to fire as the map is dragged.</p>

<p>In device mode, it does not. Only <code>drag</code> and <code>mousemove</code> fire while the map is being dragged. I also confirmed this behavior on actual devices, both Droid and iPhone.</p>

<p>That being the case, I would say it's safe to assume this is an expected, albeit undocumented, behavior.</p>
