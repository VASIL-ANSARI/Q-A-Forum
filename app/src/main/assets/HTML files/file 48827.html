<p>Vendor prefixed properties are <strong>experimental</strong> features in <strong>specific browser engines</strong>.</p>

<p>Firefox is built around Gecko, not Webkit, so experimental Webkit features will not work in it.</p>

<p>Avoid using vendor prefixed properties on the open web (unless you are writing sites where the point is to experiment instead of being robust).</p>

<p>Firefox has supported <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/filter#Browser_compatibility" rel="nofollow">the non-prefixed version</a> for quite some time.</p>

<p>If you really want decent browser support, use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity" rel="nofollow">opacity property</a> instead. It has support back to Firefox 1.</p>
