<p>Well one way to do it is use dynamic sql </p>

<p>first build the query string and then execute it. That way you have full control</p>

<pre><code>declare query nvarchar(max)
set query = 'SELECT * FROM A
             UNION ALL
             SELECT * FROM B
             UNION ALL '

IF @type = 1
BEGIN
set query = query + '
            SELECT * FROM C'
END
ELSE
BEGIN
set query = query + '
            SELECT * FROM D'
END
set query = 'UNION ALL
             SELECT * FROM E'

exec(query)
</code></pre>
