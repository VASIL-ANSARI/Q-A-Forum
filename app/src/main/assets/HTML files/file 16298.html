<p>You shouldn't really have a collection of <code>Images</code> which is a control and does not belong there, instead it should be a collection of <code>ImageSource</code>, which then in a <code>DataTemplate</code> (<code>ListBox.ItemTemplate</code>) can be bound to the <code>Source</code> of an <code>Image</code>.</p>
