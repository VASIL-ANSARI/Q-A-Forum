<p>There's no module that fit your needs, a little development should be done to retrieve the result you are looking for.</p>

<p>You could use the <code>app/design/frontend/base/default/template/catalog/navigation/left.phtml</code> block for this. In that block subcategories from the current category are shown, normally this block only is shown on listpages with subcategories.
You can add this block to the homepage and replace <code>&lt;?php $_categories = $this-&gt;getCurrentChildCategories() ?&gt;</code> with custom code which retrieves the categories/menu structure.</p>
