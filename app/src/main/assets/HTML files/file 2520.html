<p>I would just have the tables <code>Article</code> and <code>Comment</code>, and the Article table would have a NULL-able <code>ParentArticleID</code> field.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Article
-------
ArticleID (int PK)
ParentArticleID (nullable int FK)
...

Comment
-------
CommentID (int PK)
ArticleID (int FK)
...
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do need a GUID, do not use it as the PK because it will not perform as well when indexing. Make separate fields for the GUIDs.</p>
