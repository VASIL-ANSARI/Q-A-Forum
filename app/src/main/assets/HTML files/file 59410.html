<p>The problem is that you are saying:</p>

<pre><code>let lower = searchBar.text!.lowercased()
</code></pre>

<p>But the <code>exercises</code> elements are all titlecased:</p>

<pre><code>let exercise1 = exercise(exerciseName: "Incline Bench Press")
let exercise2 = exercise(exerciseName: "Decline Bench Press")
let exercise3 = exercise(exerciseName: "Bench Press")
</code></pre>

<p>... so <code>lower</code> can never match anything in <code>exercises</code>.</p>
