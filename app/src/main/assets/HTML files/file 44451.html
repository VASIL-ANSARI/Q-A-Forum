<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd783449(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">Documentation</a> is clear by itself: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>IObservable</strong> interface represents the class that sends
  notifications (<em>the provider</em>); the <strong>IObserver</strong> interface
  represents the class that receives them (<em>the observer</em>). T represents
  the class that provides the notification information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in other words: <code>IObservable</code> is a one who pushes notifications to the channel, <code>IObserver</code> the one who ones subscribed, start receiving them. </p>
