<p>The log has your answer. Mono for Android provides it's own <code>System.Net</code> stack in <code>System.dll</code> but you're also including other assemblies, like <code>System.Net.dll</code> which includes the same type.</p>

<p>Since you also reference <code>System.Windows.dll</code> I assume you're trying to include some code from Silverlight (or Moonlight) and that won't work. At least not for for <code>System.Net.dll</code> (not sure what you're trying to use from <code>System.Windows.dll</code>).</p>
