<p>Here are your options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't give them the program, they've already abused their power</li>
<li>Have them enter into a license agreement wherein:
<ul>
<li>They can reverse engineer the program or even see the source code within the confines defined by your legal team</li>
<li>They can't do anything without inviting a world of legal hurt</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release the code as open source. You'd be surprised, if the "forbidden fruit" isn't forbidden they may just get bored and leave it alone.</li>
<li>Move the proprietary computation to your own servers, essentially making your program into a thin client.</li>
<li>Reverse engineer some of their tools. Enter into a cold-war of sorts.</li>
<li>Stock up on patents, and when you see your own code out in the wild sue the company into oblivion for violating your patent.</li>
<li>Pay the mob to run your "friends" out of town</li>
<li>Send them a basket of muffins with a note that says "PlZ st0p wit teh H4x"</li>
<li>Dress up as the ghost of professional integrity, visit each of the employees in their homes and teach them lessons about ethics and morality.</li>
<li>Buy out the company, fire all of the employees.</li>
</ul>
