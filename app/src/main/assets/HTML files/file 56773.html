<p>UIImage has various drawing methods like drawInRect. You've already figured out how to create a graphics context. You could use <code>drawInRect</code> To draw your image into the graphics context.</p>

<p>(Note that you want to use the longer form of begin image context that takes a scale and options. (I'm not at my Mac to look up the function name.) If you pass in a scale of 0 it creates a Retina context on Retina devices. With the code you're using it will degrade retina images to non-retina resolution.)</p>
