<p>You can do it following way but it is not good for performance. I don`t know exact requirement and fretwork are you using. So i am giving basic idea.</p>

<pre><code>$sqlparent = "select * from tasks";// get your task details from database.
$parentData = $sqlparent;// result from sql function.
foreach($parentData as $key=&gt;$value)
{
   $sql = "select * from Milestones where task_id='".$value['task_id']."'";// find the Milestones of the task
$milestonesResult = mysql_featch_array($sql); // run sql and get data from database it is giving you single record you need to create loop here. as i don`t know what are you using for PHP.
$value['milestoneslist'] = $milestonesResult; //task_id=&gt;array( here you can not use task_id =&gt; array as it is already there. if you do it it will over-right the task_id
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope you will get idea from this.</p>
