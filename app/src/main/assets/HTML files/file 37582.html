<p>JavaScript does not support possessive quantifiers.  The error you are seeing occurs because the <code>+</code> can only be used as a greedy one-or-more quantifier.</p>

<p>The chart you reference is from Oracle, and is explaining the quantifiers supported by Java, not JavaScript.</p>

<p>You don't need to resort to anything special to do the kind of matching you want.</p>

<p>If you want to match "a string ending in a <code>/</code>, with no other slashes in it, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>/[^/]+\/$/
</code></pre>

<p>One or more non-slashes, followed by a slash, followed by the end of the string.</p>
