<p>You'll need to store this data within a session first, here is a step by step guide for you which should work:</p>

<p>PHP:</p>

<p>Start off by starting a session (Include this on all pages of your site)</p>

<pre><code>Session_Start(); //Usually included at the top of each page
</code></pre>

<p>From here, once the user has logged in, you can transfer the data they entered straight into the session using:</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['Username'] = $Username;
</code></pre>

<p>As you have already set your $Username variable using the following line of code:</p>

<pre><code>$Username = $_POST['Username'];
</code></pre>

<p>Now that it is stored within the session, on your other page you can obtain it into a local variable using the following:</p>

<pre><code>$Username = $_SESSION['Username'];
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can do what you want with this, such as displaying it on screen by echoing it out</p>

<pre><code>echo $Username;
</code></pre>
