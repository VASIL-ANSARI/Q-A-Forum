<pre><code>btnadd = Button(root, text="add", command=callback())
</code></pre>

<p><code>callback</code> should not have parentheses here. That makes the function execute immediately instead of waiting for the button to be pressed.</p>

<pre><code>btnadd = Button(root, text="add", command=callback)
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Additionally, <code>if ent1 != 0 and ent2 != 0</code> is always going to evaluate to <code>True</code> because <code>ent1</code> and <code>ent2</code> are always strings, and a string is never equal to zero. Perhaps you meant <code>if ent1 != '' and ent2 != '':</code>, or just <code>if ent1 and ent2:</code></p>

<hr>

<p>Additionally, you should delete the <code>text</code> attributes from your Entry objects. I don't know what they're supposed to do since I don't see it listed in the documentation, but it looks like as long as they're both equal to one, typing in one entry will cause the same text to appear in the other entry.</p>
