<p>This is not a supported use of python-for-android. In order for your app to function, you need to interact with one of the available bootstraps - sdl2, pygame or webview. Kivy knows how to interact with the sdl2 and pygame bootstraps, and the webview bootstrap just uses an Android Webview to display content from a local web server (flask). If you want to use Tkinter, you would need to create a bootstrap for it (either a new bootstrap in p4a itself, or some python code to connect Tkinter to an existing bootstrap like sdl2).</p>
