<p>My approach would be to have an aggregate model or models to keep track of event types, dates and counts.  I'm not 100% how you should model this given your requirements, though.</p>

<p>Then, I'd fire off deferred tasks to asynchronously update the appropriate aggregate models whenever a user does something that triggers an event.</p>

<p>Nick Johnson's <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/deferred.html" rel="nofollow">Background work with the deferred library</a> article has much more information, and provides a framework that you might find useful for doing the kind of aggregation you're talking about.</p>
