<p>I imagine you have an issue with your data.  Assuming the data is stored as a <code>VARCHAR</code>, then the reason the above is working in your first query and not in your second query is because MySQL tries to convert the data in the <code>VARCHAR</code> field to an integer to compare with your first query.  It will take the all the first non-alpha characters to compare the integer against.  </p>

<p>This will actually be easier to show you.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/c6c75/1" rel="nofollow">SQL Fiddle</a>.</p>

<p>If you have data in your VARCHAR field such as line breaks, then the first query works because it matches up until the line break.  Same way, if your data was 123XYZ and you compared that to 123, it would be returned.  That's because MySQL converts 123XYZ to 123 when searching by an integer value.  </p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE inv_array  (id int, serial varchar(100));
INSERT INTO inv_array VALUES (1, '123XYZ
                                 ');
SELECT * FROM inv_array where serial = 123; #returns records
SELECT * FROM inv_array where serial = '123XYZ'; #does not return any records
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
