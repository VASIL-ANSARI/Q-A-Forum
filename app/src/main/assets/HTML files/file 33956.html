<p>My answer doesn't quite describe <em>why</em> it was downgraded, since the algorithms in Composer are quite intensive (that is why <code>update</code> takes way longer than <code>install</code>ing with a <code>.lock</code>).  They go through all of your dependencies, all of the potential versions, and what each dependencies' versions' dependencies are.  After getting all of this information it tries to come up with a "perfect" match.</p>

<p>Sometimes the slightest change in your dependencies, or a dependency's dependencies, can create drastic changes.  Also, you'll sometimes see that it is impossible to resolve your dependencies because one dependency may require <code>symfony/http-foundation ~2.5</code> and one may require <code>symfony/http-foundation 2.1.*</code> (this isn't what happened in your case, but it is good to know).</p>

<p>All in all, the moral of the story is you should be as specific as possible with your <code>composer.json</code> (especially in production).  That way, you can always be in control of what version you use rather than letting Composer decide.  Worse case, is you run a <code>composer update</code> and it cannot resolve your dependencies.  Then do some research on <a href="https://packagist.org/" rel="nofollow">Packagist</a> to see which versions will happily resolve together.</p>

<p>I suggest using either version <code>~2.3</code> (which is the same as <code>&gt;= 2.3</code> and <code>&lt; 3</code>) or <code>2.3.*</code>.  Then Composer won't even try version <code>2.2.5</code>.  Check <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#package-versions" rel="nofollow">Composer's documentation</a> to see how you can express different package versions.</p>
