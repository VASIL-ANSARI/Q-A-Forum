<p>If you do not have any interoperability requirements (e.g. you are just going to use the data with Python) and a binary format is fine, go with <a href="http://python.org/doc/2.5/lib/module-cPickle.html" rel="nofollow">cPickle</a> which gives you really fast Python object serialization.</p>

<p>If you want interoperability or you want a text format to store your data, go with JSON (or some other appropriate format depending on your constraints).</p>
