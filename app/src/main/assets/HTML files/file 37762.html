<p>If the key does not exist then <code>regKey1</code> is <code>null</code>, and the call to <code>regKey1.GetValue()</code> fails for the obvious reason.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>

<p>If the key does not exist, <code>Registry.GetValue()</code> returns <code>null</code>, and <code>regValue1</code> is therefore assigned <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of registry views and AnyCPU, you are asking for trouble at present. Presumably you mean to look in a specific registry view. You should be explicit about this by using the <code>RegistryView</code> enumeration.</p>
