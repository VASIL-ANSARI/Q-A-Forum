<p>then you can use GMail API's to use the OAuth token to access user's email

<p>You can create a web app and use your android app to access your web server database via API's you create. Using this data you provide a nice GUI for your android users and provide user interactions.</p>

<p>Another method would be to use only the android client without a web app as mentioned by Jan Gerlinger. </p>
