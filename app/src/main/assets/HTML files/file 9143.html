<p>You need first to put an expectation on your mock. For example I want to test that Invoke is called only once and that I don't care about the incoming parameters.</p>

<pre><code>mockDispatcher.Expect(m =&gt; m.Invoke(null)).IgnoreArguments().Repeat.Once();
</code></pre>

<p>Then you have to assert and verify your expectations</p>

<pre><code>mockDispatcher.VerifyAllExpectations();
</code></pre>

<p>you can do it the same way for the second mock, however it's a not good practice to have two mocks per unit test. You should test each in different tests.</p>
