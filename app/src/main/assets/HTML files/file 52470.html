<p>After fiddling around with the project files, I found that adding the reference to the original dll back, migrating the afflicted structs to a different file, removing the reference, and deleting and regenerating the afflicted Resx file (via moving a control on that form's designer) finally fixed the problem. Pretty roundabout, but it worked.</p>

<p>I also made a few changes to the Vector2 struct, which I assume played a part in the solution (perhaps versioning conflict).</p>
