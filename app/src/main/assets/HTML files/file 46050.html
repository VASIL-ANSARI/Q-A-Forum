<p>Because the loop exit the first time it runs. You have <code>break</code> inside both <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>, so if they're equal or no, the loop won't continue.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(cars.indexOf(userPrompt) != -1);
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you really want a loop:</p>

<pre><code>var found = false;
for (var x=0; x &lt; cars.length; x++) {
    if (cars[x] == userPrompt) {
        console.log("found!");
        found = true;
        break;
    }
}
if (!found)
    console.log("error!");
</code></pre>

<p>The logic:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to know if <code>userPrompt</code> is in <code>cars</code>.</li>
<li>I have to check each element if they matches.</li>
<li>For each element from 0 to length of cars - 1 do:</li>
<li>Is this car is the same as what the user want?

<ul>
<li>If yes, we found it, we don't need to check other elements, break the loop.</li>
<li>If no, we need to check the next element. Do not break the loop here, since I haven't checked the remaining cars and I don't know if they're correct. Repeat step 4 until I've checked all elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have I found it?

<ul>
<li>If yes, print "Found!".</li>
<li>if no, the user's car is not in the cars list, print "error!".</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
