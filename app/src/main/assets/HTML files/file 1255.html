<p>You are right in that WPF gives us a <code>Dispatcher</code> to make multi-threading simple; but if you want to separate concerns with the MVVM pattern, you'll need to implement a different threading strategy.</p>

<p>I've always found the <code>BackgroundWorker</code> class more than enough to satisfy this, pushing updates back to the UI thread, such that you can update the <code>ObservableCollection</code> in the VM and have changes propagate to the view.</p>
