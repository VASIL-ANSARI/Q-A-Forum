<p>Finally, I figured out the problem. It is the browser. For any reason only Internet Explorer works correctly with the webpage. Neither firefox nor other web browsers got the xml file. I don't know the reason but I would like  to find it.</p>

<p>If someone knows something about I would be glad of trying to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>
