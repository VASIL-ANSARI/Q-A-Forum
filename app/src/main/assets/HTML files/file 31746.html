<p>Short answer: yes, it does make sense to use AngularJS + jQuery + Highcharts/D3.</p>

<p>Longer anser: while I have no background with D3, I do use Highcharts on a daily basis in a large AngularJS application. I have found it to work seamlessly with AngularJS as long as a suitable directive is written.</p>

<p>The directive you found on GitHub looks promising, though writing your own (and perhaps a service to take care of the input data processing) shouldn't be problematic either.</p>
