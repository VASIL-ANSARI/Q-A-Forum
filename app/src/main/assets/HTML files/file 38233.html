<p>You have to add the JRadioButtons themselves to a JPanel and then add that JPanel to your JTabbedPane.  The ButtonGroup is a logical construct whose sole purpose is to make sure that only one JRadioButton can be selected at a time. It is not a visible component, and so you cannot add the ButtonGroup to any container.</p>
