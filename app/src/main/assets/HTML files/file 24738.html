<p>Try using either <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sf1aw27b.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Convert.ToInt32()</code></a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f02979c7.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Int32.TryParse()</code></a>. Either will accept a string and convert it to an Int32 instance. <code>Convert.ToInt32</code> takes a string (among its many overloads) and returns the corresponding integer value if a conversion is possible; <code>Int32.TryParse()</code> takes a string and an output variable (the <code>out x</code> in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16873075/486504">@Cyral's answer</a>) and returns a boolean which indicates whether or not the conversion was successful.</p>

<p><em>Also</em>, yes, we are generally happy to help here but you are also expected to try for yourself first and to state your problem clearly. Always try to provide a MWE (Minimal Working Example) that illustrates the problem you are having. Posting almost a wall of code when a few lines will illustrate the issue you are having is generally frowned upon. It might not always be easy especially if you are still learning but in doing so you may very well discover the solution yourself which will almost certainly help you learn <em>much</em> better than having the answer spoon-fed.</p>
