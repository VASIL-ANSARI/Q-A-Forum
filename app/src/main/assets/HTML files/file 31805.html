<p>I am assuming that <code>totalBetween</code> is less than <code>totalBothTeams</code> - in which case the division</p>

<pre><code>totalBetween / totalBothTeams
</code></pre>

<p>results in the integer value <code>0</code></p>

<p>If you are looking for a "percentage" type of answer, you can multiply by 100 before taking the division. You will still get "rounding down". Or you can do the whole thing in double precision and cast at the end:</p>

<pre><code>(totalBetween * 100) / totalBothTeams
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>(totalBetween * 100.0) / totalBothTeams + 0.5
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>the latter will round correctly</li>
</ul>
