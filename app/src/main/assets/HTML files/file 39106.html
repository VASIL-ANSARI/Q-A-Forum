<p>If you create user notifications using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSUserNotification_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">NSUserNotification</a>, on Mavericks +, setting <code>contentImage</code> does the trick. Strangely enough it's not documented, but it's exposed and in the release notes. OS X 10.8 or less would necessitate a custom solution.</p>

<pre><code>NSUserNotification *notification = [[NSUserNotification alloc] init];
notification.contentImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"imageNamed"];
</code></pre>
