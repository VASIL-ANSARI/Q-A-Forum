<p>Simply distribute it using OTA ("Over The Air" distribution).</p>

<ul>
<li>When you Archive your application using Xcode (menu Product -> Archive, I hope that's what you do already to keep debugging symbols so that you can symbolicate crash logs when testers send some back to you!), once you click on "Distribute", select the "OTA Distribution" option and follow the steps.</li>
<li>Don't forget to check the "Distribute for Enterprise" checkbox in the appropriate step and fill the requested informations (Product Name, URL of the IPA when you will upload it on your server, etc).</li>
<li>Once your <code>.ipa</code> and the associated <code>.plist</code> is created, upload them both on a web server, and make a link to "<code>itms-services://?action=download-manifest&amp;url=&lt;the_url_to_your_plist_file_here&gt;</code>".</li>
</ul>

<p>When the users will open this link from their iPhone, it will prompt to install the application on their device directly, without the need to plug their device to any computer.</p>

<p>There are many tutorials on the net about this, simply google about iPhone OTA distribution.</p>
