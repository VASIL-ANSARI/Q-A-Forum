<p>If your <code>GenericDAOImpl</code> is a simple wrapper around a Hibernate <code>Session</code> and you're compelled to create tests for this implementation, then I would suggest creating a very basic entity and a respective implementation of your <code>GenericDAOImpl</code> for said entity.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class BasicTestEntity {
  @Id @GeneratedValue private Integer id;
  private String name;
}

public class BasicTestEntityDao 
    extends GenericDaoImpl&lt;BasicTestEntity, Integer&gt; {
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you find you have certain situations where you need more explicit tests for this layer, simply add them and test them using mock/simple classes.  </p>

<p>Nothing here needs to be tied with your actual real entities that you're using in higher levels of your code.  That type of testing will surface with integration and unit tests for those specific modules and layers.</p>
