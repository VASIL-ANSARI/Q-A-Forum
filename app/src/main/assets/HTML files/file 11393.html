<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element (or the <code>-link</code> option for command line javadoc) only help with generating the links - but Javadoc stops at an earlier point, it can't really work with your app classes if they reference unknown (common) classes.</p>

<p>In this respect, Javadoc works just like Javac - you must somehow point it to the classes to be used, i.e. they must be in the class path. You can use a <code>&lt;classpath&gt;</code> element to point to the jar file or class directory, or a <code>&lt;sourcepath&gt;</code> element, to point to the sources (do this if you need to inherit some comments from them).</p>

<p>This is not needed for linking to the standard API, since it is already included in the compiler.</p>

<p>Note that linking in this way requires Javadoc to download the <code>package-list</code> from this URL - you can instead point to a local directory which contains this package-list file.</p>
