<p>It appears that you're looking for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer" rel="nofollow">Circular Buffer</a>. Here's a <a href="http://circularbuffer.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">.NET implementation</a> on CodePlex. You may also want to look at this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/590069/how-would-you-code-an-efficient-circular-buffer-in-java-or-c">How would you code an efficient Circular Buffer in Java or C#?</a></p>

<p>From the sample you've provided, it isn't clear how <em>exactly</em> this  relates to an online-mean algorithm. If the only operation allowed on the buffer is to append; it should be trivial to cache and update the "total" inside the buffer (add the new value, subtract the removed one); making the maintaining of the mean an <code>O(1)</code> operation for every append. In this case, the buffer is effectively holding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average" rel="nofollow">Simple Moving Average</a> (SMA) of a series.</p>
