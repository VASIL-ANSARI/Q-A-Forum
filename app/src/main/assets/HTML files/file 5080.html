<p>Although timespan exposes it's properties as ints I suspect that it's using a floating point value internally. Such issues are due to the way floating point values are stored.</p>

<p>Have you tried checking what you get from <code>TimeSpan.Equals(MediaPlayer.Position, oTimeSpan)</code>? I suspect this would indicate that they are equal.</p>
