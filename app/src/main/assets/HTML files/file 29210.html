<p>I use onUpgrade in my applications and think it works well.  I do take great care to ensure that the changes I'm implementing in onUpgrade are very simple though, like table creation or altering.  I would keep all structural changes to the database in onUpgrade and handle changing the data via a different method.  This separates the stability of your SQL from the content the user wants displayed, which you may want the user to change that data at any point.  </p>

<p>A simple onUpgrade for me might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
    if (oldVersion &lt; 3) {
        createTranslationTable(db);
    }
    if (oldVersion &lt; 4) {
        createStreamingColumns(db);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the users old version of the DB is 2 then both updates to the db will ran.</p>

<p>It sounds like you need more than a simple "Upgrading, Please Wait" on your splash screen while data downloads, so you would simply push the user off to another activity to gather your required input and then initiate the upgrade.  You can still keep structural changes in onUpgrade but do your other work outside of the standard upgrade flow.  </p>

<p>There are always problems that will require a more complex solution and cause you to go against the grain, but this is the standard approach I try to use. </p>
