<p>Pass the variable c by reference.</p>

<pre><code>void function AddT(int a, int b, int&amp; c)
{
    c = a + b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will make it so that any changes to c that you make in the function will remain even after the function ends.  My wording is pretty poor here; you can look here for more information:  </p>
