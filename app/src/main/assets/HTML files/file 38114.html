<p>The tables that you want to query must be in the <em>model</em>. If you are using model-first, it means you have to add them to the model. If you are using code first they will be in the model, if there are <em>navigation properties</em> from a class that is in the <code>DbContext</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have navigation properties in place, you should use them to access the related tables. Entity Framework will create the needed joins in the SQL automatically:</p>

<pre><code>var q = from u in context.UserProfiles
  select new
  {
    u.UserId,
    u.Location.LocationName, // Using navigtion property instead of join
    // Add more properties here...
  };
</code></pre>

<p>Explicit joins should be avoided when using linq, <a href="http://coding.abel.nu/2014/06/asp-net-identity-and-owin-overview/" rel="nofollow">see more in this blogpost I wrote a few years back</a>.</p>
