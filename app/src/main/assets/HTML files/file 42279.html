<p>Unfortunately, you can not have an Enterprise App and an App Store App share the same Bundle Identifier (= AppID). App Store Apps need be provisioned by a profile created in a normal Developer Account. Enterprise In House Apps need to be provisioned by a separate Enterprise Developer Account, as you can not create Enterprise Distribution Profiles in a normal Developer Account and vice versa. Once you set up the AppID in one account, you can not set it up in the other, because an AppID needs to be unique.</p>

<p>Alternatives: </p>

<ol>
<li>Don't use the Enterprise Account. Use AppStore- and AdHoc-Provisioning (for Beta-Testing) with the normal Developer Account</li>
<li>Try Beta-Testing via Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/BetaTestingTheApp.html" rel="nofollow">TestFlight</a>. It allows you to distribute Pre-Release versions of your App-Store IPA without the restrictions of AdHoc-Provisioning. You don't need the Enterprise Acc in this setup.</li>
<li>Use separate AppIDs. One for the Enterprise Account. One for the normal Developer Account. That would result in 2 different Apps on a device, once installed.</li>
</ol>

<p>To simplify your Push Notification setup, you should run with 1. or 2.</p>
