<p>You should not use one tomcat per App. The amount of tomcats should increase only when needed (really needed).</p>

<p>It is not true that you have to kill the whole tomcat, for one App update, you should only restart the specific context (going to <a href="http://your.tomcat:8080/manager/html" rel="nofollow">http://your.tomcat:8080/manager/html</a>).</p>

<p>About the URLs you can use an apache in front with mod_proxy_ajp configured to talk with tomcat (see this: <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy_ajp.html" rel="nofollow">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy_ajp.html</a>)</p>
