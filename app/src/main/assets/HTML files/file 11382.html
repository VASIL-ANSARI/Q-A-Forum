<p>They are essentially different things.</p>

<p>Rackspace Cloud Servers are similar to Amazon's EC2. They are <em>virtual servers</em> you have root access to. Nothing more. It's a concept known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service#Infrastructure" rel="nofollow">Infrastructure as a Service</a></p>

<p>What this means is that, once your server is up and running, you have to install all the software you need to run your app: web servers, databases, application servers etc...
These chores can certainly be automated, but someone from your team still has to do that.</p>

<p>Heroku on the other hand is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service" rel="nofollow">Platform as a Service</a> - You don't have to bother installing any software. They provide a complete solution stack where you can deploy your app to. You literally just need to put your code there.</p>

<p>What's best? That depends. I certainly don't want to have to deal with installing the software myself unless I absolutely had to. That way I can focus most of my time actually developing my product.</p>

<p>Sorry I didn't answer your three questions but it's hard to do so given they are two very distinct solutions.</p>
