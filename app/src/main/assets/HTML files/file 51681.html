<p>OH MY GOSH, i'm the dumbest man in Earth!</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> only the first .post1 of page has content loaded. Each of then have a <strong>categlink</strong> url value, wich is used to get the <strong>TLink</strong> url value inside the categlink page. Then i use the TLink with $.get to load content inside this .post1 div.</p>

<p><strong>The fix:</strong> only the categlink page from the first .post1 div actually has a TLink inside to use. The other ones was having no content matching my filters. So, this mess was all about data on server, and not JQuery or HTML.</p>

<p>Sorry for wasting your time, guys!
It's all fixed now, thanks!</p>
