<p>You can't. 
Oracle's JDBC driver does not support the JDBC XML type properly. </p>

<p>The only thing you can do, is to convert the XML as part of the query:</p>

<pre>
SELECT to_clob(XMLElement("name")) from dual
</pre>

<p>Then you can retrieve the XML using getString()</p>

<p>alternatively you can also use <code>XMLElement("name").getClobVal()</code>, but again this is part of your query and it can be accessed as a String from within your Java class</p>
