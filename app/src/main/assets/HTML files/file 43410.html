<p>I see a couple of issues.  usemap is an attribute that belongs in the img tag (not in the anchor tag).  Also, make sure that there are only single instances of map name="MapSys" and usemap="#MapSys" on the page. I would put the map element right after the img tag, and no extra anchor around that map tag.</p>
