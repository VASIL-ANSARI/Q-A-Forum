<p>Apple insist on certain industries using their paid/commission based In-App purchasing services, for example Music downloads and Books. This protects their rights and costs in advertising these apps and services for sale through iTunes. </p>

<p>AirBnB and Hotels are not currently on the list of Apple In-App services, so you will not get rejected for that.
Insurance is also not on the list.
You will have to satisfy PCI DSS compliance but if you are running through an existing service providers web browser and not capturing confidential data then you are probably covered.</p>
