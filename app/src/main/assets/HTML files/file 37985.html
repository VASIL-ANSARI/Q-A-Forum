<p>In practical terms, the way C++ programmers deal with this is by making the same error repeatedly enough times that they can generally recognise the "shape" of the error message rather than having to read it in detail.</p>

<p>Usually what I do when I get an error on a source line, is look to see whether I've done something dumb (without reading the error message in detail). Only if that fails and I can't see it, then I read the error message and see what the compiler is complaining about. Sometimes it's still inscrutable and I have to go back to looking for something dumb. In extreme cases this might happen a few times before I figure it out.</p>
