<p>Why don you use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/org/xmlpull/v1/XmlPullParser.html" rel="nofollow">XmlPullParser</a> for parsing the XML? I have never used your version, but seem to me that <code>XmlPullParser</code> will do it's job better, since you tell it to focus on <code>START_TAG</code> (for example) and then write the name of the tag you want to be found (<em>FL in your example</em>). </p>

<p>What <code>XPP</code> will do is, he'll read through entire XML document and search for the given <code>START_TAG</code>. Once found, you can do whatever you want with it, inside a <code>switch</code> case.</p>
