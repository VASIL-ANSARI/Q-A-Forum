<p>I'm guessing that the reason that most people wo are using Roboelectric are using Maven is that most people who bother to use Roboelectric are serious about their testing.</p>

<p>Given that they are motivated to put a serious amount of effort into testing, they are highly likely to want to be able to include their tests in an automated build, typically in a Continuous Integration (CI) server, such as Jenkins or Hudson.</p>

<p>When you want to do automated testing, you need a good command-line build.
Gradle is the brand-new official command-line build tool for Android, but being brand-new, is still a work in progress, and not yet widely adopted. The tried-and-true tool is Maven. </p>

<p>Lots of people love to hate Maven, but it gets the job done, and beats Ant by a mile.</p>

<p>So, it may not be a bad idea to use Maven (or Gradle) - it will give you a lot more bang for your testing buck than just running your tests in your IDE.</p>
