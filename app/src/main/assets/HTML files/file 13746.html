<p>First off, Java is fully Unicode internally (though not the latest version of Unicode, for complex reasons that don't matter here). 89 hex would be <code>\u0089</code> which is an extended control character (Character Tabulation With Justification), just as it is in the character set <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1" rel="nofollow">ISO-8859-1</a>; Unicode is precisely the same as ISO-8859-1 for the first 256 characters. From your description, I guess you're on Windows and have things configured to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252" rel="nofollow">CP1252 character set</a>, which interprets 89 hex as <code>â°</code> but conversion from Unicode is done (during printing to the console) by mapping to equivalent characters, not just blatting the bytes out; because that C1 control character has no equivalent in CP1252, it ends up as the replacement character (a question mark in this case).</p>

<p>The moral of this story is that <em>characters are <strong>not</strong> bytes</em> and you need to be very careful with charsets when working in this area. (Or you should use a fully Unicode system, where these problems largely go away, though at a cost of characters being much more complex entities than before.)</p>
