<p>the best way would be get the state from rails and not client-side</p>

<pre><code>UserModel.fetch()
// returns a user model if there is one, if not then you are obviously not authenticated
</code></pre>

<p>or, i think better, use a token as a param on your requests to the server</p>

<pre><code>?token={some hash the server gave you}
</code></pre>

<p>so that its not just a boolean, you need a token</p>
