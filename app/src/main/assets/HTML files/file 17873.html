<p>As far as I'm concerned, writing it to a file is probably NOT a good approach. You're trying to achieve a variable retrieval, and nothing more.
I'm not sure why your test variable is null. I just tried making this test myself and I could access everything just fine.
Your code that you provided SHOULD be writing the data to the session variable. First, be sure you're not killing the session somewhere later in that first script. Second, double and triple check your code to access the session variable. Without seeing your code it's hard to tell, but on the second page my only guess is that you're either misspelling the access to the variable, or you're forgetting to <strong>start the session again!</strong>
Here is the code for both of my files:</p>

<h2>First page:</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;?
session_start();
$_SESSION['test'] = array('var1' =&gt; "somevalue", 'var2' =&gt; "someothervalue");

?&gt;
&lt;a href='other.php'&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Second page:</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;?
session_start();
var_dump($_SESSION['test']);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That works fine for me- I get the full session variable spat back out. Give it a shot and let us know if you're still having issues (with more of your code so we can better understand whats up). Good luck!</p>
