<p>you should certainly not add try catch everywhere</p>

<p>you just need a top level catch of all exceptions. If this is a GUI app then just display a nice dialog with a button saying 'please report to support' (it can write out a stack trace snapshot to the screen or a file)</p>

<p>if you are lucky then the app can continue (lucky since you have no way of knowing if you are really stuck badly)</p>

<p>note that you can also do this</p>

<pre><code>        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += new UnhandledExceptionEventHandler(CurrentDomain_UnhandledException);
        Forms.Application.ThreadException += new System.Threading.ThreadExceptionEventHandler(Application_ThreadException);
</code></pre>

<p>but that doesnt stop it crshing, it just lets you capture the failure</p>
