<p>Instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>if (nameParts[2].isEmpty())
{
    System.out.println("No Middle Name Detected");
}
</code></pre>

<p>something like</p>

<pre><code>if(nameParts.length != 3)
{
    System.out.println("Invalid entry");
}
</code></pre>

<p>might be preferrable.</p>

<p>Basically, in the case that there are only two names entered, <code>split()</code> will return an array of length 2, whose elements are accessible by indices 0 and 1.</p>

<p>But in your <code>if</code> condition you attempt to access index 2, which could be out of bounds (it <em>would</em> be OOB for the case where you entered only two names).</p>

<p>To resolve this, you could either (a) try it like you do, but catch the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or (b) check first that split produced a properly sized array, then go from there (this was the approach I took with the change I listed).</p>

<p>I'd suggest (b), but both approaches seem fine.</p>
