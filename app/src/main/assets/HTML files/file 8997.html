<p>OAuth is used when your application need to access resources or perform operation on another service on the behalf of the user (without needing their credentials).</p>

<p>Depending on what is your Java application (desktop, web, mobile), you will use different OAuth flow as shown in the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/GettingStarted.html" rel="nofollow">Auth documentation for Google APIs</a>.</p>

<p>And no need for the user to login in the Java application, as long as they are logged in the GAE application, you should be able to retrieve an Access Token from GAE OAuth end points.</p>

<p>Note that GAE only support OAuth 1.0, when acting as an OAuth provider, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/oauth/overview.html" rel="nofollow">GAE OAuth Documentatio</a>n for more details.</p>

<p>Also Ikai recently made a <a href="http://ikaisays.com/2011/05/26/setting-up-an-oauth-provider-on-google-app-engine/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> detailing how to setup a OAuth provider on GAE/Java.</p>

<p>As a side note, did you take a look at the latest GPE version, it features tooling for developing Android Application with a GAE backend, as show in this year <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/android-app-engine-a-developer-s-dream-combination.html" rel="nofollow">Google I/O presentation</a></p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
