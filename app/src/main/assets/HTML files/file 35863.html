<p>When the object it's a photo, you can do this way:</p>

<pre><code>https://graph.facebook.com/fql?q=select+share_count+from+stream+where+post_id+IN+(select+page_story_id+from+photo+where+object_id+=\"{$object_id}\"+)&amp;access_token={$tk}
</code></pre>

<p>when the object it's a stream, or something like this, you can d this way:</p>

<pre><code>https://graph.facebook.com/fql?q=select+share_count+from+stream+where+post_id+=\"{$object_id}\"&amp;access_token={$tk}
</code></pre>

<p>Parse json, and get the field 'share_count'...Worked for me!</p>
