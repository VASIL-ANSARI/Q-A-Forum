<p>I suspect something went wrong in this step:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ckan datastore set-permissions | sudo -u postgres psql --set ON_ERROR_STOP=1
</code></pre>

<p>When it works, it should show a few lines on the console just saying "GRANT" and "REVOKE". If however you get full SQL lines of commands then the pipe isn't working and instead you have to open psql:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u postgres psql --set ON_ERROR_STOP=1
</code></pre>

<p>and then paste in all the commands that you saw in the console (you can paste them all in one go).</p>
