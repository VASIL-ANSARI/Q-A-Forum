<p>Your problem is this:</p>

<pre><code>KeyGenerator kgen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");kgen.init(128); 
SecretKey skey = kgen.generateKey();
byte[] bytes = skey.getEncoded();
SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(bytes, "AES");
</code></pre>

<p>As you've written it, your program is generating a new, random key every time it's run, which is never saved or displayed anywhere. Anything that you're encrypting with this key is effectively impossible to decrypt.</p>

<p>What you'll need to do is come up with some scheme for generating a secret key from the user input, rather than randomly generating it using <code>KeyGenerator</code>. How that scheme will work is up to you.</p>
