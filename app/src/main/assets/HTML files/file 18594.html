<p>I tend to like to keep the request handlers as simple and thin as possible. If <code>json.dumps</code> is not good for you and you don't like putting a bunch of format/serialization-specific code in the database module, I usually create a module called <code>serializers.py</code> for customizing the output.</p>

<p>As for best practices, I think it best to not put a bunch of, "I want my controller to return it exactly like this so I will put all of this specific stuff in my db module". What if <em>gasp</em> you need to return something other than json (unlikely, I know)!? It would be best for the db module to return db objects (rather than custom-serialized json strings) and have a separate module that knows how to serialize the documents.</p>
