<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>AlertDialog.Builder alertDialog = new AlertDialog.Builder(
    new ContextThemeWrapper(MainActivity.context, R.style.AboutDialog));
</code></pre>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>AlertDialog.Builder alertDialog = new AlertDialog.Builder(this, R.style.AboutDialog);
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: This is only available for API 11 (Android 3.0) and above.</p>

<p>If you need to to support Android &lt; 3.0 you probably have to create a custom dialog (instead of using <code>AlertDialog</code></p>

<p><strong>EDIT Added really sleazy reflection-based hack</strong></p>

<p>If you are really stuck and don't want to implement a custom dialog, then try the following.</p>

<p>After you've built the dialog and just before you want to return it, instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>return alertDialog.create();
</code></pre>

<p>do this:</p>

<pre><code>AlertDialog ad = alertDialog.create(); // Create the dialog
// Add listener so we can modify the dialog before it is shown
ad.setOnShowListener(new DialogInterface.OnShowListener() {
    @Override
    public void onShow(DialogInterface dialogInterface) {
        // Set the text color on the dialog title and separator
        setTextColor(dialogInterface, 0xFFE5492A);
    }
});
return ad;
</code></pre>

<p>Now add this very nasty reflection-based method:</p>

<pre><code>public void setTextColor(DialogInterface alert, int color) {
    try {
        Class c = alert.getClass();
        Field mAlert = c.getDeclaredField("mAlert");
        mAlert.setAccessible(true);
        Object alertController = mAlert.get(alert);
        c = alertController.getClass();
        Field mTitleView = c.getDeclaredField("mTitleView");
        mTitleView.setAccessible(true);
        Object dialogTitle = mTitleView.get(alertController);
        TextView dialogTitleView = (TextView)dialogTitle;
        // Set text color on the title
        dialogTitleView.setTextColor(color);
        // To find the horizontal divider, first
        //  get container around the Title
        ViewGroup parent = (ViewGroup)dialogTitleView.getParent();
        // Then get the container around that container
        parent = (ViewGroup)parent.getParent();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; parent.getChildCount(); i++) {
            View v = parent.getChildAt(i);
            if (v instanceof ImageView) {
                // We got an ImageView, that should be the separator
                ImageView im = (ImageView)v;
                // Set a color filter on the image
                im.setColorFilter(color);
            }
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // Ignore any exceptions, either it works or it doesn't
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I tested this on Android 2.2 and Android 4.0 and it works. It may not do exactly what you want, so you'll need to try it. I can't guarantee it will work on all devices or on future versions of Android, since it depends a lot on the way the <code>AlertDialog</code> class is implemented (if they change that in the future this probably won't work anymore).</p>

<p>Just a few notes for anyone who cares:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The reason that I use <code>setOnShowListener()</code> is because you can't actually get to the internal <code>View</code> objects that <code>AlertDialog</code> uses until after they have been inflated. They don't get inflated immediately when you create an <code>AlertDialog</code>, it happens some time later. Using the listener we can get control after the layout is inflated but before the <code>Dialog</code> is shown.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm using reflection to access in internal member variables in the <code>AlertDialog</code> implementation. Once I get access to the <code>TextView</code> that contains the title, I have to monkey around to find the horizontal line that is used to separate the title from the message. To do this I get the <code>Layout</code> that surrounds the title (this <code>Layout</code> contains the alert icon and title text). Then I get the <code>Layout</code> that surrounds that (this <code>Layout</code> wraps the icon, title text and the separator). Then I look at all children of the surrounding layout and set the color on all <code>ImageView</code> objects in there. The separator is implemented as an <code>ImageView</code> using a drawable, therefore it isn't possible to just change the color. Note: An alternative to using <code>setColorFilter()</code> would be to replace the drawable in the ImageView with a suitably colored drawable here.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for the challenge, it was kinda fun to figure this out :-D</p>
