<p>The rename is a question that's been asked on here so I'll leave that one for now.</p>

<p>For the percentages you'll need to create a character variable. TO calculate the percent use the automatic variable <code>_n_</code>  which is the row, but will also be the denominator for your calculation. Then use a concatenate function such as cats to create the variable in the format N(PP%).  </p>

<pre><code>data want;
set have;
array cc(177) cc1-cc177;
array dd(177) $ dd1-dd177;

do i=1 to 177;
   percent=cc(i)/cc(_n_); 
   dd(i)=cats(cc(i), "(", put(percent, percent8.1), ")");
end;

run;
</code></pre>
