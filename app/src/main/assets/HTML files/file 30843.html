<hr>

<p>Are those really six inputs that you parsed and placed in an array? Or is <code>TempStorage</code> a string of ASCII characters that was input? If it's the latter, you should be using a string comparison, and you should be using the proper ASCII codes for the character you want to compare. (This is <code>0x30</code> or <code>'1'' for</code>1<code>.) A string comparison stops as soon as one of the strings is a NUL (</code>'\0'`), meaning you don't compare meaningless padding if any exists.</p>

<pre><code>char *input = GetInput();
if (strcmp(input, "1234") == 0) { ... }
</code></pre>
