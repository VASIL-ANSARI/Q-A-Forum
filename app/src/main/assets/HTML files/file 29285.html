<p>You can use those blocks for anything you want.  Specifically, if you want to do something to the UI you should make sure to do it on the main thread as noted in the "special considerations" section of the documentation, "The cancellation handler may be invoked on any queue. If you must do work on a specific queue, you should dispatch to that queue from within the cancellation handler block."  So for UI you would use:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
    // Do work on UI
});
</code></pre>

<p>The completion handler pattern is common for dealing with tasks that are 'always' done in the background; I/O tasks such as downloading a file from a server.  In this case though it is also useful to define a single handler for pausing and cancelling because there might be many events within your application that invoke the pause: or cancel: methods on the NSProgress instance.</p>
