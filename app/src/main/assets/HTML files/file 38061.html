<p><code>.local</code> is treated as a special TLD on OS X, and I think iOS. I believe this is primarily because it's used <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3473" rel="nofollow">as an indicator for Bonjour lookups</a>. Try changing to a different TLD for your development domains. I use ".localhost"; I've seen others use ".dev". Both of those work as expected.</p>

<p>It looks from the linked article that you might have been running into the problem specifically because you were using <code>x.local</code>âa single label, which will be looked up via Bonjour instead of by DNS, so you might also find that <code>x.y.local</code> works, too, but personally I'd just avoid <code>.local</code> all together.</p>
