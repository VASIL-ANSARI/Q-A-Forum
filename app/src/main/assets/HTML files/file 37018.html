<p>What do you mean by 'get the file name when dragging a file'? Are you asking how to automatically copy the name of a file when you drag it into your WPF application?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To get the file name:
Try clicking once on the file icon, then click again on the file's name about 2-3 sec later. The name will become an editable text field and you can Copy the name before dragging, to be pasted into the WPF application.</p></li>
<li><p>To get the file path:
In Windows Explorer (file browser), browse to the file you want to drag. In the bar at the top of the window where it shows the folders you've gone through, right-click and select "Copy address as text". You can then Ctrl+V the filepath into any text field.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It's kind of hard to understand what you're asking (kind of tired here), sorry if my answer didn't help in the slightest haha.</p>
