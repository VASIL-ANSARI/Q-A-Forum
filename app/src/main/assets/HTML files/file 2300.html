<p>No, it doesn't seem like you are necessarily using MVC. Most of the time they are grouped by their real MVC names:</p>

<p>If I had to guess how you are splitting your files, your structure could look like this</p>

<pre><code>views/
  account/
    login.php
    home.php
    settings.php
    logout.php
controllers/  #maybe what you call modules
  account.php
  blog.php
  mail.php
models/       #maybe what you call "classes" are models
  account.php
  blog_entry.php
  comment.php
</code></pre>

<p>Just a quick reference:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong> odel = Class that handles all interaction with the database for a specific object/function and normally has a 1 to 1 ratio with a database record (And of course has relationships to other models).</li>
<li><strong>V</strong> iew  = Handles displaying content to the user. No business code (or very little) should be contained in these files. Database access, for example, should not be performed in the view.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> ontroller = Script that receives the requests from the user, decides which models to get involved, performs the necessary action (passing off as much as makes sense to individual models), then prepares the data to show the user and sends that to the view for display.</li>
</ul>
