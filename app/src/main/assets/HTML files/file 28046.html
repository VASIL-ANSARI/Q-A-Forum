<p>It's fine to write to the parameter, and <em>might</em> even be better performance-wise depending on how clever the compiler is.</p>

<p>On the other hand, your example could also be written as:</p>

<pre><code>s16 functionA(s16 sum)
{
  const u8 addy = 5; /* Assuming this is more complex in reality. */
  return sum + addy;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's no point in assigning to <code>sum</code> and then returning it, the two statements can be combined.</p>
