<p>To solve this problem, you need to figure out when the last quarter was. Then it's as easy as going back from there. Here's how I would do it:</p>

<pre><code>$minute = idate('i');
$qdiff = $minute % 15;
$lastQuarter = time() - $qdiff*60;
echo date('Y-m-d H:i', $lastQuarter);
</code></pre>

<p>Try to figure out what my code is doing. Especially learn how to use the <a href="http://php.net/modulo" rel="nofollow">modulo</a> operator since it's very useful for a large set of numeric problems!</p>
