<p><code>Enumerable#each_slice(n)</code> when called with a block (<code>{ ... }</code>) takes chunks of <code>n</code> elements of the series and passes them to the block as arrays.</p>

<p>The block is an anonymous function with <code>| a |</code> being the argument list. So, <code>a</code> becomes the chunk on each invocation.</p>

<p><code>p</code> is a built-in function which outputs a presentation of its argument (<code>a</code>) to <code>stdout</code>.</p>

<p>All in all, you are seeing the chunks/slices of three elements (plus the incomplete last one) being printed.</p>

<p>Obviously you've found the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_slice" rel="nofollow">Ruby documentation</a> already.</p>
