<p>Actually I've documented the development process of tangram!, find it here: <a href="http://gotoandplay.freeblog.hu/categories/compactTangram/" rel="nofollow">http://gotoandplay.freeblog.hu/categories/compactTangram/</a></p>

<p>At that time there was no option to render OpenGL polygons with anti-aliasing, so I made a demanding workaround to achieve the result (I wanted to add bump effect too, but later on I skipped). The point is in this post: <a href="http://gotoandplay.freeblog.hu/archives/2010/02/04/compactTangram_074_-_organizing_textures_performance_preservingincreasing_plan/" rel="nofollow">http://gotoandplay.freeblog.hu/archives/2010/02/04/compactTangram_074_-_organizing_textures_performance_preservingincreasing_plan/</a>
Funny.</p>

<p>Since than, you can easily render with anti-alias, and retina also a solution for that pain, so some polygon mesh, some shader for specular stuff, and there you go, or go with Cocos2D, as you mentioned, it has growing 3D support.</p>
