<p>One very simple answer to this question (if it's an option for you) is to use the Better Buttons module: <a href="https://github.com/unclecheese/silverstripe-gridfield-betterbuttons#creating-a-custom-action" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/unclecheese/silverstripe-gridfield-betterbuttons#creating-a-custom-action</a></p>

<p>It lets you define the actions on the model, which is a bit questionable from an architecture standpoint, but also works pretty well in the context of Silverstripe and ModelAdmin.</p>
