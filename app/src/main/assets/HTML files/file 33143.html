<p>The error means exactly what it says. The click event handler actually does the following:</p>

<pre><code>myButtonName.Click += myClass.ClickHandlerName;
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have a class assigned to the resource dictionary, it doesn't know what to assign the click handler to!</p>

<p>Because a control template shouldn't be tightly coupled to a specific class in the code behind, I would remove the click handler from the template entirely. Command is a better choice in MVVM anyways.</p>
