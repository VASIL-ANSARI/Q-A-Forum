<p>No, there isn't a pseudo selector to do that.</p>

<p>One certainly not optimal solution, however, would be to use this type of CSS:</p>

<pre><code>:not(html, head, body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, div, ...) {
  /* Code here */
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would work! On the down side if ever new elements are added you need to add that element into your not-selector. Yay.</p>
