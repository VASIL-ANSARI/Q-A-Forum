<p>As YllierDev said, you could look into a MobileSubstrate tweak to display the information.  But, for something that's <em>maybe</em> a little less daunting for someone new, you could try this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, create a <strong>launch daemon</strong>.  This can run in the background and do whatever you like.  It'll be started when the phone boots, so the user doesn't need to first run some app, and then put it into the background.  I found <a href="http://chrisalvares.com/blog/7/creating-an-iphone-daemon-part-1/" rel="nofollow">this to be a good example of building a LaunchDaemon</a></p></li>
<li><p>It sounds like you already know how to use undocumented features of the Core Telephony framework to get notified of a new call.  This will be your daemon's responsibility.  For completeness, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11236454/119114">see this answer</a>, or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14765396/119114">this other answer</a> on how the daemon can listen for calls with Darwin notifications.</p></li>
<li><p>When the call is intercepted, your daemon can contact your server.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you can create a simple popup with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2199642/display-cfusernotificationdisplayalert-on-iphone-lock-screen">something like this</a>:</p></li>
</ol>

<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>CFOptionFlags responseFlags = 0;
CFUserNotificationDisplayAlert(20.0, 3, NULL, NULL, NULL, 
     CFSTR("Hello"), CFSTR("Hello World"), CFSTR("OK"), 
     NULL, NULL, &amp;responseFlags);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's some <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFUserNotificationRef/Reference/reference.html" rel="nofollow">Apple docs on CFUserNotifications</a></p>

<p>You'll probably have to link with the <strong>CoreFoundation</strong> framework, and maybe <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-550/CFUserNotification.h" rel="nofollow">include this header</a> in your project, for <code>CFUserNotificationDisplayAlert()</code> to be available.</p>

<p>But, that should give you a popup with your dynamic call data.</p>
