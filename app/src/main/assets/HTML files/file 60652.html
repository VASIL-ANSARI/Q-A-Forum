<p><code>await</code> is not compatible with <code>Mutex</code>. You can use an async-compatible mutex like <code>SemaphoreSlim</code> or the <a href="https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx.Coordination" rel="nofollow"><code>AsyncLock</code> that I have as part of my AsyncEx library</a>.</p>

<p>However, if you need a <em>named</em> mutex, then you'll have to do something quite different. What that is depends on what exactly you're trying to do.</p>

<p><strong>Update due to comments:</strong></p>

<p>Since you're on the UI thread, there's no need to call into the dispatcher. You just need a <code>SemaphoreSlim</code> to keep them one-at-a-time:</p>

<pre><code>private readonly SemaphoreSlim _mutex = new SemaphoreSlim(1);

//Function that is attached to each pages "LayoutUpdated" call.
private async void AnyPageLayoutUpdated(object sender, object e)
{
  await _mutex.WaitAsync();
  try
  {
    LCDDriver.ILI9488.PaintScreen(sender);
  }
  finally
  {
    _mutex.Release();
  }
}
</code></pre>
