<p>Powershell can instantiate and use C# (or any .NET) objects just fine.  I've never tried having C# code invoke powershell commands, but I'd be surprised if it couldn't.  That said, the DLR route is good too, and in fact there's examples in Ayende's DSL book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1933988606" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/DSLs-Boo-Domain-Specific-Languages/dp/1933988606/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1308063119&amp;sr=8-1</a> that might be useful to you as well (even if you end up not using Boo, it's a good read).</p>
