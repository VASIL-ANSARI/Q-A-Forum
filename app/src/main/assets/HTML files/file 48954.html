<p><code>std::vector</code> does not reallocate every time an element is added. It reallocates when it runs out of capacity. And when it reallocates, it doesn't allocate space for just 1 more element. It typically allocates by some factor of the the current capacity. I believe VS uses a factor of 1.5, and some others use 2. It has to do this in order to ensure that <code>push_back</code> has amortized O(1) complexity, which is a requirement of the standard.</p>

<p>If you know for certain exactly how many elements you are going to add to the vector over its lifetime, it is still a good idea to reserve though, imo. Some might consider that premature optimization. But it is such a simple thing to do, I consider not doing it to be premature pessimization.</p>
