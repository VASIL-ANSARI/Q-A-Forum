<p>As others have mentioned in the comments, you should really start thinking about how you can get rid of the list which holds in-homogeneous data in the first place.  However, if that really <em>can't</em> be done, I'd use a defaultdict:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
for x in myList:
   d[type(x)].append(x)

print d[int]
print d[str]
</code></pre>
