<p>If you want to overwrite the Laravel Carbon objects, write the following function in your Model that you want to overwrite.</p>

<pre><code>public function getDates() {
    return array();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This tells Laravel which dates you wish to return as Carbon objects (none) thus they'll all come out as DateStrings </p>

<p>Hope this helps - but do note, this will affect every date within the model. If you wish to have certain dates treated as Carbon object, add them into the array like</p>

<p><code>array('created_at', 'updated_at')</code> etc</p>

<p>Apologies, this above is for 4.2</p>

<p>In 5.1 you can just write an attribute <code>$dates</code> and give it a blank array</p>

<p><code>protected $dates = []</code></p>
