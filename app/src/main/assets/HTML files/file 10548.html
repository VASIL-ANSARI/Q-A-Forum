<p>Response time is also known as <code>time to last byte</code> while Latency is <code>time to first byte</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time to last byte</strong> - time from the moment the request was sent till the last resource is finished downloading.</li>
<li><strong>Time to first byte</strong> - time from the moment the request was sent till the first byte of the first resource is received back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is that what you wanted to know or have I misunderstood your question?</p>
