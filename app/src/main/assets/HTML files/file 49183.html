<p>Since your table will not grow endlessly and understanding the contents of the columns intuitivly is more important than saving some memory/harddisk space or milliseconds to query the result:</p>

<p>I would create one bit/boolean column per weekday: <strong>Mo Tu We... Su</strong> </p>

<p>This is better than a join table to "tbl_weekdays" since you had to ensure then that nobody assigns the same weekday twice to the same event.</p>

<p>The bit coded solution you mention is very elegant from a technical POV, but requires implicit knowledge regarding the meaning of the bits. Separate columns make this knowledge explicit and ease SQL queries.</p>

<p>BTW: This solution only works because of the low cardinality of the distinct values (only 7) otherwise the number of columns would explode.</p>
