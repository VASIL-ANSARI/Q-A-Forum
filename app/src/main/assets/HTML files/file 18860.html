<p>Looks like a bug in the JNI implementation to me. One obvious workaround is to use a one-dimensional array instead. The array is not jagged on Java side, it seems, so it would be pretty straightforward to convert back and forth. The index of the element <code>(i,j)</code> in the 1D array would be <code>i*xdim + j</code>.</p>
