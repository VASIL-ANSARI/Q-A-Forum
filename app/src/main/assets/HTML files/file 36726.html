<p>I need to clarify something about C# on the server side; if you <code>return</code> a value on a function/method, it will return the value to the code that called said function/method as opposed to intelligently guessing that you want to <code>print</code> the value back to the client so the browser may then manipulate the results?</p>

<p>If that is the case, you need to <code>echo</code> or <code>print</code> the return value from the function/method or from where the function/method is called.</p>
