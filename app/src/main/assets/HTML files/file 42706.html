<p>Create the WriteableBitmap with a PixelFormat that has an alpha channel and thus allows for transparency, e.g. <code>PixelFormats.Bgra32</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var wb = new WriteableBitmap(1200, 1600, 96, 96, PixelFormats.Bgra32, null);
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have four bytes per pixel, one for blue, one for green, one for red, and one for the alpha value.</p>

<p>Note also that you would usually use a value of <code>96</code> for the DPI parameters. </p>
