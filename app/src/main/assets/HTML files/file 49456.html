<p>In java method signature consists of method name and its argument types. This is the basics of method overloading (same method name, but different argument types).</p>

<p>run(void) is not the same as run(SwingExample11).</p>

<p>This is because at runtime JVM will look for a method with name run and takes no arguments. Since you have only defined a method with name "run" and takes one argument of type "SwingExample11", there are no method with name "run" taking no arguments.</p>
