<p>What exactly do you intend to do with a <code>known-url#id</code> url ? If you dont have a specific need, you can just keep known-url...</p>

<p>Anyway, for redirecting you can use <code>window.location.href = new-url</code>. And to get the url, you either take the href or build the url yourself with the id of the anchor.</p>

<p><strong>-- Edit --</strong>
I see your last update of your question's description... it seems this is much more a selenium "howto" question. </p>
