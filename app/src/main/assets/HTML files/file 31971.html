<p>Your query has some group by problems (actually, you should not have any group by clauses), and you should convert it to a join:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name,
  c.securityid
FROM c_contact c
LEFT JOIN c_monitoring m ON m.securityid = c.securityid
  AND m.ended is null
WHERE c.securityid != ''
AND m.securityid IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/e97cf/34" rel="nofollow">SQLFiddle</a></p>

<p>I also tidied up the query a little with aliases.</p>
