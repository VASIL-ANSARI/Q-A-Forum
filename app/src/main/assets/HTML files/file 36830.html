<p>You want to run it 100 times, but you don't want to run each iteration <em>independently</em>, because you want to compare the outputs of each iteration with each other ( to ensure they're all unique), so parameterization isn't the best way.</p>

<p>I would just loop 100 times:</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;Set&gt;();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) { 
    assertTrue(set.add(uniqueIdGenerator.getClientId(email, userExternalId)));
</code></pre>

<p>FYI, <code>set.add()</code> returns false if the element being added is already in the set.</p>
