<p>You are going to want to first convert it to a Date javascript object, which you can then use to create a timestamp which has the hh:mm:ss area which we can then splice out. The following code demonstrates this:</p>

<pre><code>var date = new Date(data); // Create the javascript date object
var dateStamp = date.toTimeString(); // Create the base dateStamp
var dateText = dateStamp.split(' ')[0]); // Splice out only the part that we want
console.log(dateText); // 16:30:00
</code></pre>
