<p>Because only <code>year</code> would reference a variable (or a function), but not a property.<br/>
To reference a property you have to name the object, this property is attached to.</p>

<pre><code>Car.prototype.funcyear = function() {
    console.log(this.year);
};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<pre><code>function Car(color, drivetrain) {
    this.color = color;
    this.drivetrain = drivetrain;
    this.stats = function(){
        //this part is "dangerous", because color and drivetrain reference the local variables 
        //in this surrouunding function-call, NOT the properties of this instance
        //so you might change the properties, but you don't see any effect.
        console.log(color + " " + drivetrain);
    };
}
</code></pre>
