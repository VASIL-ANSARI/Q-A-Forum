<p>Use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/File.html#length%28%29" rel="nofollow">File.length()</a> to determine the size of the file, and reject if it's too big.  </p>

<p>How do you know if it's too big?  Use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#freeMemory%28%29" rel="nofollow">Runtime.freeMemory()</a> to see how much heap you have left.   Of course loading the file and populating it into your <code>Model</code> class will take additional memory, and you may not actually keep the entire content of the file.  You should leave adequate room to load all the data in the classes based on what you know about how you will use the data.</p>

<p>Note that a JVM is not typically allocated all the memory in a users computer, but probably defaults to some smaller number.  It can be modified with the Xmx option if the user is not happy with the default.</p>
