<p>Basically the the error is explained in the error message. Learning to program included learning to read error messages.</p>

<p>You are calling a setText() method on a TextView object, except that your TextView you're calling it on doesn't exist (in memory, as in it's not allocated). Without know what line it reports the error comes from I have no way of helping beyond that. I would suggest debugging it and check objects that turn up being null when they shouldn't be.</p>
