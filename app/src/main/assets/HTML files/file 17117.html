<p>Currently, you only have one <code>background-image</code>. This <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#layering">creates only one layer</a>, so only your <code>0 0</code> position and <code>100% 20px</code> size are being used and the rest are being ignored.</p>

<p>If <code>tabs-large.png</code> represents your entire tab image, you'll need to slice it into three parts: the top edge, the bottom edge and the middle part for example, then specify each part in its own image. You also need to ensure that the top and bottom edges don't repeat while the middle part does.</p>

<p>Here's what the code would look like:</p>

<pre><code>background-image: url(tabs-large-top.png), url(tabs-large-middle.png), url(tabs-large-bottom.png);
background-position: 0 0, 0 20px, 0 180px;
background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat-y, no-repeat;
background-size: 100% 20px, 100% 100%, 100% 20px;
</code></pre>

<p>This way, each image corresponds to one position and one size, in the same order.</p>
