<p>You are violating one of the primary rules of Core Data.  A <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> and its associated <code>NSManagedObject</code> instances can only be accessed on the thread that created them.  You can pass <code>NSManagedObjectID</code> instances around but not <code>NSManagedObject</code> instances.</p>

<p>Further, when you create a relationship between two <code>NSManagedObject</code> instances; both instances <strong>must</strong> be from the same <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> otherwise you will get the error you are seeing above.</p>

<p>Instead of the approach you have above, re-fetch the <code>Artist</code> in the block. I could provide sample code on how to do this with Core Data but you will need to research how to do that with MagicalRecord.</p>
