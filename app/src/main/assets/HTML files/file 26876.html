<p>Assuming your triangle is defined by three points where T0 is base left, T1 is base right and T2 is tip.
And a lot of other assumptions about how the triangle is aligned etc:</p>

<pre><code>public bool GetIntersect(Vector3 T0, Vector3 T1, Vector3 T2, float Z, out Vector3 P0, out Vector3 P1)
{
    if (!((Z &lt;= T2.Z) &amp;&amp; (Z &gt;= T0.Z) &amp;&amp; (Z &gt;= T1.Z)))
        return false;

    var left = T2 - T0;
    left *= 1f / left.Z;

    var right = T2 - T1;
    right * 1f / right.Z;

    P0 = T0 + (left * (Z - T0.Z));
    P1 = T1 + (right * (Z - T1.Z));

    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>P.S; Uppercase in parameter names are bad! don't do that! I just don't care to fix my mistake right now :P</p>
