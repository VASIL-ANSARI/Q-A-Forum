<p>GO to <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/" rel="nofollow">this website</a>: it has alot of really good examples in Java for you. When you use design patterns you are not using them because you have to. You use them because they make your code better, last longer, easier to understand, and a large variety of other reasons. You definantely should use factoy (to make different charecters), builder (load DB, or game), Decorater (so you can easily make changes later). </p>

<p>Start with the Singleton pattern, because it is easy to understand and needed for most programs. I leave the last pattern for you to decide. Good luck.</p>
