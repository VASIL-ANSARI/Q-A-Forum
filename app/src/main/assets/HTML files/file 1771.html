<p>There's a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv</a> module in Python, which handles this.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: This task falls into "build a lexer" category. The standard way to do such tasks is to build a state machine (or use a lexer library/framework that will do it for you.) </p>

<p>The state machine for this task would probably only need two states:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial one, where it  reads every character except comma and newline as part of field (exception: leading and trailing spaces) , comma as the field separator, newline as record separator. When it encounters an opening quote it goes into</li>
<li>read-quoted-field state, where every character (including comma &amp; newline) excluding quote is treated as part of field, a quote not followed by a quote means end of read-quoted-field (back to initial state), a quote followed by a quote is treated as a single quote (escaped quote).</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, your concatenating solution will break on <code>"Field1","Field2"</code> or <code>"Field1"",""Field2"</code>.</p>
