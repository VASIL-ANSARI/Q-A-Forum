<p>I found an issue !
The reason is that MongoDB is all in-memory. It will be recreated on every complete app reload. If I want something more persistent, I have to use a meteor package like <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/ground/db" rel="nofollow">https://atmospherejs.com/ground/db</a>.</p>

<p>I hope that it will help other people.
Thank you.</p>
