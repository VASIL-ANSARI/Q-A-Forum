<p>There are a number of methods on Array that are in-place modifiers, that is they don't make copies, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is one of them.</p>

<p>What you might find easier is this:</p>

<pre><code>array = [ 2, 3 ]
array1 = array + [ 4 ]
array2 = array + [ 5 ]
</code></pre>

<p>The result in this case is two independent arrays.</p>
