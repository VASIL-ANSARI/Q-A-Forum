<p>There are two ways to do it:</p>

<p>1) Create a Comma Separated Values from Your List Box Selected Items. But this is not a recommended Approach, as you need to parse it in your Stored Procedure.</p>

<pre><code>string commaSeparatedParams = string.Join(",", myArray);
</code></pre>

<p>2) Create an XML, each Role would be a Node. And Pass XML as your Stored Procedure Parameter. Most Databases Support Easily retrieving Data from XML. btw, Which Database are you using?</p>

<p>3) If you are using MS SQL 2008, you can also use <code>Table-Valued Parameters</code> : <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510489.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510489.aspx</a></p>

<p>but its only recommended for Bulk Insert kind of operations. The Recommended approach for you is XML, i would say.</p>
