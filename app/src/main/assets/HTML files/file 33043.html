<p>It is a TypeLoadException.  That's the boring part, it doesn't get interesting until you start looking at the InnerException.  Which tells you what <em>really</em> happened to stop the type from getting loaded.  </p>

<p>If this is all you got out of your program then you need to improve your exception reporting.  Be sure to use the exception's ToString() method instead of the Message property.  You'll get <em>everything</em>, including the inner exceptions.  If you get it in the debugger then be sure to use the Exception Assistant.</p>
