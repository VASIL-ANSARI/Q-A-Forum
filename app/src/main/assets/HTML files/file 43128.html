<p>From the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379180%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation for LookupPrivilegeValue</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The LookupPrivilegeValue function retrieves the locally unique identifier (LUID) used on a specified system to locally represent the specified privilege name. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That strongly suggests that the LUIDs are different on each system.  At the very least, there is no guarantee that they will be the same.</p>

<p><em>Addendum</em></p>

<p>Assuming that the logging system does not absolutely have to work under every conceivable circumstance, and assuming that the logs will be analyzed in software and that you can update the analysis software every time a new version of Windows comes out, and provided the logs also include the Windows version, it should be safe enough to compress this information into a single 64-bit bitmap as Eryksun suggests in the comments.</p>

<p>If you want to play it as safe as possible, I suggest a bitmap followed by an optional variable-length field.  You can have a fixed table of strings (one for each privilege name that we know about) with one bit in the bitmap for each string.  If all the privilege names you see are in the table, the bitmap is all you need.</p>

<p>If you see one or more privilege names you didn't know about, set the top bit in the bitmap to indicate that there is more data, then add one or more null-terminated strings, with an additional null at the end to indicate the end of the list.</p>
