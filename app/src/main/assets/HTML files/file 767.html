<p>There is no standard mapping that I know of.  What I've done in the past is translate the ones I know about, and a catch block for System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException.  All non-translated exceptions will be turned into that exception.  As long as you have a debug build of the code that is throwing the exception, you should get a nice stack trace.  Then you can go and look at the exception and write the wrapper.</p>

<p>But on the last project I had to do this on, I went with something much more simple, I ended up writing a couple of System.Exception derivatives for logic_error and runtime_error.  Then I would catch those 2 base classes and use typeid(err) to write the .NET message that got thrown.  This way I didn't "lose" what was being thrown from the C++ but didn't have to map everything except the most important ones.</p>
