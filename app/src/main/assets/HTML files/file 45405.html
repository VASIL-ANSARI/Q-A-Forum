<p>Found a solution <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24854802/presenting-a-view-controller-modally-from-an-action-sheets-delegate-in-ios8">here</a>. I'm probably doing it wrong but if not it might be an Apple bug. The workaround is to delay the presentation of the <code>UIAlertController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
    self.presentViewController(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
})
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I found another workaround (I don't use the solution I put down here anymore). I had to change this because the Twitter login was also breaking my transitions between VCs.</p>

<p>I now call a specific <code>UIViewController</code> (I called it something like <code>TWLoginVC</code>) where I do all the Twitter login and other stuff. The view is just black so the user don't see the process is actually done in another VC (he just has to pick up the Twitter user he wants to login with). I guess you could also put a clear background to be even more invisible.</p>

<p>When I call this view controller and dismiss it, the transition is not applied to it and I don't have any more problem with it.</p>
