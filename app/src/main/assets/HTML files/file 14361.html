<p>Without seeing all your code (for the class in question) it's hard to say, but here's a few of the usual suspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>The @Resource annotation instance does not specify a type, so it will default to the type of the field. If the actual resource is <em>a.b.c.ConnectionFactory</em>, but your field is <em>x.y.z.ConnectionFactory</em>, you would get an error of some sort.</li>
<li>Your annotated class may not be being deployed as a managed (injected) class. In other words, if you do not ensure that the class is treated as an EJB when deployed, the injection annotations will not be honored.  See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10438475/how-can-i-include-a-jms-producer-in-a-transaction-when-the-jms-prod-lives-in-a-h">this post for an example</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do you not get any stack traces in your log when this happens ?</p>
