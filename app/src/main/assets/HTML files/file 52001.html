<p>Possibly one approach if you're after distinct counts ( though you may need to adjust to the PK field)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT emp.*, 
       COUNT(distinct rep.id ) no_of_field_reports, --may need to be on Unique key instead
       COUNT(distinct of_rep.id) no_of_office_reports --may need to be on Unique key instead)
FROM employee emp
LEFT JOIN report rep
    ON (emp.id = rep.employee_id) 
LEFT JOIN office_report of_rep 
    ON (emp.id = of_rep.employee_id) 
WHERE emp.user_id =7 AND emp.active = 1 
GROUP BY emp.id, emp.name 
ORDER BY emp.name ASC
</code></pre>

<p>An approach getting the counts before the joins if you're not after a distinct count then this is likely the right approach and offers flexibility.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT emp.*, rep.cnt, of_Rep.cnt 
FROM employee emp
LEFT JOIN (SELECT count(ID) cnt , employee_ID
           FROM REPORT 
           GROUP BY employee_ID) rep
  ON (emp.id = rep.employee_id) 
LEFT JOIN (SELECT count(ID) cnt, Employee_ID      
          FROM office_report 
          GROUP BY employee_ID) of_rep 
  ON (emp.id = of_Rep.employee_id) 
WHERE emp.user_id =7 AND emp.active = 1 
GROUP BY emp.id, emp.name 
ORDER BY emp.name ASC
</code></pre>

<p>or use of correlated queries (but not supported all the time Such as when creating materialized views from this SQL)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT emp.*, 
      (SELECT count(ID)
       FROM REPORT 
       WHERE  emp.id = rep.employee_id) Report_Cnt, 
      (SELECT count(ID)
       FROM office_report  of_REP
       WHERE emp.id = of_Rep.employee_id) of_Rep_Cnt
FROM employee emp
WHERE emp.user_id =7 AND emp.active = 1 
GROUP BY emp.id, emp.name 
ORDER BY emp.name ASC
</code></pre>
