<p>What is happening is MVC is checking the database and seeing that you do not have an account object in the database with only one column, ID in your case. So MVC is trying to create that object for you. What you need to do in order to use the existing table structure is to make your object match what is already in the database.</p>

<p>You can also create a temporary database and create your object with only one property(column). That allow you to see if your connection string is correct.</p>
