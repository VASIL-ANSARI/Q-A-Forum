<p>After spending hours to resolve this issue, I've found the reason. </p>

<p>It is an assembly, that I need in my project, AxAcroPDFLib.dll (Migradoc that needs AcroPDFLib.dll and generates AxAcroPDFLib.dll). It has an attribute with a bad format date. 
<a href="http://forums.asp.net/t/1678544.aspx/1?Error%20in%20ScriptManager%20constructor" rel="nofollow">This guy</a> had the same issue than me.</p>

<p>But I can't unuse Migradoc, so my problem is still on, but now, I know what is exactly the error, and why it occurs.</p>

<h2>EDIT: problem solved</h2>

<p>Problem solved, partially.
I cleaned the assemblies that my project needed. Two of the PDFSharp dll were useless, so I removed the references, deleted all the bin folders, and rebuild my solution. 
And TADAAAAA. The AxAcroPDFLib.dll has disappeared, the error does not come back. </p>
