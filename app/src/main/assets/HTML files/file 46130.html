<p>You cannot embed fragments from another application into your application. But if you own both the applications, you could consider using second application as a <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html" rel="nofollow">content provider</a> to export its data. Your first application can query the second application's content provider and handle the displaying of the data on its own.</p>
