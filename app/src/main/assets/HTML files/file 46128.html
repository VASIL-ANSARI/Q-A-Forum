<p>You have the dynamic segment <code>id</code> defined on the <code>task</code> route, not the <code>task.edit</code> route.  </p>

<pre><code>EmTasks.TaskRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
    model: function (params) {
        console.log("TaskEditRoute params:", params);

        return this.store.find("task", params.id);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>As of Ember 1.4 or something child routes will automatically use their parent's model unless the child route chooses to use something different in its own model hook.  So you should have the parents model without having to do anything in the <code>TaskEditRoute</code></p>
