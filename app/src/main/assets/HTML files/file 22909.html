<p>As noted in <a href="https://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/implicit-sharing.html#implicit-data-sharing" rel="nofollow">docs</a> regarding implicit sharing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a shared object is created, it sets the reference count to 1. The
  reference count is incremented whenever a new object references the
  shared data, and decremented when the object dereferences the shared
  data. The shared data is deleted when the reference count becomes
  zero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that you must have <code>QImage</code> frames referenced somewhere in your code.</p>
