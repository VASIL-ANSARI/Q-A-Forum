<p>Sounds like you probably want:</p>

<pre><code>var dictionary = input.Lines
                      .Select(line =&gt; line.Split(','))
                      .ToDictionary(array =&gt; double.Parse(array[0]),
                                    array =&gt; double.Parse(array[1]));
</code></pre>

<p>However:</p>

<ul>
<li>This assumes the split lines all have the right number of bits (and that you're using a culture which uses "." as the decimal separator; otherwise you're going to have problems)</li>
<li>This assumes each line has parsable longs in it</li>
<li>Comparing <code>double</code> values for equalty (required by a dictionary) is generally a bad idea. Can you use <code>int</code> or <code>decimal</code> instead?</li>
</ul>
