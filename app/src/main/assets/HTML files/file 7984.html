<p>As I understand it ... not done much browser testing of anti-aliasing. It kicks in when drawImage(img1, x,y,width,height) x or y are not integers. And kicks in when the canvas tags width="600" height="600" are larger than the style="width:600; height:600" </p>

<p>Setting the style to 1/2 the canvas size is suppose to force anti-aliasing. Last time I researched the subject. I would not assume browsers will implement the standard to 100%.</p>

<p>Note for green screening of videos anti-aliasing is important to remove artifacts.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> On your example I am not getting the anti-aliasing using chrome I am with firefox.
latest releases of both browsers for Win XP. Firefox fps is painfully slow on your example.</p>

<p><strong>Another Update</strong>
Setting canvas style size to 1/3 of the canvas size [3 canvas pixels for 1 screen pixel] does appear to get the sub pixel rendering to work ... but the performance hit may be to big to accomplish it this way.</p>

<pre><code>Sub-pixel canvas test.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;canvas id="canvas" width="317" height="351" 
style="border:solid 1px  #000; width:100px; height:100px"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry not the answer you actually wanted.</p>
