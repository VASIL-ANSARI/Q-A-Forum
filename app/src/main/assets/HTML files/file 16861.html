<p>If it is inside of a scrollable div, make sure <strong>that</strong> original div is: <code>&lt;div style="position:relative;"&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>That way, a <code>div</code> inside it that is <strong>absolute</strong> will stay within the confines of it, and use its parent relative div as a reference point for <code>top:50%;</code></p>
