<p>I have cut and paste for you from <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/v../viewthread/214172/#t286462" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<p>Catalog -> Attributes -> Manage Attributes.</p>

<p>Select brand_name</p>

<p>At the bottom make sure Used for Sorting in Product Listing is set to Yes. &lt;- your design theme must support it.</p>

<p>Then over in Catalog -> Manage Categories, select your category that displays your product listing, select the Display Settings tab.</p>

<p>brand_name should be one of the items in the Available Product Listing Sort by multi select. Go down to the next field Default Product Listing sort by, uncheck Use Config Settings and set the dropdown to brand_name.</p>

<p>To make the system default for product listings be sorted by brand_name, go into System -> Configuration -> Catalog ->Frontend and set Product Listing Sort by dropdown to brand_name. Then you can leave the âUse Config Settingsâ checkbox in Manage Categories checked</p>
