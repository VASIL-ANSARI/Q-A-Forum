<p>Your are getting mixed up between command arguments and piping. When you say <code>cmda | cmdb</code> it essentialy means run <code>cmda</code> and pass its output as an input of <code>cmdb</code> whereas your code passes the string "| cmdb" as an argument of <code>cmda</code></p>

<p>There are several ways you can do to fix your code, but I think the most straight forward way is to take away the last grep argument:</p>

<pre><code>String[] commands = new String[]{"asterisk","-rx","core show channels"};
</code></pre>

<p>Then when you're looping the result, just use the <code>contains()</code> method from String class to check if it contain the string <em>channels</em></p>

<pre><code>while((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
  if(line.contains("channels")  System.out.println(line);
}
</code></pre>
