<p>What you are trying to acheive is not the best way of keeping the database and hibernate in sync. If possible, you should do the other way around - make changes in the hibernate mappings, and let them be reflected in the database.</p>

<p>After all, it's your object model that matters, not the database representation.</p>

<p>Check the <code>hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto</code> property <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html">here</a>. If set to <code>update</code>, it will update the underlying database with the appropriate columns and constraints based on the changes in your hibernate mappings.</p>
