<p>I would suggest two changes to your code.</p>

<p>First, rather than having the thread sleep, create a timer that fires every 50 milliseconds. That timer handler will then loop on <code>TryTake</code> with no delay, collecting all of the items that are currently in the collection (or up to some maximum). With no delay, <code>TryTake</code> will return immediately if the collection is empty.</p>

<p>Second, do not call the "update UI" once for each update. Modify the update handler so that it accepts the entire list of updates rather than one update at a time. That will avoid the time involved in waiting for the UI thread.</p>

<p>The above assumes, of course, that you've modified your update handler so that it can add multiple items to the <code>ObservableCollection</code> in one shot, preventing multiple <code>CollectionChanged</code> events.</p>
