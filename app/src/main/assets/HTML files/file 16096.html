<p>From <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#read%28java.io.InputStream%29" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If no registered ImageReader claims to be able to read the resulting stream, null is returned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my guess is that no registered ImageReader claims to be able to read it...</p>

<p>Assuming your <code>InputStream</code> code doesn't have the typo you've got in your question (<code>imagen</code> instead of <code>image</code>) that leaves three options I can think of easily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your image data was corrupt to start with</li>
<li>You've encoded it incorrectly into base64</li>
<li><code>DatatypeConverter.parseBase64</code> isn't quite appropriate for the base64 format you've got. (It's not a converter I've used before. There are lots of options for base64 - e.g. <a href="http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/base64/" rel="nofollow">this public domain one</a>)</li>
<li>The data is all fine by the time it reaches <code>ImageIO.read</code>, but it's not a supported image format.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should work out which of these is the case - in particular, what happens if you skip the base64 encoding completely? Or what happens if you compare the base64-encoded-then-decoded data with the original? (Is it at least the same length?) If you write out the base64-decoded data to a file, can you open it in your favourite image program?</p>
