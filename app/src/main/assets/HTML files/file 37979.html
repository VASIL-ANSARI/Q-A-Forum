<p>Basically, because of the simple types (string parameters), Web API is expecting these parameters from the URI and for that reason you are getting 404.</p>

<p>Change the action method some thing like this (sorry about C#).</p>

<pre><code>public class MyController : ApiController
{
    [Route("v1/login")]
    [HttpPost]
    public IHttpActionResult Login(Cred c)
    {
        return Ok();
    }
}

public class Cred
{
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, include <code>Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> in the request. That should work. BTW, you can use <code>[FromBody]</code> against the string parameter but then you cannot use two, since body can be used only once. In case you have one parameter, you can use that instead of a complex type (class).</p>
