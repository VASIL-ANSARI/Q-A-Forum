<p>I don't see any reason for it to not work .
check out <a href="https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/tree/master/system/pyrocms/modules/users" rel="nofollow">pyrocms</a> </p>

<p>They are using ionauth with hmvc.</p>

<p>if you don't get it working,
just upload the files in normal ci directories and check if it works without any problems.</p>
