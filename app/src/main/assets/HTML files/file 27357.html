<p>Yes there is a method onUpgrade </p>

<p>add you code there and increase database version if your version is higher than the previous 
onUpgrade is fired and the your code will execute which you write to add table</p>

<h2>sample</h2>

<p>Remember increasing you version code in super call</p>

<pre><code>class Database extends SQLiteOpenHelper
{
public Database(Context _myContext)
    {
    super(_myContext, DB_NAME, null, DB_VERSION_CODE);

    }

    @Override
    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion)
    {
        if(oldVersion &gt; newVersion)
        {
            // create a new table what you want to create you can also check the existence of the table
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
