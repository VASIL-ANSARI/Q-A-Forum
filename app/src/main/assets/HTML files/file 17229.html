<p>Please stop using backward compatibility views like sysindexes / sysobjects. </p>

<p>Something like this might be better, though indexes/tables alone do not account for everything in a database.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Size_In_MB = SUM(reserved_page_count)*8/1024.0
  FROM sys.dm_db_partition_stats
  WHERE OBJECT_NAME([object_id]) NOT IN (N'table1', N'table2');
</code></pre>

<p>Also, why are you ignoring non-clustered indexes? Do you think they don't contribute to size? You can add a similar filter here, but I'm not sure why you would:</p>

<pre><code>AND index_id IN (0,1,255);
</code></pre>
