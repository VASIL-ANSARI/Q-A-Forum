<p>Have you consider moving the whole MyClass class in the upper layer ?
Since you didn't explain what this class do, it might be a stupid answer but as it seems the class depends on repositories, I guess it is doing some sort of business logic, therefore it should not be in data layer.
That would allow you to implement the singleton directly inside the class like you would usually do.</p>
