<p>It has been a few years, but at one point I wrote a RichTextBox wrapper that ended up manipulating the underlying markup.  It wasn't pretty and it wasn't for the faint of heart, but it did work.  I ended up using it to highlight some text I believe.</p>

<p>The key thing you need to know is the specification for the RTF markup language: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format</a> should get you started.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.richtextbox.aspx" rel="nofollow">RichTextBox class documentation</a> and the <strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.richtextbox.document.aspx" rel="nofollow">Document</a></strong> property should get you started at modifying the underlying structure of the document after loading or during editing.</p>
