<p>I agree with Mike C above-- <code>console</code> is generally available in most browsers, but you should probably remove <code>console</code> logs before a site gets pushed to production.</p>

<p>Additionally, some older browser might <em>not</em> have the <code>console</code>, and if you <em>did</em> accidentally leave in a console log, it would fire an error when it attempted to interact with with something that wasn't defined.  As an extra failsafe, you can declare <code>console</code> and <code>console.log</code> in the global namespace if they are not detected, just in case:</p>

<pre><code>if (!console) {
    console = {
        log: function () { //noop }
    };
}
</code></pre>
