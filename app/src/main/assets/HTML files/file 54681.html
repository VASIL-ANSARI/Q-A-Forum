<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I think a better answer is here:

<p><em>MY INITIAL COMMENTS:</em>
Well it's a matter of practice, some guys like it at the top while some like lazy-loading. In my opinion both are good, and should be used as per need, so I think that author is right here, because loading a whole bunch libraries at the startup would overload the module with much of the stuff that is never used, and hence would increase the load-time. And although loading the libraries on demand is a synchronous operation, but if we look <code>help</code> method as an entity, then it would give an asynchronous module loading effect (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition" rel="nofollow">AMD</a>, which is a popular pattern).</p>

<p>Lazy loading is also a good selection if you have to make a choice between which libraries to load in a particular case, like for example</p>

<pre><code>var isOSX;
// some code here which finds if this is OSX
// then this
if (isOSX === true) {
  var platformHelper = require('supercoolosxhelper');
} else {
  var platformHelper = require('yetanothercoolhelper');
}
</code></pre>

<p>In short, you should anticipate in your code if the probability of using a method is high or even mid, then you should require at the top, otherwise if it's low then it would be nice if the module is <code>required</code> on need basis.</p>
