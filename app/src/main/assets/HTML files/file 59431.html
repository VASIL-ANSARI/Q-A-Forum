<p>As the error mentions, you are not able to use your <code>appearance</code> property until it has been set in the initializer. Your properties are evaluated before the initializer runs, so your only option here is to move the desired customisation of your <code>circleBG</code> view into the initializer, for example your <code>setup()</code>-method.</p>
