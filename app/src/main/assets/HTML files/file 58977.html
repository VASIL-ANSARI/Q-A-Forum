<p>From what i can gather,</p>

<p>You CrashLandedShip objects do not have colliders, adding colliders should work.</p>

<p>Also note that for triggers to work, One of the objects (the terrain or the ship) has to be a non-trigger (2 triggers will not cause a collision or trigger event)</p>

<p>So try this : Add a sphere collider to your <code>CrashLandedShip_UpsideDown</code> prefab and make sure they are <strong>not</strong> set with IsTrigger</p>

<p>The rest of your code looks fine.</p>
