<p>Have a look at the GDI+ classes in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>System.Drawing</code> namespace</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I am really not sure what you mean when you keep asking for more abstract libraries. How are these classes not abstract enough? <code>Graphics.DrawLine()</code>, <code>Graphics.FillEllipse()</code> and so on.</p>

<p>Unless you are looking to do something <em>very</em> specific, like charting for instance, there is no other abstraction on top of this. You do want to draw lines, polygons, rectangles etc., don't you?</p>

<p>Can you explain what abstraction you would want? In pseudo code?</p>
