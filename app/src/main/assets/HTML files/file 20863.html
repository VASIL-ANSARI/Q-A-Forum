<p><code>std::ends</code> is defined as having the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inserts a null character into the output sequence: calls <code>os.put(charT())</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <code>charT</code> is <code>char</code>, it is value initialized to have the value 0, which is equivalent to the character literal <code>\0</code>. So when <code>charT</code> is <code>char</code>, which it usually is, the two lines of code are exactly the same.</p>

<p>However, using <code>std::ends</code> will work well even when the character type of your stream is not <code>char</code>.</p>
