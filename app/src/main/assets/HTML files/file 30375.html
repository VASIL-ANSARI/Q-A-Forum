<p>Please <strong>don't</strong> write a regex to find hyperlinks.  All the information you need is within the Tweet object as <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/entities" rel="nofollow">entities</a>.</p>

<p>A typical Tweet will have something like this in it</p>

<pre><code>"entities": {
    "hashtags": [],
    "symbols": [],
    "urls": [{
      "url": "https:\/\/t.co\/XdXRudPXH5",
      "expanded_url": "https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2013\/rich-photo-experience-now-in-embedded-tweets-3",
      "display_url": "blog.twitter.com\/2013\/rich-phot\u2026",
      "indices": [80, 103]
    }],
</code></pre>

<p>The "indices" will tell you exactly where in the text the URL is - or you can use the "expanded_url" to find them.</p>
