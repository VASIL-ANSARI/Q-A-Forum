<p>It is happening because the table is created only on initial page load and when it is posted back via button click, table is again initialized but with no columns since IsPostBack is true in Page_Load event. So, by removing the IsPostBack condition, table object is instantiated with columns for every page request.</p>

<pre><code>Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)                 
    CreateDataTable()
End Sub
</code></pre>
