<p>The code that you posted on codepad.org is </p>

<pre><code>__some__={}
def main():
    assert __some__ == type("Hello World").__name__
    assert __some__ == isinstance("Hello World", str)
if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p><code>type("Hello World").__name__</code> is <code>'str'</code> and <code>__some__</code> is <code>{}</code>, so of course they don't match.  Likewise, <code>isinstance("Hello World", str)</code> is <code>True</code>, so it doesn't match either.  Your conditions are false, so the assertions fail and throw AssertionError.  If on the other hand, you tried <code>assert 'str' == type("Hello World").__name__</code>, you'd get no exception because that comparison is true.</p>

<p>Also, you shouldn't declare your own variables using names like <code>__foo__</code>.  By convention, those are reserved for special variables created by Python.</p>
