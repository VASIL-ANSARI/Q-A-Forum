<p>I haven't tested this out, but here's a way that might work.</p>

<pre><code>$('#nav').on('click', 'li a', function(evt) {
  evt.preventDefault();
  var href = $(this).attr('href');
  $('#content').load(href);
});
</code></pre>

<p>The listener is added to <code>#nav</code> only because that element exists at the time the listener is made, but it's actually listening for any bubbled elements of children, fitting the selector.</p>

<p>The <code>preventDefault()</code> is meant to prevent regular navigation from taking place. If that doesn't work, you could try the same with a link in appearances-only. (eg, <code>&lt;span class="linkLike" data-href="about.html"&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;</code>)</p>
