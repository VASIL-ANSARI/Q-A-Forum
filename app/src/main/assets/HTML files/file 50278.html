<p>Make sure that the <code>mail</code> part works, so it's reaching the <code>redirect part</code>.</p>

<pre><code>if (mail($recipient, $subject, $email_content, $email_headers)) {
    // Set a 200 (okay) response code.
     echo "It tries to redirect"; exit; //Do you see this!?
     header('Location:thankyou.html'); 
     exit; //Add an exit to make sure your code stops here.
}   
</code></pre>

<p>Also make sure there isn't anything like <code>echo</code>, <code>print_r</code>, <code>var_dump</code>, or anything else that display things before the <code>header</code> part. It won't work when you already have output.</p>

<p>If this is called through an AJAX request you need to be aware that that the <code>thankyou</code> page <code>echo</code> the correct HTML and your AJAX callback function displays this HTML correctly.</p>
