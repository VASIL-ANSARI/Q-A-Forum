<p>Not necessarily an answer, but perhaps you should try var_dump on your array search, sometimes integers (mostly 1 and 0, as in true and false) don't print out right. This will tell you exactly what the result is, rather that just not printing anything (which is what I assume happened, since you didn't say what it printed)...</p>
