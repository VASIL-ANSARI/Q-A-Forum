<p>You'll also want to make sure that your SSH system is well secured to prevent people from logging in <em>as</em> your Capistrano bot.  I'd suggest restricting access to password-protected key pairs.</p>

<p>Encrypting the .yml file on the server is useless since you have to give the bot the key, which would be stored . . . on the same server.  Encrypting it on your machine is probably a good idea.  Capistrano can decrypt it before sending.</p>
