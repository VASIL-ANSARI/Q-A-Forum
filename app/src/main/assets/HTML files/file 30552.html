<p>The main problem is that <code>F2C</code> isn't defined anywhere that you can access.</p>

<p>That's obvious in the fragment you showed usâ¦ but in your real code, presumably it's defined <em>somewhere</em>. The problem is that wherever it's defined, it's not in this module's globals. Most likely either:</p>

<ul>
<li>You defined it in another module, and did <code>import other_module</code>âin which case the function is named <code>other_module.F2C</code>, not <code>F2C</code>.</li>
<li>You defined it in another module, and didn't even import that module, in which case the function isn't there at all.</li>
<li>You accidentally defined it inside some other function (by getting your indentation wrong), meaning it's local to that function rather than global to your whole module.</li>
<li>You assigned some other value to <code>F2C</code> later in the function. Again, probably accidentally (by getting your indentation wrong). Python will guess that you want to use the <em>local variable</em>, rather than the <em>global function</em> whenever you say <code>F2C</code> in this function.  But the local variable hasn't been assigned yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that it's specifically an <code>UnboundLocalError</code> rather than a <code>NameError</code> is a useful clue: it means Python thinks this should be a local variable rather than a global, which almost certainly means you either defined it or assigned a value to <code>F2C</code> <em>later in the same function</em>â¦ most likely because you indented a bunch of the rest of the script inside this function.</p>
