<p>If I understand you are worried about someone copying your page to their website, you can try this, though it is indeed absurdly easy to get around:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
if($('#credits').length == 0)
     window.location = 'http://www.url.com'
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
