  <p>The third and fourth parameters are of type DWORD, which can hold

<p>No. It means that it can only read up to 2^32 bytes in one go. There's noone stopping you from calling <code>ReadFile</code> multiple times to read a total of as many bytes as you like (each read will advance the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365457%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">file pointer</a>, so it will begin reading from the point where the previous read stopped).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Supposed the loop tends to overwrite the buffer every iteration, in
  order for this design to work, the ReadFile needs to remember where
  the previous read happened in the file is this true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the OS remembers this for every open file (see file pointer link above).</p>

<p>While on the subject I should mention that if you are scheduling 4GB reads then you are most likely doing something wrong. No matter what the nature of your data is, surely you can process it in smaller chunks and this will help not run up against a variety of problems such as available memory.</p>
