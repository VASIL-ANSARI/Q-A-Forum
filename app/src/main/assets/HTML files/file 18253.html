<p>You can only use <code>goto</code> to jump to labels within the scope of the <code>goto</code>. From the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hak1fc9d%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">docs</a> that describes error <code>CS0159</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The label referenced by the goto statement could not be found <strong>within the scope</strong> of the goto statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the label exists, you can't jump out of an <code>if</code> block into an <code>else</code> block. The code within <code>else</code> is not the same scope as that that contains the <code>goto</code>.</p>

<p>It's time to restructure your code so it doesn't need <code>goto</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>You should try to simplify your logic. Multiple functions are preferable to <code>goto</code> statements. </p>

<p>One option you might want to consider is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd489441.aspx" rel="nofollow">Windows Workflow Foundation</a>. It's a really neat tool that lets you represent your logic visually as a flow chart. WWF will then generate the code necessary to handle the logic you specify. This might work for since it appears like you are creating some type of finite state machine or similar process.</p>
