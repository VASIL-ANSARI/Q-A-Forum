<p>Python always <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-write-a-function-with-output-parameters-call-by-reference" rel="nofollow">passes by assignment</a> , even in the first case, actually the object reference is passed. But when you do an assignment inside the function, you are causing the name to refer a new object. That would not mutate the name/variable that was used to pass the value to the function (Better explained in the below example).</p>

<p>Example -</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(n):
...     n = [1,2,3,4]
...     return n
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; func(l)
[1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>In your case, when you do <code>del list[0]</code> you are actually mutating the <code>list</code> in place (deleting the first element from it) , and hence it reflects in the place where the function was called from as well.</p>
