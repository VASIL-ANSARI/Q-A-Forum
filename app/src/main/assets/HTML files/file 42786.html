<p>You will not be able to accurately track a device's position with a typical phone or tablet. In theory, you can use a device's internal sensors to measure its acceleration in each axis. In theory, you integrate acceleration once to obtain speed and once more to obtain change in position. Thus, in theory, you should be able to calculate a device's position relative to its starting location. HOWEVER, in practice, things don't work out so well.</p>

<p>A device's sensors are not perfect and contain small errors. Integrating these small errors twice turns them into large errors. These large errors accumulate and end up making your calculations useless.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/" rel="nofollow">Project Tango</a>, which contains a bunch of fancy sensors and algorithms to implement 6 DOF tracking. This device was built by a research team and is still a work in progress, so keep in mind that it's a tough problem.</p>
