<p>With python's csv reader and writer,<br>
reading from the files <code>a.csv</code> and <code>b.csv</code>, writing to <code>c.csv</code>:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import csv

with open('a.csv', 'r') as file_a:
    with open('b.csv', 'r') as file_b:
        with open('c.csv', 'w') as file_c:
            reader_a = csv.reader(file_a, delimiter=',')
            reader_b = csv.reader(file_b, delimiter=',')
            writer_c = csv.writer(file_c)

            for cols_a in reader_a:
                cols_b = reader_b.next()
                writer_c.writerow(cols_a + cols_b)
</code></pre>

<p>Creates file <code>c.csv</code>:</p>

<pre><code>a, b, c, d,o, p, q, r
e, f, g, h,s, t, u, v
i, j, k, l,w, x, y, z
</code></pre>

<p>(I assume that those braces and extra linebreaks in your csv code are just here on stackoverflow and not really part of your csv files? I also assume that a.csv and b.csv have the same length in lines.)</p>
