<p>Only do that if the labels go on top of the OpenGL content. UIKit elements sometimes do not mix well with OpenGL elements. Blending OpenGL content with transparency on top of UIKit elements is really slow. In these cases, it's better to add the label in your OpenGL code. Static text is very easy, just draw a flat object facing the camera and with a texture image of your text. Dynamic text would require more work to adjust the texture with the font to show the correct text.  </p>

<p>To do this, add the label to to viewcontroller.xib file, not the mainwindow.xib file. The appropriate code for controlling the UILabel would go in the view controller's .h and .m files. In the standard Xcode iOS OpenGL ES Application template the main view controller's .xib file will contain one EAGLView view. The label can be added to that view, and connected to an IBOutlet in the view controller's .h file.</p>
