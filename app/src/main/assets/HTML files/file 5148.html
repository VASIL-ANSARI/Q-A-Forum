<p>The problem you're running into is you're checking <code>Controls</code> for <code>null</code> to determine if it's empty.  The <code>Controls</code> property won't ever be <code>null</code> but instead will be non-null and have 0 length when empty.  For example</p>

<pre><code>if (flowLayoutPanel1.Controls.Count == 0) {
  // It's empty
}
</code></pre>
