<p>As far as I am aware, there is no way to set up Wear-side Activities on a notification created on the handheld.</p>

<p>However, you can get the same effect with the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the handheld notification display only on the handheld with <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/NotificationCompat.Builder.html#setLocalOnly%28boolean%29" rel="nofollow">NotificationCompat.Builder.setLocalOnly</a></li>
<li>When you create the handheld notification, also send a message to Wear using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/data-layer/messages.html" rel="nofollow">Messaging API</a></li>
<li>In your Wear-side code, when you receive this type of message, create a notification (using the same notification API that you used in the handheld) - this will raise a notification on the Wear device</li>
<li>Any actions associated with the Wear-side notification will be launched on the Wear device</li>
</ol>
