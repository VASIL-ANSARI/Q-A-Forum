<p>I would do something like:</p>

<pre><code>plt.xticks([1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300], [1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300])
</code></pre>

<p>You should probably put this in a convenience function that gets the current axis limits and generates the appropriate sequence of ticks and tick labels.</p>

<p>There might be a "Ticker" object in matplotlib that does something like this. The documentation is pretty sparse on log plots, unfortunately.</p>
