<p>The <code>FilenameFilter</code> only matches  the <em>names</em> of files or directories. It cannot help you with the decision whether or not to include an item based on existence in a different tree. However, <code>copyDirectory()</code> seems to do the right thing for your needs, just inefficiently - if you want to exclude unchanged files from the copying you need to add that logic yourself. (The solution could still make use of <code>copyDirectory()</code> internally, unless you want the date comparison to happen on every level.)</p>
