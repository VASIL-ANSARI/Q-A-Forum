<p>The only way to do this is to movethe bytes that are currently in the way. Depending on how frequently you have to do this, and how large the file is, it's often a better idea to create a new file, copying the existing file and inserting the new bytes along the way.</p>

<p>If you need to update the file infrequently, or it's small (up to maybe 100 kb) you can use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/RandomAccessFile.html" rel="nofollow">RandomAccessFile</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extend the file, using the <code>setLength()</code> method, adding the number of bytes you'll be inserting to whatever is returned by the <code>length()</code> method.</li>
<li>If you have enough memory, create a <code>byte[]</code> that will hold all the bytes from the insertion point to the previous end of file.</li>
<li>Call <code>seek()</code> to position at the insertion point</li>
<li>Call <code>readFully()</code> to fill your temporary array</li>
<li>Call <code>seek()</code> to position at the insertion point + the number of bytes to insert</li>
<li>Call <code>write()</code> to write your buffer at that point</li>
<li>Call <code>seek()</code> to reposition at the insertion point</li>
<li>Call `write() to write the new bytes</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can't create a large-enough array in step #2, you'll have to perform steps 3-6 in a loop with a smaller buffer. I would use at least a 64k buffer for efficiency.</p>
