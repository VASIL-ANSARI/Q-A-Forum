<p>You imported R as <code>import android.R;</code>, but you want to import <code>com.example.tieulyphidep.R</code></p>

<p>Just erase the line of <code>import android.R;</code> and Android Studio will suggest you to import the good one.</p>

<p>Note also that a class should start by an upcase letter and end by the mother class, like LoginActivity.</p>
