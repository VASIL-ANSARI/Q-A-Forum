<p>I would say no, it's no good use of OOP.</p>

<p>Areas for improvement:</p>

<p>Separate the db connection and query stuff.
Separate the db result handling. Implementing a result object that is iterable will be a good idea.
Not using the mysql extension and switching to mysqli is a very good idea. It will also give you an OOP interface to MySQL for free.</p>

<p>Probably aspects of escaping input inside SQL strings should be considered, but this is undecidable because no such code has been shown.</p>
