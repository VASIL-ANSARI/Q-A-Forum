<p>You only have multiple 1D arrays, you should combine them into 2D, like :</p>

<pre><code>var Items = new Array
BodyPaint = new Array(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
WolfFur = new Array(3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
BearFur = new Array(4, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
WolfSkin = new Array(6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
BearSkin = new Array(7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);

Items[0] = BodyPaint;

alert(Items[0][2]);
</code></pre>

<p>In that case you have 2D, and with the alert example you can access the items</p>
