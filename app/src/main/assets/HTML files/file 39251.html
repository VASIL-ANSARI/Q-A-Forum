<p>I have solved this issue by changing the Build settings of SDWebImage to "(armv7,arm64)" . 
Got a few errors in "NSLog" but those are easy fixes, apart from the fact that you need to change the following: </p>

<pre><code>- (int)getMemoryCount
{
    return [[memCache allKeys] count];
}
</code></pre>

<p>in  SDImageCache.m  to</p>

<pre><code>- (int)getMemoryCount
{
    return (int)[[memCache allKeys] count];
}
</code></pre>
