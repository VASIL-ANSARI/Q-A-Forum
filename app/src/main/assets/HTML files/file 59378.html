<p><code>"success"</code> as a String cannot be cast to JSON format. Hence, spring controller returns plain/text.Generally, for any object to be cast as JSON, it must be in the format of a key value pair, so all POJOs can be converted to corresponding key-value pairs where <code>key</code> is the property name and <code>value</code> is property's value. You can have a look at this page to validate what constitutes a valid json.
