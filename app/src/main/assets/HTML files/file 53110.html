<p>All code above <code>FileKey.create</code> can throw a <code>IOException</code> so your assumption that this behaviour is not ok is correct.</p>

<p>Indeed this was already filed as <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8025619" rel="nofollow">bug</a>. In Java 9 the <code>Error</code> will be gone and a <code>IOException</code> will be <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/jdk/rev/655c81c02331#l6.7" rel="nofollow">thrown</a> instead.</p>

<p>Therefore for now you should be prepared to catch the error and evaluate the inner IOException.</p>
