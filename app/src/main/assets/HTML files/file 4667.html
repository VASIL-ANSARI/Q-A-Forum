<pre><code> if([bodyPart isKindOfClass:[types_getFavoriteColorResponseType class]]) {
     types_getFavoriteColorResponseType *body = (types_getFavoriteColorResponseType*)bodyPart;
     // Now you can extract the color from the response
     q.text = body.color;
     continue;

<p>ÐÐº as far as I understand this is a part which extracts text data from your SOAP response.</p>

<p>BTW you need response to be processed via SAX or DOM? First example in given URL refers to DOM usage, whereas the second to SAX.</p>

<p>More than that I can not tell. Guess you have to read manual or find someone, who worked with this.</p>
