<p>I haven't worked with AndEngine, but to scale your sprite I think you got 2 options. 
One is to scale your resources and have 2 sets of sprites, one for 1280x800 and one for 800x480.</p>

<p>Another way is to draw your sprites relative to the base resolution 800x480 and use a scale factor or 1.6 or somthing like that when you have a bigger resolution. Also set the scale for the sprite accordingly. </p>
