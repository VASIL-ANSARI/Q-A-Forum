<p>Ahhh, I see the problem. </p>

<p>You put your function <em>declarations</em> into the .h (or header) file, which is your "<code>@interface</code>" while the actual code you'll put into your .m file, which has the keyword "<code>@implementation</code>".</p>

<p>It looks like you simply have your code in the wrong place.  </p>
