<p>As per Stephen's comment and link above, Homebrew doesn't provide a my.cnf file by default: at least not in a location where MySQL will read it. The link above provides instructions on how to use one of the boilerplate my.cnf that homebrew <em>does</em> provide to start building a my.cnf file of your own.</p>
