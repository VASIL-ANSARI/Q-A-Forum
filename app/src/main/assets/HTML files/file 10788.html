<p>You might be looking for <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreDataFramework/Classes/NSManagedObjectContext_Class/NSManagedObjectContext.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001182-BAJFCECB" rel="nofollow"><code>-refreshObject:mergeChanges:</code></a> - the docs say that it resets an object from the persistent store, and if you pass <code>NO</code> as the second argument, you can choose not to reapply changes that have been made.</p>

<p>This will likely require you to store a set of objects that you have changed (for the first argument), then clear that set when you commit changes in your context to the store. This should be a pretty trivial addition, though.</p>
