<p>It is all about charset . Use <code>ISO 8859-9</code> instead of <code>UTF-8</code> as charset in your <code>meta</code> content of <code>HTML</code> <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></p>

<p>this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Turkish_characters" rel="nofollow">link</a> mentioned for turkish character set.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turkish computers may use character set ISO 8859-9 ("Latin 5"), which
  is identical to Latin 1 except that the rarely-used Icelandic
  characters "eth", "thorn", and "y with acute accent" are replaced with
  the needed Turkish characters. If you are reading Turkish text in
  Wikipedia, when you see these Icelandic characters they are probably
  meant to be the Turkish ones (users with Turkish computers may or may
  not see them properly). If you are entering Turkish text into
  Wikipedia, be aware that the Bomis server identifies web pages as ISO
  8859-1, and there is no way to override this, so even if these
  characters appear correct to you, they are not properly encoded from
  the point of view of a non-Turkish Wiki reader.</p>

<p>Hope it will help.</p>
