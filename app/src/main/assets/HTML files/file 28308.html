<p>The event handlers (functions 1,2,3) are all returning false. This stops the event from bubbling up the DOM. I'm guessing that they're not being triggered as expected because the first function to handle the event is stopping the propagation. Test this by removing the return statement. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can try scoping the delegated event handler closer to the target.</p>
