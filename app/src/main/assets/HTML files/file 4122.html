<p>Is your view controller implementing the UIAlertViewDelegate? If not, add  in you interface declaration before the { starts.</p>

<p>Also try NSLogging inside the clickedButtonAtIndex method and print the buttonIndex values and see the console.</p>

<p>Edit: Reading your post again, I guess you indeed have missed the UIAlertViewDelegate in your interface declaration.</p>
