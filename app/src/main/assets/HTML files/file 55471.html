<p>afaict this can't be done in Meteor because Meteor uses the template tag for exactly the reason it was designed, from your link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The HTML template element  is a mechanism for holding
  client-side content that is not to be rendered when a page is loaded
  but may subsequently be instantiated during runtime using JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should never see a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag actually appear in the DOM which will preclude you from manipulating it in the DOM later.</p>

<p>It sounds like you maybe trying to do something that Blaze itself has assumed responsibility for. Perhaps you can tell us what you want to do with your template and we can tell you how to do it in Meteor.</p>
