<p>Modify your code as shown below and try, this may help you. This is the one which I had used before from SO itself:</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(this, AlarmReceiver.class);
PendingIntent sender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, intent, 0);
AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager) getSystemService(ALARM_SERVICE);

alarmManager.cancel(sender);
</code></pre>
