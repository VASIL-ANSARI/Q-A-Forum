<p>You did NOTdefine binding for you detail data grid and you set the autogenerate columns to false. You need to define the binding either in XAML or in code behind before the client_CustomerDetailCompleted event fires. Simply setting the item source alone won't work because the detail datagrid does not contain columns. This is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel" rel="nofollow">MVVM pattern</a> comes in handy.</p>
