<p>Chris Viau provided a good answer to this question over on the d3 Google group.

<p>The trick is to select the path's g parent to reorder it with the others:</p>

<p>this.parentNode.parentNode.appendChild(this.parentNode);</p>

<p>This appends the current selection's container "g" on top of all the other "g".</p>

<p>I've found this useful in lots of other instances as well.</p>

<p>Thanks Chris!</p>
