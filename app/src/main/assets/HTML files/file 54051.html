<p>Yes, they are different.</p>

<p>In the first example, you are just telling the compiler about the name and return type of the function and nothing of its expected arguments.</p>

<p>In the second example you are telling the compiler the full signature of the functions, both return type and expected arguments,  prior to calling them.</p>

<p>The second form is pretty much universally better as it helps you compiler do a better job warning you when you have the wrong type or number of arguments when calling the function.</p>

<p>Also note <code>int function()</code> in C is a function that can accept <strong>any</strong> arguments, not a function that accepts <strong>no</strong> arguments. For that you need an explicit <code>void</code>, i.e <code>int function(void)</code>.  This mostly trips up those coming to <code>C</code> from <code>C++</code>.</p>

<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13950642/">Why does a function with no parameters (compared to the actual function definition) compile?</a></p>

<p>To demonstrate <em>why</em> the first, antiquated form is bad in modern C, the following program compiles without warning with <code>gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic</code> or <code>gcc -Wall -std=c11</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
int foo();

int main(int argc, char**argv)
{
  printf("%d\n", foo(100));
  printf("%d\n", foo(100,"bar"));
  printf("%d\n", foo(100,'a', NULL));
  return 0;
}

int foo(int x, int y)
{
  return 10;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  M&amp;M brought to my attention that my example uses <code>int</code> not <code>float</code> for the functions.  I think we can all agree that declaring <code>int function1()</code> is bad form, but my statement that this declaration accepts any arguments is not quite correct.   See Vlad's answer for relevant spec section explaining why that is the case. </p>
