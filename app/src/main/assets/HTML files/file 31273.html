<p>If you want to simply show web pages in your application you need webview. If you want some external features to show something like javascript(e.g youtube videos) then you just need to enable some javascript features which are predefined. </p>

<p>If you need the web page operations like button click , playing with server database (like post as you want here) then you have to create the activity which holds the same design as the webpage (design through xml layout) and do whatever you want through java coding.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Just simply understand the current stackoverflow page. If you want to show this page in your app then you have to use a webview inside your layout and give the the current url inyour java code. But this is nothing but just the UI(user Interface). You can not do any kind of extra android operation in this because you simply show the desktop page in a mobile.</p>

<p>But if you want some extra operation to add then you have to create a personal xml layout same like the current stackoverflow page which has a tab on the top some hyperlinks on the right, some mutiline edittext views to write questions or answers and some more things.
Then you have to add each operations what stackoverflow does here and some extra if you need. If you want the same design then it depends on you..you may use So png images ,same writing style etc.. 
hope you understand.</p>

<p>Thank You</p>
