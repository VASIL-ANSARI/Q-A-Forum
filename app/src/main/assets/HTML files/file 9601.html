<p>I have an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6108864/php-how-to-call-a-class-in-zendamf">unanswered question</a> that I asked here I believe for the same reason as yours.  I would love to know how to call multiple methods or even better, classes over one connection.</p>

<p>Anyway, in your case where you are talking about methods, with no answer on how to call them from the flex side, I would either make a 3rd method that calls those two, or allow some kind of object or parameter passing for init and let init call getData.</p>

<p>Another thought - maybe you need to consider what is happening in init and whether you really need it or need to call it directly from the client - for example, in order to getData (or put or etc), you always have to have been initialized?  So getData should probably check to see if it has been initialized and init if it has not.</p>
