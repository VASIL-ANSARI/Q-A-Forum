<p>A few things here: First off, Javascript is disabled in WebViews if you don't explicitly enable it. See WebSettings' <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings.html#setJavaScriptEnabled%28boolean%29" rel="nofollow"><code>setJavascriptEnabled</code></a> method. Also, loadDataWithBaseUrl uses the first argument to determine a bunch of security behaviors (see <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html" rel="nofollow">the docs</a> on that method), including I believe blocking scripts from fetching external resources if the base URL is null or starts with "data://". Try using any URL with "http://" at the beginning for the first argument and see if that helps, and of course make sure you have the <code>INTERNET</code> permission in your app's manifest.</p>

<p>But before all that... why don't you just use a <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-mapview.html" rel="nofollow">MapView</a>? IFraming a javascript Google Maps URL seems silly when you can just use a native map control.</p>
