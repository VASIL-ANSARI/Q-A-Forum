<p>It is completely possible to distribute a Framework using Cocoapods. Look at how <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/blob/master/Specs/PSPDFKit/3.7.9/PSPDFKit.podspec.json">PSPDFKit</a> is doing it.</p>

<p>Basically, instead of linking to a Github repo, their <code>source</code> url point to a .zip archive containing the Framework (with obviously a static library inside of it). The only source files distributed are the headers.</p>

<p>The interesting part in the podspec is the <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#vendored_frameworks"><code>vendored_frameworks</code></a> variable, which will tell Cocoapods to keep the Framework as part of the pod.</p>
