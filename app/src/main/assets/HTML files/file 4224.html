<p>I would use the navigation controller when they go into the registration section. This would allow the user to step back out after they go in and also allows for some flexibility if your registration process ever needs to be made into multiple steps. </p>

<p>Another suggestion is that you should put the actual log-in form on the first view. This way users that have already registered with you will not have to perform 2 steps just to log-in.</p>

<p>Login Screen</p>

<ol>
<li>Login Form</li>
<li>Register Button -> Register Views</li>
</ol>
