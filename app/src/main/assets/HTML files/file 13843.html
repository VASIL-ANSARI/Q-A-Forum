<p>You can't mount/unmount the SD card (external storage) from an app. You probably need to call media scanner to get your picture indexed. Look at <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaScannerConnection.html#scanFile%28android.content.Context,%20java.lang.String%5B%5D,%20java.lang.String%5B%5D,%20android.media.MediaScannerConnection.OnScanCompletedListener%29" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal" rel="nofollow">here</a> for pointers. There is also an sample app that comes with the SDK. BTW, what Android version are you testing on?</p>
