<p>for change current page url:</p>

<pre><code>function DownloadData()
{
   window.location = 'new url';
}
</code></pre>

<p>for opening new page:</p>

<pre><code>window.open(url);
</code></pre>

<p>This is the only thing you can do if browser settings permit it.</p>

<p>Fortunately!</p>

<p>If it was different i think that will be impossible to surf the web without having tons of popup opened</p>
