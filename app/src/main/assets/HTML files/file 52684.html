<p>The problem was in 'play-services-gcm' instead of 'play-services'</p>

<pre><code>compile ('co.realtime:messaging-android:2.1.58'){
        exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services'
}
</code></pre>

<p>grrr those typo mistakes... Well I thought I could delete this question but, once in a while someone has the same issue, so I will leave this here hoping perhaps it helps someone in need.</p>
