<p>Since you are getting the data from two server you will have to load the data into memory and compare them.</p>

<p>Keep them as a collection of some wrapper object that can give you the comparison results.</p>

<p>If you only want the data that is different, another approach will be to load the data from one server batch wise and generate a query to check and return the data if it's different in the other database.</p>
