<p>If you're using R (I use Rstudio), you can add the Leaflet package (<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/" rel="nofollow">https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/</a> it has some prerequisites). First you load the CSV as a dataframe, then you add a marker layer from it with a one liner (see <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/markers.html" rel="nofollow">https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/markers.html</a>)</p>

<p>For the layer control follow this example <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/showhide.html" rel="nofollow">https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/showhide.html</a></p>
