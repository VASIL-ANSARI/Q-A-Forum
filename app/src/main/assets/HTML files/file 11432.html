<p>There's <code>std::set</code>, which implements dynamic sets (dynamic means elements can be inserted or deleted). To make it work with your <code>element</code> structure, you need a custom comparison function that looks only at the <code>id</code>. Alternatively, you could use <code>std::map&lt;int, float&gt;</code>, which might be a better fit to your problem.</p>

<p>To find the intersection of two sets, use the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/set_intersection.html"><code>std::set_intersection</code></a> algorithm. That requires sorted ranges, which includes ranges of iterators into <code>std::set</code> or <code>std::map</code>. For the difference, use <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/set_difference.html"><code>std::set_difference</code></a>.</p>
