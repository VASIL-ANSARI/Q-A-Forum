<p>Perhaps it would be easier to follow if written like this:</p>

<pre><code>FROM trnsact t JOIN
     store_msa m
     ON m.store = t.store JOIN
     strinfo s
     ON t.store = s.store
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>JOIN</code> isn't <em>in</em> the <code>ON</code> statement.  The <code>FROM</code> clause consists of multiple joins, chained together.</p>

<p>You can think of the <code>JOIN</code> keyword as ending the <code>ON</code> clause and starting a new join condition.</p>
