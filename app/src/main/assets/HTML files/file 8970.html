<p>Why don't you store emails in separate table UserEmails and make a relationship with user table. For starting point you may look at <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/Topic609552-361-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> link
Useremail table will have three fields UseremailID email UserID </p>

<pre><code>UseremailID    email         UserID
1           sss@ss.com        1
2           asasf@ssf.com     1
</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend you to read some relational database so that you get some idea about tables and relationships</p>
