<p>GWT compiles your code into JavaScript which runs in the browser. JavaScript does not have access to your filesystem (for good reason).</p>

<p><code>java.io.FilePermission</code> is not listed in the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/RefJreEmulation.html#Package_java_io" rel="nofollow">JRE Emulation Reference</a> so you can't use it in your client-side code, so this shouldn't even be able to be compiled with GWT.</p>
