<p>Your app should be accepted if you notify the user first that the action will take them out of the app. A simple UIAlertView with a cancel and ok that continues with the Google+ login should work. An app we have does something similar and it was accepted after adding an alert.</p>

<p>Edit: Apple will reject any app that shifts to another app (e.g. launching another app like safari) without first notifying the user and giving them a choice with a label such as "This action will take you out of the app, continue?". In regards to this question, @Learner has the correct solution. At time of original answer, the new SDK wasn't yet available. </p>
