<p>A separate table which uses a non-sensical key (which could be an enum internally or an identity column) and a display value is the best design for the following reasons:</p>

<p>1) If a country name changes (which is a not-infrequent event recently) or is added, you won't have to recompile.</p>

<p>2) If your application is used in different countries, they will almost certainly have different spellings for other countries, in which case it is much easier to update the database than produce a different version of your application for each country it is sold in.</p>
