<p>Your question is a little vague, because it seems that you're conflating AOT and P/Invoke. AOT won't call and cache the results of a P/Invoke call, in fact, they have nothing to do with each other.</p>

<p>AOT basically generates native code for the ILDASM .NET bytecode. It has nothing to do with P/Invoke calls. P/Invoke is a runtime .NET function that calls the function from the native DLL. </p>

<p>Contrary to your post, Mono fully supports P/Invoke. Your problem isn't with Mono, hence there's nothing that Mono AOT can do to resolve your issue. Your problem is that the library being P/Invoke'd is not supported on the platform you're running your application under Mono on. No one can help you here; you will need to either reimplement the native functions for the new platform or find a managed alternative.</p>
