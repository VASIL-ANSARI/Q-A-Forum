<p>First of all you need to inherit your TitleButton class from Component so that the designer knows it is a component that can be created via designer generated code. Then you need to instruct the designer code generator to work on the contents of the collection and not the collection instance itself. So try the following...</p>

<pre><code>public class TitleButton : Component
{
   // ... 
}

[DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Content)]
public List&lt;TitleButton&gt; TitleButtons
{
   // ...
}
</code></pre>
