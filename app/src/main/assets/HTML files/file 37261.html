<p>It is not possible at the moment. <code>navigator.languages</code> is only implemented in Firefox at this time as you can see from the relevant <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorLanguage.languages" rel="nofollow">MDN page</a>, and it only lists the user's preferred languages as configured in Firefox settings, not the languages installed in OS. There is no alternative way to get to such information from JavaScript.</p>
