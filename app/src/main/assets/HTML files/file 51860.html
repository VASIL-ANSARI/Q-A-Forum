<p>I know this is old, but I was searching for something else and came across it so I thought I would provide a solution. The check mark is part of the label element in Fuel UX. So you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;label class="checkbox-custom" data-initialize="checkbox" data-bind="css: { checked: paid }"&gt;
    &lt;input id="Paid" type="checkbox" data-bind="checked: paid"&gt;
    &lt;span class="checkbox-label"&gt;Paid&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>data-bind</code> on the label? This applies the CSS class <code>'checked'</code> when the check box is checked. This is the same class that is applied by Fuel UX.</p>
