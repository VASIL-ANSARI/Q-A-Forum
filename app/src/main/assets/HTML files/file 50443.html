<p>The solution is that you can use multiple MediaPlayer's with independent left/right volumes for each track using .setVolume(left, right). However, and this is <strong>absolutely crucial</strong>...</p>

<p>It will <strong>not</strong> work with all audio formats. At present, I have got .wav files to work completely while .mp3's will not work (in any of the 3 respects).</p>

<p>I hope this saves some of you some of the time I just wasted accidentally coming up with a solution.</p>

<p>As a caveat, this worked on a Nexus 5 running API 23, so I can make no promises for other contexts.</p>
