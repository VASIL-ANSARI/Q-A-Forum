<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>From the comments we see that there are actually 51 td elements that have the text "Add Intrinsic Filter":</p>

<pre><code>browser.tds(:text =&gt; 'Add Intrinsic Filter').length
#=&gt; 51
</code></pre>

<p>We also see that some of these cells are visible and some are not - ie when calling <code>.visible?</code> for each cell, some returned true while others returned false:</p>

<pre><code>browser.tds(:text =&gt; 'Add Intrinsic Filter').map(&amp;:visible?).uniq
#=&gt; [false, true]
</code></pre>

<p>When locating a single element, Watir will pick the first element that matches. In this case, we can infer that the first cell with text "Add Intrinsic Filter" is not visible:
* The Selenium::WebDriver::Error::ElementNotVisibleError exception does it was not visible.
* Based on the ordering of the results of <code>browser.tds(:text =&gt; 'Add Intrinsic Filter').map(&amp;:visible?).uniq</code>, the first element was not visible.</p>

<p>Without seeing the page, we can only assume that the first matching cell is not the one you actually want to click.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>You need to determine which of the 51 cells is actually the one you want to click and then use a more specific locator.</p>

<p>Based on the result from Selenium IDE, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>browser.td(:xpath =&gt; '//tr[@id="filtersJob_intrinsic_container"]/td[2]/table[2]/tbody/tr/td[2]').click
</code></pre>

<p>Specifying the whole path to the element can be brittle to changes, so you might want to try something a little less specific. Perhaps try locating the row that has a specific id and then the cell with the specific text:</p>

<pre><code>browser.tr(:id =&gt; 'filtersJob_intrinsic_container').td(:class =&gt; 'text', :text =&gt; 'Add Intrinsic Filter').click
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>:class</code> was added as a locator to try to get the inner td rather than the outer one.</p>
