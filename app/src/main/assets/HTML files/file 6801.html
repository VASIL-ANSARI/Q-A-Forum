<p>You may find some useful information in the comments for <a href="http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/1535">this ticket</a> on <a href="http://trac-hacks.org">trac-hacks</a>.  One user reports using the <code>wget</code> utility to create a mirror copy of the wiki as if it was a normal website.  Another user reports using the <a href="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin">XmlRpc plugin</a> to extract HTML versions of any given wiki page, but this method would probably require you to create a script to interface with the plugin.  The poster didn't provide any example code, unfortunately, but the XmlRpc Plugin page includes a decent amount of documentation and samples to get you started.</p>

<p>If you have access to a command line on the server hosting Trac, you can use the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracAdmin"><code>trac-admin</code></a> command like:</p>

<pre><code>trac-admin /path/to/trac wiki export &lt;wiki page name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>to retrieve a plain-text version of the specified wiki page.  You would then have to parse the wiki syntax to HTML, but there are tools available to do that.</p>
