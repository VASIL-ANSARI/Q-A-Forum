<p>In the link you provided, the third example has something like:</p>

<pre><code>g.repulsion = g.repulsion / 8;
            g.spring_length = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>This apparently makes it more compact. Since, you want to spread out the graph, you should probably multiply like this:</p>

<pre><code>g.repulsion = g.repulsion * 10;
</code></pre>

<p>Try different numbers to see if it works. In future, I would suggest to use something with better documentation like D3.js.</p>
