<p>There was a changed made to how URLFetch handles redirect in the updated SDK.</p>

<p>Long story short, basically, all redirects becomes GET method regardless of what the original method was. So if you perform a POST URLFetch and then the redirect will turn it into a GET.</p>

<p>There are two ways to fix your code:</p>

<p>1) Use GET Method for all URLFetch that contains redirect</p>

<p>2) Do not use redirects and target the final URL directly</p>

<p>From your error though, it seems like the target URL isn't accepting GET requests? If that's the case do a POST to it directly.</p>
