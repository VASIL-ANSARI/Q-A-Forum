<p>By Ruby commands you probably mean the command line programs for Ruby.  These are also called Ruby Helper programs.  Here are a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/ruby">ruby</a> - The interpreter itself.  Run Ruby scripts or statements.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rubygems.org/read/book/2">gem</a> - Ruby Package Manager.  Great for automatically downloading or updating small Ruby modules like XML libraries, web servers, or even whole Ruby programs.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/pickaxe/irb.html">irb</a> - Interactive Ruby Prompt.  This is an entire Ruby shell that will let you execute any Ruby code you want.  You can load libraries, test code directly, anything you can do with Ruby you can do in this shell.  Believe me, there is quite a lot that you can do with it to improve your Ruby development workflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32537/what-is-the-best-way-to-use-a-console-when-developing#32686">[1]</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.caliban.org/ruby/rubyguide.shtml#ri">ri</a> - Quick shell access to Ruby documentation.  You can find the RDoc information on nearly any Ruby Class or method.  The same kind of documentation that you would find on the online ruby-docs.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stdlib.rubyonrails.org/libdoc/erb/rdoc/index.html">erb</a> - Evaluates embedded Ruby in Ruby Templated documents.  Embedded Ruby is just like embedding php into a document, and this is an interpreter for that kind of document.  This is really more for the rails crowd.  An alternative would be <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">haml</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/index.html">rdoc</a> - Generate the standard Ruby documentation for one of your Ruby classes.  Its like Javadocs.  It parses the Ruby source files and generates the standard documentation from special comments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>testrb</strong> and <strong>rake</strong>.  I'm not familiar enough with these.  I'd love it if someone could fill these in!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this was what you were looking for!</p>
