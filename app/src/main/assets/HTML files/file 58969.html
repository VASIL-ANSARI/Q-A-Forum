<pre><code>select screenid, branchid, count(1) as no_of_sessions
from screen A
    join session B
        on B.screenid = A.screenid
        and B.branchid = A.branchid
group by screenid, branchid
order by branchid, no_of_sessions
;
</code></pre>

<p>First, you join the two tables on <code>screenid</code> and <code>branchid</code>. Then, you aggregate (<code>group by</code>) the joined data to groups by <code>screenid</code> and <code>branchid</code> and simply count the number of rows in each group (<code>count(1)</code>). Then, you order the results by <code>branchid</code> and the number of sessions in the group (<code>no_of_sessions</code>).</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
