<p>You're asking if you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM TableB WHERE A_id = (SELECT id FROM TableA WHERE Name = 'Alice');
</code></pre>

<p>It's a perfectly legitimate query, but MySQL will perform much better doing the join because the subquery is treated as a second separate query. Using the MySQL <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html" rel="nofollow"><code>EXPLAIN</code></a> command (just put it in front of your <code>SELECT</code> query) will show the indexes, temporary tables, and other resources that are used for a query. It should give you an idea when one query is faster or more efficient than another.</p>
