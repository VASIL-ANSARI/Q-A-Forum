<p><a href="http://www.odetocode.com/Articles/70.aspx">OdeToCode has a good article covering the basic differences</a></p>

<p>As it says in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proper indexes are crucial for good
  performance in large databases.
  Sometimes you can make up for a poorly
  written query with a good index, but
  it can be hard to make up for poor
  indexing with even the best queries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite true, too... If you're just starting out with it, I'd focus on clustered and composite indexes, since they'll probably be what you use the most.</p>
