<p>I think your <code>validates :password, presence: true</code> validation may conflict with the validations added by has_secure_password in Rails 4. See Ryan B's answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10905870/how-to-user-has-secure-password-with-field-with-errors">here</a></p>

<p>Also, has_secure_password should already do <code>validates :password_confirmation, presence: true</code> for you, so you should remove that line from your model.</p>
