<p>That's a simple javascript mistake.<br>
You can't compare 1 value to 2 "potential" values like you tried <code>(val1 !== val2 || val3)</code>. You can do <code>(val1 !== val2 &amp;&amp; val1 !== val3)</code> or <code>([val2, val3].indexOf(val1) &gt;= 0)</code> and probably a few other ways to achieve the same effect.</p>
