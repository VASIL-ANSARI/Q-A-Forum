<p>If I understand you correctly, you want this:</p>

<pre><code>rewards = Reward.objects.all()
</code></pre>

<p>instead of <code>rewards = Reward.objects.get()</code>. You can then iterate over the rewards query object to access the data in each row, if necessary. For example,</p>

<pre><code>rewards = Reward.objects.all()
rewards = [(x.id, x.name) for x in rewards]  # returns a list of tuples for the id and name fields (if such fields exist)
</code></pre>
