<p>Since I see there are no helpful responses until now, and it's been a good few hours, here is my idea:</p>

<p>Basically, change the question to a minimal distance question on graphs. think of every room change as "long" and every time you stay in a room as "short". Looking at your example table (Table 1), I would create a graph in the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nodes: every cell in the table that is an optional room (equals 1) becomes a node.</li>
<li>Edges: every cell with value 1 (i.e. every node) with a similar cell in any column next to it will have an edge between them. This means <code>A[2,1]</code> will have and edge to <code>A[2,2]</code> and to <code>A[3,2]</code> (not to 'A[3,1]').</li>
<li>Weights of edges: this is the trick part. If the edge connect that same room, the weight is 0. If it connects different rooms, the weight is 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add s start node <code>s</code> that connects to all rooms on day one and a terminate node <code>t</code> connected to all the rooms on the last day and run BFS from <code>s</code> to <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>Hope this was helpful...</p>
