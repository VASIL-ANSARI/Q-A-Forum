<p>The way I do this is by using port forwarding:</p>

<p>1) Connect your device and open chrome on both your mobile and laptop browser.</p>

<p>2) On the URL tab, type chrome://inspect</p>

<p>3) Click on port forwarding and add a new row, with port as 8888 and IP as webservice_url:port.

<p>4) Now in your android application code, replace webservice_url:port with localhost:8888.
Basically now on 8888 your mobile will call the computer webservice url. Note: Make sure that chrome is open on both your laptop and the device. And when you type chrome://inspect you should be able to see the device you have attached.</p>

<p>Also add <code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/&gt;</code> to your Androidmanifest.xml</p>
