<p>What i wanted to do was basically load the button with the simple line below. 
<code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://mesitehere.com/button.php?sid=6587652341GFDSY"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

<p>Loading it like that rather than using iframe was a better option since it was lighter than having to use the iframe with custom style elements.</p>

<p>To accomplish what I wanted I simply put the contents of button.php in documentwrite like below. The code in button.php has the iframe with the proper styling and its basically just getting printed
<code>
&lt;?php
echo '
document.write(\'&lt;iframe frameborder="0" hspace="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" style="position: static; top: 0px; width: 50px; margin: 0px; border-style: none; left: 0px; visibility: visible; height: 60px;" tabindex="0" vspace="0" width="100%" id="I4_1397562331199" name="I4_1397562331199" src="http://mysitehere.com/show.php" title="Button"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\');
';
?&gt;</code></p>
