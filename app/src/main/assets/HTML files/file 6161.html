<p>You need a parser that is lenient enough to parse in HTML as XML, and those are rare.  I believe TagSoup - <a href="http://java-source.net/open-source/html-parsers/tagsoup" rel="nofollow">http://java-source.net/open-source/html-parsers/tagsoup</a> - can do it, but it's been a long time since I had a look at it.</p>

<p>Is there any reason you cannot just provide a XHTML snippet?</p>
