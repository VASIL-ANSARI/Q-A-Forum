<p>My original answer does not apply per your comment below.</p>

<p>One thing I'll suggest checking, then; Is your <code>app.config</code> file being moved into the directory with your program, and being renamed to the same as the program, with .config added?</p>

<p>So, <code>program.exe</code> has <code>program.exe.config</code> as the config file?`</p>

<p><strike>It looks like you have a Web application here; if so, your configuration file should be <code>web.config</code> rather than <code>app.config</code>. Then, you should be using the <code>WebConfigurationManager</code> from the <code>System.Web.Configuration</code> namespace.</strike></p>
