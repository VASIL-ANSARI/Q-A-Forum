<p>I'm fairly certain that some devices cover up some of the screen under the bezel, which is why you see non 0 scene coordinates in the upper left-hand corner on your device. I have experienced the same effect on my device. An alternative is to change your resolution policy to a fixed ratio resolution policy. That way you could create a buffer around the edge of your screen to account for the error.</p>
