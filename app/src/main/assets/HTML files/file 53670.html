<p>So I figured out what was wrong. </p>

<p>Every new bulk request was adding up to the previous one and eventually it was leading to out of memory. </p>

<p>So now before I start a new bulk request I run the 
<code>bulkRequest = client.prepareBulk();</code> 
which flushes the previous request. </p>

<p>Thank you guys for your comments</p>
