<p>The link_to helper makes this super easy.  Use it this way.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h6&gt; &lt;%= link_to special.business.business_name, special.business %&gt; &lt;/h6&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the name of the business in path you need to do more.  The gem <a href="http://norman.github.io/friendly_id/file.Guide.html" rel="nofollow">FriendlyId</a> was made for this.  <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/314-pretty-urls-with-friendlyid" rel="nofollow">Here's a great (free) railscast on how to use it.</a></p>
