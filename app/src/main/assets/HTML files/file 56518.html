<p>The SciPy generated frequency response is correct. In any case, I wouldn't trust the book's figure which appears to have been drawn by hand.</p>

<p>If you want to find the frequency response "manually", this can be simply done by defining a function returning the original Z-transform and evaluating it on the unit circle as follows</p>

<pre><code>def H(z):
    num = z**5 - z**4 + z**3 - z**2
    denom = z**5 + 0.54048*z**4 - 0.62519*z**3 - 0.66354*z**2 + 0.60317*z + 0.69341
    return num/denom

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

w_range = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1000)
plt.plot(w_range, np.abs(H(np.exp(1j*w_range))))
</code></pre>

<p>The result is exactly the same as SciPy.</p>
