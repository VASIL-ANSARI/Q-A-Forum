<p>I did find the answer in another StackOverflow question and answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4467539/javascript-modulo-not-behaving">Javascript modulo not behaving</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/">I wanted to share it</a> for people who like me only looked for a "CoffeeScript" related explanations and thus have a hard time finding the correct answer.</p>

<p>The reason for using <code>a %% b</code> which compiles to <code>(a % b + b) % b</code> is that for negative number, like <code>-5 % 3</code>, JavaScript will produce a negative number <code>-5 % 3 = -2</code> while the correct mathematical answer should be <code>-5 % 3 = 1</code>.</p>

<p>The accepted answer refers to <a href="http://javascript.about.com/od/problemsolving/a/modulobug.htm">an article on the JavaScript modulo bug</a> which explains it well.</p>
