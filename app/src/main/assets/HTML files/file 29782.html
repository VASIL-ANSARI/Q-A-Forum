<p>David, generally speaking a java interface is a Object Oriented "prototype" for a real object implementation. "Static mathod" are not (properly) Object Oriented, then static method are not allowed on interface.</p>

<p>Let me say <strong>"Static method" and "Java interface" are incompatible</strong> (please accept my lack of formalism).</p>

<p>Finally the sentence</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is there some trick to declare generic method in interface without
  declaring it on interface level ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is a little bit controversial, please refine it.</p>
