<p>I would seriously take a look at the documentation for <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a> library of Python.  From the first sentence of the package's description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>multiprocessing is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It then goes on to say that it side-steps the GIL, which is what it sounds like you're trying to avoid.  See their example of a trivial set up:</p>

<pre><code>from multiprocessing import Process

def f(name):
    print 'hello', name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))
    p.start()
    p.join()
</code></pre>

<p>That's a function call being done in another process separate from the process you're inside.  Again, all this from the documentation.</p>
