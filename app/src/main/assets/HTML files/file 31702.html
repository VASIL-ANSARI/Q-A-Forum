<p>Generally you don't want to use the main queue. Any operation there will run on the main thread.</p>

<p>When you create an operation queue, create it for a purpose. Like it will be used for all server requests. So you can control how many concurrent requests are in progress. So don't add algorithmic processing operations to this queue because they have a different purpose. Keep a reference to the queue so you can add operations in future (and pause / cancel operations).</p>

<p>There is no 'normal' setting for <code>maxConcurrentOperationCount</code> - it should be set based on the purpose.</p>

<p>If you set it to 8 then the queue will run up to 8 at the same time. This may not be the most efficient option. Always keep the purpose of the queue in mind.</p>
