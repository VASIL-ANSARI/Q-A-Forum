<p>Use a Set instead - it ensure no duplicates (i.e. a user can't like a post twice) and you can check existence quickly, i.e. (assuming redis-rb):</p>

<pre><code>redis.sadd 'post:{#post_id}:likes', '{#user_id}'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in order to do the reverse query, get the list of pages that a user liked, you'll need to keep another Set with the likes per each user, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>redis.sadd 'user:{#user_id}:likes' '{#post_id}'
</code></pre>
