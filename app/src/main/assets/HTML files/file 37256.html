<p>Ok, I found the issue. As I'm using Windows 8 the IP used to connect to my site is ::1 (The IPv6 version of 127.0.0.1). In my httpd.conf I only allowed requests from IP ::1. I had to add 127.0.0.1 to the allowed IP:s. My new httpd.conf has:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory "c:/wamp/www/"&gt;
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride all
#   onlineoffline tag - don't remove
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from ::1
    Allow from 127.0.0.1

&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>
