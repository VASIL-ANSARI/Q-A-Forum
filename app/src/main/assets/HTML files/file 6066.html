<p>Unfortunately your value of 2 in PasswordFormat tells us that these passwords are hashed, presumably using SHA1 (you can check this in your web.config). There's no way to reliably get the original password back, sorry.</p>

<p>*edit: unless you're aware of a specific cryptographic weakness in the particular hashing function, of course.</p>
