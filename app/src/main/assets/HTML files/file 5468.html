<p>I had same problem with my page but with 3 divs. My solutions was to use javascript code to get width and height of the page  <strong>offsetHeight and  offsetWidth</strong>. </p>

<p>For example use code bellow to get half of some element's width.</p>

<p><code>var midpoint = document.getElementById("MyElementId").offsetWidth/2;</code> .</p>
