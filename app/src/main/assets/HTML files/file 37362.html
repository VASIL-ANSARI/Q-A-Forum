<p>If values of the field that was created in that manner are being passed further down he application and can end up sent to database than yes you are open to SQL injection attacks.</p>

<p>Is there some code that is looking for "select" and decides that a field should be created from that? If yes, that looks somewhat dangerous and there could be more areas where this ecommerce app makes potentially dangerous decisions.</p>

<p>Binding is a good step in preventing unexpected data types from being entered, but going a step further like limiting some characters e.g. ;&lt;> is also a  good way. What worries me with your example is that you were not expecting a select field, but got one; that means that once broken that mechanism could be further exploited to interact with your database.</p>
