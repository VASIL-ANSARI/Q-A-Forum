<p>You're probably looking for timestamp. From Wikipedia you get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Timestamp, Unix time, or POSIX time, is a system for describing
  points in time, defined as the number of seconds elapsed since
  midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970, not
  counting leap seconds. It is widely used not only on Unix-like
  operating systems but also in many other computing systems. It is
  neither a linear representation of time nor a true representation of
  UTC (though it is frequently mistaken for both) as the times it
  represents are UTC but it has no way of representing UTC leap seconds
  (e.g. 1998-12-31 23:59:60).</p>

<p>Every programing language should probably have its own conversion functions: time -> date and date -> time. Here on stackoverflow you can find a similar question right answered: </p>
