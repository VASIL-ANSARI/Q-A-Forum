<p>Incremental numeric IDs are tricky in a distributed context, since there are multiple clients trying to edit the data at the same time. Instead, Firebase offers a more powerful primitive via the <code>push</code> method (or, in AngularFire, the <code>$add</code> method). These IDs are chronologically incremental by default and won't clash with other clients who may be trying to write to the same location.</p>

<p>I'd strongly consider a way to utilize these auto-generated IDs and then mapping them back to the grid as appropriate.</p>
