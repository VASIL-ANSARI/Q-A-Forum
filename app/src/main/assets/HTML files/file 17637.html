<p>Here's one possible method, although it's not quite as good as I'd like: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/5NWab/8/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/5NWab/8/</a></p>

<p>The idea is to decrease the speed gradually, as you were doing, based on the amount of time left, <strong>until</strong> you get to a point where the amount of distance that the cube has to rotate to reach it's starting rotation (0) becomes <em>greater than or equal to</em> the amount of rotation that can possibly be made given the current velocity and the current amount of time left. After that point, ignore the time left, and slow down the velocity in proportion to the amount of rotation left.</p>

<p>This works fairly well for certain <code>timeSpans</code>, but for others the ending slowdown animation takes a little long.</p>
