<p>There are errors with your PHP, but I think you are trying to do this:</p>

<pre><code>if ( isset( $_FILES['userfile'] ) ){
    $csv_file = $_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'];

    if ( ! is_file( $csv_file ) ){
        exit('File not found.');
    }

    $sql = "LOAD DATA INFILE '" . $csv_file . "' INTO TABLE testing_db FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'";
    $result = $dbh-&gt;query($sql); 

}
</code></pre>
