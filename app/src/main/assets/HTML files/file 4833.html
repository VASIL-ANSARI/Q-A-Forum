<p>As you mentioned, this is a non-functional issue about the code. With that in mind...</p>

<p>It's hard to give a definitive rule about it since it depends entirely on the context. Is the variable set once and forgotten about it, or constantly updated? How many methods share the same variable? How will the code be used?</p>

<p>In my experience, variables that drive behavior of the object but are seldom (if at all) modified are set in the initialize method, or given to the method that will cascade behavior. Libraries and leaf methods tend to have the variable passed in, as it's likely somebody will want to call it in isolation.</p>

<p>I'd suggest you start by passing everything first, and then refactoring if you notice the same variable being passed around all over the class.</p>
