<p>You have no <code>order by</code> clause on either query, so the result set ordering is indeterminate.  You could even run the same query twice and get different results.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why the results sets would not be in the same order.  The most likely is that you have an index on <code>mrpcolumn</code>.  This index covers the second query, so the query could use the index to get one row.</p>

<p>The first would go to the datapages.</p>

<p>Another reason would be execution in a parallel environment, where is it indeterminate which thread/process returns the first value.</p>

<p>When using <code>fetch first</code> clauses, you should generally be using <code>order by</code>.</p>
