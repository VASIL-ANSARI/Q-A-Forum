<p><code>highp</code> support is not mandatory, and AFAICT it's also not an 'extension', so you can't query it and support for it is also not recorded in GLES capability databases like <a href="http://opengles.gpuinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://opengles.gpuinfo.org/</a></p>

<p>You can query the precision of the shader using <code>glGetShaderPrecisionFormat</code> (  <a href="http://docs.gl/es3/glGetShaderPrecisionFormat" rel="nofollow">http://docs.gl/es3/glGetShaderPrecisionFormat</a> )</p>

<p>Of course it's up to your application to know what actual precision is actually needed. And this is at runtime, no way to know in advance.</p>
