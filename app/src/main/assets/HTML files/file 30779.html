<p>I'd keep the length of entered text. When pressing backspace/delete, you're basically erasing last character (the length is decreasing), so compare the new length with an old one. Pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>if newLength &gt; oldLength then vibrate

else don't vibrate 
</code></pre>

<p>If newLength is shorter, it means you have pressed backspace/delete key and deleted a character, so don't vibrate. You can do it in onTextChanged, or where ever makes sense to you.</p>
