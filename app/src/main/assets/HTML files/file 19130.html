<p>The problem is that your methods <code>in()</code> and <code>out()</code> are running on the EDT and are blocking it until they end, which prevents Repaint events from being dispatch and display the modified location of your keyboard.</p>

<p>Use a Swing timer instead to pace your animation. This will allow intermediary repaint to actually occur.</p>
