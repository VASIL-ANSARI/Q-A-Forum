If a given chunk is identical between the two servers, no copying is needed.  If the chunk differs, it copies just the chunk it needs.  You don't have to wipe the local table.</p>

<p>Another alternative is to copy the remote data to a distinct table name.  If it completes successfully, then DROP the old table and RENAME the new local copy to the original table's name.  If the copy fails or is interrupted, then drop the local copy with the distinct name and try again.  Meanwhile, your other local table with the previous data is untouched.</p>
