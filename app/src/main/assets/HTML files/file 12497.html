<p>The second code is returning an object that represents the query you are calling; it will never be null. Though once enumerated, it could be an empty collection. (still not null, though)</p>

<p>Your first is calling FirstOrDefault, which is forcing a single result into a single variable, returning null if there are no results. If you did <code>Where</code> instead of <code>FirstOrDefault</code>, you would have the same result both times.</p>
