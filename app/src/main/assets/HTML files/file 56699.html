<p>Indeed <code>erase</code> cannot be used directly with a reverse iterator; you'd essentially be removing the wrong element if it were allowed.</p>

<p>You need to convert <code>rit</code> to a forward iterator.</p>

<p><code>(rit + 1).base();</code> will give you the equivalent <code>it</code>. Note carefully the <code>+ 1</code>. </p>

<p>Putting this together, write</p>

<p><code>BLV-&gt;erase((rit + 1).base());</code></p>

<p>in your reverse case.</p>
