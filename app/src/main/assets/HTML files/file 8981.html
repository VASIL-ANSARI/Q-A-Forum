<p>For Michael:</p>

<p>The problem was using the same ID to style the unordered list and to animate the unordered list using jQuery. </p>

<p>To solve this, simply add a class to the unordered list and use this to style it using CSS. Then use the original ID to perform the jQuery animation, eg: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id="archive-full" class="archive-style"&gt;
</code></pre>
