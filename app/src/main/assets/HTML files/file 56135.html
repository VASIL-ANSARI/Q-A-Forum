<p>you are confused, if i`m not wrong, you want to create a counter (How many people are clicking in X post, wright?).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In table wp_term_taxonomy, the 'count' row, it's not the times a user has click on the post.those numbers are the number of terms asociate to a Taxonomy.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want a counter there is a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-views-counter/" rel="nofollow">fast way</a> or a 'Hard way'.</p></li>
<li><p>Hard way: create your own plugin and use <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-and-working-with-the-wordpress-options-table--cms-21119" rel="nofollow">wp_options to save your data</a></p></li>
</ol>
