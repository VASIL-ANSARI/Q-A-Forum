<p>Your code should work fine, the only thing you may need to fix is that user interaction is disabled for UILabel by default, so gesture recogniser does not receive any touch events. Try manually enable it by adding this line to your code (e.g. in init method):</p>

<pre><code>self.userInteractionEnabled = YES;
</code></pre>
