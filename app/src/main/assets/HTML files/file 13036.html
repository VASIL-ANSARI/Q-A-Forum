<p>This one is straightforward.  The API states that a PUT against the name of a db (in your example, "db") attempts to create a new database, which requires admin privileges.</p>

<p>To create a new document, you may use a POST as you did successfully, but the API documents discourage the use of POSTs.  PUTs can be used for both creates and updates.</p>

<p>To update an existing document, use a PUT with the ID of the document in the path of the URL and the desired revision to update in the JSON; e.g., <code>CouchRest.put('http://localhost:5984/db/1', {"rev": "sdf", "test": "testing"})</code></p>
