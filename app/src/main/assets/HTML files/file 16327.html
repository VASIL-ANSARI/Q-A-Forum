<p>I found a hack that accomplishes what I need, but negatively impacts the NH cache (I think): I simply assign to a "new" Question, instantiated with the <em>existing</em> question's ID.  It looks horrible, and, like I said, it essentially loads the cache with these (very) partially-filled question objects (not verified, but behavior seems to indicate as much).</p>
