<p>The correct path to employees.js depends on the path of the page that wants to load it, not the path of the script doing the loading. From your index.html file, the path to employees.js is "data/employees.js". From test.html, the path is "../data/employees.js". </p>

<p>You will need some way to figure out where you are in the structure of the site and make the correct request.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this is to store those files in a well-known location, then use absolute URLs - i.e., "/data/employees.js". Then, no matter where you're trying to load from, the path is always starting from the root of the site.</p>
