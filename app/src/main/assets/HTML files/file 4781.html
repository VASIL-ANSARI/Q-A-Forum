<p>Ok well it doesn't seem to be affecting your outcome, but you do have 2 data: fields.</p>

<p>Besides that, you are treating the remote: rule like a regular jquery ajax call... its not like that.  It doesn't have a success callback, etc... It should look more like this.</p>

<pre><code>remote: {
        type: "post",
        url: "WebForm1.aspx/IsValid",
        data: { username: function () {
            return $("#UserName").val();
                                      }
              }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>And your server side well echo "true" or "false" based on the posted value being true or false, it's not done via a success callback.</p>

<p>So something like</p>

<pre><code> public static Boolean IsValid()
{

  document.write("true");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, it will hit the url: you give it, pass it the variables in data: and wait for a true or false to determine if its valid code or not.  The reason your form validate works when you put nothing in, is because of the required: true value you have checks if its empty...</p>
