<p>Today I run into the same problem with this example code. @mathematical-coffee was right there were no features extracted, thus obj and scene were empty. I replaced the test pictures and it worked. From texture style images you can't extract SURF features.</p>

<p>Another way to is to lower the parameter minHessianve.g. `int minHessian = 20;</p>

<p>or use the FAST feature detector by changing a few lines: </p>

<pre><code>  //-- Step 1: Detect the keypoints using SURF Detector
  int minHessian = 15;

  FastFeatureDetector detector( minHessian );
</code></pre>
