<p>A slice can't be in your return type as the method just doesn't support this. You can read more about the <code>__index__</code> <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0357/" rel="nofollow">special method here</a>.
I could only come up with a workaround that directly calls the function in your class:</p>

<pre><code>class MyThing(object):
        def __init__(self, start, stop, otherstuff):
            self.start = start
            self.stop = stop
            self.otherstuff = otherstuff  

        def __index__(self):
            return slice(self.start, self.stop)

    thing = MyThing(1, 3, 'potato')
    print 'Hello World'[thing.__index__()]
</code></pre>

<p>This will return <code>el</code>.</p>
