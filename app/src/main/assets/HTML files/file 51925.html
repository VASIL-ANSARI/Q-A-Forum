<p>I can help more with exactly how to do this so feel free to message me, but the short answer is in this great package of filters:</p>

<p>Filter by helps with exactly what you are trying to do, however I suggest converting your top level object into an array first.</p>

<pre><code>collection | filterBy: [prop, nested.prop, etc..]: search: strict[optional]
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
