<p>The "Rails doesn't scale" myth simply won't die ...</p>

<p>Quoting Twitter's lead architect:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The performance boosts associated with a âfasterâ language would give us a 10-20% improvement, but thanks to architectural changes that Ruby and Rails happily accommodated, Twitter is 10000% faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't give you a fixed number, but it is almost absolutly guaranteed that you run into database or architectural bottlenecks long long before Ruby or Rails are starting to become bottlenecks.</p>
