<p>I'm not sure if I understood correctly, but that name in your example is not the button name, it's just the reference name used in code to access the button. The button name would be set like this:</p>

<pre><code>buttonRefName.Name = "ButtonName1";
</code></pre>

<p>So you can set the name to whatever you want: dynamically generated names inside a loop, names read from a file, etc... </p>

<p>You can use the same reference name for multiple buttons, just be sure to add it to List or to WPF Window, Panel, etc... before creating the new one:</p>

<pre><code>var buttonList = new List&lt;Button&gt;();
var buttonRef = new Button { Name = "YourButtonName" };
buttonList.Add(buttonRef);
buttonRef = new Button { Name = "YourButtonName2" };
buttonList.Add(buttonRef);
</code></pre>
