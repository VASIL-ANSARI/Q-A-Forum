<p>I ended up contacting the company I am hosting my virtual server with and as it turns out it wasn't an issue with anything I have control over at all. It turned out that their hypervisor (virtual machine monitor - VMM) was having issues so when my server was synchronizing its time from it, my time was getting offset by about 7 minutes. Since the system clock of my server was being controlled by it, this also disallowed me from being able to set the time manually with this command:</p>

<pre><code>date -s "27 SEP 2012 HH:MM:SS"
</code></pre>

<p>since the changes would just be superseded by the VMM.</p>
