<p>General tip for troubleshooting this: Run both sides of the pipeline using the <code>strace</code> tool (you can use <code>strace -f</code> to follow forks) so that you can verify what is actually written / read from the pipe.</p>

<p>I suspect that in this case, nothing is written by the child! This is because the stdio layer that you use (<strong>printf()</strong>) checks whether it is writing to a terminal or to, well, anything else. In case of terminal, it flushes the output after each newline, but in other cases, it flushes only after a large-ish block of data is written (8KiB on GNU systems). Try flushing the output manually using <strong>fflush()</strong> after <strong>printf()</strong>. If that helps, you can adjust <strong>stdout</strong> buffering mode using <strong>setvbuf()</strong>.</p>
