<p>I did eventually find a solution to this still haven't tracked down why. Apparently in IE8 $.hide() and $.show doesn't set calculated height correctly in some situations.  However, I modified my method to use an addClass("display-none") call instead and heights calculated correctly.  I hope this helps any other having a similar issue.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
On another page with this same issue the "fix" listed above had no effect.  So I still don't know. Will update if I find out more.</p>
