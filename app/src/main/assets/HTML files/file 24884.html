<p>It's good to see that you have made an effort at solving the problem. However, there is a mismatch between what you set out in your question and some of the comments in your code. It seems clear to me that a key part of your brief is that the employee object itself is required to be able to write itself to the file and to read itself back from the file.</p>

<p>You have written code that will write the contents of the object to the file rather than having the object write itself to the file. It might seem like I'm splitting hairs on this one, but this is the essence of what Object Oriented Programming is about. Encapsulating the functionality within the object itself is the real goal here.</p>

<p>I've included some code below to help you. Hopefully this will make good sense for you.</p>

<pre><code>class employee
{
private:
    int _locEmpNumber;
    std::string _locName;
    std::string _locAddress;
    std::string _locPhone;
    double _locHrWorked;
    double _locHrWage;

public:
    employee();
    employee(int locEmpNumber, std::string locName, std::string locAddress, std::string locPhone, double locHrWorked, double locHrWage);

    //object should be able to save itself as per your project brief.
    void writeData(std::ofstream &amp;empFile);

    //object should be able to read itself from file as per your project brief
    void readData(std::ifstream &amp;empFile);
};

employee::employee()
{
    _locEmpNumber = 0;
    _locHrWorked = _locHrWage = 0;
}


employee::employee(int locEmpNumber, std::string locName, std::string locAddress, std::string locPhone, double locHrWorked, double locHrWage)
{
    _locEmpNumber = locEmpNumber;
    _locName = locName;
    _locAddress = locAddress;
    _locPhone = locPhone;
    _locHrWorked = locHrWorked;
    _locHrWage = locHrWage;
}

//
//From what I can glean from your brief ...
//Employee objects to write themselves out to the file!!!
void employee::writeData(std::ofstream &amp;empFile)

    //would either return a response that indicates that the operation
    //succeded or failed. You might alternatively use exception handling
    //or indeed a combination of both.
    //
    //Normally you would reset all members to initial / empty values before
    //reading values into them from your file. In this case we will omit that
    //for the purposes of simplicity. The main reason you would reset members
    //is to ensure that when reusing an object you don't end up with partial
    //data from the current "read" operation mixed with partial data that
    //was already in the object before you started reading.
