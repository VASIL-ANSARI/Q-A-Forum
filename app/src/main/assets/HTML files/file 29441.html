<p>As you identified in the comments, predict_proba is NOT deterministic!</p>

<p>But it does accept a random_state (as does KFold). I've found before that setting shuffle=False can lead to really poor results if your data were collected in a non-random order, so IMHO you're better off using shuffle and setting random_state to some number.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html" rel="nofollow">the docs</a></p>

<pre><code>class sklearn.svm.SVC(C=1.0, kernel='rbf', degree=3, gamma=0.0, coef0=0.0, shrinking=True, probability=False, tol=0.001, cache_size=200, class_weight=None, verbose=False, max_iter=-1, random_state=None)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>random_state</strong> : int seed, RandomState instance, or None (default)</p>

<p>The seed of the pseudo random number generator to use when shuffling the data for probability estimation.</p>
