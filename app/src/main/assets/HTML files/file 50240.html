<p>I recommend that you use code generation to create native models out of the json response, this will save your time of parsing by hand and reduce the risk of errors due to mistaken keys, all elements will be accessible by model properties, this will be purely native and the models will make more sense rather checking the keys. Check <a href="http://www.json4swift.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.json4swift.com</a> and let me know if you require further help in initiating the object from your json response. (make sure you enter the actual json response and not the printed object as that in your question)</p>
