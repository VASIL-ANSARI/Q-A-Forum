<p>If you want to show an error message in jsp page that was send from a servlet and to display it in jsp page the code must be similar to this one:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if(!request.getAttribute("errorMessage").isEmpty()){
 out.println(requet.getAttribute("errorMessage"));
} %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the errorMessage attribute must be defined in the servlet that send the request to the jsp page, or if you are using jquery you can send it from a PrintWriter in the servlet and write the script that will be displayed in the jsp file. I hope my answer can help you </p>
