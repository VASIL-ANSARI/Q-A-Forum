<p>Lua is designed to work well with both C and C++. The C API is meant for that.</p>

<p>You don't need to create and use shared libraries to extend Lua. It is the easiest way to extend the standard command line interpreter but it should be easy (if not easier) to link static C libraries for Lua in your own application.</p>

<p>If you want to see some examples of C libraries for Lua, see <a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/" rel="nofollow">mine</a>. There are many others.</p>
