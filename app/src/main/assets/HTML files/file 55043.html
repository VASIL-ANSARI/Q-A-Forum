<p>I'm going to write here what I've discovered until now, but I'm not going to mark the question as answered.</p>

<h1>Concepts</h1>

<h3>What is reactivity?</h3>

<p>Using reactivity, the data you show to your users will be updated in real time. You can enable or disable reactivity when you subscribe to a collection. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>// enabled by default
Meteor.publish('top', function() {
  return Top.find({},{reactive: false});
});
</code></pre>

<h3>What is oplog?</h3>

<p>Oplog is the MongoDB log. When you tell meteor to use oplog, reactivity performance is much better, unless you have a really high volumne of insert operations. In this cases may be wise to keep it disabled. Oplog can optimize your reactive DB calls <a href="https://meteorhacks.com/making-meteor-500-faster-with-smart-collections/" rel="nofollow">by ~x5 ~x20</a>.If you are going to use oplog you should optimize your db calls. You can read more about it <a href="https://kadira.io/academy/meteor-performance-101/content/optimize-your-app-for-oplog" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<h1>What methods exists to connect DBS to meteor?</h1>

<h3>Default connection:</h3>

<p>Reactivity? yes. Oplog? yes. DB Limit? One. Description: Meteor creates a default MongoDB database when you run 'meteor'. You can set a different database using enviromental variables, or just <code>MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/db_name meteor</code>.</p>

<h3>DDP:</h3>

<p>Reactivity? yes. Oplog? yes. DB Limit? no. Description: You need a meteor project for every DB. That's about 600MB in memory for every DB. You can read about it <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20537457/2010764">here</a> and <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/api/connections.html#DDP-connect" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<h3>MongoInternal (<strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Thanks to carlevans719):</h3>

<p>Reactivity? yes. Oplog? yes. DB Limit? no. Description: You can specify a DB in your subscriptions file like:</p>

<pre><code>ar database = new MongoInternals.RemoteCollectionDriver('mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/meteor', {oplogUrl: "mongodb://localhost:27017/local"});
var numberOfDocs = database.open('boxes').find().count();
</code></pre>

<h3>Last Words:</h3>

<p>MongoInternal If you are not going to use the default db, you have to tell meteor to do not create it. To achieve this you must always run meteor as <code>MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017 meteor</code></p>
