<p><strong>Why</strong> is great question. The <code>catalog_product_super_link</code> table only contains data related to configurable products. <code>catalog_product_relation</code> also contains the relation information for bundled and grouped products, in addition to the configurable relations.</p>

<p>All the business logic revolving around configurable products refers to the <code>catalog_product_super_*</code>tables, e.g. finding the configurable attributes and price updates for a configurable product.</p>

<p>The <code>catalog_product_relation</code> table in contrast is used by classes not specific to configurable products, like the abstract catalog product indexer classes.</p>

<p>It seems that the Magento core team wanted to separate the logically distinct functionality not only into separate PHP classes, but also into separate database tables. Possible advantages? I guess theoretically it is easier this way to change the configurable product implementation without disrupting the indexer implementation.</p>

<p>This is just a guess - I haven't confirmed that or spoken with someone who "knows" (<em>mental-note-for-imagine</em>)</p>
