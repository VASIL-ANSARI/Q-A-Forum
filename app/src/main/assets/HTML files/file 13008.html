<p>I would abort your previous ajax request for each one you send out.  That way they won't be stepping over each other.  Another option is waiting a couple of milliseconds after each keypress to see if there is another keypress before sending the ajax request.  The former being more responsive but causing more server load and the latter being less responsive but causing less server load.  In fact you could do both if you wanted to.</p>

<pre><code>if(previousRequest) {
  previousRequest.abort();
}

previousRequest = $.ajax(...
</code></pre>
