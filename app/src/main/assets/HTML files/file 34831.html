<p>I'd do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static int playerX, playerY;
public static void MovePlayer(int x, int y)
{
     table[playerX, playerY] = "-"; //Remove old position
     table[x, y] = "P"; //Update new position
     playerX = x; //Save current position
     playerY = y;

     UpdateGrid();
}
</code></pre>

<p>All you have to do is set the element to <code>"P"</code> to change it, nothing fancy.</p>

<p>To update your grid you have two options, to either re-draw everything, or to set the cursor position and change the character.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>SetCursorPosition(playerX, playerY);
Console.Write("-");
SetCursorPosition(x, y);
Console.Write("P");
</code></pre>

<p>Or, use the code you have now to call it again to re-write everything.</p>
