<p>You'll need to tell us more about the "huge calculation" to get specific help. There are a few strategies that can be applied, depending on the nature of the calculation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the client is sending a large workload, break it up into smaller requests that can be satisfied in under two minutes. </p></li>
<li><p>Include some sort of no-op operation in your response format, and have the ASMX service periodically send a no-op if the full response isn't ready yet.  This will keep the connection alive while the long computation continues.  However, this will require a pretty deep understanding of all the buffering between the client and the ASMX service, because you won't want the no-op operation to buffer, as you are specifically using it to keep the connection open.  This can be difficult to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn the single request/response into two request/response pairs, one for 'start' and one for 'check'.  The 'start' API starts the calculation, and returns some sort of ID, which the client can use to invoke the 'check' API to see if the calculation is complete, and fetch the result.</p></li>
</ol>
