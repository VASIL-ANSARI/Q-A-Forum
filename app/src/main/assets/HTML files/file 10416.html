<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>Maybe I get you wrong but is your problem that the grid gets updated to early (read: the new game state is used for calculating remaining old cells?)</p>

<p>I think you run into troubles with <code>old = grid</code> because that will merely produce a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1175620/in-java-what-is-a-shallow-copy">shallow copy</a> of your array. Very likely you looking for a deep copy which could be achieved using the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html" rel="nofollow">clone method</a> which Array has inherited.</p>

<p>Furthermore as I read the code I got the feeling you already update the grid while still calculating the new game state. Only assign the new game state to a working grid like "gridTemp" and when exiting the outer for loop you should do something like:</p>

<pre><code>grid = gridTemp.clone()
gridTemp.clear() //purge, trash whatever, just make it empty
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that's just pseudo code! I hope it's helpful anyway. :)</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong>
Ok, I can't run your code here and therefore I'm not 100% sure if that's the solution to your problem but this code block seems to be wrong:</p>

<pre><code>if(generation == 1)
                {
                    old = grid;
                    newGrid[i][j] = 1;
                    grid = newGrid;
                    show();
                    grid = old;
                }
                else 
                {   
                    old = grid;
                    newGrid[i][j] = 0;
                    grid = newGrid;
                    show();
                    grid = old;
                                }
</code></pre>

<p>instead I suggest a tiny restructure. Replace the code above with:</p>

<pre><code>newGrid[i][j] = generation
</code></pre>

<p>and furthermore add the following just after your iteration.</p>

<pre><code>grid = newGrid.clone();
show();
</code></pre>

<p>So instead of updating and displaying the grid all the time while calculating the new game give yourself a kiss, (Keep It Sweet and Simple!). First determine the new game state and save it in a temporary grid like <code>newGrid</code>.
In the end you can copy the game state into the old grid and update the display.
Probably it's not even necessary to call the clone() method there but let's be a little bit crazy :)</p>
