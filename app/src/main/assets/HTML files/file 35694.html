<p>I would need to debug your code to find out why you're overwriting other parts of memory, but I won't be shocked if it's due to punning.</p>

<p>As an alternative to all of the casting, you can memcpy() the data to the requisite variable.</p>

<pre><code>u32 ar;
memcpy(&amp;ur, model_bin, sizeof(u32));
</code></pre>

<p>The pointer casting should make you nervous, given the links that I posted in my comments.  Using memcpy() is safer, and you don't get all of those compiler warnings and errors.  </p>
