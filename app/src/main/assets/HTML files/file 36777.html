<p>"Encrypted" is a misleading term, because that implies that it can be decrypted.  Something transformed with the "SHA256" algorithm is actually cryptographically <em>hashed</em>.  There is no "decrypt" functionality for a cryptographic hashing algorithm.</p>

<p>But you can still use it.  When a user submits a password, perform "SHA256" on the user's submitted password, and compare it with the stored, hashed password.  By the looks of the string above, you may need to convert the hash output to a hex string to compare it.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may first need to find out if a salt is applied to the hash (additional random content added on a per-user basis to increase security).  If so, then you'll need to apply the salt to the user's submitted password before hashing it.</p>
