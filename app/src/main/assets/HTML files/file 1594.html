<p>You're calling <code>ShowDialog()</code> twice. That can't be good.</p>

<p>Don't store the result in two variables (<code>loginSuccessful</code>, <code>loginRetry</code>), because then you have the same information stored in two places.  Try instead:</p>

<pre><code>switch (login.ShowDialog())
{
    case DialogResult.OK:
        Application.Run(new Form1());
        return;

    case DialogResult.Retry:
        Application.Run(new Login());
        return;

    default:
        throw new Exception("unexpected dialog result");
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think you should be calling <code>Application.Run()</code> in a nested context, but I don't have hard data on that.  Maybe looping on <code>login.ShowDialog()</code> until it returns OK.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem right to have an authentication system return <code>DialogResult</code> to indicate success of authentication. these values are about which buttons were pressed.</p>

<p>You haven't shown us the context of this code, but I would bet that it's not secure. Most experienced programmers struggle with security (myself included). Having an experienced programmer do it is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>While I'm at it, I would name a dialog class with <code>Dialog</code>, as in <code>LoginDialog</code>. Having it be called <code>Login</code> will lead to name clashes soon.</p>
