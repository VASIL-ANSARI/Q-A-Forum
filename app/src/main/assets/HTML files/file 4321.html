<p>Yes. It's called a database. Since a dictionary was working for you (aside from memory concerns) I would suppose that an sqlite database would work fine for you. You can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow">sqlite3</a> quite easily and it is very well documented.</p>

<p>Of course this will only be a good solution if you can represent the values as something like json or are willing to trust pickled data from a local file. Maybe you should post details about what you have in the values of the dictionary. (I'm assuming the keys are words, if not please correct me)</p>

<p>You might also want to look at not generating the whole dictionary and only processing it in chunks. This may not be practical in your particular use case (It often isn't with the sort of thing that dictionaries are used for unfortunately) but if you can think of a way, it may be worth it to redesign your algorithm to allow it.</p>
