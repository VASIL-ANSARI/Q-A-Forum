<p>Start by making sure you use the good practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>eliminate viewstate if possible (that could be a lot of hidden data)</li>
<li>use DataGridView paging to keep request times down by showing data in pages of 10, 20, 30, ...</li>
<li>if paging is not nessesary, use a DataList or Repeater to reduce the overhead of the object </li>
<li>deploy solution from release build without any debugging or tracing directives</li>
</ul>

<p>If that does not help, use profiler such as ANTS or dotTrace to investigate DataGridView behavior.</p>

<p>These tools will show you exactly where the bottlenecks are.</p>
