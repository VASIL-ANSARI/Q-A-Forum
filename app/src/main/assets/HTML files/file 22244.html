<p>I might be missing something, but can you not use <code>MIN</code> instead of <code>TOP 1 ... ORDER BY</code>, since you are ordering by EndDate, StartDate DESC, and only selecting EndDate, the start date is not relevant to the sort, it is only considered when you have 2 end dates that are the same, but since you are only selecting end date it doesn't matter which of the two (or more end dates) are used:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  D.StartDate,
        (   SELECT  MIN(E.EndDate)
            FROM    Dates E
            WHERE   E.EndDate &gt;= D.EndDate
            AND     NOT EXISTS 
                    (   SELECT  1
                        FROM    Dates E2
                        WHERE   E.StartDate &lt; E2.StartDate
                        AND     E.EndDate &gt; E2.StartDate
                    )
        ) EndDate
FROM    Dates D
WHERE   NOT EXISTS 
        (   SELECT  1
            FROM    Dates D2
            WHERE   D.StartDate &lt; D2.EndDate
            AND     D.EndDate &gt; D2.EndDate
        );
</code></pre>
