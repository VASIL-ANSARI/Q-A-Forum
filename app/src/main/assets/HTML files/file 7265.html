<p>Have a look at SQLServer-DBA.com at <a href="http://www.sqlserver-dba.com/2011/05/sql-server-query-optimizer-and-statistics-.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for a statistics overview and <a href="http://www.sqlserver-dba.com/statistics/" rel="nofollow">another page</a> on how to gather statistics in MS SQL Server. I don't know of other vendor implementations. </p>

<p>Further research shows that SQL Server has the <a href="http://ss64.com/sql/stats_c.html" rel="nofollow">CREATE STATISTICS</a> command, which looks to be the equivalent.</p>
