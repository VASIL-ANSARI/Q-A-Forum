<p>Thi happened to me when I had 2 versions of the library and I was linking against the wrong one. Also c++filt shows:</p>

<p>c++filt _ZN19CreturnLabelPrinter10PrintLabelESsSsiiiSsbSsCreturnLabelPrinter::PrintLabel(std::basic_string, std::allocator >, std::basic_string, std::allocator >, int, int, int, std::basic_string, std::allocator >, bool, std::basic_string, std::allocator >)</p>

<p>This has a huge list of arguments, did you check them?   </p>
