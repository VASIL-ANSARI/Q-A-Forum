<p>I think the Webserver is not serving your app.js File. Have you tried to open it in your Browser, to check if the Path is right?(e.g. <a href="http://localhost/app.js" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/app.js</a>).</p>

<p>Check if the Name of the File is Lowercase as well and if the Webserver has read Permissions on the File.</p>
