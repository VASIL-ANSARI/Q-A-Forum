<p>I'm not going to write this out for 10 tables, but here's the essence of it.</p>

<p>UNION 10 derived tables, like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT id, average, 'Table1' AS TableName FROM Table1
UNION
SELECT id, average, 'Table2' AS TableName FROM Table2
</code></pre>

<p>With that 10-table union as a subselect, write an outer query that selects TOP 1 TableName, order by average DESC, WHERE id=@desiredId.</p>
