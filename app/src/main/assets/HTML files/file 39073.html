<p>Depending on your website and on what you want to achieve, I would suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the fileupload is within a dialog, you can attach a listener to the dialog itself. When the listener is called just stop the validation progress in your bean.</p></li>
<li><p>You can try to make the dialog modal, it prevents the user form clicking anywhere else on the page (except the experience users which are able to remove the modal, and the dialog from the document DOM by using e.g., Firebug or Developer Tools)</p></li>
<li><p>The same applies for a <a href="http://malsup.com/jquery/block/" rel="nofollow">block ui</a> script.</p></li>
<li><p>Imho the best approach would be to attach a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onbeforeunload" rel="nofollow">window.beforeunload listener</a> or something similar. This listener can then call a backing bean method to stop the validation.</p></li>
</ul>
