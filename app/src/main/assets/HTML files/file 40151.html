<p>You can create a <code>link</code> element just like any other element:</p>

<pre><code>var link = document.createElement('link');
link.rel = "stylesheet";
link.type = "text/css";
link.href = "style.css";
document.querySelector("head").appendChild(link);
</code></pre>

<p>...but that said, I would normally expect you to leave that to the page author, just list it as a requirement of your script that the CSS must be put on the page&nbsp;&mdash; not least because it lets them combine that CSS with other CSS to avoid lots of HTTP requests, etc. That's what every major framework/library (jQuery UI, Bootstrap, etc.) does.</p>
