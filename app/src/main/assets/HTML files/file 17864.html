<p>This is a crazy example, but hopefully you get the idea:</p>

<p>Imagine you have an online shopping website, in the users profile page, you show a nice image (canvas created) of a credit card with the four last numbers of the card on it, when users click on it they can change their credit card details(number,date,etc). That's fine.</p>

<p>Now imagine that by any means, for example an XSS vulnerability, or an sql injection, or whatever, a cracker could change the link where you load your canvas image to point to a canvas image in the attacker's server. </p>

<p>The canvas image the cracker is sending resambles the same of the original website but with different four last numbers at the end, and a link that says <em>"If this is not your credit card, click here to change it"</em>.</p>

<p>When the user clicks that link goes to a phising webpage of the cracker, that resambles the original "change card data details" page, but when user enter his credit card details they will be saved on the attacker server and then redirected back to the original website.</p>
