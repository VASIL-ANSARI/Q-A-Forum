<p>Accorrding to the very draft spec <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-device-adapt/#translate-meta-to-at-viewport" rel="nofollow">CSS Device Adaptation Module Level 1</a>, the precedence is determined by the position of the viewport element in the DOM</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Viewport <code>&lt;META&gt;</code> element is placed in the cascade as if it was a
  <code>&lt;STYLE&gt;</code> element, in the exact same place in the dom, that only
  contains a single @viewport rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, it would override @viewport rules that precede it, and be overridden by @viewport rules that follow it, except that when @viewport declarations have higher importance (!important), they would always trump viewport <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element rules.</p>
