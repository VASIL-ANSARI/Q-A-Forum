<p>If all you want are the borders for the provinces, there are a few options.  At least as a last resort, you can use the tool described at <a href="http://martinove.dk/2011/03/17/polylinepolygon-tool-for-google-maps/" rel="nofollow">http://martinove.dk/2011/03/17/polylinepolygon-tool-for-google-maps/</a> to generate the code.</p>

<p>That said, it seems to me that the project you site makes the data available as KML files in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/election-results/source/browse/#hg%2Fturkey2011%2Fshapes%2Fkml" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/election-results/source/browse/#hg%2Fturkey2011%2Fshapes%2Fkml</a>.  </p>

<p>(If the problem isn't getting the data but rendering it, edit your question to show what you've tried and maybe someone can figure out where the problem is.)</p>
