<p>You are working in Bundle. "A Bundle is basically a dictionary. Each value in the Bundle is stored under a key. You must know the type of value under the key. When you know the type, you access the value associated with the key by calling a method relevant for the type of the value (again, you must know the type)"</p>

<p>For example if the key is request and its type is String you would call:</p>

<pre><code>String id= bundle.getString("id");
String message= bundle.getString("message");
</code></pre>

<p>After that, you can use split to cut the <code>:</code></p>
