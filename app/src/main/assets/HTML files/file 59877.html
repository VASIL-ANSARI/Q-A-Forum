<p>Step through the logic of your program using pen and paper.</p>

<p>For your "horizontal" loop, you go all the way up to <code>n</code> each time. Is that right? I think you meant to go only as far as <code>x</code>, as this is the value that increases with each line.</p>

<p>The other problem is that you have one too many of everything, because you used <code>&lt;=</code> rather than <code>&lt;</code>.</p>
