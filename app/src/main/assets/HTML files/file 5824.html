<p>As a general comment, debugging is much easier if you split up the nested method calls and do a quick NSLog to see what's going on. (i'm not that good at adhering to that so it's not meant as criticism). </p>

<p>One thing i first noted was the use of "%f" to display the length, try using %i (integer) and you should be able to get the correct length. %f will always display 0.00000.</p>

<p>what url are you using? given that you are pulling the data from the headers, the string "x" may or may not be present in the field. i would suggest NSLog-ing the NSString* object that you pull out of the dictionary and checking to see what's going on. E.g.:NSString *cookie = @"http://www.google.com/";</p>

<pre><code>NSHTTPCookieStorage *store = [NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage];
NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:cookie];
NSDictionary *header = [NSHTTPCookie requestHeaderFieldsWithCookies: [store cookiesForURL:url]];
NSString *cookieParameter = [header objectForKey:@"Cookie"];    

NSLog(@"Cookie param is %@", cookieParameter);

// Test range of "x"
NSRange range = [cookieParameter rangeOfString:@"x"];
NSLog(@"%f", range.length); // will print out 0.00000
NSLog(@"%i", range.length); // will print out correct length (always 1 for "x")
NSLog(@"%i", range.location); // will print out the location of the first instance of "x"
if (range.length &gt;= 1) {
    NSLog(@"Do Something");
} else {
    NSLog(@"AUTHING");
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like the code just detects the index of the string "x" from what I can tell, is this the intended result?</p>
