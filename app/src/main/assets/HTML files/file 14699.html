<p>According to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/error-reporting/#s-filtering-error-reports" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> Django does include locals. Or am I missing something? Also you may find in the documentaion (see: link above) how to write your own custom error reports.</p>
