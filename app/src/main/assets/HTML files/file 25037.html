<p>If your property has one of standard validation attributes and you enable client validation, the view engine generates markup and javascript for client validation. </p>

<p>There is some built in dataannotations that works out of the box: <code>Compare, Range, RegularExpression, Required, StringLength</code>.</p>

<p>If you want, you can create your own dataannotation attribute that will work on the client. For this, you should add to attribute method:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;modelclientvalidationrule /&gt; GetClientValidationRules
(ModelMetadata metadata, ControllerContext context)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will return validation rules. Based on this rules ViewEngine will generate markup and javascript.</p>
