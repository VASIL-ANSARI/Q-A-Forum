<p>Did you try something like:</p>

<pre><code>window.open("data:text/plain;charset=utf-8," + localStorage.WebAppData);
</code></pre>

<p>For the download, I guess you need a round trip to a server, that will set a mime/type that will make the download box to pop up.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:<br/>
If you use <code>localStorage</code>, may be <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage" rel="nofollow"><code>window.postMessage</code></a> is available in your environment and could help for speed.</p>
