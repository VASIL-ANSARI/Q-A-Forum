<p>The best way to construct an observable is to use the existing primitive and then a combination of the existing operators. This avoids a few headaches (unsubscription, error management etc.). Then <code>Rx.Observable.create</code> is certainly useful when nothing else fits your use case. I wonder if <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/operators/generatewithabsolutetime.md" rel="nofollow"><code>generateWithAbsoluteTime</code></a> would fit.</p>

<p>Anyways, here the issue you run into is that you complete your observer before you send him data. So basically you need to come up with a better completion signal. Maybe :</p>

<ul>
<li>complete x seconds after last value emitted if no new value is emitted</li>
<li>complete when a value is equal to some 'end' value</li>
</ul>
