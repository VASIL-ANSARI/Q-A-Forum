<p>IE supports .ani and .cur using Windows APIs. Webkit/Blink and Firefox have their own parsers for .cur (see <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/image-decoders/ico/ICOImageDecoder.cpp&amp;sq=package:chromium&amp;type=cs" rel="nofollow">ICOImageDecoder</a> and <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/image/decoders/nsICODecoder.cpp" rel="nofollow">nsICODecoder</a>), but they do not have parsers for the ani format (as evidenced by no results from a code search for [ANIHEADER] etc.)</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189250/animated-cursor-support-in-web-applications">Animated cursor support in web applications?</a> for animated cursor support on browsers other than IE. Basically, at this time nobody else really supports any animated cursors.</p>
