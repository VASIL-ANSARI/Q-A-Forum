<p>For animating the resizing of a view do:</p>

<pre><code>[UIView beginAnimations:@"resizeAnimation" context:nil];
youView.frame = newFrame;
[UIView commitAnimations];
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want an element to resize automatically, just set its autoresize to <code>UIViewAutoresizingNone</code>.</p>

<p>If I get your case correctly, you don't want the containter and its subviews to resize automatically, except the subview you mention. That view should have some autoresizing options enabled (I don't know exactly the ones you want, just try some and see their effect). That subview should also have its subviews resizing disabled. </p>
