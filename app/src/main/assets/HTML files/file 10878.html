<p>That is presumably your application delegate. You need to import the header file:</p>

<pre><code>#import "iRolegameAppDelegate.h"
</code></pre>

<p>At the top of the .m file this method is in. </p>

<p>If that <em>isnt</em> your app delegate, then you are copying from an example you don't understand. </p>
