<p>Python code is fairly portable as long as you don't use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/windows.html" rel="nofollow">Windows specific modules</a> or functions. And as  abarnert rightly mentions, some functions act differently on different operating systems. And not all functions are available on all platforms. But this is generally mentioned in the documentation.</p>

<p>You could <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4769968/c-cross-compiler-from-windows-to-linux">set up a cross-compiler</a> for Linux on Windows, but it is more ofter done the other way around, because Linux in general comes with more developer tools and has better infrastructure for installing software packages.</p>

<p>What you could do is set up a virtual machine (like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" rel="nofollow">virtualbox</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/" rel="nofollow">vmware</a> or <a href="http://qemu.weilnetz.de/" rel="nofollow">qemu</a>) running Linux. That will enable you to get experience with Linux and its development tools.</p>

<p>If you are using an Altera board, it seems that their tools (Board Support Package) only run on Linux.</p>
