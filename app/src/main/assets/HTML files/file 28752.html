<p>If it's not a complicated app i.e if there is no real need to have multiple activities, then i would definitely recommend using a view in your xml layout for the status information and use fragments for rendering other pieces of information around your status view.</p>

<p>If you absolutely can't do the app with one activity, then i think you will have to create a fragment for your status information and then attach it to every activity. Remember that the fragment's lifecycle is connected and controlled with that of the activity it is attached to. So, you will have to attach/add your status fragment for each activity.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
