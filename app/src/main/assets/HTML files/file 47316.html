<p>You should be doing this:</p>

<pre><code>app.service('Session', function() {
    // A service is a singleton, as in it a persistent 
    // object you can inject in controllers
    this.foo = 'bar'; // anything on "this" is publicly available

    this.createSession = function() { ... };
    // you can also expose functions that you can call from the controllers 
});

app.controller('Ctrl1', function($scope, Session) {
    // You can inject "Session" here and use stuff you 
    // added on "this" inside of it

    $scope.foo = Session.foo;
    // you can put stuff on the controller's $scope
    // and you can bind to it in your HTML by using &lt;span&gt;{{foo}}&lt;/span&gt;

    Session.foo = 'baz';
    // you can change stuff in the service and it will be persisted
});
</code></pre>

<p>So now if you navigate to a certain "Ctrl2" that injects "Session" too, <code>Session.foo</code> will be "baz", not the initial "bar" value.</p>
