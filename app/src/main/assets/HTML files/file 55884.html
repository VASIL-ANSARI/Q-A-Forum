<p>The slow part of your programm are the requests you are sending one by one.
You can do some tricks to speed them up:</p>

<pre><code>// allow more connections at a time
ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit = 30;
// don't wait the 100ms every request do
ServicePointManager.Expect100Continue = false;
</code></pre>

<p>Further you can send the request in multi-threading, so you don't have to wait for every request until it's finished. But be aware, that a lot of request can bring down a server. 200 shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>Here you have some code you could test:</p>

<pre><code>static void Main()
{
    // allow more connections at a time
    ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit = 30;
    // don't wait the 100ms every request do
    ServicePointManager.Expect100Continue = false;

    List&lt;Task&gt; tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 200; i++)
    {
        var lines = File.ReadAllLines(@"D:\file_" + i.ToString().PadLeft(5, '0') + ".txt");
        foreach (var line in lines)
        {
            tasks.Add(Task.Run(() =&gt;
                {
                    try
                    {
                        WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("ftp://myftp/dir/" + line);
                        request.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.MakeDirectory;
                        request.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("user", "pass");
                        request.GetResponse();
                    }
                    catch (Exception ex)
                    { }
                }
            ));
        }
    }

    Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());
}
</code></pre>
