<p>You are going to need something like this. </p>

<pre><code>Object biggestObject = array[0];
    for (Object obj: array){
        if (biggestObject.compareTo(obj) == 1){
            biggestObject = obj;
        }
    }
 return biggestObject;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using a custom object you are going to need to override the compareTo method so like if the object is a person and we are comparing  Pen... feet size, then we would want to set up compareTo to compare feet sizes, returning 1 when the object being compared to is bigger, 0 if its the same, and -1 if its smaller.  </p>

<pre><code>@Override
public int compareTo(Object obj){
    if (this.feetSize &lt; obj.getFeetSize()){
        return 1;
    etc, etc....
</code></pre>
