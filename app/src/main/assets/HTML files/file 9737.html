<p>IE6 and IE7 do support <code>inline-block</code>, but they have a major bug with it: They only support it on elements which have a default display style of <code>inline</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore <code>span {display:inline-block;}</code> will work, but <code>div {display:inline-block;}</code> doesn't.</p>

<p>If this is an issue for you, there's good news: they have another bug, which makes <code>inline</code> work the way <code>inline-block</code> is supposed to in some cases, so you may be able to simply use <code>display:inline;</code>.</p>

<p>If you are going to do this, you need to be careful to make sure that only IE6 and IE7 do this, as other browsers will need a proper <code>inline-block;</code> style. Some browser-specific hacks or conditional comments may be required to achieve this.</p>
