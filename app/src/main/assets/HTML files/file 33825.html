<p>If I understood it right, you are trying to print a PDF file using the default PDF reader installed in the client machine.</p>

<p>As you said, this code is trying to actually run a .pdf file. You could use a C# PDF library, but I dont know how it'll send the raw PDF data to the printer, so I would try using a PDF command line tool, put it in the bin/Release folder of the project (and also bin/Debug, for testing purposes) and then call it using a command line. </p>

<p>If you want it to be totally transparent and PDF-Reader independent, maybe you should try it. In the command line, you explicitly tell what executable you want to run, so it wont make Adobe Acrobat Reader pop up in the screen, and the user won't freak out =D</p>

<p>Here is an example of PDF printer: 
<a href="http://pdfbox.apache.org/commandline/#printPDF" rel="nofollow">http://pdfbox.apache.org/commandline/#printPDF</a></p>

<p>The command line is: <code>java -jar pdfbox-app-x.y.z.jar PrintPDF [OPTIONS] &lt;inputfile&gt;</code></p>

<p>It needs Java to run, if this is not a problem, you can try it. You could also search for a native or .NET managed solution, I think you got the idea.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
