<p>Going from the question you linked to, that defined TaskDelegate as :</p>

<pre><code>public interface TaskDelegate {
    public void taskCompletionResult(String result);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can pass GetData any instance of a class that implements TaskDelegate - but typically, that would be the object that creates it - ie. your main activity (and so, therefore, it would also implement "void taskCompletionResult(String result);").  That then means you can pass "this" to GetData's constructor, so :</p>

<pre><code>public class MyMainActivity implements TaskDelegate {

    public void someMethod() {
        GetData getData = new GetData(this);
    }

    public void taskCompletionResult(String result) {
        // do stuff
    }
 }
</code></pre>
