<p>As explained <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2836/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The underlying architecture in BCM2836 is identical to BCM2835. The only significant difference is the removal of the ARM1176JZF-S processor and replacement with a quad-core Cortex-A7 cluster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The available documentation for the BCM2836 does not detail the peripheral hardare, only the A7.  Instead you need the documentation for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2835/README.md" rel="nofollow">BCM2835</a>.  The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2835/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf" rel="nofollow">peripheral specification</a> section 6 deals with the GPIO.  The registers are memory mapped so you can write directly to them in C.</p>
