<p>Stored Procedures can do far more than just query the database. They can contain any T-SQL statement. So you could use them to perform business logic, execute queries, do backups etc.</p>

<p>Many companies have a policy that all database activity is to be done via stored procedures. So, in now way would I say that a web development team would have no use for them. They might make great use of them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in our company, we're not using them much of all for our next generation manufacturing applications. We're using an ORM (Linq-To-SQL) instead, and have very little use for stored procedures, at this point. I suspect though we'll still use them somewhat, in order to avoid several trips back and forth to the server. Somethings are just more efficient if done in a stored procedure, if you're already doing work on the server anyway.</p>
