<p>I don't think there's something at the API level that will get you that.  Not easily, anyways.  Memory's not really reserved against threads.  Memory is reserved against objects, and objects are not thread-specific.</p>

<p>There is a nifty tool out there that can do all this by parsing memory dumps, but I'm not sure if it works against a live JVM.</p>

<p>What you would need to do is find the objects associated with the threead (not sure how to do that) and then navigate its references to calculate the retained heap (as the memory being used is more than just the the object itself, but also the objects whose references being held also take up memory.  This is not a trivial task.  And you're not going to get it from a simple API call.  Plus, it's not really thread-specific, as another thread could have references to the same objects (as objects can be used by multiple threads.</p>

<p>Part of this is difficult because threads/objects are meant to be ignorant about the memory pools.  That's something for the JVM to manage.</p>

<p>So, um, dunno.</p>
