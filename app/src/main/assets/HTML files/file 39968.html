<p>First, fetching from Core Data to fill an array is not a good idea. You should explore the <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> API and use that instead. </p>

<p>Second, once you have retrieved the object for your table view cell you can do the check simply in the same way you would check the existence of any other object in Objective-C.</p>

<pre><code>if (objectDate.subject) {
  // dequeue cell for displaying subject
}
else {
  // dequeue cell for displaying only the date 
}
</code></pre>
