<p>Looks like it may be a bug with certain versions of the mysql driver. Search <a href="http://kickjava.com/src/com/mysql/jdbc/Statement.java.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> source code for the error message. They aren't checking for the getGeneratedIds condition.</p>

<p>MySQL has a similar 'won't fix' <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=13668" rel="nofollow">bug</a> open since 2005. The discussion mentions that it's not a requirement of the JDBC API that their driver support the feature. Seems likely this is a known and unaddressed issue.</p>
