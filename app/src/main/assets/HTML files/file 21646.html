<p>As fas i I can see there is not difference between 3.0 and 4.0, the following action will cause the app to restart:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Application Restarts</p>
  
  <p>Modifying the source code of your Web application will cause ASP.NET
  to recompile source files into assemblies. When you modify the
  top-level items in your application, all other assemblies in the
  application that reference the top-level assemblies are recompiled as
  well.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, modifying, adding, or deleting certain types of files
  within the application's known folders will cause the application to
  restart. The following actions will cause an application restart: â¢<br>
  Adding, modifying, or deleting assemblies from the application's Bin
  folder.</p>
  
  <p>â¢    Adding, modifying, or deleting localization resources from the
  App_GlobalResources or App_LocalResources folders.</p>
  
  <p>â¢    Adding, modifying, or deleting the application's Global.asax
  file.</p>
  
  <p>â¢    Adding, modifying, or deleting source code files in the App_Code
  directory.</p>
  
  <p>â¢    Adding, modifying, or deleting Profile configuration.</p>
  
  <p>â¢    Adding, modifying, or deleting Web service references in the
  App_WebReferences directory.</p>
  
  <p>â¢    Adding, modifying, or deleting the application's Web.config file.</p>

<p>So I guess it depends on <code>which</code> folder you delete in the appliction directory.</p>
