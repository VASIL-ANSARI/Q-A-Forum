<p>No fields are required until you Save the entity by committing it.  You can create an entirely empty entity even if there are fields marked required on the server.  Simple use manager.createEntity('Entity'); and then show your editor view to input the first and last name and then call save.  No different than in ASP.Net MVC showing a view and testing ModelState before saving.</p>

<p>Your statement about validation holds true whether you are creating or editing the entity for all intents and purposes, if there is something special you are doing show a snippet and I can try to help further.</p>
