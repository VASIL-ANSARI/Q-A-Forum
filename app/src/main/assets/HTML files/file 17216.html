<p>If you have ACS up and running and it all works, then I wouldn't change it unless you have a specific reason.  ACS implements the same features that WebSecurity does with OAuth and using OAuth providers...  You're probably better off with ACS, as it's a well debugged system and you don't have to maintain it.</p>
