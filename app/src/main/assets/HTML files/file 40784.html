<p>Your code is correct. jQuery is not adding attributes to the element it is adding an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener" rel="nofollow">Event Listener</a> to the  DOM. In other words it will not show up in the markup even when it is working. Try adding a <code>console.log</code> statement to the listener and trying it out - it should work. </p>

<p>On a side note there are a few best practices that might help keep your code cleaner and more maintainable.</p>

<ol>
<li>When working with jQuery elements in JavaScript people usually use a <code>$</code> to prefix variable names. In your example this would be <code>$row</code>.</li>
<li>Since you are composing nested elements it is often much cleaner to create a variable to each of the major ones and bring them together at the end. This reduces the surface area effected when you have to do refactors. In your example I might pull the <code>$input</code> element into it's own variable.</li>
<li>Inline styles and particularly styles written in JavaScript are considered bad practice. If possible you should try and add a class then style the class in your stylesheet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
