<p>Apart from the appearance - which uses some non-standard, dark scheme not available with standard Cocoa controls - it appears to be all <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/Controls/Controls.html" rel="nofollow">standard OS X controls</a> which you can simply configure yourself.</p>

<p>As for the dark appearance..<br>
Apple has started to add something like styled controls with the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSAppearance_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow"><code>NSAppearance</code> class</a> introduced in Mavericks, however from the current documentation it doesn't do much yet (10.9).</p>

<p>There are however quite a few third-party controls that mimic the controls found in Apple's Pro or iLife Apps. Examples are <a href="https://www.cocoacontrols.com/controls/grprokit" rel="nofollow">GPProKit</a> or <a href="https://www.cocoacontrols.com/controls/snrhudkit" rel="nofollow">SNRHUDKit</a> (amongst many others).</p>
