<p>Several items come to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never override paint(), do paintComponent() instead</li>
<li>Why are you drawing on a JFrame directly?  Why not extends JComponent (or JPanel) and draw on that instead?  it provides more flexibility</li>
<li>What's the purpose of that JLabel? If it sits on top of the JFrame and covers the entire thing then your painting will be hidden behind the label.</li>
<li>The painting code shouldn't rely on the x,y values passed in paint() to determine the drawing routine's start point.  paint() is used to paint a section of the component. Draw the oval on the canvas where you want it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, you're not seeing the JLabel because the paint() method is responsible for drawing the component itself as well as child components.  Overriding paint() is evil =)</p>
