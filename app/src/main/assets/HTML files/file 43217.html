<p>According <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom#Validation" rel="nofollow">this wiki page</a> the post code always ends in 'digit letter letter', that would be a regex pattern of <code>\d\w\w$</code>. Now we know how to spot what the end is, we just want to capture the rest.</p>

<p>A pattern like <code>(\S*)\s*\d\w\w$</code> will work. That will capture the first half, and ensure that you do not get the last 'digit letter letter part. It will capture the first part by getting anything not white space, ie only letters and digits.</p>

<p>To fully explain this, the brackets <code>()</code> is what we are capturing. <code>\S</code> says 'any one non white space character, with <code>\S*</code>being all that we can get. so <code>(\S*)</code> captures everything up to a space character, but will capture everything if the user doesn't enter one. The full regex I provided will also try to capture 'any white space, one digit, two letters, end of string' which will ensure that <code>AA999AA</code> is split into <code>AA99</code> and <code>9AA</code>.</p>

<p>I've also just noticed though that your question states you might not actually have that second part. I think you could get around that by checking the string length. If you trim white space and the length is less than 5 characters, you must only have the first part, so no need for any regex.</p>

<p><sub><strong>disclaimer</strong> this will not work for Anguillan postcodes. To support their postcodes as well, I think (\S*)\s*(?:\d\w\w|-\d{4})$ would work.</sub></p>
