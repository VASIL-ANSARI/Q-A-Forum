<p>I think you are trying to merge an <strong>Array Bind</strong> {simply binding an array to a param to have it execute multi times -- this is how the example in the link you provided did it} with an <strong>Associative Array</strong> {re: PLSQLAssociativeArray with an INPUT param of TABLE OF}.</p>

<p>Since you didn't post your package/proc that you are running, I am assuming you are doing something like this (just putting this down to validate the assumption)</p>

<pre><code>procedure insertdata(P_JOB_TITLE IN VARCHAR2) as
begin
insert into myTable(x) value (P_JOB_TITLE);
end  insertdata;
</code></pre>

<p>To execute this like the author of the article you need to use <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/html/B14164_01/featOraCommand.htm#i1007888">ArrayBindCount (check out this link, it also has an example)</a>.
This also indicates, if you have multiple parameters, it will expect an ARRAY for each one.</p>

<p>Now to have this executed for all the P_JOB_TITLE() that you pass in</p>

<pre><code>//this was missing in your example and MUST be there to tell ODP how many array elements to expect
cmd.ArrayBindCount = 2;

 string[] jobTitleArray = {"name1", "name1"};

OracleParameter paramNames= new OracleParameter("P_JOB_TITLE", OracleDbType.Varchar2);

   //paramNames.CollectionType = OracleCollectionType.PLSQLAssociativeArray;/*once again, you are passing in an array of values to be executed and not a pl-sql table*/

    //paramNames.Size = 2; /* this is unnecessary since it is for a plsql-associative array*/
    paramNames.Value =  jobTitleArray ;
    cmd.Parameters.Add(paramNames);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>For a plSQLAssociativeArray example have a look at the samples provided when you installed ODP @ %ORA_HOME%\odp.net\samples\2.x\AssocArray</p>

<p>and for array bind examples (as from the link you provided)
 @ %ORA_HOME%\odp.net\samples\2.x\ArrayBind</p>
