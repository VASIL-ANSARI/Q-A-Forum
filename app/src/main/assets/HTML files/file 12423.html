<p>I've recently began delving into django-celery which is an asynchronous task queue for django. It allows you to queue up tasks to run asynchronously so that you don't have to wait for responses. It's simple to install and get started and it would allow your application to utilize asynchronous queueing instead of just your test suite.</p>
