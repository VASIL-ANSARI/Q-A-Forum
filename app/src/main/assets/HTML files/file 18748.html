<p>You can come close with the following:</p>

<pre><code>select coalesce(ta.id, tb.id, tc.id), ta.field1, tb.field2, tc.field3
from (select ta.*, row_number() over (partition by id order by (select NULL)) as seqnum
      from ta
     ) ta full outer join
     (select tb.*, row_number() over (partition by id order by (select NULL)) as seqnum
      from tb
     ) tb
     on ta.id = tb.id and
        ta.seqnum = tb.seqnum
     (select tc.*, row_number() over (partition by id order by (select NULL)) as seqnum
      from tc
     ) tc
     on coalesce(ta.id, tb.id) = tc.id and
        coalesce(ta.seqnum, tb.seqnum) = tc.seqnum
group by coalesce(ta.id, tb.id, tc.id),
         coalesce(ta.seqnum, tb.seqnum, tc.seqnum)
order by 1, 2
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, though, in my comment, the ordering of rows in a table is not guaranteed, so these may not come out in the order you expect.  With your sample data, you could use:</p>

<pre><code>over (partition by id order by field&lt;n&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>If the fields define the ordering</p>
