<p>Java on OSX is developed  by Apple it self, so the main site will be the Apple Developer Connection </p>

<p>Start here: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/java/</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I've been looking for those at that site and what I found was the link for you to reporte your own bug. A ADC account is needed ( which I don't really feel like creating now ) and from there you can access to the bug reported. Chances are that the existing bugs are listed there already.</p>

<p>Here's the link, I hope you find it useful:</p>
