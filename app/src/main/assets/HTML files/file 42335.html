<p>When I took a closer look there was an inner exception which complained an nlog 2.0.0 dll was not found. Found a solution as follows</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete all packages related to nlog and commons logging restart application. If the packages don't get deleted by nuget edit .csproj file and .packages file manually to remove all references to Commons logging or nlog packages.</li>
<li>Then searched for latest nlog package as by entering <code>Common.Logging.Nlog</code> in search text box. Then pick the latest nlog package and it will install all other needed packages for using using nlog through commons logging as a dependency. As shown below:

<li><p>In your <code>web.config</code> update your factory adapter element In my case i selected 31 so updated it to </p>

<p><code>&lt;factoryAdapter type="Common.Logging.NLog.NLogLoggerFactoryAdapter, Common.Logging.NLog31"&gt;
                        &lt;arg key="configType" value="INLINE" /&gt;
                      &lt;/factoryAdapter&gt;</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>P.S. If you are getting error <code>The configuration section cannot contain a CDATA or text element.</code> Then the problem has to be a type in your config file.</p>
