<p>i can suggest you to follow these steps and find an approach to your case !! </p>

<p>first in your function</p>

<pre><code>    function parseURL(){
  var info = "some value",  // This is retrieved from the browser URL which is my.JSP

  $.ajax({
     method: post,
     url: anotherPage.jsp   // This is the same URL (browser URL) from which I am getting information, so I just send back to it
      data: { information: info} )}
      .done({
              $("div or section where you want to inject the result").html(data);
         })
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in the anotherPage.jsp try to have something like this :</p>

<p>//jsp header and stuff and the data you want to get back such as scriplet or expression just the data that would be injected by the function ahead
if you could post the my.jsp and the anotherPage.jsp that could be helpful</p>
