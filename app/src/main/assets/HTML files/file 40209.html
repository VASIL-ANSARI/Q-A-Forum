<p>I believe problem relies in the last sentence:</p>

<pre><code> dv.RowFilter = "name='" + ss;  
</code></pre>

<p>You forgot about closing the quotation. It should be </p>

<pre><code> dv.RowFilter = "name='" + ss+"'";
</code></pre>

<p>However - about the sample from attached link - please, please, please never ever query database using string concatenation. It's probably most common security flaw.</p>

<p>Read about using query parameters here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.parameters%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.parameters%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>Edit: About the row duplication, I have suspitions about old data in dataset. Have you tried to recreate dataset or just clear it before load?</p>

<p>And proper query for ensure no data duplication would be</p>

<pre><code>select distinct name from phone
</code></pre>
