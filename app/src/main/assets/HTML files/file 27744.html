<p><code>myLibrary.resolve</code> is undefined, but the general code you need (untested) is:</p>

<pre><code>import ctypes
dll = ctypes.CDLL('your.dll')
Open = dll.Open
Open.argtypes = [ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p),ctypes.c_char_p]
Open.restype = ctypes.c_uint16
Handle = ctypes.c_void_p()
result = Open(ctypes.byref(Handle),'c:\\Config.xml')
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you have a DLL named <code>your.dll</code> with a function <code>Open</code> you want to call.</p>
