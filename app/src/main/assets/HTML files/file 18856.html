<p>To be honest, I can't really tell if authorization/authentication should be a model's or a controller's job and people will give you various answers on this. It's like a grey area.</p>

<p>So I prefer to go with the Rails conventions there, as they have been proven trustworthy for all these years. Your controllers seem fine to me, I wouldn't call them fat. You could ofcourse move these private methods into a helper.</p>
