<p>Compare like this:</p>

<pre><code>time.toTime_t() == datetime.toTime_t()
</code></pre>

<p>The method returns seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>Note 1: Why did you use <code>&lt;</code> if you want to test for equality?</p>

<p>Note 2: You should not store time values in a double - it may cause loss of precision. uint32_t is good for seconds, and uint64_t is required ofr milliseconds.</p>
