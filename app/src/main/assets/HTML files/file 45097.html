<p>Base on the info you provided, yes you can, but for memory segment, its per process not controls inside the process, for 32-bit applications, max is 2GB, can be extended to 3GB but not recommended.</p>

<p>if you want independent memory then you must create multiple executables where each exe has its own address space. </p>

<p>so what you can do is create a C# application that has usercontrol or form and add your logic, this will be compiled into a separate exe, then create another C# application to start a process(es) for the first C# application.</p>
