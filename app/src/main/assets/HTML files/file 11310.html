<p><code>#define backgroundColor [UIColor whiteColor]</code> then to use it you would say <code>UIColor *txtColor = backgroundColor;</code>.</p>

<p>Although you may only be able to use <code>whiteColor</code> as the definition instead of <code>[UIColor whiteColor]</code>. You would then call <code>[UIColor backgroundColor];</code> instead of the above example.</p>

<p>I would not do this to generate stylings. Defining various settings outside of code would be a good idea but using defines is pretty binding and defeats the purpose of de-coupling the UI from code.</p>

<hr>

<p>In a <code>#define</code> do not put a semicolon anywhere. When the preprocessor inserts the definition it will insert whatever semicolon is there exactly as it is; <strong>you do not want the preprocessor inserting semicolons.</strong> When writing the definition you probably don't know all the places you'll write it, therefore you shouldn't have a semicolon in it because you may write it inline an expression.</p>

<p>Another option is to use <code>const</code> instead.</p>

<p>In code I've written I have <code>#define</code>s for string literals <code>@"literal string"</code> and numbers. In other places I use the <code>const</code> declaration which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//static type *const variableName = assignment;

static NSString *const kConstantString = @"Constant variable";
</code></pre>

<p>Constants don't use the preprocessor to fill in the information. If you access a define frequently and it uses some computation it might may be better suited to a constant declaration which is stored only once. </p>

<p>The other big reason I used <code>const</code> instead of <code>#define</code> is that define is not type-checked as it's handled by the preprocessor. Define basically turns off the compiler warnings and only gives you errors; strict warnings are extremely helpful and can save a lot of frustration.</p>
