<p>Since .NET 4 Beta 2, the policy portion of code access security (CAS) has been made obsolete. See <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/01/CAS-.NET-4.0" rel="nofollow">Code Access Security Is No Longer Used in .NET 4 Beta 2</a>. It's still an interesting feature of .NET to manage or enforce internal access rights, but any feature that relies on IT admins to sep policies would create confusion.</p>
