<p>My opinion is android has better API in common:  </p>

<ul>
<li>networking is simple and auto configured, but may be extended as well, use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">javax.net.ssl</a> or <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">android.net</a>  </li>
<li>PIM is accessed by <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html" rel="nofollow">ContentProviders</a>, which may take a little time to port    </li>
<li>IO operations are simple, use <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#files" rel="nofollow">files</a> or <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db" rel="nofollow">sqlite</a>   </li>
<li>PIM listeners - can't tell anything need to be investigated, see <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/android-developers@googlegroups.com/msg55857.html" rel="nofollow">Contact Listener</a></li>
<li>UI design - completely different approach, ui (usual) is declarative, saved in xml, so this will require redesign and resources prepare.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Be prepared to redesign application totally, even business part may be improved with typed lists, extended math functions and db functionality.  </p>

<p>But still, it depends on you're skills, so <strong>if you good in android I'd say it's x/3, otherwise x/2</strong>.  </p>
