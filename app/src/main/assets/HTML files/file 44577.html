<p>Supposing you use the two projects to create just one app (let's say one of them is a library project used in your app), you can get the <code>AppDelegate</code> from the main project in your library project using</p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]
</code></pre>

<p>If they are different projects for different apps, you can't get the <code>AppDelegate</code> from other app</p>
