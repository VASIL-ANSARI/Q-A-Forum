<p>You don't have a base url defined. You need something like -</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = patterns('',

    # ...
    url(r'^$', HomeView.as_view())

)
</code></pre>

<p>You should be able to see your site at - localhost:8000/admin/ (assuming you're running your dev server with <code>python manage.py runserver</code>). </p>

<p>Django checks all the URL's you've defined in your url conf file and looks for one that matches the url you've entered in the browser. If it finds a URL that matches then it serves up the http response returned by the url's corresponding view (<code>HomeView</code> in the code above). The urls.py file is matching url's to views. Views return the http response.</p>

<p>Looking at the error message you've got (and the code you've included from the <code>url.py</code> file), you can see that there's only one url defined in your app - <code>admin/</code>. Trying to get a page at any other url will fail.</p>
