<p>Since you're able to break in the debugger in <code>viewDidLoad</code>, what's the value of the <code>tweetService</code> ivar? If it's <code>nil</code>, the <code>getAllTweets</code> message will just be a no op. Maybe the ivar isn't being set properly or overridden somewhere else. </p>

<p>You should probably use the property to access the <code>tweetService</code> (call <code>self.tweetService</code>) rather than its underlying ivar. You should only ever access the ivar directly in getters, setters, and <code>init</code> (also <code>dealloc</code> if aren't using ARC for some crazy reason).</p>

<p>You also should not call <code>loadView</code> yourself, rather just access the <code>view</code> property of the view controller. That will kick off the loading process and call <code>viewDidLoad</code>.</p>

<p>Also, if you're doing a lot of mocking, I highly recommend <a href="http://ocmock.org/" rel="nofollow">OCMock</a>.</p>
