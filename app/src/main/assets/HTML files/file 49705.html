<p>If I were implementing this I would create a custom HTML tag containing a function that binds to the onchange event fo your select element.  The function would fire a custom event into the dataLayer which also contains pertinent information.  You would then create a UA event tracking tag that uses the correct information and is fired by a custom trigger that is fired by the custom event name.</p>

<p>So, as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create Custom HTML tag with some similar functionality to this, fire it on DOM ready of all pages you want to bind to a select element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  $('#myselect').on('change', function(){
    dataLayer.push({
      'event':'select_change',
      'select_val':this.value
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Create a trigger of type <code>custom event</code> where event value = <code>select_change</code></p></li>
<li>Create a Universal Analytics tag which is an event tag and fill in the the required details (category, action, label, value).  If this was me I'd use something like 

<ul>
<li>category = user interaction</li>
<li>action = select change</li>
<li>label = {{select_val}}</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>This tag shoudl be fired by the trigger you created in 2.</p>
