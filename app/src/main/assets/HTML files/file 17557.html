<p>A ListView is a collection of layouts that are automatically displayed one below the other. The developer adds new items through a piece of code in the Activity. An example is the address book where you have lots of contacts one after the other.</p>

<p>A TableView on the other hand is defined in the layout file and does not only need to contain elements below or above each other but can also arrange elements on the left or on the right. A TableView is exactly what it says: A table with rows and columns.</p>
