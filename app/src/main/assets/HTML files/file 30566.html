<p>You can't define the whitespace that <code>var_dump()</code> or <code>var_export()</code> puts into the text. </p>

<p>A better option would be to write a function that prints out the details of the array in the format you would like. Or, you can change the way you are parsing the text after it is printed to parse what <code>var_dump()</code> or <code>var_export()</code> gives you. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>My bad, I thought of another way that you could do it. It would require using <code>str_replace()</code>. <code>var_dump()</code> spits out the variable using <code>\n</code> and <code>" "</code> for formatting, so you could do something along the lines of: </p>

<p><code>echo str_replace(" ","&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp", $this-&gt;getArray())</code></p>

<p>You would have to determine what you want the <code>" "</code> to be replaced with to get your desired formatting, and of course this would be designed to work on an HTML page. It's not the easiest thing to do (or the prettiest) but it as least something that you could try out if you don't want to write out your own function to print the array to your liking. </p>
