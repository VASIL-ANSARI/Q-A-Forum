<p>You should just be able to do <code>this.get('leads').add(lead)</code> in your loop; <code>this.get('leads)</code> in this case will return (a reference to) the <code>leads</code> collection which has the <code>add()</code> method. You can't do <code>this.leads.add</code> because <code>this.leads</code> doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Backbone's <code>this.attributes</code> is a convenient way of getting all the attributes of a model, however <code>this.set()</code> and <code>this.get()</code> are preferred as interfaces as events are fired when these are called.</p>
