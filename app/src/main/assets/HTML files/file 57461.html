<p>I would put this application logic into your application, not into the database (query).</p>

<p>That said, you can solve this with a sub-query:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE yourTable
SET yourValue = (
    SELECT LEAST(yourValue + $change, yourMax)
    FROM yourTable
    WHERE yourId = $yourId
)
WHERE yourId = $yourId
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It appears that MySQL does not allow you to reference the table you are updating also in a sub-query.</p>

<p>A solution to this problem is shown in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14302701/3836229">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
