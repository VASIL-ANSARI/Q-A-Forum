<p>Your format string has two placeholders, but you're only passing one string. That's not how string interpolation works, you'll have to pass everything at once:</p>

<p>Do: </p>

<pre><code>print str_to_print % (
    (','.join(str(j) for j in ROI_X_vect)),
    (','.join(str(j) for j in ROI_Y_vect)) 
)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this won't give exactly what you want. Your format string should have the <code>[</code>and <code>]</code>.</p>
