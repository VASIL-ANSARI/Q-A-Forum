  <p>i have to compare whether the arraylist contains the string. i did
  "ArrayList.toString()" to convert it to string since i cant compare an
  arraylist with a string.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>contains</code> method on <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for example, lets say if String 1= "ground" and in String 2 the word
  "playground" exists, then it would make the .contains true because the
  word "ground" is INSIDE the word "playGROUND". Is there anyway to
  avoid this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes use <code>contains</code> method of arrayList it will not return true for <code>ground</code> if it has <code>playGround</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ive tried .equals and .equalsIgnorecase and no luck :/</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to loop over the arrayList and than use <code>equalsIgnorecase</code> on each <code>String</code> to find the match.</p>
