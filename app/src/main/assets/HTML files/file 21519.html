<p>There is no simple way to do this.</p>

<p>If those were fields, you could get their names using reflection.  However, local variable and parameter names are not loaded into the JVM.  So you would need to resort to reading the "A.class" file and extracting the debug information for that method.  And the bad news is that if the class wasn't compiled with debug information, then even that wouldn't work.</p>

<p>There are libraries around for reading ".class" files for various purposes, but I can't give a specific recommendation.</p>

<hr>

<p>But the $64,000 question is "But why ...?".  What is the point of listing the local variable names for a method from Java?  Can't you just look at the source code?  Can't you dump the ".class" file with "javap" or decompile it with some 3rd party decompiler? </p>
