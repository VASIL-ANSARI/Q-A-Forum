<p>In the second example, there are two forms with <code>id="login"</code>. One is at the top of the page, and one in the middle of the page. The submit is done by a <code>$(#login"").submit();</code> call on the button, which will select the first form with <code>id="login"</code>. Since ids are supposed to be unique, try using different ids for each form. Or use something like <code>$(this).closest('form').submit();</code>    </p>
