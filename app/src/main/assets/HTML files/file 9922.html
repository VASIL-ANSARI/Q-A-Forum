<p>If that is an image sprite they should share the same background-image right?</p>

<p>Then you only need to assign the same background image as the others, same width and height of the others, display:block, and just change the background position of the image.</p>

<p>Since the more links you have the more wide the image gets, probably you have to give that new link a negative background position along the x axis.</p>
