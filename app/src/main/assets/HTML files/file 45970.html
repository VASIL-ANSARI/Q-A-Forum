<p>If you add this code to your page <code>head</code>, the width of the viewport won't be the the actual number of pixels, but instead something compareable to a pixel density of 96dpi:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This results with a CSS width of 320 pixels on most smartphones even though their actual resolutions are higher.</p>
