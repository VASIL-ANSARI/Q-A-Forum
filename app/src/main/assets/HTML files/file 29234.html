<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19004460/cakephp-error-unable-to-configure-the-session-setting-session-auto-start-faile/19495111#19495111">Andriy's answer says</a>, you should upgrade CakePHP or downgrade PHP. However, if you don't want to or don't have the option to, you need to reconfigure your Cake session so that it uses standard PHP sessions rather than Cake's session.</p>

<p><strong>app/Config/core.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>Configure::write('Session', array(
    'defaults' =&gt; 'cake', // You need to change the value of this to 'php'
    'timeout' =&gt; 120,
    'cookieTimeout' =&gt; 20160,
    'checkAgent' =&gt; false 
));
</code></pre>
