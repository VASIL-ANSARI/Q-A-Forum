<p>Have you run <code>cap deploy:setup</code> and <code>cap deploy:check</code>? These should highlight a lot of common issues.</p>

<p>The error causing failure above however looks like a permissions issue.</p>

<pre><code>cp: cannot create directory `/home/deployer/apps/dropwall_rails/releases/20120513204913': No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that the folder exists and that the deployment user has the correct permissions to manipulate it.</p>
