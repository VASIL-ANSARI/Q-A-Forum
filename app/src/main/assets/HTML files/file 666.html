<p>I don't have the book reference anymore, and I'll have to find it just to confirm, but I thought the default base hash just hashed together all of the members of your object.  It got access to them because of the way the CLR worked, so it wasn't something that you could write as well as they had.</p>

<p>That is completely from memory of something I briefly read so take it for what you will.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The book was <strong>Inside C#</strong> from MS Press. The one with the Saw blade on the cover.  The author spent a good deal of time explaining how things were implemented in the CLR, how the language translated down to MSIL, ect. ect.  If you can find the book it's not a bad read.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Form the link provided it looks like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Object.GetHashCode() uses an
  internal field in the System.Object class to generate the hash value. Each
  object created is assigned a unique object key, stored as an integer,when it
  is created. These keys start at 1 and increment every time a new object of
  any type gets created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm I guess I need to write a few of my own hash codes, if I expect to use objects as hash keys.</p>
