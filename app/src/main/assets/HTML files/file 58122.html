<p>Casting a pointer just changes how it is interpreted; no change to its value or the data it points to occurs.  <em>Using</em> it may change the data it points to, just as using the original may change the data it points to; <em>how</em> it changes that data may differ (which is likely the point of doing the casting in the first place).</p>
