<p>When you add a <code>yield</code> statement, the compiler actually generates a private class that acts as a state machine that implements <code>IEnumerable</code>. As such none of the code wrapped up from the original method will be called unless you enumerate the result of the method - in your example, you're throwing away the return value, so nothing would happen.</p>
