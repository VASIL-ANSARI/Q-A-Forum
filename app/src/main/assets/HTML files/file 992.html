<p>Yes, in most cases. MRI (1.8) have supported them as far as my memory reaches, Ruby 1.9 (YARV) <a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=rev&amp;revision=12380">does it, too</a>, so does Rubinius. JRuby and IronRuby don't have continuations, and it's quite unlikely they will get them (JVM and CLR use stack-instrospection for security)</p>

<p>Ruby as a language supports continuations via <code>callcc</code> keyword. They're used, for example, to implement <code>Generator</code> class from standard library. </p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_c_continuation.html">continuations on ruby-doc</a></b></p>

<p>Continuation-based web frameworks (like seaside, or one from Arc's std. library) seem less popular. I've found <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/wee/">wee</a> that claim to let you do optional continuations, but I've never used it.</p>
