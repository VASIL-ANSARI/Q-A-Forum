<p>You can always create a <code>File</code> object from a <code>String</code> using the <code>File(String)</code> constructor. Note that the File object represents only an abstract path name; not a file on disk.</p>

<p>If you are trying to create an actual file on disk that contains the text held by the string there are several classes that you can use, for example:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    Writer f = new FileWriter(nameOfFile);
    f.write(stringToWrite);
    f.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // unable to write file, maybe the disk is full?
    // you should log the exception but printStackTrace is better than nothing
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>FileWriter</code> will use the platform default encoding when converting the characters of the string to bytes that can be written on disk. If this is a problem you can use a different encoding by wrapping <code>FileOutputStream</code> inside an <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>String encoding = "UTF-8";
Writer f = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(nameOfFile), encoding);
</code></pre>
