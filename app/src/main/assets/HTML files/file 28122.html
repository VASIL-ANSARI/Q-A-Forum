<p>So after a bit of investigation, it seems like Dropbox has not released the SDK to support the 64 bit architecture.</p>

<p>Other frameworks are having this warning as well, check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18934043/unable-to-link-googleanalytics-3-01-with-xcode-5-missing-required-architecture">this</a> for more information on the GA framework.</p>

<p>Nothing can be done to resolve this but to wait for an official release.</p>
