<p>AppEngine release 1.7.0 has support for deleting Google Storage objects using bigstore API.</p>

<pre><code>key = blobstore.create_gs_key('/gs/my_bucket/my_object')
blobstore.delete(key)
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the rest API to make a call out to Google Storage to delete the file.</p>
