<p>The idea here is to limit the parameters you will accept for a given model.  Then you can test each of them either with a validation or some other code to be sure they fit expected values.</p>

<p>Attr_accessible is intended to limit the "surface" of your model to what you intend to accept and check carefully. In this way you can automatically ignore an injected parameter like :roles => "admin" in case you add that feature to your model</p>

<pre><code>user.update_attributes(params[:user])
</code></pre>

<p>Since the roles attribute is not listed in attr_accessible, the user's attempt to become an administrator is fruitless.</p>

<p>You want to handle the validation logic in one place (your model), instead of checking each parameter value in your controller.  </p>
