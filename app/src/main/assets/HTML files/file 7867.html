<p>You can do an update article first to use the lowest author id having the same name</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE art SET art.author_id =
    (SELECT MIN(a1.id) FROM author a1 WHERE a1.Name = a2.name
        FROM article art INNER JOIN author a2 ON art.author_id = a2.id)
</code></pre>

<p>Then delete the higher author having the same name</p>

<p>PS. I have not tested the SQL but should work.</p>
