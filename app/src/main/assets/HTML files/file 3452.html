<p>See UPDATE section above, if you follow the example provided in the link above and remove the specific lines commented out above, that seems to fix the problem if all you're looking for is to fake the UrlReferrer, which is what I was after.  Not sure how that would affect the rest of the fake httpContext, as I'm not sure exactly what the purpose of those lines was.</p>
