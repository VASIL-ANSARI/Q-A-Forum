<p>You can't really read "just the header" unless you know it's size.</p>

<p>Instead, determine the minimum amount of bytes you need to be able to distinguish between the formats you need to support, and read only those bytes. Most likely all of the formats you need will have a unique header.</p>

<p>For example, if you need to support png &amp; jpeg, those formats start with:</p>

<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>  PNG: 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A
 JPEG: FF D8 FF E0
</code></pre>

<p>So in that case you'd only have to read a single byte to differ between the two. In reality I'd say use a few more bytes, just in case you encounter other file formats.</p>

<p>To read, say 8 bytes, from the beginning of a file:</p>

<pre><code>using( var sr = new FileStream( "file", FileMode.Open ) )
{
    var data = new byte[8];
    int numRead = sr.Read( data, 0, data.Length );
    // numRead gives you the number of bytes read
}
</code></pre>
