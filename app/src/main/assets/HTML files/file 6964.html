<p>You can use explode to transform a comma separated list to an array. You can explode on spaces too, but explode isn't smart enough to know that the space in <code>social media</code> is not a separator, while the space in social bookmarking is. </p>

<p>I think you'd best train your users to use comma's. You can also provide a multiline edit (textarea) to enter the keywords and have them enter one on each line, optionally allowing commas too. But if you're allowing spaces as separators, you won't be able to have spaces within a tag unless you query all tags first and check against that list. But what if your user actually meant to enter the keywords "social" and "media"?  ...</p>
