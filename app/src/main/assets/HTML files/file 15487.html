<p>Is ruby.exe showing up in task manager under processes?  That's the easy way to kill it.  If it doesn't show up there do the following from the command prompt.</p>

<pre><code>netstat -a -o
</code></pre>

<p>That will list all the ports being used by the system.  under the tcp section find the port that is running.  When you find the entry it will list the process id that it is running on.  You then need to kill that PID as follows</p>

<pre><code>taskkill -F /PID 2632
</code></pre>

<p>The following is the line that I used on my windows machine.</p>

<pre><code>Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State           PID
TCP    0.0.0.0:3000           fastone:0              LISTENING       2632
</code></pre>

<p>I killed pid 2632 as I was using the default rails port.  As to why it happens?  It happens in the linux world as well where most rails apps are deployed.  The problem is the ruby process is still running when a terminal window is closed etc.  The process disappears in the background.  The port is still in use and the service is still running.  I'm not sure if there's an easy way to prevent it from happening.  welcome to the programming world</p>
