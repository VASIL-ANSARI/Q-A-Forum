<p>As I posted in the comments, my initial assumption was using the element selector will make the selector faster...</p>

<p>As as per the <a href="http://jsperf.com/jquery-attribute-selector-with-element-selector" rel="nofollow">benchmark</a> I tested in <a href="http://jsperf.com/" rel="nofollow">jspref</a>, it looks like the one without the element selector is faster... even though very negligible </p>
