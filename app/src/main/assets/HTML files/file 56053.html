<p>If you can you want to select an element that is loaded and then delegate down to the item. For example </p>

<pre><code>$("body").on("click", "div#element", function(){
    alert("this is working!");
});
</code></pre>

<p>The body is always loaded so we can target that, then search for a div with an id of element. This will fire when the div with id of element is clicked no matter when it is loaded.</p>
