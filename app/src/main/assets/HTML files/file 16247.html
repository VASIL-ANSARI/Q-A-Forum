<p>I would just host the files on a web server and then download it on a background thread and write the files to isolated storage. That is going to be easier than FTP as I don't know if there are any free FTP libraries for Windows Phone right now.</p>

<p>Here is an <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2010/08/16/download-and-store-media-for-playback-in-windows-phone-7-using-mediastreamsource.aspx" rel="nofollow">example of downloading files and saving them to isolated storage</a>. It does a bit more than you might need but it should be a good jumping off point. Also don't use the performance progress bar mentioned in that article but rather the <a href="http://debugmode.net/2011/09/30/system-tray-progressindicator-in-windows-phone-7-5-or-mango-phone/" rel="nofollow">Progress Indicator</a>.</p>

<p>If the files are highly compressible I would also consider zipping them and then unzipping them on the phone using something like <a href="http://slsharpziplib.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Silverlight SharpZipLib</a></p>
