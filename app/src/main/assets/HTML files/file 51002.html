<p>As per my knowledge, like default SMS Manager you can't send message directly with other apps....like way2sms / whatsapp. If and only if they are providing there SDK and with that option.</p>

<p>Do you know the 'key' -> "address" and "sms_body" are using by way2sms app to receive your data!!!!  </p>

<p>For Eg: Facebook you can post directly with ur app by using some user permissions.</p>
