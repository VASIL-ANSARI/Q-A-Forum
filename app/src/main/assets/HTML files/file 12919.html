<p>As said in the comments, it would probably easiest for you to use HTTPS.</p>

<p>I once set up an iPhone app that had to communicate with a PHP backend over HTTPS, and spent many hours trying to find out why the iPhone wouldn't accept the encrypted connection.</p>

<p>As it turned out, it didn't work because I was using a self-signed certificate on the server side. Buying an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority solved all issues. </p>

<p>SSL certificates that validate a single domain name without company or extended validation are really cheap, so I suggest you give that a try!</p>
