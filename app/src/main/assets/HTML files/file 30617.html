<p>Using an explicit connection string I was able to get a "real" connection without any "magic", and this works for me:</p>

<pre><code>public DBContext()
: base("name=DataBaseFirstDBEntities")
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am still confused why a connection without any setting works, but I tend to think this has to do with the Windows Authentification for the SQL Server: Since the web server process has the same user credentials as the SQL server (on my local developer machine) this seems to be a reasonable explanation. </p>
