<p>Java only supports signed types (except <code>char</code>) because it was assumed that one type was simpler for beginners to understand than having two types for each size.  In C it was perceived to be a source of error so support for unsigned types was not included.</p>

<p>So the designers picked four sizes</p>

<ul>
<li><code>byte</code>, 8 bit</li>
<li><code>short</code>, 16 bit</li>
<li><code>int</code>, 32 bit</li>
<li><code>long</code>, 64 bit.</li>
</ul>

<p>and to keep things consistent they were all signed just like <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>  However a signed byte is rarely very useful and given they allowed unsigned 16-bit <code>char</code> having an unsigned <code>byte</code> might have made more sense.</p>

<p>Where this doesn't work so well is when you have to interact with systems which use unsigned integer types.  This can be source of confusion and to which type to use instead because often it doesn't make any difference.  Java 8 will have operations to support unsigned types as well.  These are added to the wrapper classes like <code>Integer</code> and <code>Long</code></p>
