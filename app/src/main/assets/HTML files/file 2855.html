<p>I had a similar situation arlier. I created a table with the same structure, let's call it the archive table. I copied the data from the active table to it every day at 3:00 and the deleted ALL the original.</p>

<p>The graphs and other statictics were <code>select</code>ed from the archive table, the current events were logged to the active one.</p>

<p>Maybe it is not a best practice but worked sufficiently for me.</p>
