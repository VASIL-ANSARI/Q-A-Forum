<p>The problem i was the hash key that i have uploaded and that i got from the code below were different. That was the reason that when facebook app was installed on the device it did not get the logged in session of the user. Thus I wrote this code, got the hash, updated on my console and woo.. i got the login perfect. I am posting this so that my fellow developer save some time that i have spent in solving this problem.</p>

<pre><code>try {
PackageInfo info = getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(
      "com.facebook.samples.loginhowto", PackageManager.GET_SIGNATURES);
for (Signature signature : info.signatures){
       MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
       md.update(signature.toByteArray());
       Log.d("KeyHash:", Base64.encodeToString(md.digest(), Base64.DEFAULT));
}
} catch (NameNotFoundException e) {
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
}
</code></pre>
