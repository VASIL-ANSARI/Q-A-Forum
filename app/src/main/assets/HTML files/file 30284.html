<p><code>static</code> blocks and declarations are executed <em>in the order they are coded</em>. This means that at the time the static block executes, the <code>num</code> field is not yet defined.</p>

<p>The simple fix is moving the declaration <em>above</em> the block.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.3.2.3" rel="nofollow">Java Language Specification Section 8.3.2.3</a> (among other things) says that a variable may <em>assigned</em> a value <em>before</em> being declared, but the value of the variable may not be <em>accessed</em> before the variable is declared <strong>unless its name is fully qualified</strong>, so this compiles:</p>

<pre><code>public class Example {
    static{
        num = 3; // assignment OK without qualifying the name
        System.out.print(Example.num); // name must be qualified to access value
    }
    public static int num;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Still more interesting is that if a variable is accessed before being declared, its <em>default</em> value is used, and further the initialization on declaration <em>still occurs</em>, so this code:</p>

<pre><code>public class Example {
    static{
        System.out.println(Example.num); // uses default value
        num = 3;                         // assignment OK
        System.out.println(Example.num); // assigned value (3) is visible
    }

    public static int num = 1;           // initialization to 1 occurs

    static{
        System.out.print(Example.num);   // initialized value (1) is visible 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Produces this output:</p>

<pre><code>0
3
1
</code></pre>

<p>Wow!</p>
