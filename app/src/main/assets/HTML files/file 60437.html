<p>Your Format must be:</p>

<pre><code>DateTimeFormat.forPattern("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ");
</code></pre>

<p>It must be exactly like the date string, with the fixed values escaped by single quotes and without additional blanks.
Also you have to use <code>HH</code>for 24 hours Format. hh is 12 hours Format and it starts at 1 and Ends on 12</p>
