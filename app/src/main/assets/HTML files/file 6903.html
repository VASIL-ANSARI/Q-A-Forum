<p>As far as I know, there isn't any debug mode. I am using firebug with Firefox (if you are using chrome you can go for the chrome developer tools), and that can show errors associated with the syntax when a chart is not properly rendering.</p>

<p>It's like a console appear in the bottom of the web browser showing all the data transactions.</p>
