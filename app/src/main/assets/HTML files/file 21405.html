<p>So the basic idea is you have a button in the tableview (maybe in the footer or in a row) and when they press the button you can use <code>UITableView</code>'s <code>insertRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation:</code> to add a new row which can have your new field/label etc.  If you search for samples on <a href="http://developer.apple.com" rel="nofollow">developer.apple.com</a> you'll find some samples using that method.  Search for <code>insertRowsAtIndexPaths:</code> and you'll pull up several examples.  Download and run them and when you see one that has what you want go look at the source.</p>
