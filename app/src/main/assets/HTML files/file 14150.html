<p>I built <strike><a href="http://www.cordblood.com/cord-banking-basics" rel="nofollow">this project</a></strike> <strong>(no longer live)</strong> using Raphael. What I did is actually abandoned the idea of using HTML inside of SVG because it was just too messy. Instead, I absolutely positioned an HTML layer on top of the SVG layer and moved them around together. When I wanted the HTML to show, I merely faded it in and faded the corresponding SVG object out. If timed and lined up correctly, it's not really noticeable to the untrained eye.</p>

<p>While this may not necessarily be what you're looking for, maybe it will get your mind thinking of new ways to approach your problem! Feel free to look at the JS on that page, as it is unminified ;)</p>

<p>PS, the project is a lead-gathering application. If you just want to see how it works, select "Friend" in the first dropdown and you don't have to provide any info.</p>
