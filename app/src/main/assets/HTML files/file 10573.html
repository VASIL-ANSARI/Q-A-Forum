<p>i believe the problem lies in your json</p>

<p>either you override the parse method on the collection, to work with your json</p>

<p>or you could change the json :)</p>

<pre><code>[{
    "description": "Lorem ipsum..."
},
{
    "description": "Lorem ipsum..."
}]
</code></pre>

<p>i believe this is what your json should look like, just an array of your models.</p>
