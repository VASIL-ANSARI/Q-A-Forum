<p>No, the <code>dill._objects</code> module is just a list of types dill can and cannot pickle. Adding to that will just make <code>dill</code> think it can do more, while remaining the same functionally.</p>

<p>If you want to add a pickler, use <code>dill.register</code> (usally as a decorator). It takes a function which does the breaking down. E.g. given an unpicklable class:</p>

<pre><code>class A:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def __reduce__(self):
        raise GoAwayError()
</code></pre>

<p>Trying to pickle an instance of <code>A</code> will give you:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "d.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
    dill.dumps(A(1))
  File "/home/matthew/GitHub/dill/dill/dill.py", line 192, in dumps
    dump(obj, file, protocol, byref, fmode)#, strictio)
  File "/home/matthew/GitHub/dill/dill/dill.py", line 182, in dump
    pik.dump(obj)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/pickle.py", line 410, in dump
    self.save(obj)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/pickle.py", line 497, in save
    rv = reduce(self.proto)
  File "d.py", line 7, in __reduce__
    raise GoAwayError()
NameError: name 'GoAwayError' is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>You can define a pickler like:</p>

<pre><code>def recreate_A(a):
    return A(a)

@dill.register(A)
def save_A(pickler, obj):
    pickler.save_reduce(recreate_A, (obj.a,), obj=obj)
</code></pre>

<p><code>recreate_A</code> is the function used for reconstruction, and <code>(obj.a,)</code> is a tuple of args which will be passed to your reconstructer function when loading.</p>

<p>This is probably the most flexible way of doing it, as you can use any function for <code>recreate_A</code>, including <code>A.__init__</code> if you need to, but as you are trying to pickle a more complex type, you may need to do pre/post-processing. The functionality for skipping objects is <a href="https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/66" rel="nofollow">still in the works</a>, so you'll have to wait if you want to do it that way. If you want to achieve the same effect, you could just define <code>recreate_A</code> to return None, and take no args.</p>
