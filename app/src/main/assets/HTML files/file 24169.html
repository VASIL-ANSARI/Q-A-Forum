<p>You could run through all your test files and examine the contents to make sure that is @Before is present then @After is as well. I do this kind of thing quite a bit, and I find it runs sufficiently swiftly to include in a unit test suite.</p>

<p>Of course this won't prove that you are doing the right thing in your @After method.</p>

<p>Something like this should get you started</p>

<pre><code>for (File file : new File(yourTestDirectory).listFiles()) {
   for (String contents : Files.toString(file, Charset.defaultCharset())) {
    if(contents.contains("@Before")){
      if(!contents.contains("@After"){
        fail("must have @Before and @After");
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
