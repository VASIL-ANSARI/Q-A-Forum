<p>After a bit of research I found that the following code allows me to get what I want, supposing I am interested in the series at index intitem: </p>

<pre><code>plotswingschart.getData().get(intitem).getNode().getStyleClass();
</code></pre>

<p>This will produce a ObservableList  containing the following string values (here example for the series at index 8 (9th series)):</p>

<pre><code>chart-series-line
series8
default-color2
</code></pre>

<p>From this I can then get the information that I need. that is the colour actually applied to that curve. I can then generate a symbol to be used in my tableview. </p>

<p>I would still be interested in an answer to the question linked, which prompted the present question...</p>
