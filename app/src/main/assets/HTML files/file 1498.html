<p>Option 1 <em>(.htaccess and several .php files)</em> was often used "in the past" ; now, I see option 2 <em>(every request going through one .php file)</em> used a lot more.</p>

<p>The main advantages I see with option 2 are :</p>

<ul>
<li>you can add / modify any kind of URL without having to change any physical file like .htaccess
<ul>
<li>which means the format of the URLs can be configured in the admin section of your application, for example</li>
</ul></li>
<li>you only have <strong>one entry point</strong> to your PHP code.
<ul>
<li>which means everything goes though <code>index.php</code> : if you need some code executed for all requests, put it there, and you're sure it'll always be executed.</li>
<li>That's used a lot with MVC frameworks, for instance.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><br>
A couple of years ago, I would have gone with option 1 ; now that I use MVC and Frameworks, I always go with option 2.</p>
