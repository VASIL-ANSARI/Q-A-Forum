<p><strong>Original Answer:</strong></p>

<p>If I understood correctly this is a theoretical question.
<code>REDUCING</code> slicing can be done by not defining new members in the derived class.</p>

<p>slicing occurs when assigning an instance of a derived class to a base class reference type.
In this case the system does not know where to allocate a new data-type because it is defined in the derived class only and not in the base class.</p>

<p>But there is no way to <code>RESTRICT</code> that, this is what suppose to happen and it is defined as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A natural and unavoidable consequence of assignment by value from
  subclass objects</p>
</blockquote>

<p>however you can declare a class as <code>sealed</code> to prevent inheritance that will restrict object slicing because it will prevent the cause (Inheritance) so you will not have a derived class to assign to a base reference by value.</p>
