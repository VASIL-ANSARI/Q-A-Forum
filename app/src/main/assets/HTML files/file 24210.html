<p>The problem is related to the overflowing of your div. As your demonstration shows you have the box that is sized to 1100 pixels correctly centering but your table is coming out of it. The reason is that the table cannot be made any smaller due to words that cannot be split forcing a minimum width for columns and thus for the table as a whole.</p>

<p>There are a few options to solve this depending on what you want to do. The best in my view would be to change the <code>width: 1100px;</code> to <code>min-width:1100px</code>. This will allow the div to expand if its contents want to be larger than 1100px as in this case.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could use the overflow style on the div to create scrollbars or hide the overflow.</p>
