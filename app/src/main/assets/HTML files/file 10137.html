<p>Both Vim and Emacs will read âeditor hintsâ in the file: text, usually embedded in a comment, that contains commands or settings for the editor to obey when opening the file. You can use that to tell the editor what to do with the file, regardless of the filename.</p>

<p>For hints that will work with both Emacs and Vim, place a comment block at the end of the file:</p>

<pre><code># Local variables:
# coding: utf-8
# mode: php
# End:
# vim: fileencoding=utf-8 filetype=php :
</code></pre>

<p>(Your question doesn't entail the need to specify character encoding, but this shows how you can combine multiple settings in one comment block.)</p>
