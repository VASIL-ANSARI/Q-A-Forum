<p>It's your Dev Emulator. According to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/appleapplications/reference/safariwebcontent/usingtheviewport/usingtheviewport.html">Safari Web Content Guide</a> by Apple (under "Examples of Viewports on iOS"), the default size of the viewport of the iPhone is 980px. The Dev Emulator is then...emulating that page size for you. If you want to make it go away, just turn off the emulator or adjust any settings it may have.</p>
