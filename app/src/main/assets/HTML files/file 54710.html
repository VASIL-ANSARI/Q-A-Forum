<p>The current API for that is the one that you already used.</p>

<pre><code>Sprockets.register_dependency_resolver 'web-socket-server-url' do
  ::Rails.application.config.web_socket_server_url.to_s
end

config.assets.configure do |env|
  env.depend_on 'web-socket-server-url'
end
</code></pre>

<p>That would invalidate all the cache when the config is changed an not the cache for that file as you pointed.</p>
