<p>Astonishingly, </p>

<p>This works:</p>

<p>In functions.php, right after php tags, add this line: </p>

<p>update_option('home','<a href="http://someblog.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://someblog.com/blog/</a>');</p>

<p>Obviously, this should just add that to the 'home' keypair in the wp_2_options table, but actually it does something else.  It fires this at some point: </p>

<pre><code>   $notoptions = wp_cache_get( 'notoptions', 'options' );
      if ( is_array( $notoptions ) &amp;&amp; isset( $notoptions[$option] ) ) {
           unset( $notoptions[$option] );                    
           wp_cache_set( 'notoptions', $notoptions, 'options' );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I believe this deletes option cache, and currently either wordpress or wpengine has an issue with some cache, and the plain vanilla 'home' keypair should have worked right in the first place, leaving 'site' as 'someblog.wpengine.com' and leaving all wp_config as the plain vanilla multi-site/root configs that wpengine will set-up.  </p>
