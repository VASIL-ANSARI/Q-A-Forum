<p>I'm not sure about whether there is a workaround for this or not but there surely is a better way of listening for the UITextField text value. If you are creating instances of UITextField programmatically, all you need to do is add an event handler for them to notify your class about the text changing events. For example:</p>

<pre><code>[myTextField addTarget:self action:@selector(editingChanged:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventEditingChanged];


- (void)editingChanged:(UITextField *)sender {
  NSString *targetText = sender.text;
}
</code></pre>
