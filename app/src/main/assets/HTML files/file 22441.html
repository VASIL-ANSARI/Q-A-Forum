<p>You need to modify your object Literal to make it a JSON String. It should look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>{"images": {

    "image1" : {
        "small_image" : "images/1.png",
        "large_image" : "images/big/1.png"
    },

    "image2" : {
        "small_image" : "images/2.png",
        "large_image" : "images/big/2.png"
    },

    "image3" : {
        "small_image" : "images/3.png",
        "large_image" : "images/big/3.png"
    }

}}
</code></pre>

<p>That along with the javascript you already have should work, assuming your webserver is setup to properly serve .json files.</p>
