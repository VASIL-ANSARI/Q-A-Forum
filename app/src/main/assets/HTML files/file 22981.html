<p><strong>Just for information:</strong></p>

<p>I was also facing the same issue my Samsung device was not being detected by the <code>ADB</code> which was working fine earlier, I changed my cable, restarted Eclipse, restarted my system but nothing worked.
At the end I restarted my Samsung mobile and <code>ADB</code> detects it without any problem :)</p>
