<p>When you try to make a new publish setting there is a link where you can say you want to import old settings. This looks for files with an extension called .PublishSettings or .XML, so I would start by searching your pc for files with that extension. I would imagine the .xml file would have your sites name in it's filename, so that is worth a shot as well :)</p>

<p>This should be enough. If not I am looking forward to hearing what others say or you can dig up yourself.</p>
