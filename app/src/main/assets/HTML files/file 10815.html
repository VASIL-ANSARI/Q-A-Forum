<p>The problem with <code>BigInteger</code> is that it isn't meant for such large numbers. Last time I checked, it was still using <strong><em>quadratic run-time algorithms</em></strong> for both its multiplication and it's base conversion.</p>

<p>So the reason why computing <code>2^43,112,609 â 1</code> takes so long is that it's just huge - and you're trying to put that through a quadratic run-time algorithm.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you want something faster you will need to use a better bignum library. In C/C++ you have <a href="http://gmplib.org/" rel="nofollow">GMP</a>. There are Java wrappers for it if you google around.</p>

<p>*Note that computing <code>2^43,112,609 â 1</code> itself is fast since you can do it with just a shift. The slow part is printing out as a string in base 10. Java still uses an <code>O(n^2)</code> algorithm for this conversion. </p>

<p>Efficient programs will be able do this conversion in roughly <code>O(n * log(n)^2)</code> time - which will be under a minute using the latest version of GMP on most up-to-date machines today.</p>
