<p>A classic situation when dealing with mixed mode projects, and your suggestion is OK!</p>

<p>It would make sense to have a bool in the constructor that tells it not to destroy the pointer  if the same object is used in another non-wrapped object. <em>The ideal case is that every object was wrapped, and the destruction would be done by the CLR.</em></p>

<p>You can make a generic base class out of this (using the code you already have there), setting the bool by default by the subclass. You are guaranteed to have this functionality many times over. Another tip is to have a virtual OnFinalize() method that is called from the CLR destructor (!) that can do special operations in the subclass, like calling some special free function provided by the native library.</p>
