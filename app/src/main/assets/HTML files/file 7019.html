<p>You can use the hash part of the URL for this:</p>

<p>www.example.com#some_state</p>

<p>Then parse it (<code>document.location.hash</code>) with JavaScript and change the content that is displayed based on that.</p>

<p>Changing any other part of a URL will cause a request to the backend to be made.</p>
