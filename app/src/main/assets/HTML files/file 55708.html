<p>This is a bug with Visual C++. I can reproduce it with 2015 and 2012, but not on 2005. I've opened a <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/2810786/no-access-or-ambiguity-check-on-templated-member-function-found-in-multiple-base-classes" rel="nofollow">bug report on Connect</a>. The only workaround I have is to rename the function to have some unusual name so it can't be called accidentally.</p>
