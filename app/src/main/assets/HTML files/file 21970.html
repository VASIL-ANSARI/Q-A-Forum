<p>When you say <code>media.src = "vGow.mp4";</code> you are setting the source attribute of vGow.mp4 to media element that you have defined to be the video tag, by using <code>document.getElementById('trailers');</code> But actually html5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag hasn't any source attribute. It is actually the source attribute of the <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> tag that you need to update.  </p>
