<p>Thanx to the comments received on my question, I achieved it using <code>localStorege</code>. A quite fair reference is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/" rel="nofollow"><strong>http://dev.w3.org/</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>code</h2>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    if(!localStorage.a)
    localStorage.a=10;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If this script is included in a webpage of a particular domain(say www.example.com). Then whenever that page or any other page belonging to that doman is opened in the previously used browser, you can access it as <code>localStorage.a</code> which will be <code>10</code> in this case until and unless you explicitly delete <code>localStorage.a</code>.</p>

<p>This is probably the simplest and shortest and hence the best solution to my problem. Thanx to everyone for providing the relevant info.</p>
