<p>Synchronous and asynchronous are meant in respect to the thread used by the Servlet container. Synchronous requests will use up that thread, blocking it if necessary for other operations to complete. An asynchronous request, will use up the thread, but will not block it. Operations will move to another thread where blocking can happen. </p>

  <p>Why is that? The second request handling should not be started about 5 sec after the first SYNC?</p>

<p>If you have more than 4 threads in your Servlet container (very likely), none of your 4 requests will wait for any other.</p>
