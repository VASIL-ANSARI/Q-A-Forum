<p>We'll address this by dividing it into parts.</p>

<p><code>U&amp;</code> means that we are passing a variable of type <code>U</code> that will be used by reference - the variable used by the constructor is the same one (same memory address and value) that is given as an argument. By saying <code>const U&amp; first = U()</code> we are saying that we promise not to change the <code>first</code> passed into the constructor (<code>const ...</code>), we want <code>first</code> to be taken by reference (<code>...U&amp;...</code>), and if we don't provide <code>first</code> in the constructor we should use a <code>U</code> provided by <code>U</code>'s default constructor (<code>... = U()</code>).

<p><code>first(first)</code> is part of a "constructor initialization list" - the preferred method for initializing class member variables in a constructor. We tell the constructor that we are initializing the member variable of <code>pair</code> called <code>first</code> (<code>first(...)</code>) with the argument <code>first</code> provided by the constructor (the <code>U&amp;</code> we discussed earlier).
