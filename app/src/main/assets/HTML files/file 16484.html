<p>I feel that the data type of your column is "varchar/char". That's why the data is getting destroyed. Apparently you should store anything that is to be AES_ENCRYPTed in blob format</p>

<p>I think it is because a varchar field can't handle certain characters that are produced from the encryption.</p>

<p>Quoting the MYSQL documentation for <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman//5.5/en/encryption-functions.html#function_aes-decrypt" rel="nofollow">AES_ENCRYPT</a>.</p>

<p>" AES_ENCRYPT() encrypts a string and returns a binary string" </p>

<p>Therefore, you'd need a BLOB (Binary Large object).</p>
