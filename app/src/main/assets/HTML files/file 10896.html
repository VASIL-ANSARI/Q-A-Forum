<p>You have to do this serverside; the client's browser cannot write to the file system of the server directly as it's a huge security risk.</p>

<p>In addition to that, not even HTML5 with it's File API can extract ZIP files. You need to do it on the server with PHP, or whatever language you're using.</p>

<p>If you just want to do things locally on the client, you could consider a Flash/Java/Browser extension, but I wouldn't recommend it for compatibility and performance reasons. Your best bet is to send a request to the server for it to process and send back. You're already serving the HTML page, so you can use the same server to process the ZIP file.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you want to write the ZIP file to the server, you <em>have</em> to do it server side for reasons stated in my first paragraph.</p>
