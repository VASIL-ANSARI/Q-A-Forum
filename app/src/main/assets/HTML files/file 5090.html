<p>The attribute name 'changes' conflicts with the AR::Dirty functionality. You should probably pick a different name for that column.</p>

<p>Here's the rails3 api docs for Dirty:</p>

<p><a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Dirty.html" rel="nofollow">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Dirty.html</a></p>

<p>In rails2 it's in ActiveRecord rather than ActiveModel.</p>

<p>If you aren't able to rename the column, you could work around the issue by calling <code>@model_obj[:changes]</code> instead.</p>
