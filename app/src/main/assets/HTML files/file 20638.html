<p>If you do not have corresponding input fields for the Family properties inside your view those values will never be sent back to your controller. So you should retrieve them using the FamilyID (which you would have sent with a hidden field) from the database before updating your Person object. That's the correct flow.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>This being said the best way to handle this scenario is to use view models (DUH). So you will design a view model which will contain only the properties that are supposed to be edited by the user in the view. Then you will make your view strongly typed to the view model and your HttpPost controller action will take the view model as argument. Inside this action you will load the entire Person domain that needs to be updated from the database, set the properties that were modified from the view model (trivially easy with a tool such as <a href="https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper" rel="nofollow"><code>AutoMapper</code></a>) and then persist back your domain model to the database. Only the properties that were part of the view will be modified from this Person domain model.</p>
