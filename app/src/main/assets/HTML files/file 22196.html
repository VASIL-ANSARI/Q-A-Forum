<p>I think your are confusing template styles with the style for menu module. Unless you have a parameter in your template that specifies the choice of a mod_menu layout a template style is not going to help you.Go to he module manager and pick the module you want to apply the style to. Use the field to select the layout you want.  Or if it is a css style use the style option.   It could also be that what you really want is to apply module chrome. THat do can be done by editing the module.   If you want to have the same menu with different layouts or styles you'll probably want to make additional modules for that menu.</p>
