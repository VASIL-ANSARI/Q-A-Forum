<p>As GAE builds on how data is managed in Django there is a lot of info on how to address similar questions in the Django documentation (for example see <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/chapter05/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, scroll down to 'Your first model').</p>

<p>In short you design you db model as a regular object model and let GAE sort out all of the object-relational mappings. </p>
