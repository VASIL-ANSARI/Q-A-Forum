<p>Search the web for "double buffering."  </p>

<p>In general, one thread will write to one or more buffers.  Another thread reads from the buffers, "chasing" the writing thread.</p>

<p>This may not make your program more efficient.  Efficiency with files is achieved by writing in huge blocks so that the drive doesn't get a chance to spin down. One write of many bytes is more efficient than many writes of a few bytes.  </p>

<p>This could be achieved by having the writing thread only write when the buffer content has exceeded some threshold like 1k.  </p>

<p>Also research the topic of "spooling" or "print spooling".  </p>

<p>You'll need to use C++11 since previous versions don't have threading support in the standard library.  I don't know why you limit yourself, since Boost has some good stuff in it.</p>
