<p>Crystal Reports does always need to install standalone, I've been dealing with that for a while now, mine is a ClickOnce Application, actually I'm making some Reports using Report Viewer but I should warn you IT NEEDS TO INSTALL TOO on client machines so you will need Admin Privilegies on new installs.</p>

<p>What I 'm doin now is changing to a pure dll generation reporting solution as Telerik or DevExpress, right now I'm using DevExpress one.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I do NOT work for either company.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
