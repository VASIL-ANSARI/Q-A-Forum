<p>I'm a bit confused on what you're asking. Are you trying to post these records at midnight local time instead of midnight UTC time? </p>

<p>Have you looked into something like this: </p>

<pre><code>DATEADD(hh,DATEDIFF(hh,GETUTCDATE(),GETDATE()),dateScheduled)
</code></pre>

<p>The DATEDIFF pull how many hours local time is away from UTC + 0 time and then add that difference to a date column. This is useful if your timezone practices DST so you don't have to change a hard coded -8 value. </p>

<p>Let me know if this helps. If not, clarify what you're trying to do and I'll look at it. </p>
