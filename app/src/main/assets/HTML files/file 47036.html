<p><a href="https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/alice-fixtures/fixtures" rel="nofollow">This tutorial</a> has everything covered. You can create distinct YAML files for each entity and load them in the proper order (by dependency) and then reference skills in other fixtures.</p>

<p>If your issue is that creating the skill from within the YAML files required a construct call, you can do that too (as shown in the tutorial).</p>
