<p>Do a :</p>

<pre><code>var_dump($_POST);
</code></pre>

<p>at the beginning of your page, that way you will display what is inside your $_POST variable.
Once this is done, you'll maybe figure out what the problem is :)</p>

<p>Post the content of the dump in case you don't figure out how to use it.</p>
