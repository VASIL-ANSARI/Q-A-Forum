<p>Personaly I don't like pop up windows instead of that maybe yo can do the following:</p>

<p>You can open an overlay DIV that you can populate with data from "index.php?module=Contacts..." using AJAX and make links inside of that DIV that way so that by clicking them you close that overlay DIV and redirect page to what you want...</p>
