<p>There are several approaches for this,
I am not sure, how you have designed your data,<br>
One simple solution,<br>
You can set tag for all the ImageView with image url, </p>

<pre><code> view.setTag(url)  
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you click on imageview,  you can get the tag i.e. ImageUrl,     </p>

<pre><code>  view.getTag()
</code></pre>

<p>send url to other activity and read the bitmap and show it there in ImageView or as background as you wish.</p>
