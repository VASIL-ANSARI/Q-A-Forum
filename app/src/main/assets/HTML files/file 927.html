<p>just a guess but it seems that your session[:user] is just storing the id, you need to do:</p>

<pre><code>@user = User.find(session[:user])
</code></pre>

<p>or something along those lines to fetch the user from the database (along with its associations). </p>

<p>It's good to do the above in a before filter too.</p>
