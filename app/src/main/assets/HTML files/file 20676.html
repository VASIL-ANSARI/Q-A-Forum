<p>As mentioned in the comments you have to use <code>NSLog(@" data %@", self.videoMetaData);</code> to log the data. There is no variable called <code>videoMetaData</code>.</p>

<p>Having said that, you might want to have a look how to examine objects and variables using the debugger. Have a look at this for example: <a href="http://www.cimgf.com/2012/12/13/xcode-lldb-tutorial/">http://www.cimgf.com/2012/12/13/xcode-lldb-tutorial/</a></p>

<p>There are some good videos on lldb from WWDC 2012 on developer.apple.com (you have to be a registered developer in the iOS or Mac Developer Program)</p>
