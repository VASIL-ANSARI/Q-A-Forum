<p>If I understand you correctly you want the following:</p>

<p>A click on a <code>td</code> with the <code>add-new-team-member</code> attribute should only fire the click event handler in the directive.</p>

<p>A click anywhere else on the row should fire the <code>onItemClick</code> function in the controller.</p>

<p><code>preventDefault</code> will not help you with this since it only prevents the default action the browser makes on that event.</p>

<p>What you need for this is <code>stopPropagation</code>, which stops the event from bubbling up the event chain.</p>

<p>Simplified version of what you have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr controller-event-listener&gt;
  &lt;td directive-event-listener&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you click on the <code>td</code> and don't want the event to bubble up to the <code>tr</code>, you need to call <code>stopPropagation</code>.</p>

<p>Putting this in your directive should be enough:</p>

<pre><code>element.on('click', function(e) {
  e.stopPropagation();
</code></pre>
