<p>I've downloaded this app, and it seems pretty good. I think that the approach is solid. The accuracy of the apps is very much dependent on the hardware of the actual device being used. The accuracy of the sensors would be very variable. The apps give an option to calibrate the app to your device. I would say that you need to do measurements yourself to get an idea of the accuracy using a range of devices. </p>
