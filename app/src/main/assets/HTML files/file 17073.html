<p>You could use a try/catch block around the insert query and handle the double email in the exception handler.</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "INSERT INTO `mystuff` (email, name ) VALUES (:email, :name)";

try {
  $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql);
  $sth-&gt;execute(array(':email' =&gt; $email, ':name' =&gt; $name)); 
}
catch (Exception $e)  {
  echo 'email already taken';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you must configure PDO that it throws exceptions on errors.</p>
