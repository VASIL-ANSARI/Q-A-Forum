<p>Logically this kind of approach may not be correct. For example in your record set the second and third row can be distinctly filtered to one row based on the Sid, table and userid. However, If you want to access all fields on a distinct query, the result will be either of the rows which may result in par3 to have different value based on the row returned.</p>

<pre><code>Sid Table userid par1 par2 par3
232 tbl1  43     1    2    0
232 tbl1  43     1    2    1
</code></pre>

<p>If you have decided to get all the fields of the first row of each group regardless, then use the following code</p>

<pre><code>var distinct2 = (from t in InYourDatabaseRows
group t by new { t.Sid, t.Table, t.userid }
into grp
select new { 
Sid = grp.Key.Sid,
Table = grp.Key.Table,
userid =grp.Key.userid,
par1 = grp.First().par1,
par2 = grp.First().par2,
par3 = grp.First().par3
}).ToList();    
</code></pre>
