<p>since we are without any code snippets - and i've seen z-index working in firefox, i looked for a tut for you.</p>

<p>found this via google:
<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/15/the-z-index-css-property-a-comprehensive-look/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/15/the-z-index-css-property-a-comprehensive-look/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although z-index is not a difficult property to understand, due to
  false assumptions it can cause confusion for beginning developers.
  This confusion occurs because z-index will only work on an element
  whose position property has been explicitly set to absolute, fixed, or
  relative.</p>
