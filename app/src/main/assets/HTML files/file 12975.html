<p>Change the condition in your while to this:</p>

<pre><code>while (pass &lt; unsortedNumLen)
</code></pre>

<p>Logically <code>pass</code> <strong>never</strong> equals <code>unsortedNumLen</code> so your <code>while</code> won't terminate.</p>

<p><code>pass</code> does eventually equal <code>unsortedNumLen</code> when it goes over the max value of an <code>int</code> and loops around to it.</p>

<p>In order to see what's happening yourself while it's in the hung state, just hit the pause button in Visual Studio and hover your mouse over <code>pass</code> to see that it contains a huge value.</p>

<p>You could also set a breakpoint on the <code>while</code> line and add a watch for <code>pass</code>. That would show you that the first time the list is sorted, <code>pass</code> equals 5.</p>
