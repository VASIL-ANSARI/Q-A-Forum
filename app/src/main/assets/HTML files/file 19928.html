<p>I had the exact same problem and it was due to localization which splits the storyboard into different ones for each language. It remains one file but xcode shows each localization in the address bar (or whatever it is called) if you select the storyboard in the file navigator.</p>

<p>Most likely you made changes for a storyboard language you don't use yourself for testing.</p>
