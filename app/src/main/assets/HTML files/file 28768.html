<p>The problem is that the <code>c_str</code> return a pointer that is temporary. So when the loop continue it's iteration the object you got the pointer from is destructed and the pointer is no longer valid, leading to undefined behavior when you later dereference that pointer.</p>

<p>If you want an array of strings, why not declare it as an array of strings?</p>

<hr>

<p>There are also other problems with your code, like you only allocating four bytes for a string that can be 12 (with sign and string terminator) characters.</p>

<hr>

<p>I would suggest you remake your program like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;array&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

const size_t ATTR_SIZE = 3;

int main()
{
    std::array&lt;std::string, ATTR_SIZE&gt; attr;

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; ATTR_SIZE; ++i)
    {
        std::istringstream is;
        is &lt;&lt; "attr" &lt;&lt; i;
        attr[i] = is.str();
    }

    for (const std::string&amp; s : attr)
        std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above uses some C++11 features like <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array" rel="nofollow"><code>std::array</code></a> (you can use <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector" rel="nofollow"><code>std::vector</code></a> instead) and <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for" rel="nofollow">range-base <code>for</code> loop</a> (you can use normal iteration instead).</p>
