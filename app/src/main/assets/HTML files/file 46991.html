<p>With regards to the scrolling background, have a look at this <a href="http://codetheory.in/moving-scrolling-sliding-background-in-html5-canvas/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a>, it will give you an idea how the scrolling can be used. You can modify this to whatever way you want, for example when the player pushes up the background will move up whatever the player moves.</p>

<p>For zooming, I believe you're looking for the scaling command.</p>

<pre><code>var canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
ctx.scale(x,y);
</code></pre>

<p>You can scale the image directly rather than the canvas by doing this. The code snippet will scale the width and height of the image by x. Give this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18761404/how-to-scale-images-on-a-html5-canvas-with-better-interpolation">post</a> a look.</p>

<pre><code>var w = value;
var h = value;
var x = scale;
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, w/x, h/x);   
</code></pre>

<p>Have a look <a href="http://codetheory.in/canvas-rotating-and-scaling-images-around-a-particular-point/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for some stuff on scaling, rotating and other things you might find useful for making a game.</p>
