<p>You're close - you just need to start with the Player table, rather than the PlayerStatus, and use LEFT JOINs. </p>

<pre><code>/* Select all Players and their Status */
SELECT ply.PlayerName, ply.PlayerTeam, sta.StatusDesc, pls.CreatedDate
FROM #Player ply
LEFT JOIN #PlayerStatus pls ON ply.PlayerID = pls.PlayerID
LEFT JOIN #Status sta ON pls.StatusID = sta.StatusID
LEFT JOIN #PlayerStatus pls2 ON pls2.PlayerID = pls.PlayerID AND pls2.PlayerStatusID &gt; pls.PlayerStatusID
WHERE pls2.PlayerStatusID IS NULL
ORDER BY ply.PlayerID ASC;
</code></pre>

<p>Your original query started with PlayerStatus, and linked out from there, so it started with just those values that existed in the PlayerStatus table. </p>

<p>You were also using <code>INNER JOIN</code>s, which limit your results to only those records which match.  Using a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> instead (or a <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>, I suppose, but I find it easier to read with a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>) will allow you to retrieve all records from the first table, regardless of whether they have a match in the second table.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38549/difference-between-inner-and-outer-joins">See here.</a> </p>
