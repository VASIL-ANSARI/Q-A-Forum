<p>I dont really understand what you're trying to do here but i know u should use floats or doubles instead of ints if you want to get a decimal anwser.</p>

<p>By the way isn't the shortest past just Pythagorean Theorem?</p>

<p>The shortest path for the points (Ax, Ay) and (Bx, By) should be sqrt( (Bx-Ax)^2 + (By-Ay)^2 )</p>
