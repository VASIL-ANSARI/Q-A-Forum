<p>when i needed one, i found that building it yourself is the best thing..
start by raising a threaded server in python <a href="http://docs.python.org/dev/library/socketserver.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/dev/library/socketserver.html</a> (you don't have to use the class itself).
and it's very simple:
in the new connection thread, you create a new socket and connects it to the real server.
then, you put both of them in a list and sends it to select.select (import select).
then, when socket x receive data - sends it to y. when socket y receives data sends it to x. (don't forget to close the socket when you receive empty string).</p>

<p>now you can do whatever you want..</p>

<p>if you need anything, i'm here..</p>
