<p>Purely css: the only way would be to position each div absolutely. I recently used a JQuery plugin called <a href="http://desandro.com/resources/jquery-masonry" rel="nofollow">masonry</a> which uses absolute positioning to achieve this effect.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use two divs with your sections divided between them:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="left"&gt;
 [3 or 4 sections]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="right"&gt;
 [3 or 4 sections]
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously though, this solution presupposes your sections can be approximately divided in half.</p>
