<p>When a picture is taller than it is wide, it means the camera was rotated. Some cameras can detect this and write that info in the picture's EXIF metadata. Some viewers take note of this metadata and display the image appropriately.</p>

<p>PIL can read the picture's metadata, but it does not write/copy metadata when you save an Image. Consequently, your smart image viewer will not rotate the image as it did before.</p>

<p>Following up on @Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams's comment, you can read the metadata using PIL this way, and rotate if necessary:</p>

<pre><code>import ExifTags
import Image

img = Image.open(filename)
print(img._getexif().items())
exif=dict((ExifTags.TAGS[k], v) for k, v in img._getexif().items() if k in ExifTags.TAGS)
if not exif['Orientation']:
    img=img.rotate(90, expand=True)
img.thumbnail((1000,1000), Image.ANTIALIAS)
img.save(output_fname, "JPEG")
</code></pre>

<p>But be aware that the above code may not work for all cameras.</p>

<p>The easiest solution maybe to use some other program to make thumbnails.</p>

<p><a href="http://photobatch.stani.be/" rel="nofollow">phatch</a> is a batch photo editor written in Python which can handle/preserve EXIF metadata. You could either use this program to make your thumbnails, or look at its source code to see how to do this in Python. I believe it uses the <a href="http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/api.html" rel="nofollow">pyexiv2</a> to handle the EXIF metadata. pyexiv2 may be able to handle EXIF better than the PIL's ExifTags module.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" rel="nofollow">imagemagick</a> is another possibility for making batch thumbnails.</p>
