<p>After some digging the only way I could figure out how to do this is to call some native methods to disable <code>ENABLE_LINE_INPUT</code>. I don't know why this works because the docs for <code>ENABLE_LINE_INPUT</code> say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ReadFile or ReadConsole function returns only when a carriage return character is read. If this mode is disabled, the functions return when one or more characters are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which doesn't really seem related. Especially since <code>ReadKey</code> doesn't wait for <code>return</code> anyways.</p>

<p>Maybe someone else can explain it better?</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>int mode = 0;
GetConsoleMode(handle, ref mode);
mode &amp;= ~0x0002; // Disable ENABLE_LINE_INPUT.  Lets ctrl-s work for some reason.
SetConsoleMode(handle, mode);
</code></pre>
