<p>Yes, there is a difference.</p>

<p>This is a DOM element:</p>

<pre><code>var element = document.getElementById("foo");
</code></pre>

<p>This element exposes those properties and functions that are specified by the DOM (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element" rel="nofollow">MDN reference</a>). For example, assuming it's an input element you can get its value with <code>element.value</code>.</p>

<p>This is a jQuery object, also known as a "wrapped set":</p>

<pre><code>var wrapped = $(element);
</code></pre>

<p>This particular wrapped set contains just the one element from above. The wrapped set exposes properties and functions <a href="http://api.jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">as defined by jQuery</a>. For example, you can get its value with <code>wrapped.val()</code>.</p>

<p>Let's see what the book notes discuss.</p>

<p><strong>First quote:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the latter returns the third "element" in the wrapped set</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the return value of <a href="http://api.jquery.com/get/" rel="nofollow"><code>.get()</code></a> is one of the wrapped <em>elements</em>; when you use it, jQuery hands you a reference to one of the elements it was wrapping. The API documentation explicitly states that the result is a DOM element:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Retrieve one of the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Second quote:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but the first one returns a wrapped set containing the element</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the return value of <a href="http://api.jquery.com/slice/" rel="nofollow"><code>.slice</code></a> is itself <em>a wrapped set</em> that wraps only some of the elements the source wrapped set was wrapping. The API documentation describes says that the result is a wrapped set that wraps a subset of the original:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of
  indices.</p>
</blockquote>
