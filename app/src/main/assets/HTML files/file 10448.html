<p>I have tried it, it compiles, and it runs as expected. A peculiar formulation, but I don't think it breaks any rules.
For clarity (for yourself and future code mantainers), you could also rephrase it as:</p>

<pre><code>int main() 
{
    try {
      throw 42;
    }
    catch( int /*...*/) {
    }
}
</code></pre>
