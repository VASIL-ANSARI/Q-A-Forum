<p>The <code>char string[][]</code> K&amp;R notation is ancient, you ought to use the "new" <code>char**</code> style, indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this an okay way to input strings of digits into a 2D array?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely no. You are reading char by char rather than digit-string by digit-string, which I assume your intention was.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would it be better / easier to use 1D array and a char ** to do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be done that way, too, writing some token between the items in the same string. It is basically up to you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And last, with the char **, if I allocate memory for the strings, do I have to allocate more / different memory for the tokens?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, sure, you either allocate a very large memory upfront or you keep reallocating.</p>
