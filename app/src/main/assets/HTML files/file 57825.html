<p>In the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/" rel="nofollow">Mono project</a>, the source code shown it supported the duplex channel.<br>
The Xamarin.IOS and Xamarin.Android are based on Mono, But not sure what reason <strong>Xamarin team just cut the duplex channel feature when create these 2 projects based on Mono.</strong></p>

<p>Even .Net core create after Xamarin so much late, but now .Net core already supported duplex channel in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/wcf" rel="nofollow">Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform v5.2.0</a>. which mean, you still could use UWP or UWP with Xamarin.Forms create a duplex channel project. But Xamarin.IOS and Xamarin.Android still not.  Actually already some people asked about the duplex channel feature for a few years in <a href="http://forums.xamarin.com" rel="nofollow">Xamarin forums</a>.But the Xamarin team still ignoring it.Maybe too busy, or maybe that's a Microsoft style: everything too late for come or too late for change.</p>

<p>However, there is still some <strong>people asking this feature on Bugzilla of Xamarin</strong>, If you still have hope for this, you could vote it or discuss:<a href="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41392" rel="nofollow">Request add WCF Duplex Channel support for Mono(for Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.IOS)</a> </p>
