<p>The issue is caused by a mismatch in the Oracle DLLs architecture and your Ruby installation, or your System not finding the right DLLs. </p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html" rel="nofollow" title="Oracle Instant Client">Oracle Instant Client</a>. Its important that its the same arch that your Ruby is in, as it contains the necessary DLLs. </p>

<p>Unzip it somewhere on your HDD, such as: 
<pre>C:/OracleInstantClient</pre> Its also convenient to add both
<pre>/network/admin/sqlnet.ora 
/network/admin/tnsnames.ora</pre> to that folder.</p>

<p>Add the Instant Client's location to your System PATH. You should now be able to connect without that error, provided you've added the correct connection information.</p>
