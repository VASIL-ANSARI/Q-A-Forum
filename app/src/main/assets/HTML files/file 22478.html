<p>The best practice is to remove any business logic from your controllers, they are only suppose to handle calling appropriate services and passing model data to the view. You models should not have any data access code and instead it's better to abstract gathering data to another class and return a clean model. For example, one of the most popular patterns to abstract DAL is a repository pattern that returns data via simple interface like <code>Customer CustomerRepository.GetCustomer(int id)</code>.  </p>

<p>All your business logic should also be contained inside services which will call repositories to get required data and the process the data based on your business rules. The service will return a clean model object which your controller will pass to the view. Simple and clean. </p>
