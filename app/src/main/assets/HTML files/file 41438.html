<p>The way you've written it <code>getName</code> is not a method, but a static function. If you don't want to make it a public method (I don't see a good reason why a getter would be private), and don't want to use <code>.call()</code>, then you will need to pass the instance explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>Person.prototype = (function() {

    function getName(self) {
        return self.name;
    }

    function greet() {
        console.log("hello " + getName(this));
    }

    return {
        constructor: Person,
        greet: greet
    }
})();
</code></pre>

<p>I'd consider all three solutions equally clean.</p>
