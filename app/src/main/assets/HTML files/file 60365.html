<p>Try changing your code like this</p>

<pre><code>// ensure record is ordered by category name
$links_cat = "SELECT links_cat.name AS linkcat, links.link AS linkname FROM links_cat INNER JOIN links ON links.category=links_cat.id ORDER BY links_cat.name";

$prevCat = '';
foreach($pdo-&gt;query($links_cat) as $row) {  
    // if category name different from previous, show it
    if($row['linkcat'] != $prevCat) {
        echo $row['linkcat'] . "&lt;br&gt;";  
        $prevCat = $row['linkcat'];
    }
    echo $row['linkname'] . "&lt;br&gt;";  
}
</code></pre>

<p>SELECT N+1 issue is code issue where SELECT query is executed in a loop. If loop count is high, then it will degrade performance. It's called SELECT N+1 because query is executed N times in loop plus 1 for initial query.</p>
