<p>You are not exactly describing the kind of data you want to save (is it only strings? is it an array? an object?) or showing any code, so I can only <a href="http://javascript.tutorialhorizon.com/2015/09/08/getting-started-with-localstorage-vs-sessionstorage-in-html5/" rel="nofollow">point</a> you to a direction. Take a look at this tutorial for a very quick start and you can learn a few things about sessionStorage and localStorage which might help you with your program. If either of these suggestions fits your needs you can do your own deeper research.</p>
