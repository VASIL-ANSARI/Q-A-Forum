<p><br /> I just got figured it out how to do this. Maybe someone will face this problem, so here is the answer. There is the REST API's <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/api/latest/people/get" rel="nofollow">people get method</a>.&nbsp;If the userId that you target is that of a Google+ page, there will be an <strong>objectType</strong> attribute with a value of page.  You can see this in action <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/explorer/#_s=plus&amp;_v=v1&amp;_m=people.get&amp;userId=116852994107721644038" rel="nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp; Just submit the query and look at the result response. You need an api key for your requests, this key has a limitation of approx. 10000 request/day. <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can registrate and obtain the api key. </p>
