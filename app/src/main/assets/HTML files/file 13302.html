<p>Same thing for me. If I "Add to Homescreen" another url it works fine and is updating fine, but the older one refuses to update no matter what I do. Works fine if you load it in Safari though.</p>

<p>I've looked everywhere on the internet and simply can't find an answer. Clearing cache/data does not help at all. I'm considering putting in a "refresh" link in my pages just to see what the hell is wrong with it.</p>

<p>Some people have said that the problem miraculously fixes itself after a while... can be 5 minutes or 1 hour...</p>
