<p>CLion uses a separate directory for building and uses that as the "current directory" when running your programs.</p>

<p>For me working on a Linux system the directory is <code>~/.CLion2016.2/system/cmake/generated/project-name-&lt;digits&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If you want another directory, like your actual project directory, then I suggest you edit the "Run/Debug Configurations" for the program, and explicitly set the "Working directory" to the directory you want.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html?origin=old_help" rel="nofollow">Creating and Editing Run/Debug Configurations</a> for more information.</p>
