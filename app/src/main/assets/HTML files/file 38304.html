<p>If you use the objective C generated NSManagedObject subclasses, they include custom methods for adding a single object - I think these are tried and tested and seem better than what is currently there for swift.</p>

<p>Theoretically you would just need to just set the new set with whatever new set you created. One option would be:</p>

<pre><code>    var matchobjs = matches.allObjects as [Event]
    matchobjs.append(event)
    matches = NSSet(array: matchobjs)
</code></pre>

<p>However the error looks very similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7385439/exception-thrown-in-nsorderedset-generated-accessors">this post:</a></p>

<p>Which to me looks like theres something fishy going on again with many-to-many relationships...</p>
