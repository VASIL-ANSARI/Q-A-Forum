<p>You are trying to hook a C++ class instance method.  It has a hidden argument, <em>this</em>.  This argument is commonly passed through the ECX register with the __this calling convention.  That's what you see that Detours version doing.</p>

<p>Getting this right is quite untrivial, the CPU register values must be preserved early, ECX in particular.  That requires a stub that uses machine code, no machine code in a managed stub of course.  I doubt that EasyHook has any support for it, it certainly isn't promised in the feature list.</p>
