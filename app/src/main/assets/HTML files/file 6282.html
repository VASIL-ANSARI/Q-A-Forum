<p>The TargetInvocationException indicates that the constructor that it is invoking has thrown an exception.  Perhaps this is due to the actual value that you are passing in for the connection string.  You might want to try using the debugger and set a break point in the constructor taking a connection string and (1) make sure that it is being invoked and (2) determine where the exception is occurring.</p>
