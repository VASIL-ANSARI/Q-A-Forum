<p>You can probably use <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable" rel="nofollow">jQuery UI draggable</a>. Note that you'd want to use a <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#handle" rel="nofollow">handle</a> since the DOM events related to dragging (probably) don't propagate outside of an iframe.</p>
