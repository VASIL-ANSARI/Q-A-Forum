<p>Here's what i think:</p>

<p>Consider the first k + 1 digits from the left. Look for the biggest one, find it and remove the numbers to the left. If there exists two of the same biggest number, find the leftmost one  and remove the numbers to the left of that. store the number of removed digits ( name it j ).</p>

<p>Do the same thing with the new number as N and k+1-j as K. Do this until k+1 -j equals to 1 (hopefully, it will, if i'm not mistaken). </p>

<p>The number you end up with will be the number you're looking for.</p>
