<p>You need to divide by the size of the type like this</p>

<pre><code>sizeof(start_tab) / sizeof(int)
</code></pre>

<p><code>sizeof</code> gives the size in bytes, since each <code>int</code> is <code>4</code> bytes then two of them are obviously eight, so you can divide by the size of an <code>int</code> and get the value you are looking for.</p>
