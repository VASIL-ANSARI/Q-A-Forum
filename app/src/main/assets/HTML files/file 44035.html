<p>You can access it from outside the loop if you declare <code>f</code> before the loop :</p>

<pre><code>ResultSet rs2 = statement.executeQuery();
String f = null;
while (rs2.next()) {
    f = rs2.getString(1);
    System.out.println(f);
}
int a = Integer.parseInt(f);
</code></pre>

<p>However, it makes little sense, since after the loop <code>f</code> will contain a reference to the final String that was assigned to it, and all the previous Strings will be ignored.</p>

<p>It would make more sense to parse the String to int inside the loop and then do something with it (add it to some Collection, process it, etc...) :</p>

<pre><code>ResultSet rs2 = statement.executeQuery();
while (rs2.next()) {
    String f = rs2.getString(1);
    System.out.println(f);
    int a = Integer.parseInt(f);
}
</code></pre>
