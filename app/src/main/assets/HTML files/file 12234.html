<p>I figured it out myself, a simple cast of the searchbox webpart is sufficient, like so:</p>

<pre><code>//get the web part:
SPLimitedWebPartManager webPartManager = file.GetLimitedWebPartManager(PersonalizationScope.Shared);
SPLimitedWebPartCollection webParts = webPartManager.WebParts;
var searchBoxWebPart = (from System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart webPart in webParts
                        where (webPart.Title.Equals("Search Box"))
                        select webPart).First();

//cast:
SearchBoxEx searchBox = (SearchBoxEx)searchBoxWebPart;
</code></pre>
