<p>You can launch an NSTimer on a background thread and make calls to the main thread periodically, this is how I do it:</p>

<pre><code>[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(LaunchTimer) withObject:nil waitUntilDone:NO];
</code></pre>

<p>Just make a "LaunchTimer" function that calls an update function at a certain interval, which makes a call to NSURLConnection, and when you receive the new messages, update the chat window by making a call to the main thread like so:</p>

<pre><code>[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(update:) withObject:newMessages waitUntilDone:NO];
</code></pre>
