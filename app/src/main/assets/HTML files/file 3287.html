<p>Currently I'm watching <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Lecture-Series-Erik-Meijer-Functional-Programming-Fundamentals-Chapter-1/">these</a> video's on Channel 9 on the basics of Functional programming.  It's explained using Haskell, but the basics apply to all languages.  I must say it's very informative and easy to understand.</p>
