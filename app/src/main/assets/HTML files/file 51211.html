<p>Unless the image is loading from a temporary source, there is no way to "hide" the image URL, otherwise the browser would have no way of knowing how to load the image.</p>

<p>Your options are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a dynamic image that requires some kind of verification to see it (eg, session based).</p></li>
<li><p>Load the image content in PHP, then echo the contents as a base64 string inline into the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Eg: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1207190/embedding-base64-images">Embedding Base64 Images</a></p></li>
</ol>
