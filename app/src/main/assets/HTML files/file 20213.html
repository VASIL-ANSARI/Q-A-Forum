<p>You should look at <code>ClassLoader.getResource()</code>. This returns a URL which represents the resource. If it's local to the file system, it will be a <code>file://</code> URL. At that point you can strip off the scheme etc., and then you have the file name with which you can do whatever you want.</p>

<p>However, if it's not a file:// path, then you can fall back to the normal InputStream.</p>
