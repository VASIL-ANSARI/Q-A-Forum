<p>jQuery cannot animate colours by default. In order to animate colours, use the official <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color">jQuery.Color</a> plugin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All animated properties should be animated to a single numeric value, except as noted below; most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless the jQuery.Color() plugin is used).</p>
