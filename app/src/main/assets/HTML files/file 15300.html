<p>If you build apps with HTML and Javascript, this item is called a flyout menu. See this link to a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465354" rel="nofollow">Quickstart: adding a Flyout</a>.</p>

<p>If you are building apps with C#/VB than there is no Flyout control available. The suggested approach is to use a Popup control, see this question on the MSDN forums where some people from Microsoft are responding to this question: <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winappswithcsharp/thread/6793c93c-072d-4567-b490-812bc5e75c89/" rel="nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winappswithcsharp/thread/6793c93c-072d-4567-b490-812bc5e75c89/</a></p>
