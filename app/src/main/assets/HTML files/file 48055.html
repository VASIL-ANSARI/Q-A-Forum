<p>Seems like this is not a tweepy issue, rather it is a windows issue.</p>

<p>The issue state that the issue is with the C runtime libraries and visual studio.</p>

<p><code>python setup.py install</code> must be trying to compile some cython code inside <code>tweepy</code> - which may be needed for performance issues. And while compiling this, it is using the conflicting C runtime library.</p>

<p>The link above explains a method to change registry keys necessary to fix this issue - but I personally hate registry edits, and prefer either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uninstall all versions of Visual Studio and C runtume libraries and reinstall them</li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>Use python compiler for microsoft (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=44266" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=44266</a>) which will install a C compiler specifically for cython. This will have it's own command prompt - use this command prompt to run <code>python setup.py install</code>. The command prompt is good because it sets paths and environment variables correctly for you to avoid weird problems like this.</li>
</ul>
