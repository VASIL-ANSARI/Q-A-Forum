<p>First off, don't use the <code>mysql</code> API; it's deprecated and won't work in PHP 7.</p>

<p>Now that that's out of the way, <code>mysql_query()</code> returns a <em>result set resource</em> (which is like an object) which can contain <em>multiple rows</em> which can contain <em>multiple columns</em>. To access the contents of this resource, you have to <code>fetch</code> a row into an array and then index into that array for the column you want. You need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$query = "SELECT id FROM users WHERE pass= '$pass'";
$result = mysql_query($query);
$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
$id = $row['id'];
</code></pre>

<p>and then you can use the value of <code>$id</code>.</p>

<p>The same holds for <code>mysqli::query()</code>, which returns a <code>mysqli_result</code> object.</p>
