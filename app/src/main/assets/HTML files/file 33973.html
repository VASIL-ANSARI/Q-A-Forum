<p>Your time has come to move to the world of modern <code>join</code> syntax.  Put your <code>join</code> conditions in the <code>on</code> clause and remember the simple rule:  Never use a comma in the <code>from</code> clause.</p>

<p>What you need is a <code>left outer join</code>.  You can't really do that in the <code>where</code> clause.  Well, you can in Oracle, but it is not pretty and not as good as a real <code>left outer join</code>.</p>

<pre><code>select gsm.mobile_no, emp.employee_id, d.department_id, roaming.name 
from employes left outer join
     data gsm
     on gsm.code = e.code left join
     department d
     on d.id = e.i left outer join
     call roaming
     on  roaming.id = gsm.code;
</code></pre>

<p>Although you can mix inner and outer joins, you want to keep all employees.  So start with that table and make all the joins <code>left outer join</code>.</p>
