<p>To answer part of your question about Rails 3.1, here's the deal...</p>

<p>Rails 3.1 currently uses a gem that requires a javascript runtime to be installed on the machine.  On Mac you typically don't have to worry about this since it already has one, but Linux (and I think Windows too) you need to install one.  So, therubyracer, or sometimes node or nodejs, are sometimes installed since they provide that.</p>

<p>However, one of the main Rails guys said they plan to fix that dependency before the final Rails 3.1 release, so hopefully that'll happen and the dependency will be gone.</p>
