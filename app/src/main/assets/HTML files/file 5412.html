<p>Probably the simplest way would be to have the remote machines publish their list of processes to authenticated clients - in other words, you'd need a "server" app on each of the remote machines, from which your client app would receive the process list.</p>

<p>Possible caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>remote-side app needed to monitor processes on that machine (you can't just read the process list off any machine, you need their cooperation)</li>
<li>authentication (you don't want <em>just anyone</em> to read the process list just by opening a connection to the remote server)</li>
<li>encryption (you don't want people to snoop the list out of the network as it's transmitted)</li>
<li>reliability (the server process may be slow/stop responding when computer is too loaded)</li>
<li>observer effect (at the very least, you'll see your "process-list-server" as an additional process)</li>
</ul>
