<ul>
<li>If you want more safety, storage in <code>onPause</code>.</li>
<li>If your data is so big that you have to storage it for several seconds, you may open a background <code>Service</code> (e.g. <code>IntentService</code>) to save.</li>
<li>You can also check the system version in your code and choose when to save. <code>if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT&gt;=Build.VERSION_CODES.ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH){}</code></li>
<li>In most situations this rule of when to save will not be changed by some customed os. But of course there can be some other os which certainly changed it. So the most important thing in android development is that u need to know that everything can be different in different phones.</li>
