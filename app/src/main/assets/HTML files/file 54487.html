<p>When <code>make -j</code> is in use, any targets may be built in parallel unless one target is <strong>explicitely</strong> set as depended from another.</p>

<p>In you case you have <code>GetEnv</code> (executable) target which uses files, produced by <code>Environment</code> (library) target. But you have no explicit dependencies between targets!</p>

<p>Correct (and the simplest) way for link with libraries is using library target name instead of library file, which is created by that target:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>target_link_libraries(GetEnv <strong>Environment</strong> xml++-2.6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a way you will have dependency between <code>GetEnv</code> and <code>Environment</code> targets, so <code>make -j</code> will no longer attempt to build them in parallel.</p>
