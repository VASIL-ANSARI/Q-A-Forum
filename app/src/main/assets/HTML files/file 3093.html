<p>make sure that you've created a new Maven project in NetBeans and not just a 'Java Desktop Project' (these don't recognize the pom.xml). make sure to select the 'Swing Application Framework project' maven archetype when the wizard asks you to select an archetype.

to check, does your project icon have a small 'M' at the top left corner (indicating it's a maven project)</p>
