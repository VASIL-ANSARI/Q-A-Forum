<p>You most definitely need to first learn about Worklight:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/mobile-solutions/worklight/library/" rel="nofollow">IBM Worklight training modules</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>You provide pretty much no information to work with in your question... I am guessing then that the problem is that the device and the computer that hosts the Worklight Server (Eclipse with Worklight Studio installed) are not on the same network, thus the app fails connecting to the Worklight Server.
