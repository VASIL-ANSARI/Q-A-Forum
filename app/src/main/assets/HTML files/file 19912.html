<p>IpmGun is not a Java programm but a Windows 32 bits executable. The mqic32.dll you want to load is part of the IBM websphere message broker. When you install the MQ Local Client software on your machine (freely availlable from IBM) the dll will get loaded. If you can not install it on the machine of your choice, maybe you can first install it somewhere else and afterwards copy all dll's to the folder where Ipmgun is currently located.</p>
