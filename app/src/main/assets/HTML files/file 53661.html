<p>I've solved this problem, but first you have to check that the issue is other than loss header files, so, once you have already cheked that this is not the problem, then is an IDE problem.
The solution could be:
go to: <em>Window->preferences->C/C++->indexer</em>  page,
then check the option <em>index all header variants</em>.
I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Well, at least worked for me on Eclipse Mars, AVR-gcc tool chain, Linux :P</p>
