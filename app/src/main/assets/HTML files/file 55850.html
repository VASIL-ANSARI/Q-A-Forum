<p>I think the problem is these lines:</p>

<pre><code>DbBroker db = new DbBroker(this, "my_database", null, 1);
SQLiteDatabase sqldb = db.getWritableDatabase();
public int test = db.insertTest("New test", "Test created from app");
</code></pre>

<p>Variables will be sorted in compiler to optimise the allocation memory. so the order of these can be changed while complie.
So the scenario can be the line #2 is called first and db instance now is <strong>null</strong> so the exception was thrown.</p>

<p>To fix it, place it in specified method, such as onCreate(), ... so these command can be execute sequently.</p>

<p>Note: you are missing a <strong>close bracket</strong> at the end of sqlite command.</p>

<pre><code>create table tests (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, publicid INTEGER, testname TEXT, description TEXT);
</code></pre>
