<p>You'll have to create a custom form that'll have all the required user fields and pass the form values to one of your controllers which will take the params something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def create
    User.create!({:email =&gt; params[:email], :roles =&gt; ["role/organization here"], :password =&gt; params[:password], :password_confirmation =&gt; params[:password_confirmation] })
end
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to this you should secure this action with one of the <code>before_filter</code> which will check if the user is currently logged in and able to create new users?</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
