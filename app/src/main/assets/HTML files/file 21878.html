<p>Your PC has multiple interfaces (at least two) and multiple IP addresses (If it's plugged into a network, of course). Typically <code>localhost</code> is going to resolve to <code>127.0.0.1</code> (on the loopback interface) and the various methods you are using are going to return that. </p>

<p>The following will show you all the interfaces on the machine and the IP addresses assigned to them:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, IOException
{
    Enumeration&lt;NetworkInterface&gt; e = NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces();
    while (e.hasMoreElements())
    {
        NetworkInterface n = e.nextElement();
        System.out.println(n.getName());
        Enumeration&lt;InetAddress&gt; ee = n.getInetAddresses();
        while (ee.hasMoreElements())
        {
            InetAddress i = ee.nextElement();
            System.out.println(i.getHostAddress());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
