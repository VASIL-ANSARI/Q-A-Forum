<p>If you can load this file into a JSON Object or an ExtJS <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/5.0.1-apidocs/#!/api/Ext.util.HashMap" rel="nofollow">HashMap</a>, then you can globally listen for a component's <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/5.0.1-apidocs/#!/api/Ext.Component-event-afterrender" rel="nofollow">afterrender</a> event to inspect your HashMap or JSON Object for a match and apply the corresponding listener.</p>

<p>Something like that may work, but that does mean every component will have to check to see if there is a listener that should be applied which will probably have a huge performance overhead. </p>
