<p>The problem is that you call <code>invalidate</code> with every point you draw. That produces a very high processor load. I'm working on a very similar project, USB device, realtime plotting data. I use a separate thread for data acquisition. This thread creates an event, every time it receives a datapacket. The data is put into a queue. The graph is updated with a timer. You find an example <a href="http://zedgraph.dariowiz.com/index3061.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In this code the graph is updated every 50 ms, it is not really necessary to draw faster. In the timertick I check the size of the Queue and draw more or less points and then call <code>invalidate</code>. I don`t know if this is a good solution(just 6month experience in C#), but it works quite well with 7500 points. You should try to use a timer for the refresh of the graph first.</p>
