<p>It really depends on the number of records involved, and how much of an impact to your system it will be regenerating the materialized view every 30 seconds. i.e. if the materialized view regenerates in 5 seconds or so, it wouldn't be much of an issue. If it takes 20 seconds while maxing-out processors and disks, then it's a really bad idea.</p>

<p>An alternative is to implement a trigger in your table (or triggers in all involved tables) to increase/decrease counters where appropriate, plus a trigger in your Groups table to calculate the current value whenever a new record is added or the condition is changed.</p>
