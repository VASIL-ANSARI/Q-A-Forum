<p>You can try</p>

<pre><code>str = str.replaceAll("\n\r?#", "chr(35)");
</code></pre>

<p>If you're going to be doing this operation a lot, precompile the regex using a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Pattern</code></a>.</p>

<p>It's difficult to say if this would perform better than two literal replaces, so if this is <em>really</em> a bottleneck for you then you should time both variants with some sample strings. In most contexts the performance difference would be completely negligible. Here is the alternative:</p>

<pre><code>str = str.replace("\n#", "chr(35)").replace("\n\r#", "chr(35)");
</code></pre>
