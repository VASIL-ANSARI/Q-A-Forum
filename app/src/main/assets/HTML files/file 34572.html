<p>I think the error message is pretty clear. The validator expects your helper method to not return anything (have <code>void</code> return type), but your method returns <code>int</code>.<br>
The instructions do say that the helper method should do the printing, so just move that code into the <code>spending</code> method, change the return type, and you should be fine.</p>
