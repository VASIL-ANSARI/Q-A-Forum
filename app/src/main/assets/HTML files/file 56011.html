<p>Finally I found the solution. I problem was when I parse uri to string, the format is something like this </p>

<pre><code>   /sdcard/download/filename.png
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The uri string must be in this format</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>   file:///sdcard/download/filename.png
</code></pre>

<p>NO Content Provider Found exception throws because my uri string does not have required prefix. So I convert the uri to string. Then added the prefix. Then I parse that string to URI back. Then it worked successfully.</p>
