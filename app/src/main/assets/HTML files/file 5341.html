<p>Use the methods:</p>

<pre><code>init()
// and
preDispatch()
</code></pre>

<p>implement them in your class, init runs at creation, predispatch runs right before your action method iirc</p>

<p>On that page I linked above it states</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Note: Usage of init() vs. preDispatch()
    In the previous section, we introduced the init() method, and in this section, the preDispatch() method. What is the difference between them, and what actions would you take in each?
    The init() method is primarily intended for extending the constructor. Typically, your constructor should simply set object state, and not perform much logic. This might include initializing resources used in the controller (such as models, configuration objects, etc.), or assigning values retrieved from the front controller, bootstrap, or a registry.
    The preDispatch() method can also be used to set object or environmental (e.g., view, action helper, etc.) state, but its primary purpose is to make decisions about whether or not the requested action should be dispatched. If not, you should then _forward() to another action, or throw an exception.
    Note: _forward() actually will not work correctly when executed from init(), which is a formalization of the intentions of the two methods. </p>
