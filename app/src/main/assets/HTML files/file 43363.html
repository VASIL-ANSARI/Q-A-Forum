<p>Can you install Google Sheets app on the device? If so, you might not have to make things so complicated. <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2375012?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Here</a>, you can see that Google Sheets are also available offline if you have the app installed. So all they would need to do is, work on the spreadsheet when they are out on the field, come back to office and sync it the next morning. Wouldn't that possibly solve all your problems? Please let me know if I missed something but from what I understood, this should be enough.</p>
