<p>According to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173121.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly. Access from another assembly must take place within a class declaration that derives from the class in which the protected internal element is declared, and it must take place through an instance of the derived class type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you should be able to do it. Can you post some of your code?</p>
