<p>Just wanted to state that first. So what you should look for is libraries and software that can convert/extract the information you want. And as mentioned by Ofir MicroSoft have tools for that for their formats.</p>

<p>But if you can not do this and want to take the chance that there is text visible in the file that you think is interesting to read you could do a normal read and look for sequences of bytes that will build text. Then comes the question, what languages/charset should I support support in my hunt for text. Is it multi-byte text?</p>

<p>The easy start is to loop through the data and look for sequences of [a-zA-z0-9_- ] to find the text. But word is probably multi-byte. So you should scan double byte as one char.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: some of the new formats like open office and docx is multiple files in a compressed container. So you need to de-compress the file first, and scan XML documents after the text you looking for.</p>
