<p>It is up to you to choose the isolation level depending on how you want your application to work. You may require different isolation levels for different db calls, depending on what you are doing with the data.</p>

<p>There are no hard and fast rules for any specific industries such as banking, however some <em>data</em> (for example financial transaction data) is obviously important and you want to do all you can to avoid data loss and data inconsistency.</p>
