<p>That okie,</p>

<p>I tried use Ratchet/AutobahnJs Websocket, that's awesome. But I have (special?) problem :o in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16334989/ratchet-websocket-cant-send-data-to-client">here</a>.</p>

<p>In your case, I think you can use AJAX, it's simpler than Websocket. You can "zip" multi-notifications in to 1 response and request server every 5 seconds.</p>
