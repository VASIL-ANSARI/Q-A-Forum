<p>A dictionary would be the best way to go here. Perhaps something like:</p>

<pre><code>table_dict = {}
for i in range(4):   # Create
  table_name = "mytable" + str(i)
  table_dict[table_name] = MyTable(table_name)

for i in range(4):   # Query
  session.query(table_dict["mytable" + str(i)])
</code></pre>

<p>Something like that is probably what you're looking for. This would also let you create the dictionary keys automatically, like in a for loop.</p>

<p>EDIT: I assumed you were making instances of the <code>MyTable</code> class, but looking again that does not appear to be the case. I don't know the specifics of SQLAlchemy but my guess is you'll want to create <code>MyTable</code> instances using the <code>__init__</code> function.</p>

<p>EDIT EDIT: if you want to create multiple table objects, you could create a function to generate and return a new class. Maybe something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Base = declarative_base()

def TableCreator(tablename):
  class MyTable(Base):
    __tablename__ = tablename
    row_id = Column(INT, primary_key=True)
    another_column = Column(CHAR(10))
  return MyTable
</code></pre>

<p>Then you could call it with <code>mytable1 = TableCreator("mytable1")</code>.</p>
