<p>In javascript anything is possible:</p>

<pre><code>this.description = ["a","b","c"];
</code></pre>

<p>You'd have an array of 3 items being strings. In the real world you'd define it as <code>this.description = [];</code>
then do something like:</p>

<pre><code>picarrays[i].description.push("a");
picarrays[i].description.push("b");
picarrays[i].description.push("c");
</code></pre>

<p>Giving you effectively the same array and you can loop through .description to get all the strings in the array. You also might not need length since description.length would give you the number of items in description.</p>
