<p>The <code>setHandles</code> function is never running because it has no reason to; it's not called, and functions in JSX without <code>()</code> at the end don't run unless they're asked to.</p>

<p>I would suggest to throw your desired function into the <code>componentDidMount()</code> React method, so it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Register extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Do the thing
  }

  render() {
    ... 
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's React's doc on it: <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#mounting-componentdidmount" rel="nofollow">https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#mounting-componentdidmount</a></p>
