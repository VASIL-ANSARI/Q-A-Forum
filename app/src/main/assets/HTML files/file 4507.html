<p>The Spring.NET reference is wrong on the xml declaration (i had the same issue a few days ago), or should i say its not crystal clear.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;object name="BoundaryService" 
        type="StudentRegistration.Services.BoundaryService, StudentRegistration"
        abstract="true" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the above declaration applies when you have an actual <code>.asmx</code> service</p>

<p>WHen you have a PONO which you export as a WebService using <code>Spring.Web.Services.WebServiceExporter</code> the object that will be exported must be declared as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;object id="BoundaryService" 
        type="StudentRegistration.Services.BoundaryService, StudentRegistration"
 /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>target</code> property of the WebServiceExporter applies to the <code>id</code> of a declared object, the abstract part is not required as Spring.NET takes the role generating the webservice.</p>

<p>Note that your exposed service name (with your current cfg) will be <code>(..)/BoundaryExporter.asmx</code></p>

<p>Edit:
The config statement for standard .asmx web services using the <strong>name, type</strong> attributes seems to be broken, at least for spring version 1.3.0.20349</p>
