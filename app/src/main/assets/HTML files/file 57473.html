<p>You can't really run a class in two different threads - generally you move a class instance into a thread. You are probably better of making two separate classes, a reader/capture class and a writer class and put each in their own thread... this is quite simple and effective.</p>

<p>An alternative if you really want to keep the class together you could use QtConcurrent to achieve this - depending on how your class works. You could run your capture / write functions (or any heavy-on-processor functions) in qtconcurrent to farm off the heavy lifting - while event-handling/event-loop can just be done in the main thread (or even a separate thread to move this completely away from the main thread).
