<p>The session handling isn't really your concern. It is handled by the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.5/docs/servlet-2_5-mr2/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html" rel="nofollow"><code>HttpSession</code></a> class (read the description in the javadoc!), which you can obtain by calling <code>request.getSession()</code>.</p>

<p>It works in two ways (no need for you to do anything to support them):</p>

<ul>
<li>using a session cookie (if cookies are allowed)</li>
<li>using url-rewriting - appending the session id (<code>JSESSIONID</code>) to the URL.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note: it is actually handled by the servlet container (Tomcat, jetty, etc) which provides an implementation of <code>HttpSession</code>)</p>
