<p>You can't. As of writing, iPhone OS does not support background processes. (There wouldn't be any <em>need</em> for push notifications if iPhone OS supported background processes!) You can alert the user while your application is running using <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIAlertView_Class/UIAlertView/UIAlertView.html" rel="nofollow"><code>UIAlertView</code></a>, but once your app is closed, you can't do anything.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/107004/henrik-p-hessel">@Henrik P. Hessel</a> mentions, it is rumoured that background processes will finally be supported in iPhone OS 4.0. Rumours also suggest that iPhone OS 4.0 will be previewed at the January 27 Apple Special Event. We'll soon see whether they're true...</p>
