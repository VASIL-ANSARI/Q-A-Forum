<p>MySQL requires indexes on fields when using <code>ALTER TABLE</code> to add new foreign key constraints. The constraint is checked against the index in the parent table, so without an index no check is made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you add a foreign key constraint to a table using ALTER TABLE, remember to create the required indexes first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deviation from SQL standards: If there are several rows in the parent table that have the same referenced key value, InnoDB acts in foreign key checks as if the other parent rows with the same key value do not exist. For example, if you have defined a RESTRICT type constraint, and there is a child row with several parent rows, InnoDB does not permit the deletion of any of those parent rows.</p>
  
  <p>InnoDB performs cascading operations through a depth-first algorithm, based on records in the indexes corresponding to the foreign key constraints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To answer your specific questions:</p>

<p>1) It's not restricting you because you have not created the required indexes. As stated in their documentation, the algo uses the indexes corresponding to the constraint.</p>

<p>2) See #1. Yes, unless the FK is in place before the rows are added to the parent table.</p>

<p>3) No, it isn't bad practice. You just need to be explicit with your intent. For example, do you want to check for referential integrity after <code>ALTER</code>ing the table?
