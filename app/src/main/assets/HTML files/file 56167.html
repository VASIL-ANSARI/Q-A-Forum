<p>Your issue is that you're comparing different data types. If you just compare dates then you won't get an issue;</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CASE 
    WHEN CAST('6/14/2016' AS DATETIME) BETWEEN '06/13/2014'
            AND '07/04/2014'
        THEN 'Yes'
    ELSE 'NO'
    END
</code></pre>

<p>It looks to me as you're basically treating these as text (varchar) it's going to do it character by character;</p>

<ol>
<li>is 0 between 0 and 0, yep</li>
<li>is 6 between 6 and 7, yep</li>
<li>is / between / and /, yep</li>
<li>is 1 between 1 and 0, yep</li>
<li>is 4 between 3 and 4, yep</li>
</ol>

<p>etc etc</p>
