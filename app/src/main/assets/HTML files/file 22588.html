<p>Look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout" rel="nofollow">setTimeout()</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setInterval" rel="nofollow">setInterval()</a> functions.</p>

<p>The first allows you to define code to be executed when a timeout ends, the 2nd will keep executing the specified code until you stop it.</p>

<p>As for <em>replacing the content of a tag without jquery</em>, i will leave that as an exercise for you. :)</p>
