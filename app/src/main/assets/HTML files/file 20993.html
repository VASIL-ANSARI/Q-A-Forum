<p>I think your problem here that you need to simply do the following</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem uninstall rspec-core -v 2.2.1
bundle update rspec-core
</code></pre>

<p>This maybe required for other dependent gems like (rspec-rails, rspec)</p>

<p>Check this by by doing <code>gem list rspec</code></p>
