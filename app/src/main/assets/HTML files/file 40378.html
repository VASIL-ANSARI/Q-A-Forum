<p>Your loop never ends because <code>node-&gt;right</code> and <code>node-&gt;left</code> point to random memory locations. What is the value of <code>node</code>? You haven't assigned anything to it. Its value is random.</p>

<p>Another problem is that you're pushing <code>tree-&gt;data</code> onto the stack. You actually want to push <code>tree</code> onto the stack. Then you can pop a node off the stack and assign it to <code>node</code>. Now you can print <code>node-&gt;data</code> and check the children of <code>node</code>.</p>
