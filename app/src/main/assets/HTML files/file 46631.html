<p>As the stack trace says, you're trying to call <code>moveToFirst()</code> on a null reference. <code>locationCursor</code> is the only object you're calling that method on, so it must be null.</p>

<p>The docs for <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver.html#query(android.net.Uri,%20java.lang.String[],%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String[],%20java.lang.String)" rel="nofollow">query()</a> say that it can return null, so you'll should null check that object, and you should also check your invocation of <code>query()</code> to try to understand why it's returning null.</p>
