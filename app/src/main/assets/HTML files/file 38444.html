<p>You may be able to achieve this by writing custom serialization, but I won't recommend overwriting an array item representation with single object, as then that would not be a standard.</p>

<p>I would suggest create two properties in your Car object, one Owner and another past owners, and don't expose past owners to the user by using JSON ignore.</p>
