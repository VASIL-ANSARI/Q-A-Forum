<ol>
<li><p>You are trying to get capture properties of the camera before calling <code>cvQueryFrame</code> and depending on the circumstances that may not result in getting the correct properties.  Doesn't look like that is the issue, just FYI.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no reason to create a new <code>IplImage</code>.  If all you are trying to do is display it in a window, consider changing your capture code.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>New Capture Loop:</p>

<pre><code>while (true) { 

    frame = cvQueryFrame(fc);

    if (!frame) 
        break;

    cvShowImage("1", frame);

    char c = cvWaitKey(33);
    if (c == 27) {
        break;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Like you mentioned in your EDIT, the problem stems <code>cvShowImage</code> followed immediately by <code>cvReleaseImage</code>, unless you have a <em>reason</em> for doing it, just remove it.</p>
