<p><strong>never compare floating point numbers for equality.</strong></p>

<p>Basically, you're not getting the correct numbers, because they are saved in a slightly different format, so when you compare, it gets screwed.</p>

<p>That link of @Corbin is really good, So I'm adding it just for the love :)<br>

<p><strong>What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This paper presents a tutorial on those aspects of floating-point that
  have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with
  background on floating-point representation and rounding error,
  continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating-point standard, and
  concludes with numerous examples of how computer builders can better
  support floating-point.</p>
