<p>I am answering this on the basis of my testings, so anyone looking for solutions might find it useful.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the question, I was using a custom beanstalk ami [Tomcat 7 stack]. The customization was done following below steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create Beanstalk Application, create a version for this app, and launch beanstalk environment (Not customized one, default as provided by AWS) by passing options like KeyPair so you can use the same to ssh into the instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Note the AMI-id of the above instance and launch a regular EC2 (Not Beanstalk) instance of this AMI.</p></li>
<li><p>Customzie the EC2 instance to your needs, and create an EBS Image of this instance once done. Stop this instance, you can terminate it later once you are happy with the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Terminate the Beanstalk instance as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Launch new Beanstalk environment, but this time pass this ami-id of the image created in step 3.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have created customized beanstalk images for both tomcat 6 and 7. For my problem, I found out that the issue was happening when I was using a customized ami for tomcat 7. The update just didn't work. But when I use beanstalk default instance (not the customized image of mine), the update works fine.</p>

<p>However, with the tomcat 6 customized image, update works just fine. So it appears the issue is with the AWS Beanstalk Default AMI for Tomcat 7 customization.</p>

<p>I am marking this one as answered for now.</p>
