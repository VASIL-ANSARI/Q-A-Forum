  <p>I want the events list to be grouped by Regions - now matter what they're sorted by. If they're sorted by regs -- I would all events from Boston to be shown clumped together, and then sorted by regs. </p>

<p>You want ORDER BY for this, not GROUP BY. You can add the field you want to be "clumped together" before all the other fields in your ORDER BY clause.</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY region_id, regs
</code></pre>
