<p>The reason why you are getting <code>0</code> instead of <code>Science</code> is that Form component, when generating a <code>select</code>, uses array keys as values of available options and array values as string that is displayed in the select. You don't provide array keys, so the keys are <code>0</code> for <code>Science</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>Arts</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to get <code>Science/Arts</code> as the value from <code>Request::get('Area')</code> you need to pass an array to <code>Form::select()</code> where values and keys are the same strings, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Form::select('Area', ['Science' =&gt; 'Science', 'Arts' =&gt; 'Arts']);
</code></pre>
