<p>The problem is likely due to an invalid <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-101909"><code>CFBundleExecutable</code> property</a> value in the <code>Info.plist</code> file you are copying into the application.</p>

<p>In Xcode projects the default value for this property is a special variable (placeholder) value (<code>${EXECUTABLE_NAME}</code>) that is expanded (replaced) when the build system builds the application. Are you sure you need to copy this file manually? Maybe you can add a script build phase that makes whatever changes you need <strong>after</strong> it has been expanded and copied into place by the normal build process.</p>

<p>While you are at it, you should check for other placeholder values in the file. It is likely that you will need to fill in <code>CFBundleName</code> (others may also be necessary, depending on your application type).</p>
