<p>You don't run JUnit from the command line like that. The tests don't have a <code>main</code> method, so are not executable. </p>

<p>If you used Ant to compile the source, then you should use Ant to run the tests also.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.html" rel="nofollow">JUnit section of the Ant manual</a>.</p>
