<p>Sorry for my first answer, I thought it was a has_many assocation.  This works, but it's not ideal:</p>

<pre><code>topic = Topic.first
user = User.first
topic.favorited_by = topic.favorited_by.to_a - [user]
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<pre><code>topic.favorited_by(:user, :rel).match_to(user).delete_all(:rel)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit better, but still not great.  I just created a github issue for this:</p>
