<p>The problem is you're calling <code>employeeOps.open()</code> in <code>onResume()</code>, but <code>employeeOps</code> is not instantiated yet, it's value is still <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle" rel="nofollow">Activity lifecycle</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, when an <code>Activity</code> gets created two methods get called before <code>onResume()</code>: <code>onCreate()</code> and <code>onStart()</code>.</p>

<p>If you would like to call the <code>open()</code> method of <code>EmployeeOperations</code> in <code>onResume()</code>, you need to have an instance of it by then.</p>

<p>Call the following in <code>onCreate()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>employeeOps = new EmployeeOperations(this);
</code></pre>
