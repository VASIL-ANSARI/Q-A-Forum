<p>You are best off using the internal (local) repository.  This is described in more detail at <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html" rel="nofollow">Â«Introduction to RepositoriesÂ»</a>.  Basically, you just copy your artifact into the proper directory with the proper filename (following Maven conventions) underneath this internal repository, and Maven will pick it up without needing to use <code>&lt;systemPath&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>This will require you to replace the file manually when it gets updated.  (Actually, to do it properly, it will require you to include the new version with a separate version suffix in the internal repository, and to update the <code>&lt;version/&gt;</code> in your <code>pom.xml</code>.)  The only better way around this is to have someone else manage the dependency - either in the Maven central repository, or another repository location that you reference from your <code>pom.xml</code>.  (In fact, you can setup your own - either for yourself or your workgroup, which I'd recommend.)</p>
