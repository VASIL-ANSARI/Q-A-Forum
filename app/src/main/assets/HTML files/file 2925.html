<p>A daemon thread is a thread that does not prevent the JVM from exiting when the program finishes but the thread is still running. An example for a daemon thread is the garbage collection.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>setDaemon(boolean)</code> method to change the <code>Thread</code> daemon properties before the thread starts.</p>
