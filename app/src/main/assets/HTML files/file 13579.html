<p>Yes, even <strong>with ARC there are memory leaks</strong>. ARC is not a garbage collector, it only inserts for you, at compile time, retains, releases and autoreleases in key positions. So although it does help the developer, you should be aware that memory leaks still exist (for instance circular referencing). You can start by using the <strong>Static Analyzer</strong> and correct any problem it shows you. You can then go to <strong>Instruments and choose Leaks</strong>.</p>
