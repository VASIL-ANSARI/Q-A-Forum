<p>The issue is that you are returning a pointer to an automatic array. Once the function returns, the array goes out of scope. Attempting to dereference the returned pointer results in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" rel="nofollow">undefined behaviour</a>. The first call to <code>puts()</code>, while technically undefined, happens to work in your case. The second doesn't.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1224042/returning-a-pointer-to-an-automatic-variable">Returning a pointer to an automatic variable</a> for a discussion.</p>

<p>One solution is to allocate the array inside <code>main()</code>, pass a pointer to it (and its size) to <code>drawCard()</code> and let <code>drawCard()</code> populate it.</p>
