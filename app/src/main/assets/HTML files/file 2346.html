<p>I don't see how const-modifiers would really be an issue. </p>

<p>What members of your <code>QAbstractItemModel</code> derivate would you want to modify when <code>rowCount</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>columnCount</code> and <code>data</code> methods are called ? You may very well store a reference to your map, and compute everything from it. No need to modify the map itself to extract the needed information (as far as i can tell !).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT after EDIT1 and comments</strong> :<br>
If your map is bound to be modified, use it as your base structure in your own class.
If you can't keep a reference to your map because the model's lifetime might exceed the map's, use smart pointers to make sure it does not happen.</p>
