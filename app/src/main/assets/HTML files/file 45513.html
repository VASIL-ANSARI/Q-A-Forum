<p>I was able to resolve this strange issue by adding a UITapGestureRecognizer to the button and setting the target to run the code that the IBAction would have otherwise.</p>

<pre><code>UITapGestureRecognizer *tapOne = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(buttonOneTapped)];
    [one addGestureRecognizer:tapOne];
</code></pre>

<p>Then just made sure to disconnect the IBAction link from storyboard. Now it receives the quick taps that I need.
I think this had something to do with the fact that I had applied a radius to the buttons. Still unsure.</p>
