<p>The key is separation of responsibilities.</p>

<p>Your rewrite rules are meant to direct input to your application, nothing more.  Your application is responsible for determining what is valid, and what isn't.</p>

<p>While it is true that you will only get 4 digits from the rewrite rule you have shown, is <code>run.php</code> accessible directly?  What happens if someone were to find it?</p>

<p>In more general cases where you accept broader input for rewrite, but more specific rules for processing, you don't want to have to change your rewrite rules every time your application needs change.</p>
