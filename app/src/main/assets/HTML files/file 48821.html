<p>I believe you are simply looking for this: </p>

<pre><code>param1, param2 = charAbility()
</code></pre>

<h1>Explanation</h1>

<p>Your method is returning two values <code>pAbility, pScore</code>. If you are to do this simply: </p>

<pre><code>param = charAbility()
</code></pre>

<p>You will still have access to both of your returns, however, they are returned as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow">tuple</a>:</p>

<p>Simplified example of what is happening:</p>

<pre><code>def charAbility():
    return 1, 2
param = charAbility()
print(param)
(1, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>So, to handle the return in to their own variables, so you can pass it to a new method, you should be using the example I provided above. To re-iterate: </p>

<pre><code>param1, param2 = charAbility()
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can pass <code>param1</code> (which will hold <code>pAbility</code>) and <code>param2</code> (which will be holding <code>pScore</code>) to whatever other method you need to send it to: </p>

<pre><code>some_other_method(param1, param2)
</code></pre>
