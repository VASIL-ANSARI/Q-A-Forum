<p>It's a bit hard to answer without some code from your buttons, but it sounds like the click event is propagating up to the sidemenu. One quick suggestion is that you can stop propagation using ng-click, like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;button ng-click="doSomethingCool(); $event.stopPropagation();"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
