<p>Generally you need to post your expected output and point out the difference between that and the output you receive, or include an error message you are receiving, to get a usable answer.  But, I suspect the problem is that you want the value of <code>c</code> to be inserted into the string <code>u</code> and instead the literal letter <code>c</code> is being inserted.  If that is the case, the solution is:</p>

<pre><code>c = "222"
u = "my_www.%%first_game_start_time%%(%s, %s, %s)" %("REN", "233_736", c)
</code></pre>
