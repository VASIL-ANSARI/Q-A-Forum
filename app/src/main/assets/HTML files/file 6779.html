<p>The domain is definitely not what you're looking for, in my opinion, neither is your data access layer.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, what would have to be exposed is not yet there, that is, a static class, let's say, if we consider the FaÃ§ade design-pattern, which exposes your library subsystems features and functionalities.<br></p>

<p>So in the end, what is your code supposed to do? Just expose what is necessary, which you ought to know, since you're the only one to know about the system you're developing.</p>

<p>In short, I often use the FaÃ§ade pattern so that I can isolate my classes, implementations and several related subsystems under the hood of a faÃ§ade. Let's consider we are a brand new car dealer. This faÃ§ade will be the great windows which let you see the cars exposed in the show room. You got to think of what this faÃ§ade exposes. Does it expose only cars?</p>

<p>In my opinion, this faÃ§ade exposes cars, which you will be able to buy, to borrow money to buy, to repair the car, to buy other related accessories, etc. The accessories are then to be exposed, but only what needs to. The same with the other items such as the car. That is, you might want to expose an interface only, and keep the implementation for yourself, so that through you faÃ§ade, when you got to return an <code>ICar</code> or an <code>IAccessory</code>, you have to instantiate them through your implementation object class, then return the interface instance through your faÃ§ade. That said, the user doesn't need to know what is going on under the hood, but only that if he wants a car, he has to order it through your faÃ§ade. Just like you won't go buy a Mazda 3 to Mercedes Benz. You'll work with the right faÃ§ade. Then again, the different car dealers might only be subsystems, hence some kind of factories. Then you ask the faÃ§ade for a car with this and that specifications, and the faÃ§ade should know what <code>ICar</code> instance to return to exchange for what you're asking it to provide you with.</p>

<p>Hope this helps anyway! =)</p>
