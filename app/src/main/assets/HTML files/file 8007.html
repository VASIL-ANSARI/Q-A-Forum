<blockquote>
  <p>Shall i store data in one table or create different table for different categories?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would suggest spending some time creating a normalized database structure, instead of splitting it into separate tables.  For example, if you think you might assign one entry to multiple categories, that would call for a very different table schema (<code>categories</code> table, <code>definitions</code> table, and a <code>definition_categories</code> linking table that references the first two).  If you don't need that, then having a single <code>definitions</code> table with a <code>category</code> column would be sufficient.</p>

  <p>Shall i store the images also in database?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you'll be shipping the application with the images included, then do not store them in the database -- the reason is because then you'll be using up twice the space for your images (once in the application resources, and once in the database).</p>

<p>If you'll be downloading the images from the Internet, it really comes down to personal preference..  The easy way would be to just download the images and store in your data directory, or on the SD card ("external storage").</p>

  <p>Is there any way to use pdf files to display?</p>

<p>That depends on the device, and if it has a PDF reader installed.  You can test for the existence of a PDF-capable application on the device using techniques described in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/2784847/231078">this question</a>.</p>
