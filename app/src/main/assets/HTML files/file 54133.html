<p>I would recommend using forms or use AJAX to send a POST request. However, If you <strong>really</strong> don't want to use forms or use POST, GET, etc. a possibility is to take advantage of a PHP session. </p>

<p>Give this <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/php-sessions/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> a read, it'll hopefully get you started with PHP sessions.</p>
