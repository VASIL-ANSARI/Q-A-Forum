<p>I think what will work best is to have the html/JavaScript post to an endpoint on the server that's on the LAN. </p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "can this be achieved using jQuery/ HTML5" but the answer is no from a perspective of you can't write lines of html or JavaScript that will send the file and force the server to store it/retrieve it. You'll want an application running on that server that will do that for you and the HTML / jQuery will just post to that server. </p>

<p>I would also suggest building it in such a way that the LAN server or the client side code redirected you to the web server to display either a failure or success page. </p>
