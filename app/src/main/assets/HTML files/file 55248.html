<p>The Firebase Database has no server-side aggregation primitives.</p>

<p>The most common workarounds for this limitations are to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>calculate a moving aggregate on the client every time it is needed. For example, whenever you add a new number you can update the average with a transaction as <code>average = (99*average + newValue)/100</code></p></li>
<li><p>have a server do the aggregation. Preferably also with a streaming operation, as bulk operations tend to get in the way of the realtime operation of the database.</p></li>
</ol>
