<p>Due to all the compiler sugar that exists in the .NET platform, you can't decompile a binary into the original code without extremely sophisticated decompilers.  For instance, the compiler creates classes in the background to handle enclosures.  Automating this kind of thing seems like it would be a daunting task.  However, handling expected issues just to get it to compile might be scriptable.  </p>
