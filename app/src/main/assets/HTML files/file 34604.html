<p>Upon testing this myself, it appears json_encode() can't handle recursion such as what's provided in $GLOBALS['GLOBALS']... etc.</p>

<p>So a trick(?) you can do is:</p>

<pre><code>json_encode(array_slice($GLOBALS, 1));
</code></pre>

<p>Which will skip past $GLOBALS['GLOBALS'] and continue encoding the rest of the array.</p>

<p>*EDIT: $GLOBALS['GLOBALS'] appears first for me when printing this array, but a better way is to find where $GLOBALS['GLOBALS'] appears and skip that element entirely.</p>
