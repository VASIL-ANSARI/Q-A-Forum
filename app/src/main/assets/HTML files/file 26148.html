<p>Your code is fine. Do you need a mipmap? If you're taking the default format, Dx is going to produce a mipmap, which will increase the time to generate the texture as well as the time to push it to the GPU, as it will be much larger.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, what is the type of screenData? </p>
