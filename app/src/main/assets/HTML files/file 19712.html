<p>I was looking at this question when investigating a related issue. It turned out that my issue was that I needed to use separate functions to handle <code>onclick</code> and <code>onmouseover</code> events.</p>

<p>I have found that when using Opera, Safari and FireFox, the "which" property of the mousemove event object is set to 1 when no mouse button has been clicked.</p>
