<p>There is only two solutions to this problem (and neither is 100% secure even then). Both involve "not storing the key in your application". </p>

<ol>
<li>Let the user type the key in. </li>
<li>Get the key from a server somewhere. </li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure that the server is also encrypted using for example https, or someone can decrypt it by scanning the network packets. </p>

<p>Whatever solution you come up with storing a key locally on the machine will be possible to find by omeone that has access to the executable (or DLL or whatever), there is literally no way around that. You can make it more complicated by "hiding" the key in sevreal places and make complicated calculations, but "security by obscurity" only stops people who are impatient with finding the solution. </p>

<p>And even if you don't store the key, someone running the application could stop in a debugger and examine the key as the decryption happens. There literally is no way to make encryption and decryption (in software, at least) entirely "unbreakable by hiding the key" - the key has to be there during the decryption, so it CAN be found. </p>

<p>It then comes down to "how much effort you are willing to spend on making such a process harder", bearing in mind that if the FBI, NSA, GCHQ, KGB or some such puts 100 of their best people on breaking your code, they probably will, no matter what you have come up with. [In fact, they can probably break it by simply running on many machines that just brute-force it open, because these organisations have large clusters available to them, so if it's important to break, that will be a resource for these organisations]. If you are trying to protect from "John Smith" who uses the application, and isn't particularly computer literate, then storing the decryption key in the application itself is perfectly fine. And in between those positions, you have people who, as a hobby, breaks codes in programs. They will give up before the team of 100 government agency workers, but obviously put more effort and skill into it than "John Smith". </p>
