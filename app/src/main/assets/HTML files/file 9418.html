<p>There seems to be another <code>Chronometer</code> class present that does not extend from <code>View</code>, which is why you can't cast it. It's hard to tell without your code, but did you rename <code>ChronometerDemo.java</code> to <code>Chronometer.java</code>? <code>ChronometerDemo</code> is an Activity, and is not supposed to be returned by a <code>findViewById</code> call.</p>

<p>This is, of course, assuming you're talking about <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/view/ChronometerDemo.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>
