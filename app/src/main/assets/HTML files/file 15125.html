<p>This article explains indexes/exploding indexes quite well, and it actually fits your example: <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queries#Big_Entities_and_Exploding_Indexes" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queries#Big_Entities_and_Exploding_Indexes</a></p>

<p>Your biggest issue will be the fact that you will probably run into the 5000 indexes per entity limit with thousands of items. If you take an index for a, x, items (1000 items), date: |a|<em>|x|</em>|items|*|date| == 1*1*1000*1 == 1000.</p>

<p>If you have 5001 entries in items, the put() will fail with the appropriate exception.</p>

<p>From the example you provided, whether you filter on x, y or anything else seems irrelevant, as there is only 1 of that property, and therefore you do not run the chance of an exploding index. 1*1 == 1.</p>

<p>Now, if you had two list properties, you would want to make sure that they are indexed separately, otherwise you'd get an exploding index. For example, if you had 2 list properties with 100 items each, that would produce 100*100 indexes, unless you split them, which would then result in only 200 (assuming all other properties were non-lists).</p>
