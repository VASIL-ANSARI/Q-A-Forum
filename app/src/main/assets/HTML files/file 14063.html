<p>Because observables are functions and not properties they are represented by a single instance on the object prototype, unlike properties which will be created on the object when they are set. </p>

<p>You could use functional inheritance to achieve what you want.</p>

<pre><code>var User = function(firstName, lastName){
    var that = {};

    that.firstName = ko.observable(firstName);
    that.lastName = lastName;

    return that;
};


var Employee = function(firstName, lastName){
    var that = User();

    that.firstName(firstName);
    that.lastName = lastName; 

    return that;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps. </p>
