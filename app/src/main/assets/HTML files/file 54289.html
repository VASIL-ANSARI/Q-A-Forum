<p>Try something like this maybe (This is assuming that on login and register you set a $_SESSION variable containing their user id or some other identifier):</p>

<pre><code>if(empty($_SESSION['user'])) 
    { 
        // If they are not, redirect them to the login page. 
        header("Location: login.php"); 
        die("Redirecting to login.php"); 
} else 
    {
        include_once("databaseConnection.php");
        $checkAdmin = "SELECT user_role FROM users WHERE id = '".$_SESSION['user_id']."';";
        $result = mysqli_query($conn, $checkAdmin);
        $user_role = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
        if ($user_role == "reader") 
            {
                // User is only a reader, redirecting them to the home page
                header("Location: /");  
                die("You're only a reader and you're not allowed here, redirecting you to the home page!");
        } elseif ($user_role == "editor")
            {
                // User is only an editor, redirecting them to the home page
                header("Location: /");
                die("You're only an editor and you're not allowed here, redirecting you to the home page!");        
        } elseif ($user_role == "editor")
            {
                // User is an admin, allowing them through
        } else
            {
            //Error identifying user's role
            header("Location: /");
            die("Some kind of error occured, show this to the site owner: (User role identification error)");
        }
    }
</code></pre>
