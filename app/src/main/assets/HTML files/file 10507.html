<p>I created a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/dalziel/J8LC4/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle for this</a> it seems to work. They don't have jquery 1.6.1, the demo there is using 1.6.4.  I did need to change <code>jQuery('.catlist')</code> to <code>jQuery('.cats-list')</code> on the 1st line of the javascript, it may have been that which is stopping it from working.</p>
