<p>The <code>delete</code> corresponding to the <code>new</code> has to be accessible too, because the <em>new expression</em> does not only consist of calling the new operator.</p>

<p>Instead, it's like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Call operator new.</li>
<li>Call the constructor.</li>
<li>If the constructor throws, call operator delete.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can work around it by making <em>both</em> <code>protected</code>, and providing a <code>static</code> or free function for allocating them dynamically.</p>

<p>That has the advantage of only restricting dynamic allocation.</p>
