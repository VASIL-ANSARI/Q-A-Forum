<p>I think you have to combine several of these effects in order to make something that resembles  the Landrover site. A Smooth scroll script, a scroll path script and a parallax script.</p>

<p>This is an interesting site for the path element of that website:
<a href="http://joelb.me/scrollpath/" rel="nofollow">http://joelb.me/scrollpath/</a></p>

<p>Though the best way to find out how these sites work is to examine them! Some cool sites useing parallax:
<a href="http://www.awwwards.com/?s=parallax&amp;post_type=all&amp;search=Ok" rel="nofollow">http://www.awwwards.com/?s=parallax&amp;post_type=all&amp;search=Ok</a></p>

<p>I hope this was of some help/inspiration!</p>

<p>Cheers, Robin</p>
