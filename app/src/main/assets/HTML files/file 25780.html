<p>Without actually seeing your website since it's password protected I would suggest something along the lines of the folllowing:</p>

<p>You set a wrapper around your elements, in your case the nav and the video. And then set the CSS for the video and nav to have an auto margin. Which should center it both horizontally and verically. You might want to add a wrapper for the 2 components to keep them nicely stacked together and then put an auto margin on that wrapper, but the below should already work.</p>

<p>Html:</p>

<pre><code>       &lt;div id="container"&gt;
         &lt;div id="nav"&gt;&lt;!-- nav here --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;div id="video"&gt;&lt;!--video here--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>#container {
  width:100%;
  height:100%;
}

#video{
  margin:auto;
}

#nav {
  margin:auto;
}
</code></pre>
