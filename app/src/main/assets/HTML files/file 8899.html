<p>Check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" rel="nofollow">Law of Demeter</a>. It explains why what you're doing is causing problems (no separation of concerns = spaghetti code). Also check out <a href="http://www.simonecarletti.com/blog/2009/12/inside-ruby-on-rails-delegate/" rel="nofollow">ActiveSupport::Delegate</a> to see how you can concisely apply the Law of Demeter to your Rails app and avoid lists of boring getters and setters.</p>

<p>A few notes to help you out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make all your ActiveRecord calls like <code>where</code> in your controller. Your view should have arrays (or ActiveSupport::Proxy's) to simply iterate over and display. You should avoid having your view trigger database queries, and you should never keep record-fetching business logic in them.</li>
<li>Rather than chaining endlessly on your model associations, define or delegate methods from one model to another. For example, instead of <code>@comment.post.title</code>, define and use <code>@comment.post_title</code> instead (note the underscore). This avoids requiring your view to have innate knowledge of your database schema and model associations. It simply needs to know that a comment has a post title, however that data is modeled.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you refactor your code to keep each model focused on a single concern and modeling a single resource, then layer the associations on top of that in a clean, compartmentalized fashion, you will surely obviate the need for someone to solve this single question for you (teach a man to fishâ¦).</p>
