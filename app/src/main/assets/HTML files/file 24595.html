<p>Your equals implementation is obvioiusly wrong. You are returning true if just one element matches. This means, the only time you will get false is, when all entries mismatch one to one.</p>

<p>What you are looking for is to return false, if any corresponding elements do not match and return true at the end of running loop.</p>

<p>You must also return false, if the size of the two stacks are different.</p>
