<p>Those <em>are</em> const-correct signatures.</p>

<p>You almost never write const before pass-by-value arguments.
The function gets its own copy so there's no danger there.</p>

<pre><code>void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t count)
</code></pre>

<p>is const correct too. Only the second pointer promises not to change what it points to. The destination pointer, on the other hand, is all about changing what it points to.</p>
