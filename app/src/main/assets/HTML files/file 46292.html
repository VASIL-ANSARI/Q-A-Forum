<p>I think your query is better written as:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.parentid, childid
FROM parent p INNER JOIN
     child c
     ON p.parentid = c.parentid
UNION ALL
SELECT p.parentid, NULL
FROM parent p;
</code></pre>

<p>That is <code>UNION ALL</code> is better than <code>UNION</code>, because <code>UNION</code> has additional overhead for removing duplicate values.  If you can have duplicates in <code>parent</code>, just use <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> in the second query.</p>

<p>Also, you might want to add an <code>ORDER BY</code> to get results in order the question seems to specify:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY parentid, (CASE WHEN child is NULL then 0 else 1 end), chile
</code></pre>
