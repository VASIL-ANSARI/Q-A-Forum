<p>I added an issue report for this to the issue tracker:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/openstacknetsdk/openstack.net/issues/192" rel="nofollow">#192: Object metadata methods should not change content type</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: This issue has now been fixed and will be part of the 1.2.0.0 release.</p>

<p>Several other issues related to content types have already been fixed for the 1.2.0.0 release:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openstacknetsdk/openstack.net/issues/104" rel="nofollow">Issue #104</a> for the project was resolved for release 1.2.0.0, which adds support for specifying content types in the <code>CreateObject</code>, <code>CopyObject</code>, <code>CreateObjectFromFile</code>, and <code>MoveObject</code> methods.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openstacknetsdk/openstack.net/issues/125" rel="nofollow">Issue #125</a> was also fixed for the 1.2.0.0 release, which ensures that the <code>CopyObject</code> and <code>MoveObject</code> methods <em>preserve</em> the original content type if none is specified.</li>
</ul>
