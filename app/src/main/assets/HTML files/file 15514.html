<p>You have digitally sign your executable. That's the only way to have your name displayed as publisher and change the color of UAC to blue.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140234%28v=office.10%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Digital Code Signing Step-by-Step Guide</a>. The article talks about Office and Smart Tags, yet it can be used a guide to digitally sign other files.</p>

<p>The certificate you use for signing must be <em>trusted</em>, i.e. you have to buy it from a trusted Certificate Authority. If you sign your executable with self-signed certificate as shown in the article, it won't be trusted and nothing will change in the UAC prompt.</p>
