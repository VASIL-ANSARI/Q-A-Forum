<p>..but Javascript has many facets that <strong>are</strong> OO.</p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>var Vehicle = jQuery.Class.create({ 
   init: function(name) { this.name = name; } 
});

var Car = Vehicle.extend({ 
   fillGas: function(){ 
      this.gas = 100; 
   } 
});
</code></pre>

<p>I've used this technique to create page-level javascript classes that have their own state, this helps keep it contained (and I often identify areas that I can reuse and put into other classes).</p>

<p>This is also especially useful when you have components/server controls that have their own script to execute, but when you might have multiple instances on the same page.  This keeps the state separate.</p>
