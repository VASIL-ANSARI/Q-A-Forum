<p>Are you doing <code>include ::KamilHelper</code> in a controller? If so, this includes the methods from the helper into the current class (e.g. the controller), but methods from a controller are not available in a view. <code>add_template_helper</code> makes those methods available to templates rendered <em>from</em> the current controller (by calling <code>include ::KamilHelper</code> inside the modules that are available to the view templates).</p>
