<p>Use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#dynamic-pseudo-classes" rel="nofollow"><code>:active</code></a> pseudo-class:</p>

<pre><code>a.admin:active {
  outline: #00FF00 dotted thick;
}
</code></pre>

<p>No need for any javascript at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: It is pointed out that <code>:active</code> is defined to only work while the mouse is held down. The <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class can be used - it will be active when the link is focused, which it will be after being clicked until something else is selected.</p>
