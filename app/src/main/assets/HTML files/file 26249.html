<p>OK, once more I have the 'blonde moment!'  <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/xrB7H.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>At the Services website  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.groups.leave.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.groups.leave.html</a> it states: <strong><em>Note:</strong> This method requires an HTTP POST request.</em></p>

<p>I haven't yet learned how to format those, but that is for another day, eh?</p>
