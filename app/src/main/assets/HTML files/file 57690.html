<p>Yes, there is an API for that: <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete#place_autocomplete_service" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete#place_autocomplete_service</a></p>

<p>You can use <code>AutocompleteService.getPlacePredictions</code> to get the same predictions as you'd get via the <code>Autocomplete</code> widget, and use it to implement your own UI.</p>
