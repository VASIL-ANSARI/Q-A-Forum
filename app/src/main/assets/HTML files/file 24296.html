<p>Yes, this is causing significant unnecessary overhead, and it is a "bad practice".</p>

<p>Binding your event handling to the top-level document object means that <em>every single click</em> that occurs on any element anywhere in your page will bubble up to the <code>document</code> object, where the event's target is checked to see if it matches <code>.pagination .next</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, the documentation itself recommends against your usage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attaching many delegated event handlers near the top of the document tree can degrade performance. Each time the event occurs, jQuery must compare all selectors of all attached events of that type to every element in the path from the event target up to the top of the document. For best performance, attach delegated events at a document location as close as possible to the target elements. <strong>Avoid excessive use of document or document.body for delegated events on large documents.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you're misusing <code>on</code>. It's for binding directly to elements or to parent elements which may have dynamically created children, and you are meant to bind to the closest possible parent element. Binding to the document is certainly not meant to be the <em>only</em> way you handle events in your page.</p>
