<p>Figured this one out.  After testing product id's on every other device I could find and not being able to recreate the invalid product id error, we removed the app from the bad phone, rebooted, reinstalled and everything is working fine again.</p>

<p>This was on iOS 4.2 and an iPhone 4 if anyone else come across this error again.</p>
