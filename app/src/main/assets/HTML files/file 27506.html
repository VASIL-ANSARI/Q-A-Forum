<p>What that line means is, since the object is immutable, then the <code>hashCode</code> has to only be computed once. Further, it doesn't have to be computed when the object is constructed - it only has to be computed when the function is first called. If the object's <code>hashCode</code> is never used then it is never computed. So the hashCode function can look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override public int hashCode(){
    synchronized (this) {
        if (!this.computedHashCode) {
            this.hashCode = expensiveComputation();
            this.computedHashCode = true;
        }
    }
    return this.hashCode;
}
</code></pre>
