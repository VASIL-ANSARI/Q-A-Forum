<p>If you don't want to distort the image you have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crop the image</li>
<li>Implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving" rel="nofollow">seam carving algorithm</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: this assumes you want to fill up the whole square. If not, just keep the width/height ratio and downscale the image properly so that the largest dimension fits in the side of the square.</p>
