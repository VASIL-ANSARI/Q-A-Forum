<p>OK, Solved!</p>

<p>The problem was (apparently) related to the class path.
I'm new to Eclipse development, so it's getting clearer and clearer for me each day how it works.</p>

<p>To solve similar problems, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add the dependency to your gradle build
<strong><code>compile ("com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310:2.5.1")</code></strong></p></li>
<li><p>You have to refresh your class path. With gradle, to do that, run <strong><code>gradle cleanEclipse &amp;&amp; gradle eclipse</code></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Refresh your eclipse. On mine, I really had to restart it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After this, it did the magic: the <strong><code>LocalDateTimeDeserializer</code></strong> was there for me to import.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don't like my own approach here <em>and</em> I believe that it was too cranky to be correct, so I will leave this question open in case anybody with a clearer understanding of what happened here gets a better answer.</p>

<p>Should serve as reference for those banging head like I were to move on.</p>
