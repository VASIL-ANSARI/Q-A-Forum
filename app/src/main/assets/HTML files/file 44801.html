<p>First I would check if your returned array is empty.  If it is then no matter what you do you are not going to get the information you need out of the query.</p>

<p>If you are getting an error you should probably think about your query class.  You are trying to query on the class "user" whereas I'm guessing you would like to query the built in _User class.  To do that you would use a different kind of query:</p>

<pre><code>PFQuery *query = [PFUser query];
</code></pre>

<p>Try this query type that Parse gives for this exact purpose and see if your returned data has any valid data.  If it does you can either use:</p>

<pre><code>PFUser *user = [userData objectAtIndex:0];
</code></pre>

<p>if you know that there should be only one user object returned to you, or you can use:</p>

<pre><code>for(PFUser *user in userData)
{
    //Do something with the user object that got returned to you
}
</code></pre>
