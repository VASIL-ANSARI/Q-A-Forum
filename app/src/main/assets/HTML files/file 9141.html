<p>Well</p>

<p>I am really far from being an expert but, since a user can belong to more than one group... Have you tried requesting all users with his group and then constructs the group from this. I suggest also to make some profiling to see which method is the bottleneck and have a better idea about how to proceed.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
