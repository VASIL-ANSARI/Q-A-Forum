<p>I also only experienced this issue in the last 12 hours. This issue is not to do with certificates but rather to do with the protocol used to communicate with the timestamp server. This will work with JDK7, however you need to add the following to the jarsigner command</p>

<pre><code>-J-Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, your command will look like:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_80/jre/../bin/jarsigner -J-Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2 -keystore /home/build/keystore.p12 -storepass storepass -storetype pkcs12 -tsa https://timestamp.geotrust.com/tsa /home/build/jenkins/workspace/my-gui/target/my-gui-3.0.29-SNAPSHOT.jar comp
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that GeoTrust have disabled use of TLS version 1.0 which is the default in Java 7. The following links provide more information on this:</p>

<p>Hope this helps. </p>
