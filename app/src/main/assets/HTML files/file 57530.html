<h2><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/configuration#after-installation" rel="nofollow">Naming Your Application</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>After installing Laravel, you may wish to "name" your application. By default, the app directory is namespaced under App, and autoloaded by Composer using the PSR-4 autoloading standard. However, you may change the namespace to match the name of your application, which you can easily do via the app:name Artisan command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, if your application is named "Horsefly", you could run the following command from the root of your installation:</p>

<pre><code>php artisan app:name Horsefly
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Renaming your application is entirely optional</strong>, and you are free to keep the App namespace if you wish</p>
