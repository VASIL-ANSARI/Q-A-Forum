<pre><code>$(".hidden").hide();
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually quite unnecessary.
I'd recommend that you add the following CSS rule instead :</p>

<pre><code>.hidden{
  display : none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that's not all that's wrong with your code, I'll be brutally honest its awful. It would be better if you made some effort learning jQuery.
You can't really expect people here to spend their time optimizing code that was generated by some wizard.</p>

<p>My answer isn't really helpful but you'd need to put in slightly more effort yourself in order to get decent help.</p>

<p>Edit
There seem to be subtle differences in each of your functions making it harder to generalize.
I'll give you a suggestion write a function like</p>

<pre><code>function switch_question(current_question,next_question){
  $('#Q'+current_question).hide();
  $('#results'+current_question).show().hide(10000);
  $('#Q'+next_question).show();
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now instead of changing to the next question by typing the entire thing you could just pass the Question Numbers to the function and call it.</p>

<p>There can be more optimizations of course, you have to refactor code where ever possible.
My apologies for being too hard on you, I thought you'd used some code generation tool.
Hope this is more helpful. </p>
