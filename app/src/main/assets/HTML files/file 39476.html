<p>I haven't tested it, but you could use the Array.contains method like this:</p>

<pre><code>string[] genresToDelete = new[] { "Rock", "Pop" };
db.Albums.DeleteAll(genresToDelete.Contains(db.Albums.Genre));
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not 100% sure how intelligent the statement would be created, but I strongly recommend you to define the array before the statement and just use it (instead of maybe defining it for EVERY record of the table). Plus, I think it's more readable that way :)</p>
