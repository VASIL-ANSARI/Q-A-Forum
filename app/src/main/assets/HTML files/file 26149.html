<p>This isn't fool proof, but looking inside the apk of a Phonegap and a Titanium app I have (renamed .apk to .zip) I notice that for Phonegap the assets folder has a js file named "cordova-" followed by a version number. In the Titanium app there is an org/appcelerator/titanium/build.properties file in it. The folder names already indicate it was built using Titanium and the build.properties file contains the string "#Generated by Titanium".</p>
