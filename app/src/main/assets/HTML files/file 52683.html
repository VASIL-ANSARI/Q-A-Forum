<p>According to the WAMP basic profile spec, it is not possible to register the same procedure more than once per a router's realm. The following code will result with an exception on registration (wamp.error.procedure_already_exists).
In order to achieve something like you want, consider registering a different procedure uri per client. This can be achieved using ICalleeRegistrationInterceptor.</p>
