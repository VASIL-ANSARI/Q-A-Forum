<p>For the first part of your question, you could just use a repeating alarm, or schedule a new alarm whenever one fires like you are doing.  Either way works.</p>

<p>You may also want to setup a broadcast receiver that receives ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED so you can reschedule your alarms when the phone reboots.</p>

<p>As for checking if the alarm exists, the PendingIntent with FLAG_NO_CREATE is exactly how you would do that.</p>
