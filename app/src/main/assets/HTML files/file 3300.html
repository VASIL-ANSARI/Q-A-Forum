<p>The proper way is to elevate when the program starts, with the UAC prompt (which you can set via the program's manifest) - attempting to be clever and bypass it is frowned upon.</p>

<p>Think about it - if you could install something which would elevate automatically without the UAC prompt ... what would be the point of UAC?</p>

<p>To add a UAC manifest to a program you simply add the manifest in a project and edit it. A sample manifest for UAC is <a href="http://brethorsting.com/blog/2007/02/meet_uac_-_creating_a_uac_manifest/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you want to elevate at the last possible moment then you need a spawn separate process - you cannot elevate an existing process. So separate that bit out and then start it using</p>

<pre><code>Process.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = true;
Process.StartInfo.Verb = "runas";
</code></pre>
