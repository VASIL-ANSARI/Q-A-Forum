<p>Supported queries in NCache are listed here;</p>

<p>Above that, <strong>NCache doesn't support <code>NextResult</code> command</strong> but what you can have your own implementation to facilitate your application </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>//Psuedo Code</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Create a list of queries</li>
  <li>Create a wrapper wrapping NCache query Client API</li>
  <li>Execute those queries in an async manner</li>
  <li>Create a <code>NextResult</code> function in your Wrapper</li>
  <li>Perform synchronization on the async threads to block or run on <code>NextResult</code> method (Joins or Mutex.wait e.t.c) to wait for the async query operations methods to return back</li>
  <li>Do what you wanted to do :)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Its a custom implementation. You don't actually need to do it since NCache is completely In-Memory therefore SQL queries should be very fast already.</p>

<p>You could make a feature request though on <a href="http://www.alachisoft.com/forum/index.php/forum/22-ncache/" rel="nofollow">Alachisoft Forums</a></p>
