<p>You could go for a <code>headless browser</code> for example <a href="http://phantomjs.org" rel="nofollow">PhantomJS</a>. I haven't used it, but it should run JS well.</p>

<p>The same restrictions apply though, no filesystem access from JS.
Unless you use something like the plugin framework in FF, in that case you have elevated rights for the scripts.</p>

<p>Besides that you could create a wrapper in php, perl or other language, and pass on the data from JS to them in an ajax call, and they write the txt for you.</p>
