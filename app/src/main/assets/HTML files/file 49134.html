<p>At the first link it says:</p>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important note: The selenium-webdriver gem is updated, and a new
  version released, for every subsequent version of Firefox. Presently,
  version 2.25.0 is needed to support Firefox 15.</p>

<p>But your solutions was:</p>

<pre><code>gem update selenium-webdriver
</code></pre>

<p>...which is not my interpretation of those posts.  My interpretation is NOT that you always need the latest selenium for whatever version of Firefox you are using--rather they are trying to tell you that you need to match a selenium version to a Firefox version.</p>

<p>And in fact, there is an SO question titled:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where can I find a definitive Selenium WebDriver to Firefox
  Compatibility <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13358859/where-can-i-find-a-definitive-selenium-webdriver-to-firefox-compatibility-matrix">Matrix</a>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it looks to me like the latest version of selenium does not support Firefox 42.  You need to install an earlier version of Firefox.</p>
