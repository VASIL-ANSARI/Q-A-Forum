<p>Unfortunately this is not possible.</p>

<p>Looking at the Index constructor (python), we can se that there has been some tries on implementing that in early phases but it never actually worked. Specifying the source of the index has been deprecated for a while now and doesn't work anymore.</p>

<p>Here the constructor pydoc:</p>

<pre><code>class Index(object):
  [...]

  def __init__(self, name, namespace=None, source=SEARCH):
  """Initializer.

  Args:
    name: The name of the index. An index name must be a visible printable
      ASCII string not starting with '!'. Whitespace characters are excluded.
    namespace: The namespace of the index name. If not set, then the current
      namespace is used.
    source: Deprecated as of 1.7.6. The source of
      the index:
        SEARCH - The Index was created by adding documents throught this
          search API.
        DATASTORE - The Index was created as a side-effect of putting entities
          into Datastore.
        CLOUD_STORAGE - The Index was created as a side-effect of adding
          objects into a Cloud Storage bucket.
  [...]
  """
</code></pre>

<p>So, at least for now (?), the only solution, like mentioned by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1201324/tim-hoffman">Tim Hoffman</a>, is to handle your documents and index separately from your datastore data.</p>

<p>You can still file a feature request to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list</a> ans there where that goes.</p>
