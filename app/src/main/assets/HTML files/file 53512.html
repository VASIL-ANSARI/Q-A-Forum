<p>You probably don't need the ScrollView at all.  The ListViews already do the scrolling for you.  Nesting scrolling views isn't recommended. </p>

<p>Try taking out the ScrollView.  Each LinearLayout could take up half the screen, or whatever amount you'd like.  You could also use an ExpandableListView which would allow you to expand and collapse the assignments for today and upcoming days based on their header (Today, Upcoming).  This way you would only need one ListView.  So it would be easier to maintain.</p>
