<p>Output started at (as the error says) <code>/var/www/allci/CIone/application/config/autoload.php on line 1</code>. This means that either autoload.php is a mixed HTML/PHP file (which it probably shouldn't be) or, more likely, autoload.php is has leading white space before it's opening <code>&lt;?php</code> tag.</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;</code> should be <em>the first</em> byte in the file - you need to make sure there are no spaces, tabs, carriage returns etc at the start of the file. You also need to make sure the file does not have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow">BOM</a> at the start of it.</p>
