<p>you need to put the min stuff into a having clause, so your query would be <code>select * from table group by distance having min(distance);</code>
(untested)
or you could use subquerys to find that out:
<code>select * from table where distance = (select distance from table where min(time)) and time = select min(time) from table)</code> (also untested :))</p>
