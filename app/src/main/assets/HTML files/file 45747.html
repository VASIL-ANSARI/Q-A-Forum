<p>There should be no space between <code>img</code> and <code>.pdf</code>. This means an img tag containing an element (or elements) with class <code>.pdf</code>. <code>img.pdf</code> means img tags with this class.</p>

<p>For an id you would just use <code>#pline</code>, there would be no need to use <code>img#pline</code> because id's are unique on the page, and <code>img #pline</code> would be incorrect as described above.</p>
