<p>As some comments have already suggested you will need to do a bit of trial and error with your page layout, page size and report contents to ensure that there is no white space pushing onto other pages.</p>

<p>The easiest way I have found to do this is to use the <code>Print Layout</code> option when previewing the report in Report Builder (In the middle of the Ribbon when viewing the report preview), which previews the report as it would be exported to actual pages.  If it is still not obvious as to why the blank pages are there, you can set different background colours to your report items and report itself to see which colours show on the 'blank' pages.  This will show you whether it is a report item or the report page layout that needs to be adjusted.</p>
