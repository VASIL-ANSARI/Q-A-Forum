<p>They work with any Bluetooth or attached hardware accessory. You just need to get the protocol documentation from the manufacturer. The demo prints to a mini Bluetooth printer.</p>

<pre><code>on printDocket
   mergAccessoryOpenSession "p25i|com.bluebamboo.p25i","sessionOpen"
end printDocket

on sessionOpen pNameAndProtocol
   mergAccessoryWrite pNameAndProtocol,"UfwÃ D"&amp;fld "write","writeCompleted"
end sessionOpen

on writeCompleted pNameAndProtocol
   mergAccessoryRead pNameAndProtocol,0,"readCompleted"
end writeCompleted

on readCompleted pNameAndProtocol,pData
   if byte 5 of pData = numToByte(3) and byte 6 of pData = numToByte(0) then
      answer "print complete"
      mergAccessoryCloseSession pName
   end if
end readCompleted
</code></pre>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>After a fairly lengthy support incident I worked out the problem here. It seems that callbacks from externals are not queued when there's an answer dialog open and they just get lost never to be executed. So don't use answer dialogs when you're expecting callbacks from an external folks. I have opened this thread on the engine forum to see if there is a solution: <a href="http://forums.runrev.com/viewtopic.php?f=66&amp;t=15602" rel="nofollow">http://forums.runrev.com/viewtopic.php?f=66&amp;t=15602</a></p>
