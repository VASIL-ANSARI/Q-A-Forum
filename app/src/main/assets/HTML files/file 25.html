<p>Like everything else it is environmental and depends on the use of the system.  The question you need to ask your self is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will this be actively developed</li>
<li>Is this going to be used over the course of many years and expanded on</li>
<li>Is the expansion of the application unknown and thus infinite</li>
</ol>

<p>Really it comes down to laziness.  How much time to do you want to spend reworking the system from the UI?  Because having no business layer means duplication of rules in your UI across possibility many many pages.</p>

<p>Then again if this is a proof of concept or short demo or class project.  Take the easy way out.</p>
