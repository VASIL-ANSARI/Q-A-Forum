<p>You will need to check for spaces before and after the string in question.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$string = 'cut the grass spread the aftercut and watch the difference after a few days';

$naughtyWords = array("ahole","anus","ash0le","ash0les","asholes","ass","Ass Monkey","Assface"); //etc

foreach ($naughtyWords as &amp;$word) {
    $word=' '.$word.' ';
}

$string = str_replace($naughtyWords, " **** ", ' '.$string.' ');

echo $string;

?&gt;
</code></pre>
