<p>The indentation in your screenshot is different from your question. In your question you claimed your code was this (with some bits trimmed out):</p>

<pre><code>try:
    # Do something
except IOError:
    # Handle error
try:
    # Write to man_data.txt and other_data.txt
except IOError:
    # Handle error
</code></pre>

<p>But your screenshot shows that you actually ran this code:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    # Do something
except IOError:
    # Handle error
    try:
        # Write to man_data.txt and other_data.txt
    except IOError:
        # Handle error
</code></pre>

<p>The whole of the second <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block is within the <code>except</code> clause of the first one, so it will only be executed if there is an exception in the first <code>try</code> block. The solution is to run the code that is in your question i.e. unindent the second <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block so that it is at the same level as the first one.</p>
