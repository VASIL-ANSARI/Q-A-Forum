<p>if your question is about the blue signs with the bikes in them they are referred to as markers and you create them like this</p>

<pre><code> var image = new     google.maps.MarkerImage('http://mymarkerlocation.com/markers/somemarker.png');
 var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
    position: location,
    map: map,
    icon: image,

});
</code></pre>

<p>If however your question is about the top left panel with text and graphics well that's just a div placed on top of the map.</p>
