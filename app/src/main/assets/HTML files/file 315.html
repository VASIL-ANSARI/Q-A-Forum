<p>I've only recently started looking into this type of thing, but i have found that memory profilers can give quite detailed information regarding instances of objects within your application.</p>

<p>Here are a couple that are worth trying:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/Products/ants_profiler/index.htm" rel="nofollow">ANTS Profiler</a></li>
<li><a href="http://memprofiler.com/" rel="nofollow">.NET Memory Profiler</a></li>
</ul>
