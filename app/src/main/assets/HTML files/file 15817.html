<p>There is very little reason to implement a Number class for a double.  The double format already implement Infinity, NaN, and signage as part of the raw basic double type.</p>

<p>Second, you should write your code first aiming for correctness, and then try to optimize later, at which time you can look at factor out specific data structure and rewrite code and algos.</p>

<p>Modern day compilers are typically very efficient in writing good code, and typically does a way better job than most human programmers does.</p>
