<p>That is called PHP's Heredoc syntax. It's there to help you mark up strings without worrying about quotes.</p>

<p>A simpler example would be:</p>

<pre><code>$string = &lt;&lt;&lt;STR_END_DELIMITER
This is some string, I can use ' and " freely, and it wouldn't break the string.
I can also use $variables inside, and they'll evaluate.
When I'm done with the string, I'll need to type STR_END_DELIMITER; on a fresh line, without anything else (not even spaces!)
STR_END_DELIMITER;
do_stuff_with_string($string);
</code></pre>
