<p>It's not mentioned in Sphinx documentation for some reason, but the path to output directory can be easily found as <code>app.outdir</code>. After discovering this fact, it was easy to gather all the filenames I needed: </p>

<pre><code>def process_build_finished(app, exception):    
    if exception is not None:
        return

    target_files = []
    for doc in app.env.found_docs:
        target_filename = app.builder.get_target_uri(doc)
        target_filename = os.path.join(app.outdir, target_filename)
        target_filename = os.path.abspath(target_filename)
        target_files.append(target_filename)

    ...
</code></pre>
