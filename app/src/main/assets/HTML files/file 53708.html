<p>When you declare an auto-implemented property:</p>

<pre><code>public string Name { get; set; } 
</code></pre>

<p>It is <strong>not necessary</strong> to create a backing field. The compiler creates a hidden (inaccessible) backing field for the property on your behalf that can <strong><em>only</em></strong> be accessed through the property's <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> accessors. You don't have to even think about it.</p>

<p>So, from your code above, just remove the fields that are duplicated by auto-implemented properties.</p>
