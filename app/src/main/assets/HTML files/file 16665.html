<p>How have you currently implemented what you have? Your mention of 'cell' makes it sound like you are using a <code>UITableView</code>. You won't manage to make one of those scroll in both directions, you'll need to work with a <code>UIScrollView</code>.</p>

<p>I suggest you watch "Designing apps with Scroll Views" from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2010/" rel="nofollow">WWDC 2010</a>, then "Advanced Scrollview Techniques" from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2011/" rel="nofollow">WWDC 2011</a>. That'll teach you about how you implement tiling and infinite scrolling. </p>

<p>Essentially what you want to do is implement some kind of view recycling yourself, that works like the way UITableView recycles its cells. When things are scrolled off one side of the scroll view, you remove the views for the things that just scrolled off screen and put them in a queue. When things scroll onto the screen, you pull views out of the queue (or create new ones if the queue is empty) and lay those views out in the correct place.</p>

<p>To do the infinite scrolling, you fake it: when your scroll view gets near its edge, you reposition everything inside it, you move the scroll view's content offset to where you've repositioned the views, and then you continue from there: it's all done at once so the user never notices.</p>

<p>The videos will explain these techniques better than I can sum up here: watch those as your first point of call.</p>
