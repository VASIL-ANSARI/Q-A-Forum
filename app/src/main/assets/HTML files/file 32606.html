<p>Error code <strong>data 52e</strong> means invalid credentials supplied.</p>

<p>Please try to remove these attributes <strong>manager-dn="uid=admin,ou=system" manager-password="secret"</strong> 
in the below.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;security:ldap-server url="ldap://192.168.0.88:389" manager-dn="uid=admin,ou=system" manager-password="secret" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And give a try again. These are LDAP administration credentials and are not needed for the user authentication. User authentication are done using the values you supplied during login and spring by default try to Bind to LDAP using the provided details.</p>

<p>Also try to enable debug by including &lt; debug />  tag in your security-app-context.xml and also add log4j.properties. This would give plenty of useful information for debuging.</p>
