<p>Just add an extra field in your database with the expiration date of the link. When the link is clicked you can then check the date to make sure it isn't expired.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>I'm guessing at your column and table names.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT IF (DATEDIFF(date_registered, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) &lt;= 0, 1, 0) AS expired
FROM users
WHERE id = 20
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>expired</code> is 1 then the link is expired. If it is <code>0</code> then it is valid.</p>
