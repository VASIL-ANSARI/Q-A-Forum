<p>phpMyAdmin is a tool for database administration, not for php configurations. So short answer: you can't.</p>

<p>If you don't have access to php.ini, you cannot enable any disabled functions. That would be a security vulnerability.</p>

<p>If you don't need exactly <code>system()</code> but want to execute a given command, you can try one of the following commands that is possibly not disabled:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>exec()</code></li>
<li><code>shell_exec()</code></li>
<li><code>passthru()</code></li>
<li><code>pcntl_exec()</code></li>
<li><code>proc_open()</code></li>
<li><code>popen()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And PLEASE keep in mind to check the given input and don't just execute the command given in the query string.</p>
