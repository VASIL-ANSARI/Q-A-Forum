<p>I suspect you are being asked to produce an implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson%27s_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Peterson's algorithm</a> (or similar). This uses an integer and an array of booleans to implement a mutex, without requiring any platform support for synchronisation/atomic operations.</p>
