<p>Based on your example HTML, you're missing the appropriate infinite scroll setup.</p>

<pre><code>    $container.infinitescroll({
      navSelector  : '#page-nav',    // selector for the paged navigation 
      nextSelector : '#page-nav a',  // selector for the NEXT link (to page 2)
</code></pre>

<p>This part of the code establishes what URL should be grabbed to load the next content. Your example is blank. You need to put in <code>&lt;nav id="page-nav"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;</code> a valid URL for the infinite scroll jquery plugin to access. When it does, it will look at that page's content to append to the current page. You've appropriately configured it to look at the <code>.box</code>, but you don't have a page two to look at!</p>
