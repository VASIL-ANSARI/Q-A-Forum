<p>Your problem has nothing to do with being new to swift; it has to do with not understanding storyboards. If you instantiate HomeViewController, and present it, then that's all you will get. The fact that it's embedded in a tab bar controller and navigation controller in the storyboard is not "known" to this bare controller you just instantiated. You should instantiate the tab bar controller instead, and present it. It will take care of instantiating any of its children, and the navigation controller will take care of instantiating its root view controller.</p>
