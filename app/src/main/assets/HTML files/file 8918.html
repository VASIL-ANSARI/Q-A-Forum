<p>If you are serving the PHP file with a .zip extension, getting the PHP source code for download is expected behaviour - ZIP files do not get parsed by the PHP interpreter by default.</p>

<p>You would have to register the ZIP extension to be parsed by PHP. That is pretty sub-optimal, though; in this case, you can link to the PHP file with the .php extension. The <code>filename</code> header will provide the correct name to the user who downloads the file.</p>

<p>If you are using a .php extension and the source code of your PHP file is served, your server configuration is broken.</p>
