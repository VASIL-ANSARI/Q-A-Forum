<p>As @howderek stated in his comment, dragging the <code>div</code> to the bottom of the page will automatically scroll the page. </p>

<p>But you can use a jQuery Plugin called <a href="https://github.com/martindrapeau/jQueryDndPageScroll" rel="nofollow">jQueryDndPageScroll.</a> Implementing it in your webpage is as simple adding these lines to your code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.dnd_page_scroll.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 $(document).ready(function() {
   $().dndPageScroll();
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This plugin is open-source. So you can see what's going under the hood.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can suggest <strong>W3C</strong> to have a meet to make this cross-browser. Start here <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/" rel="nofollow">https://discourse.wicg.io/</a> . You can start a forum there and if that forum gets a good amount of attention, <strong>W3C</strong> can make it a standard for all browsers. See <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/297879/how-to-suggest-a-specification-to-w3c?noredirect=1#comment618370_297879">this question</a> for more info.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last option is a very lengthy process and there's no guarantee that your suggestion will be implemented as a standard. But if you state your problem clearly and you get attention by others, there is a good possibility of success.</p>
