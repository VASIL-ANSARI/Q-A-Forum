<p>You will have to override the onPause() function which is called everytime you get called you go back to the main menu or whatever. Here is a sample of the docs : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the system calls onPause() for your activity, it technically means your activity is still partially visible, but most often is an indication that the user is leaving the activity and it will soon enter the Stopped state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I advise you to read <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/activity-lifecycle/pausing.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a> carefully to understand the different steps in an activity life and <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidLifeCycle/article.html" rel="nofollow">that link as well</a></p>

<p>Here is how to override your onPause() function : </p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void onPause() {
    //Do something like pausing the timer
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the user goes back to the game, you want the timer to restart and therefore, you'll override the onResume() function :</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void onResume() {
    //Resume the timer
}
</code></pre>

<p>Have a good day !</p>
