<p>You're setting the </p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['counter']= 0; 
</code></pre>

<p>to zero every time the PHP script gets called. Doesn't matter what it was before, this line always resets it back to zero.</p>

<p>Change this to only initialize it if it doesn't already exist. Something like..</p>

<pre><code>if (!isset($_SESSION['counter'])) {
  $_SESSION['counter']= 0; 
}
</code></pre>
