<p>You are mixing C++ and C forms of file input:  </p>

<p>When you write: </p>

<pre><code>    fscanf( file_read, "%s", &amp;array[ i ] );
</code></pre>

<p>the C standard library expects that you provide a pointer to a buffer in which the string read in the file will be stored in form of a C string, that is an array of null terminated characters.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, you provide a pointer to a C++ string.  So this will result in undefined behaviour (most probably memory corruption). </p>

<p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>

<p>If you want to keep using the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fscanf/?kw=fscanf" rel="nofollow">C standard library file i/o</a>, you have to use an interim buffer:  </p>

<pre><code>char mystring[1024];     //for storing the C string
...
        fscanf( file_read, "%1023s", mystring );
        array[ i ] = string(mystring);   // now make it a C++ string
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that the format is slightly changed, in order to avoid risks of buffer overflow in case the file contains a string that is larger than your buffer.  </p>

<p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>

<p>If you learn C++ (looking at your C++ tag and the string header), I'd strongly suggest that you have a look at <strong><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/" rel="nofollow"><code>fstream</code></a></strong> in the C++ library.  It's designed to work very well with strings. </p>

<p>Here how it could look like:  </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    const int size = 11;
    string array[ size ];
    ifstream file_read( "alt.txt");
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; size &amp;&amp; file_read &gt;&gt; array[ i ]; i++ ) //Read
        ;
    file_read.close();
    ofstream file_write("neu.txt");
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++ ) //Write
        file_write &lt;&lt; array[ i ] &lt;&lt;" "; // with space separator 
    file_write.close();
    cout &lt;&lt; "test"&lt;&lt;endl;

    return 0;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, the next thing you should consider, would be to replace classic arrays with vectors  (you don't have to define their size in advance).  </p>
