<p>The way I read that, orientation = 1 is standard (x, y) co-ordinates with (0,0) at the top left</p>

<p>orientation = 2 means that the image has been flipped around the vertical axis so that (0, 0) is now the top right</p>

<p>orientation = 5 means that the image has been rotated 90 degrees clockwise so that (0, 0) is the top right again, but the rows are now vertical</p>

<p>etc etc</p>
