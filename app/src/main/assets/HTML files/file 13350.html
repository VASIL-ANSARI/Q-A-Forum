<p>Without any code to show how you are adding it to the current view, it will be hard for anyone to help you. With that, this is a snipped of code I am using in one of my apps, a modal UITableViewController that displays the MBProgressHUD while updating data.</p>

<pre><code>HUD = [[MBProgressHUD alloc] initWithView:self.view];
[self.view addSubview:HUD];
// Regiser for HUD callbacks so we can remove it from the window at the right time
HUD.delegate = self;
HUD.labelText = @"Creating Company";
HUD.detailsLabelText = @"Please Wait";
// Show the HUD while the provided method executes in a new thread
[HUD showWhileExecuting:@selector(sendNewCompanyInformation) onTarget:self withObject:nil animated:YES];
</code></pre>
