<p>Yes Andrus, it's exactly the same IE9 bug which reference I posted you today: <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=393/bugs/heightauto-works-wrong-in-ie-height100-works-correct/#p22557" rel="nofollow">this bug report</a>. The bug was fixed in the main grid in jqGrid 4.0, but you found one more place where exactly the same problem exist.</p>

<p>To fix the problem I suggest the following. In the View form where the error take place we test whether the value of height of the form is <code>'auto'</code> and the code run under IE9. In the case we will change the setting <code>height: 'auto'</code> to <code>height: '100%'</code>:</p>

<pre><code>grid.jqGrid('navGrid', '#pager', {view: true}, {}, {}, {}, {},
    {
        beforeShowForm: function ($form) {
            if ($.browser.msie &amp;&amp; $.browser.version.slice(0,3) === '9.0' &amp;&amp;
                    $form[0].style.height === 'auto') {
                $form[0].style.height = '100%';
            }
        }});
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://www.ok-soft-gmbh.com/jqGrid/IE9BugInForm.htm" rel="nofollow">the demo</a> demonstrate the bug fix (<a href="http://www.ok-soft-gmbh.com/jqGrid/IE9BugInForm0.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> one can test the bug in IE).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>: I looked in the source code of <a href="http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki%3aform_editing#viewgridrow" rel="nofollow">viewGridRow</a> and found more easy workaround. One should just use (see <a href="http://www.ok-soft-gmbh.com/jqGrid/IE9BugInForm1.htm" rel="nofollow">the demo</a>)</p>

<pre><code>{ dataheight: '100%' }
</code></pre>

<p>setting instead of default <code>dataheight: 'auto'</code> setting. By the way I didn't found in the code of jqGrid any place where the <code>height</code> parameter will be used. It seems, that one should now use <code>dataheight</code> parameter instead.</p>

<p>If I would find enough time I would post the bug to Microsoft as the official support request. My previous expiration was always the same: MS confirmed the bug as confirmed that my request was for free: I don't have to pay for the request. On the other side to create the clear example and to describe the problem one need time. So I should invest my time and "for free". Moreover the bug will be typically not fixed in the current product (IE9) and will be <em>probably</em> fixed in the next version of IE (IE10). In such situation the writing of the bug reports is not really attractive. :-)</p>
