<p>The S3 SOAP API does not support "new" features so the REST API should be used where possible:</p>

<p>IIRC recent versions of Eucalyptus do not support SOAP with S3.</p>

<p>That said, the signature looks good to me so I would check if the client/service hosts have the correct time, if there is a difference of more than 15 minutes authentication would fail.</p>

<p>You could also check the cloud-error.log on the Walrus service host as there may be more details on the failure there.</p>
