<p>If you are getting a Heroku message, then your DNS is still pointing to Heroku.  There is no Heroku setting that could cause it to take control unless your DNS is sending traffic there.</p>

<p>If <strong>http://something.nl</strong> is working, but <strong>http://www.something.nl</strong> is not, then you probably didn't change all of your DNS settings properly.</p>

<p>The only other option I can think of is that your webserver on your VPS is routing traffic from www to the Heroku app, that is very unlikely though.</p>

<p>Last option... wait longer for DNS propagation if everything is correct.</p>
