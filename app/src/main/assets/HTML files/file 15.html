<p>Flash is certainly the most ubiquitous and portable solution.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#Market_share">98% of browsers</a> have Flash installed.  Other alternatives are <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">Quicktime</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/default.mspx">Windows Media Player</a>, or even <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> (Microsoft's Flash competitor, which can be used to embed several video formats).</p>

<p>I would recommend using Flash (and it's FLV video file format) for embedding your video unless you have very specific requirements as far as video quality or DRM.</p>
