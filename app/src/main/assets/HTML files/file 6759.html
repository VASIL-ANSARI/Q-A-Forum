<p>Oliver,</p>

<p>If you use the "FORMAT EXCEL" option, it will output the rows with the column name in the first row.  Then once you get it into excel you can save it into another format if you need to.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM SOMETABLE;
OUTPUT TO 'C:\temp\sometable.xls' FORMAT EXCEL DELIMITED BY ';' QUOTE ''
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
