<p>SIM number is not compulsory to be there, it's upto the Telecom if they put number inside the SIM card. It's mostly happen they do it for POSTPAID SIM cards, mostly SIMs do not have number so in that case they return null and if it has, it shall return that NUMBER as it is. To make sure your SIM has number or not, do check that in your android mobile settings.</p>
