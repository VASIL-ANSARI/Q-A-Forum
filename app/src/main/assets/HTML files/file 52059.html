<p>"Form inputs with the disabled attribute are not suppose to send by the client." &lt;= <strong>this is not correct.</strong> </p>

<p>"disabled" does <strong>NOT</strong> mean "do not send to the server". It means "do not allow user to interact with". </p>

<p>If you want the value not to be sent back to the server, then you'll need to remove the element from the tree. </p>
