<p>If you're checking on an iPhone 3GS then you probably don't need an iPod Touch as well. Although it wouldn't hurt as a secondary testing device.</p>

<p>I think either the iPad 2 or iPhone 4 would be good alternatives.. I know the iPhone 4 includes retina display so you'll be working at 326dpi. Much higher resolution for graphics and UI elements than previous iPhone and iPod Touch generations.</p>
