<p>Your proposed solution is a really awkward way of doing things.</p>

<p>Allow me to present this idea instead.</p>

<p>First, make your website work without any JavaScript at all.  That way, your pagination buttons will lead to real content and real data.  This will make Google (and other users happy.)</p>

<p>Enclose the comments in a <code>div</code> or possibly a <code>section</code> element.  Choose a ID at random, I'd call it <code>comments.</code></p>

<p>Then, add some JavaScript to your pagination buttons and use Ajax to go out and just the next set of comments.  Go ahead and replace <code>#comments</code> with the new content.  You can either use a separate API on your server, or you can pass it a parameter which means "just the comments, no body."</p>
