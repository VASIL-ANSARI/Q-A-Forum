<p>Is your system possibly <em>underdetermined</em>? If it is not, and there is actually a solution, then the least squares solution will be that solution, so you can try</p>

<pre><code>from scipy.sparse.linalg import lsqr
return_values = lsqr(A, b)
x = return_values[0]
</code></pre>

<p>If your system is actually underdetermined, this should find you the minimum L2 norm solution. If it doesn't work, set the parameter <code>damp</code> to something very small (e.g. <code>1e-5</code>).</p>

<p>If your system is <em>exactly</em> determined (i.e. <code>A</code> is of full rank) and has a solution, and your matrix <code>A</code> is tall, as you describe it, then you can find an equivalent system in the normal equations:</p>

<pre><code>A.T.dot(A).dot(x) == A.T.dot(b)
</code></pre>

<p>has a unique solution in <code>x</code>. This is a square linear system and is thus solvable using linear system solvers such as <code>scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve</code></p>
