<p>I got the answer, spending a lot of time on it, It will give that exception(IOException read past EOF):</p>

<pre><code>If Directory does not give write permission
If someone else is using(locked)
If some segment is corrupted
</code></pre>

<p>For my case It was corrupted :(. But Exception does not say anything about this(Could tell some <code>FIleCurroptedException</code>). This is may help to someone else. </p>
