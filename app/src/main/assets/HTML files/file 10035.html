<p>Well,</p>

<p>At last I discovered why I was getting a signature over the certificate as well. It was because of the this line of code:</p>

<pre><code>    sec.EndpointSupportingTokenParameters.Signed.Add(new X509SecurityTokenParameters());
</code></pre>

<p>Removing this line resulted in the correct message (whith only 1 reference element with then signature).</p>
