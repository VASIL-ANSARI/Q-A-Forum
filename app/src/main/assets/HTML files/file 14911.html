<p>You didn't mention the file encodings, so I'm sticking with the UTF-8 defaults here.</p>

<p>One option is the 'regular' method of a loop that reads, checks, and conditionally writes, like this:</p>

<pre><code>var inputFilePath  = @"C:\temp\input.txt";
var outputFilePath = @"C:\temp\output.txt";

using (var reader = File.OpenText(inputFilePath))
using (var writer = File.CreateText(outputFilePath))
{
    string line;
    while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
    {
        var isValidLine = CheckLine(line);
        if (isValidLine)
        {
            writer.WriteLine(line);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since you tagged this VS2008, I'm guessing that means you're limited to .NET 3.5, but on 4.0 or later, you can read and write enumerables and then leverage that (in .NET 3.5 you'd have to read all the lines into memory, filter, then write all the lines).</p>

<pre><code>var inputFilePath  = @"C:\temp\input.txt";
var outputFilePath = @"C:\temp\output.txt";

var inputLines = File.ReadLines(inputFilePath);

var linesToWrite = inputLines
    .Where(line =&gt; IsLineValid(line));

File.WriteAllLines(outputFilePath, linesToWrite);
</code></pre>
