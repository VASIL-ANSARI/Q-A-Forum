<ul>
<li><p>Static memory allocation: the lifetime of the variable is automatic, i.e. the compiler is responsible to create and destroy the variable at very specific points in the program (when the variable gets created / goes out of scope)</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic memory allocation: the creation and destruction of the object is handled by the programmer and can happen at any point in the execution of the program</p></li>
<li><p>stack: usual implementation on usual systems by usual compilers of the static memory allocation (and other things)</p></li>
<li><p>heap: usual implementation on usual systems by usual compilers for dynamic memory allocation</p></li>
</ul>

<p>stack and heap are compiler handled memory zones in the address space of the program.</p>
