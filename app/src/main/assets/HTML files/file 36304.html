<p>Odd that you showed everything but the getBDocumentsCollection mapping that is causing you problems, or the code used to set the relationships.  But since you are saying the database is populated correctly and this is a bidirectional relationship, it is a fairly common mistake to only populate one side of the relationship.  When you set the BDocuments.bEventId with a BEvents instance, you must also add that BDocuments instance to the BEvents.BDocumentsCollection to keep the relationship in synch with the database.  JPA does not maintain relationships for you, so you either set both sides, or constantly refresh the object from the database when the transaction commits using em.refresh or provider specific api.  Since refreshing has additional overhead, it is much better to just always keep both sides in sync.</p>
