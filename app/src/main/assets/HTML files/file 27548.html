<p>it looks as though you are missing the <code>exec</code> command on your <code>SqlQuery</code> which would execute the stored procedure rather than try to query a table by that name.</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>Case case1 = Context.Database.SqlQuery&lt;Case&gt;(
             "exec spCasesAdd @UserProfileID, @Title", userID, Title)
             .FirstOrDefault();
</code></pre>
