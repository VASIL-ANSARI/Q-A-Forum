<p>What you're looking for are object id's.  For any referenc type in the debugger you can right click and say "Make Object ID".  This will add a # suffix to the value column whenever that instance is displayed in the debugger.  You can also add #1, #2, etc ... to the watch window to see them again any time later.  </p>

<p>Step 0 - Run this code</p>

<pre><code>static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var x = "a string";
    var y = x;
    System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Step 1 - Right Click and select "Make Object Id"</p>

<p>Step 2 - Instances now display with the 1# suffix.  Note: I did nothing special in this step.  Immediately after clicking "Make Object Id" <em>both</em> rows updated to display the 1# suffix since they refer to the same instance.  </p>

<p>Step 3 - See them at any time by adding 1# to the watch window</p>
