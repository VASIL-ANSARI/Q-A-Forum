<p>Looks like you have everything pretty much correct. You referred to the Rigidbody correctly to turn off the gravity, but then tried referring to the rigidbody incorrectly to add force.</p>

<p>Do GetComponent().AddForce (new Vector2(1,4), ForceMode.Impulse);</p>

<p>I don't see why that wouldn't work. Take out the '//' of course. 
Also, for optimization purposes, you can store the rigidbody in awake or start, than use the variable instead of using GetComponent several times. </p>

<p>something like rb = GetComponent();
then you can just use rb.AddForce(). </p>

<p>Hope it helps! If it does, if you can mark it as the correct answer and upvote, do others know it has been answered :). </p>
