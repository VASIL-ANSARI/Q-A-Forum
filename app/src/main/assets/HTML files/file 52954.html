<p>This is not what <code>jsonpickle</code> is for. <code>pickle</code> and <code>jsonpickle</code> are used to serialize an arbitrary Python object into some format so that it can later be deserialized into the exact same Python object. They are not used for serialization of objects according to a particular schema.</p>

<p>For your case, you have to write the serialization logic yourself. Example:</p>

<pre><code>obj = lst[0]
serialized_obj = {k: getattr(obj, k) for k in ["name", "fullname", "password", "id"]}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll have to handle any special types as well. You can even get fancy and try to reflect what columns are on the model automatically.</p>

<p>By the way, is that passwords stored in plaintext I see?</p>
