<p>Ternary operators are tricky thing in PHP, as they are left-associative (unlike all other languages, where it's right-associative). You will need to use parenthesis to tell PHP what you want exactly in this case:</p>

<pre><code>echo ($projectURL ? $projectURL : ($project['project_url'] ? $project['project_url'] : $project['project_id']));
</code></pre>
