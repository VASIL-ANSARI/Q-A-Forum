<p>I'm not sure if Python has any cross-platform solution for this, but if you are only interested in Windows-based solutions, you should look into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365261%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">directory change notifications</a>.  To call the Win32 API functions, you can look into <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/" rel="nofollow">pywin32</a>.</p>

<p>On Linux, there seems to be a bunch of solutions, including <a href="http://stefan.buettcher.org/cs/fschange/index.html" rel="nofollow">fschange</a>, <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/dnotify" rel="nofollow">dnotify</a> and <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/7/inotify" rel="nofollow">inotify</a>.  I'm not sure which one is the recommended solution, but inotify seems to be the most complete solution.</p>

<p>Not all platforms have such a feature.  If it's not available for a given platform, you'll have to emulate such notifications by checking directory contents periodically.</p>
