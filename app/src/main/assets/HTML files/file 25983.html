<p>The limitation might just be ease of parsing, since <code>.</code> or <code>#</code> don't show up as the first character of a normal style rule the parser automatically knows that those should be mixed in.</p>

<p>You could get around it by defining <code>.c1</code> as a mixin and using it for both <code>button</code>s:</p>

<pre><code>.c1() {
    // c1 rules
}

button.c1 {
    .c1;
}

button.c2 {
    .c1;
    // additional rules
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, coming up in LESS 1.4.0 are <code>:extend</code> selectors, which <em>will</em> allow you to do what you want. The syntax would be:</p>

<pre><code>button.c2:extend(button.c1) {
    // additional rules
}
</code></pre>
