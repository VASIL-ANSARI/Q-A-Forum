<p>In case anyone has the same problem I answer my own question as I found a solution now that works for me.</p>

<p>I am simply doing a 'detour' now using PowerShell scripts. There is a nice article about how you can run PowerShell from C# here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18229/How-to-run-PowerShell-scripts-from-C" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18229/How-to-run-PowerShell-scripts-from-C</a></p>

<p>Included in the System.Management.Automation there is the class Runspace which can be used to call PowerShell scripts. Now in my case such a 'script' is not more than this:</p>

<pre><code>grunt build
</code></pre>

<p>You get back some escape codes for coloring the output which you can remove by calling it like:</p>

<pre><code>grunt --no-color build
</code></pre>
