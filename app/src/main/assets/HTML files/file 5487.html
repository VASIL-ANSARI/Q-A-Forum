<p>My company is employing MVCContrib portable areas to package the code into a DLL for reusable "components"</p>

<p>Each of these components can be called via an extension method. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Html.Components().ShowPoll();
</code></pre>

<p>Within each of these components, there is a way to register multiple css/js files that are embedded resources. Our main site will extract the resource files and minify + combines them before serving it.</p>

<p>The component will also register any on page event that will be called during the Document.OnReady event of JQuery. This allows each of the components to be mini-sites, standalone functionality with its own routes, models, and views.</p>

<p>Across the entire site, the same zip up JS for all the components are served. One because the file will be cached, and two - removes the complexity of determining what components are on the page and the resources it needs.</p>

<p>Let me know if you want more information regarding this setup.</p>
