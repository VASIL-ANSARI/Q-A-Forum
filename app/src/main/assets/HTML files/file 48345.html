<p>If you have a directory called <code>/engineering</code> then mod_dir (depending on the setting of <code>DirectorySlash</code>) will automatically append a slash (to "fix" the URL) and thus request <code>/engineering/&lt;DirectoryIndex&gt;</code> and not <code>/engineering.php</code> (which you would like to internally rewrite to according to your .htaccess rules - this doesn't happen).</p>

<p>If the directory index file (eg. <code>index.php</code>) does not exist then you'll get a 403 - which is what seems to be happening here.</p>

<p>The solution would be to remove/rename the <code>/engineering</code> directory, or set <code>DirectoryIndex Off</code> in .htaccess (although the default setting is <code>On</code>).</p>
