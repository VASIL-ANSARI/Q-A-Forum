<p>The server that serves the actual MP4 video to the iPad must support the HTTP header called <code>byte-range</code>.</p>

<p>I would try using an alternate video source from another server, as a proof-of-concept to see if this is the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Here is an MP4 video served with the <code>byte-range</code> header: <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com/media/echo-hereweare.mp4" rel="nofollow">http://mediaelementjs.com/media/echo-hereweare.mp4</a></p>
