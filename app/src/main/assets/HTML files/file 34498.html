<p>I think you need create php script, which will execute some tot big part of process and send json with %. Also percents need to be stored in session. In browser you will invoke ajax till get some error or result 100%. After you got answer from server, if percents&lt;100 -> show new percent line to customer and do the same request to server..</p>
