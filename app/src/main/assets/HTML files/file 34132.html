<p>To clarify:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a name starts with one underscore, it is 'protected'.</li>
<li>If a name starts with two underscores but does not end with two underscores, it is 'private'.</li>
</ul>

<p>'Protected' is just a convention, but syntax checkers do nag about accessing them outside the class hierarchy.</p>

<p>'Private' is implemented by name mangling, so that the element can only be used from within the class where it was defined. The two underscores are replaced with <code>_&lt;name of class&gt;__</code>. There are tricks to circumvent this...</p>

<p>That said, what is the warning you get? In the example below, pylint does not warn me for using _func inside the Test class, but I do get a warning (W0212) at the last line. Did you forget to define the protected function in the base class?</p>

<pre><code>class Test(object):
  ''' . '''
  def _func(self):
    ''' . '''
    raise NotImplementedError()
  def fun(self):
    ''' . '''
    self._func()

class Demo(Test):
  ''' . '''
  def _func(self):
    ''' . '''
    print 'Hi'

t = Demo()
t._func()
</code></pre>
