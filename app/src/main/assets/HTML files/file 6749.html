<p>Not a real programming problem I find, but I'll answer anyway.</p>

<p>From a quick look I would try two things:
Assuming your time unit is days, at the moment you seem to be evaluating what the situation is after day 1 (correct me if I'm wrong here). For the case you're presenting I think you want to know the evolution over several days. So you have to increase your number of loops or perhaps your timestep (but be careful with that)</p>

<p>Second, you seem to have a mistake here: c * x * i / N... should that not be (c*x*i)/N? Check if that makes a difference. And I think you can check by the fact that S' + I' + R' should = 0... </p>

<p>Once again, I did not check this very deeply, but just have a look and let me know if it changes anything.</p>
