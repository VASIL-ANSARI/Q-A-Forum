<p>You haven't found a bug in the SQL parser. You're simply trying to run SQL Server code in MySQL.</p>

<hr>

<p>The SQL acronym refers to a computer language used to query relational databases. Products that can speak SQL often include SQL on their names (MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL...) but that's all, a name. The term itself represents a <em>language</em>, not a specific product.</p>

<p>The SQL language is useful because it doesn't belong to a single vendor. However, each vendor implements its own dialect. You simple cannot run arbitrary SQL on an arbitrary system.</p>

  <p>the hosting provider said MSSQL is enabled, just not very popular</p>

<p>MSSQL is <strong>not</strong> an option inside MySQL. It's an entirely different piece of software.</p>
