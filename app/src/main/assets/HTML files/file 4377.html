<p>Yes, and it's called.... <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28286/statements_9016.htm" rel="nofollow">MERGE</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The only way to get this water tight is to insert, catch the dup_val_on_index exception and handle it appropriately (update, or insert other record perhaps). This can easily be done with PL/SQL, but you can't use that.</p>

<p>You're also looking for workarounds. Can you catch the dup_val_on_index in Java and issue an extra UPDATE again?</p>

<p>In pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>try {
  // MERGE
}
catch (dup_val_on_index) {
  // UPDATE
}
</code></pre>
