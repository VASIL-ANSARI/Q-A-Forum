<p>You could use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#contains%28java.lang.CharSequence%29" rel="nofollow"><code>String#contains</code></a> instead.</p>

<pre><code>String first = "Set Temperature";
String second = "Set Temperature (C)";

if(second.contains(first)) {
    // logic
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ordering is important - note that if you reverse the call between first and second, it will fail, since first does not contain any characters such as <code>" (C)"</code>.</p>
