<p>There is no performance penalty incurred in the form of extra loads or anything like that. Once a browser has loaded an image the first time, it has the image in memory and doesn't need to load it again every time it's referenced in a stylesheet.</p>

<p>Setting just the <code>background-position</code> property simply makes it clear that all that's really changing is the background position. It's not necessary to repeat the rest of the values (image, repeat, attachment) if they're not going to change in the <code>:hover</code> and <code>:active</code> states.</p>
