<p>If you want to store, for example, 10 items, you could do it one of two (or many other) ways....</p>

<ol>
<li>Store the items sequentially in memory, like a normal array. The advantage is it's very quick to reach any offset (multiply the data size by the offset), but the size is not flexible. If you then want 11 items, it's not simple to place it at the end (that memory may be something else important).</li>
<li>Store them in different parts of memory, but have each item know where to find the next (and sometimes the previous). This means you don't need to know a size up front, but it means reaching any offset means the chain of links must be followed. This is known as a linked list.</li>
</ol>
