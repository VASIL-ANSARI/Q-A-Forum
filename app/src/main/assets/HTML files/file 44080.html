<p>As per current documentation, you can't but you could build an array holding all the individual types of an <code>UIActivityCategory</code> and pass it to the <code>excludedActivityTypes</code> property.</p>

<p>If you fear that over time Apple could add new activity types and your <code>UIActivityViewController</code> will show the new types, fear not because it will not happen unless you update the app using the new SDK. So you're safe in this regard.</p>
