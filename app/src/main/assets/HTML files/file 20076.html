<p>It's because you are calling <code>OnPropertyChanged();</code> after you <code>return _plcIp;</code>.</p>

<p>It should be called after you set the value. i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>public string plcIp
{
    get
    {
        return _plcIp;
    }
    set
    {
        if (value != _plcIp)
        {
            _plcIp = value;
            OnPropertyChanged();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should also check that the value is actually changing in the setter before raising the event.</p>
