<p>It is useful if there are multiple instances of <code>tour</code> elements inside the page, then when a particular <code>input</code> elements value is changed we need to find out the daily price for the corresponding tour. In that case if you use <code>$('.tour')</code> it will always give the price of the very first tour instead of the one whose input value is changed. In that case we need to find out the <code>tour</code> element which is the ancestor of the element in question that is the reason for using <code>.closest()</code>.</p>

<p>If you are sure that there will never be more than one <code>tour</code> element in the page then there is no need to use <code>.closest()</code></p>
