<p><em>ID</em> is just another attribute belonging to the entity <strong>Product</strong> as defined by <a href="http://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc/%24metadata" rel="nofollow">the service's schema</a>. Like Product's other attributes defined in the schema (<em>Name</em>, <em>Description</em>, <em>ReleaseDate</em>, etc.) there isn't a guarantee of uniqueness, unless the attribute is also defined as the entity's Key. In this case <em>ID</em> is in fact Product's Key, so we know <em>ID</em> will be unique for all Product entities.</p>

<p>In the same schema the <strong>Category</strong> entity also has a property <em>ID</em>, which serves as that entity's Key. This means that each Product will have an <em>ID</em> value unique among all Products, and each Category will have an <em>ID</em> value unique among all Categories.</p>

<p>To illustrate this a bit better, try this query out at <a href="http://services.odata.org/ODataAPIExplorer/ODataAPIExplorer.html" rel="nofollow">the OData API explorer</a> to show the Categories belonging to each Product:<br>
<code>http://services.odata.org/V3/OData/OData.svc/Products?$expand=Categories</code></p>
