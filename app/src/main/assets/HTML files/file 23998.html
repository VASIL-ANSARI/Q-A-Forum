<p>You shouldn't use hardcoded pixel values. The easiest way to get around this problem is to declare a <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/more-resources.html#Dimension" rel="nofollow">dimension</a> in an xml resource file. Then in your code you can do:</p>

<pre><code>  width = getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(R.dimen.popup_width);
</code></pre>

<p>That will get you the number of pixels adjusted according to the density. You should figure out how many DPs each of your buttons is and declare the resource accordingly.</p>
