<p>When I run the tests as a single run, it would say aborted due to warnings. There were some warnings about the some tests doing a full page reload. So, I removed tests for two functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Request Desktop Version: adds a cookie and reloads the page to get only desktop styles.</p></li>
<li><p>Request Mobile Version: removes the cookie and reloads to get mobile styles</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After removing these, I get a consistent number of tests completed with the message "Done, without errors."</p>
