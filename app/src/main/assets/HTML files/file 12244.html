<p>Follow this pattern to avoid problems:</p>

<p>1) Allocate a <code>new</code> object/struct holding the information the new thread needs.</p>

<p>2) Call <code>pthread_create</code> passing it a pointer to the new object.</p>

<p>3) When the thread is done accessing the information, <code>delete</code> the object/struct.</p>

<p>If you pass a thread a pointer to something, you must make sure that pointer remains valid (and its contents unmodified unless synchronized) until the new thread is done with it.</p>
