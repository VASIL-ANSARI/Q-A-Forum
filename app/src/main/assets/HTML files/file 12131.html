<p>The following line doesn't really make sense:</p>

<pre><code>public Static Main
</code></pre>

<p>Is this a class? An Interface?</p>

<p>Even if you change it to a static class, you are using variables without declaring them, and trying to execute code outside of any method body.</p>

<p>What exactly do you want that block of code to do?</p>
