<li>Creating a Cursor from a Bitmap is described here <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5220/Creating-a-color-cursor-from-a-bitmap" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5220/Creating-a-color-cursor-from-a-bitmap</a> 
Converting a png into a Bitmap can be done easily with CImage. Simply load the PNG and Detach the HBITMAP. But a Bitmap alone is no Cursor.</li>
<li>Cursors are set by the window that receive WM_SETCURSOR. So "replacing" a specific Cursor will not work. You have to intercept the WM_SETCURSOR message to change the cursor that should be returned.</li>
<li>Your Edit2 is wrong because you Need a valid window handle to change the cursor in the class of a window. But this will never work, ifthe window handles the Cursor by ist own (see 2)</li>
</ol>

<p>PS: It would be better to inform yourself how Windows handles Cursors before you ask how to Change it globally...</p>
