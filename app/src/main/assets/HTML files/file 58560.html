<p>Your issue is you aren't using <code>&lt;ui-view&gt;</code> and have the template for that route right in the page using an <code>ng-controller</code>.</p>

<p>Then you use index.html as the template for the route. </p>

<p>In effect you have 2 instances of the controller and the app is not set up correctly at all regarding routing</p>

<p>The main ng-controller instance that runs within index.html will run regardless of the route and that's why it's not waiting for $stateParams or the route change</p>

<p>Set the page up as per router docs with it's own template and only a <code>&lt;ui-view&gt;</code> in index.html</p>
