<p>Django does not print any errors to the console by default. Instead it provides very helpful error pages that are displayed for any errors that occur in your views. Please check what your <code>DEBUG</code> setting is set to. In development this should be <code>True</code> which will give you the nice error pages for 404 and 500 errors.</p>

<p>The pretty error page will look like this:

<p>I can also recommend the talk <a href="http://djangocon.blip.tv/file/3039902?filename=Robertlofthouse-WhatTheHeckWentWrong676.flv"><em>What the Heck Went Wrong?</em></a> from DjangoCon2009 for some more information on basic debugging technics with django.</p>
