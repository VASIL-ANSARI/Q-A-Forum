<blockquote>
  <p>The BackgroundWorker class allows you to run an operation on a
  separate, dedicated thread. Time-consuming operations like downloads
  and database transactions can cause your user interface (UI) to seem
  as though it has stopped responding while they are running. When you
  want a responsive UI and you are faced with long delays associated
  with such operations, the BackgroundWorker class provides a convenient
  solution.</p>
