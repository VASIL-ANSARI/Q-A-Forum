<p>You should make sure you close the files you're opening. You can use a <code>with</code> context, which will automatically close the file when it goes out of scope:</p>

<pre><code>bucket = '/[bucketname]'
filename = bucket + '/dailyData'+datetime.datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')+'.zip'
gcs_stats = gcs.stat(filename)
logging.info(gcs_stats)
with gcs.open(filename,'r') as gcs_file:
  with zipfile.ZipFile(gcs_file, 'r') as zip_file:
    logging.info("zip file loaded")
</code></pre>
