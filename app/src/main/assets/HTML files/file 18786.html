<p>There is a <code>#ifndef STD_</code> around the definition. Do you know what defines are passed by your compiler/other includes ?</p>

<p>One way to find out it to turn up the verbosity of the preprocessor to see all the code which is parsed. Maybe that will give you some insight why that is being skipped.</p>

<p>With gcc that would be <code>gcc -E</code> to stop after preprocessing and dump the parsed content. You might want to find the option for your compiler if you use a different one.</p>
