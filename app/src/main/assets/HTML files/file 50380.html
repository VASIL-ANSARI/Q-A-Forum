<p>I would have a flag to disable the event with will be false by default.</p>

<p>inside the event check if flag is false, then perform the zoom operation, set flag to true and reset cursor.</p>

<p>then the event will be called again and the flag will be true, so you set flag to false and you will be ready to handle the next event.</p>

<p>You just have to make sure you dont have two or more calls to the mouse event firing from the actual mouse before receiving the event from the setCursor call.</p>
