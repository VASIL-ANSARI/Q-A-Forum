<p><code>HTML::image()</code> generates absolute path to image, like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://yoursite.dev/image.png
</code></pre>

<p>which works perfectly in your local environment.</p>

<p>Mail client, as Gmail, will override image path with something like this: </p>

<pre><code>http://images.gmail.com/?src=http://yoursite.dev/image.png
</code></pre>

<p>Obviosly 3rd party service can't access your local domain and so you see broken image.</p>

<p>As a solution, you can upload images to 3rd party service like Amazon AWS and pass link to uploaded image to email template.  </p>
