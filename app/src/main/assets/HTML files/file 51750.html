<p>I Found the solution....</p>

<p>The reason why the connection listeners not getting called is i have been settings the connection listener to xmpp connection object after connection established. That is my previous code was,</p>

<pre><code>mXmppConnection.connect();
mXmppConnection.login();
mXmppConnection.addConnectionListener(this);
</code></pre>

<p>I have replaced this code with:</p>

<pre><code>mXmppConnection.addConnectionListener(this);
mXmppConnection.connect();
mXmppConnection.login();
</code></pre>

<p>And all the callback is getting fired.... !!!</p>
