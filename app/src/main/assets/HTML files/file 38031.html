<p>The answer depends on a target platform for your program. Traditionally, a C- or C++-program begins its life from <code>main(....)</code> function which may have <em>byte-oriented</em> strings passed as arguments (notice <code>char*</code> in main declaration <code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])</code>). Byte-oriented strings mean that characters in a string are passed in a specific byte-oriented encoding and one character, for example <code>Ð¯</code> or <code>Ã</code> in <code>UTF-8</code> may take more than 1 <code>char</code>.</p>

<p>Nowadays the most wide used encoding on Linux/Unix platform is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" rel="nofollow">UTF-8</a>, but some time ago there were other encodings in use such as ISO8859-1, KOI8-R and a lot of others. Most of programs are still byte oriented as UTF-8 encoding is <em>mostly</em> backward-compatible with all traditional C strings API.</p>

<p>In other hand wide strings can be more convenient in use, because each character in a widestring uses a predefined space. Thus, for example, the following expression passes assertion test: <code>std::wstring hello = L"ÐÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑ!Â¡Hola!"; assert(L'Ð²' == hello[3]);</code> (if UTF-8 char strings are used the test would fail). So if your program performs a lot of operations on <em>letters</em>, not strings as a whole, then widestrings can be the solution.</p>

<p>To convert strings from multi-byte to a wide character encoding, you may use <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/mbtowc/" rel="nofollow">mbtowc</a> functions family or that awesome fancy <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/codecvt/" rel="nofollow">codecvt</a> C++-11 facility if your compiler supports it (likely it doesn't as of mid-2014 :))</p>

<p>In Windows strings are also <em>can</em> be passed as byte-oriented strings, and for Russian most likely CP1251 is used (depends on Operating system settings, but for Windows sold within Russia and CIS this is the most popular variant). Also MSVC has a language extension which allows an application programmer to avoid all this complexity with manual conversion of bytestring to widestrings, and use a variant of <code>main()</code> function which <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6wd819wh.aspx" rel="nofollow">instantly receives widestrings</a></p>
