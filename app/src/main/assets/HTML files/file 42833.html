<p>The best practice  is to leave the stored procedures in the database and just execute them. This allows the server to cache the execution plan, but more importantly allows you to run the cron job with limited user privileges only requiring execute permissions. Your first option requires permissions to drop and edit procedures and that is generally not a good idea, especially if this a production server. A bug in this code could result in other procedures that are unrelated to this cron job being dropped. </p>
