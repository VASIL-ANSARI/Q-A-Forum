<p>You need to assign an <em>instance</em> of the <code>ClockPicker</code> to <code>delegate</code> and <code>dataSource</code> (not the class itself).</p>

<p>The error you're getting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unexpected interface name ClockPicker expected expression</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...is saying that the compiler expected the righthand side of an assignment to be an expression, but you gave it the name of an interface, which is an error.</p>
