<p>You are using the colors on the wrong object.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://fullcalendar.io/docs/event_rendering/eventRender/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>event</strong> is the Event Object that is attempting to be rendered.</li>
  <li><strong>element</strong> is a newly created jQuery element that will be used for rendering. It has already been populated with the correct time/title text.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, apply the colors to the <strong>element</strong> variable, not to the <em>event</em>. This way your original colors won't change in the actual <strong>event</strong> object, only in the rendered object.</p>
