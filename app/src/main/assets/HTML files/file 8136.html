<p>You can't do it like that. You can do it like this though,</p>



<pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;form action="/K4VG2/2/show"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" name="field1"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" name="field2"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" name="field3"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Send"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;button type="button"&gt;go&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, on the server side, where you process the form, you can check which fields were filled and which ones were empty. So, you just use the ones which had content.</p>
