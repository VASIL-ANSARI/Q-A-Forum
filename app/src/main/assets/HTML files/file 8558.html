<p>Unless I'm missing something, you're right that vc1 and vc2 should be released. The method you posted allocs the view controllers, so it should either save them in instance variables so that they can be released later, or it should go ahead and release them after adding them to the array.</p>

<p>In a practical sense, it really doesn't matter much, however. In a tab-based app, the view controllers associated with the tab controller usually stick around for the life of the app. When the app terminates, those objects will be cleaned up anyway. This also isn't quite a leak, since the tab controller still has references to the objects pointed to by vc1 and vc2, but it's about as close to leaking as you can get without becoming a true leak.</p>

<p>Good eyes, though. You should consider filing a bug with Apple about that.</p>
