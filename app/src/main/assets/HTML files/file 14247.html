<p>As stated on the <a href="http://www.razorsql.com/docs/support_mysql_delimiter.html" rel="nofollow">RazorSQL website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DELIMITER statement is not part of the MySQL language. It is a command supported by certain MySQL tools. This command tells those MySQL programs to scan for a certain character that indicates the end of a query or statement. </p>
  
  <p>RazorSQL does not support using the DELIMITER command. The SQL statement delimiter value used by RazorSQL can be changed using the preferences window. The default values is the semi-colon.</p>
