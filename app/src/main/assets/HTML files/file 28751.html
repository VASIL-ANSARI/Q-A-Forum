<p>Your container names and blob names are not longer than allowed. Container names can be up to 63 characters (and must be at least 3 characters). Blob names can be up to 1024 characters.</p>

<p>I suspect that either the blob you are trying to download does not exist or there is a bug in your code that is creating the wrong URL for the blob. Your example code has URLs to containers, not blobs.</p>
