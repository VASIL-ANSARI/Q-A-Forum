<p>If you dismiss a view controller that is presenting another view controller, the entire hierarchy is dismissed.  It doesn't matter how many levels there are.  So all you have to do is find your view controller <code>A</code> and tell it to dismiss its presented view controller.</p>

<p>If <code>A</code> is always the bottom of the heap, you can use a simple loop to find it:</p>

<pre><code>UIViewController *dismissingViewController = self.presentingViewController;
while (dismissingViewController.presentingViewController != nil) {
    dismissingViewController = self.presentingViewController;
}

[dismissingViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES
                                             completion:NULL];
</code></pre>
