<p>Here's a suggestion that avoids iterating quadratically. Create a new array. Then iterate through your full array, keeping track of the minimum and maximum positions so far, and if the current object has a position that's less than 18 from the minimum and maximum, add it to the new array.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here's a quick write-up of the code.</p>

<pre><code>myFullArray = ...
myArray = [];
myArray[0] = myFullArray[0];
var min = myArray[0].pos;
var max = myArray[0].pos;
var current;
for (i = 1; i &lt; myFullArray.length; i++) {
    current = myFullArray[i].pos;
    if (Math.abs(current - min) &lt; 18) &amp;&amp; Math.abs(current - max) &lt; 18)
    {
        myArray.push(myFullArray[i]);
        if (current &lt; min)
            min = current;
        else if (current &gt; max)
            max = current;
    }
}
</code></pre>
