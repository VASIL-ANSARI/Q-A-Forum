<p>You need to use zero width assertions to stop capturing the condition you just want to match, and
not "eat" :</p>

<p><code>(?&lt;=[^\[])\*.*</code></p>

<p><code>(?&lt;=REGEX_CONDITION)</code> ensures that matching is done, but the matched part ( NOT A "[" in your case) is not included in the matched result.</p>

<p>Edit: to make it fully working, I just added or condition on it</p>

<pre><code>(?&lt;=[^\[])\*.*|^\*.*
</code></pre>
