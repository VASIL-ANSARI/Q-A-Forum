<p>For this specific case, I'd have to disagree with the comments. For homogeneous type containers - as is the case here (all <code>int</code>s) - <code>array</code> is superior.</p>

<p>When looking at the interface of <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple" rel="nofollow"><code>std::tuple</code></a> vs. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array" rel="nofollow"><code>std::array</code></a>, it is very clear that the latter is a container (with iterators, e.g.), while the former is not. This means that the rest of the standard library will be much more naturally applicable to the latter.</p>

<p>If the types weren't homogeneous, there wouldn't be a question - it would have to be <code>std::tuple</code>.</p>
