<p>You don't have to <strong>intercept</strong> <code>ACTION_DOWN</code> just to monitor that it flowed through your container view.  In other words, you can override <code>onInterceptTouchEvent()</code> to monitor the touch events before they are passed to the appropriate child view by the framework, but as long as you don't screw with the return value it won't actually steal subsequent touch events from the grid elements.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent (MotionEvent ev)
    if (ev.getActionMasked() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
        //Touchdown!
    }

    //Don't modify this and touch interaction will happen normally
    return super.onInterceptTouchEvent(ev);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to see the event without taking it away from the child element(s).</p>
