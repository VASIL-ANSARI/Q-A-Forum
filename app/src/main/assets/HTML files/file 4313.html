<p>They both validate the associated model(s). </p>

<p>The difference is that the first is an option on the association (e.g. <code>belongs_to</code>, <code>has_many</code>, etc). E.g. you define the 'act of validation' in your association.</p>

<p>In a classic "Author has many Books" example, say you enable <code>belongs_to :author, :validate =&gt; true</code> on the Book model. Every time you validate a Book model, the associated Author must also be valid.</p>

<p>The other is a separate validates rule you can add to your other validations. So, in this case you enable the validation of an associated object together with other validation rules.</p>

<p>This can work the other way around. In Author: <code>has_many :books ; validates_associated :books</code>. When you validate the Author object, all books are validated as well. </p>
