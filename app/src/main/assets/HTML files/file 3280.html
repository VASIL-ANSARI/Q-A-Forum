<p>As you said, the problem is not Eclipse losing contact with the Emulator, but ADB - the <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/de/guide/developing/tools/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge</a> - losing contact with it.  As Eclipse uses ADB to communicate with the emulator when ADB is broken Eclipse can do nothing.</p>

<p>To fix this <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/de/guide/developing/tools/adb.html#stopping">stop the ADB server</a> by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>adb kill-server
</code></pre>

<p>Eclipse will then usually try to restart ADB, or you can restart it yourself by running an ADB command, such as:</p>

<pre><code>adb devices
</code></pre>

<p>If you do, you'll see output like this:</p>

<pre><code>* daemon not running. starting it now *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device
</code></pre>

<p>You can also do this via the mouse, using the <strong>Reset adb</strong> option in the <strong>Devices</strong> view in Eclipse.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting the <strong>Console</strong> view has two modes, <code>DDMS</code> and <code>Android</code>.  You're usually in <code>Console</code> mode but it's <code>DDMS</code> mode which will show ADB status messages.  Select modes by clicking the button with the Monitor icon, or using the arrow next to it:</p>

<p>If all else fails, try killing the adb processes from the OS.  On Windows XP I use:</p>

<pre><code>TASKKILL /F /IM adb.exe
</code></pre>
