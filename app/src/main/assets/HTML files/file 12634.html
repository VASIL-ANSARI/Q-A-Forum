<p>I've never run across one. But I have used ACRA before. The way that it uploads its data to google spreadsheet is pretty straight forward. You can just create a form on your G-Docs with whatever columns you want and then in your code create an HTTP request out of the base URL + parameters</p>

<p>Here is how you can build the url string to upload to a form:</p>

<pre><code>String url = "https://spreadsheets.google.com/formResponse?formkey="+ YOUR_KEY+
                         "&amp;entry.0.single="+URLEncoder.encode(val1)+
                         "&amp;entry.1.single="+URLEncoder.encode(val2)+
                         "&amp;entry.2.single="+URLEncoder.encode(val3)+
                         "&amp;entry.3.single="+URLEncoder.encode(val4);
myReq.sendPost(url, "");
</code></pre>

<p>In this example myReq is an HttpRequest object. Unfortunately I can't find the page where I picked this up from. But if you search around for things like "input to google form pro grammatically" or similar you can probably find a few people posting more about it. You can add more or fewer columns if you like just keep the "entry.#" portion of the url incremental.</p>
