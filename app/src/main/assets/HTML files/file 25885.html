<p>You need to provide the host name to <strong>ConnectionConfiguration("your_xmpp_host_name", 5222)</strong> constructor on which your openfire is configured and not just any name. Like "jabber.org" or "www.example.com" or "myxmpp.example.com". You can also provide your server's IP(should be static) as your host name.</p>
