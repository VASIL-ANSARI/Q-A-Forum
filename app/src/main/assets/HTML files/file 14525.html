<h3>EasyNFC is meant to be used as an Android library but is NOT an Eclipse project.</h3>

<p>I checked out its pom.xml and have a play with it.</p>

<ol>
<li>It uses android-2.3.3.jar as dependency in POM doesn't mean it has to be a Android library project.</li>
<li>According to the project structure and &lt;packaging&gt; defined POM, obviously, the producer wants consumer developer use this as a regular java project (bulid as a jar library). In addition, maven-android-plugin defined in POM is verbose, no android phase/goal involved at build time. Also it uses an ancient version 2.8.4 so I guess it is originally created as Android library project and get converted to regular java project recently and didn't clean up the unused code.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Is there an easy way to import EasyNFC as a Maven/Git/Android project into Eclipse?</h3>

<p>Suppose you use latest Android SDK &amp; ADT version, in Eclipse (requires m2eclipse), simply import it as a regular mavenized java project: <code>File -&gt; Import ... -&gt; Maven -&gt; Existing Maven Projects</code>, once done, you can see easynfc in Package Explorer has icon marked with capital M and J, which means a Mavenized Java project.</p>

<p>In Android project, add easynfc project into project build path: <code>Properties -&gt; Java Build Path -&gt; Projects -&gt; Add ...</code> then export easynfc project: to build class path: <code>Properties -&gt; Java Build Path -&gt; Order and Export</code>. </p>

<p>Now you should able to use easynfc in your Android project and build/run/debug it in Eclipse.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
