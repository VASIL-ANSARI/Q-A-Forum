<p>You never define that you want to access the attribute called "name". There could be any number of other attributes like "id".</p>

<p>What you could do is use xpath like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static function Text($category, $item) {
    $xml = new SimpleXMLElement(file_get_contents(self::GetPath()));
    $items = $xml-&gt;xpath("//category[@name='$category']/item[@name='$item']");
    if ($items[0]) {
        return (string)$items[0];
    }
    return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this solution it is important to make sure that $category and $item never contains xpath control characters, i.e. $item = 'my[item]' would produce errors.
In that case, you would have to escape $item and $category somehow.</p>
