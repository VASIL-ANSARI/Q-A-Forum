<p>I think you might be overcomplicating things a little bit.</p>

<p>From what I understand, you need a symbolic link from your docroot to the data folder.</p>

<p>Create one using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p /data1/home/spaceweather/htdoc/cases #just in case it does not exist
ln -s  /data1/public/cases /data1/home/spaceweather/htdoc/cases/data 
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a symbolic link called "data" which will point to your /data1/public/cases directory.</p>

<p>If you <code>ls -l</code> in that directory you should see something like</p>

<pre><code>data -&gt; /data1/public/cases
</code></pre>

<p>Try to <code>cd</code> into the <code>data</code> directory to verify this worked.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>This shouldn't be necessary for you as you have it already in your .htaccess, but leaving it here for anyone else anyway:</em></p>

<p>If this doesn't work through the web browser at first, you may need to add the <code>FollowSymLinks</code> to your htaccess: <code>Options +FollowSymLinks</code>. This tells Apache that it is OK to follow symbolic links such as the one you created.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. If I misunderstood your situation or requirements, please say so and I will edit appropriately.</p>
