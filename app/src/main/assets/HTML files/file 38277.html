<p>You can't customize the appSettings like that; instead, you'd want to create your own custom configuration section.  Here are some articles to see what it's capable of:</p>

<p>The idea is you create a class that inherits from ConfigurationSection, and then define properties on the section which you can set, similar to:</p>

<pre><code>[ConfigurationProperty("DisplayInformation", DefaultValue=true)]
public bool DisplayInformation
{
    get
    {
       return (bool)this["DisplayInformation"];
    }
    set
    {
        this["DisplayInformation"] = value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The one article includes how to do collections, which in your example appSettings is the ConfigurationSection, TestingScenario is the list of items in a collection on the appSettings class, and the key and value are the properties on the entity in the list.</p>
