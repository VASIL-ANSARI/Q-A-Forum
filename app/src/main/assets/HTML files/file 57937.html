<p>Late answer, but hopefully not useless, since this behavior by scrapy doesn't seem well-documented. Looking at this <a href="https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/blob/52a52e2388e465f81e56fb92a3d731531ea6f007/scrapy/core/downloader/handlers/http11.py#L410" rel="nofollow">line of code</a> from the scrapy source, the <code>partial</code> flag is set when the request encounters a Twisted PotentialDataLoss error. According to the corresponding <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/9.0.0/api/twisted.web.http.PotentialDataLoss.html" rel="nofollow">Twisted documentation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This only occurs when making requests to HTTP servers which do not set Content-Length or a Transfer-Encoding in the response</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possible causes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The server is misconfigured</li>
<li>There's a proxy involved that's blocking some headers</li>
<li>You get a response that doesn't normally have Content-Length, e.g. redirects (301, 302, 303), but you've set <code>handle_httpstatus_list</code> or <code>handle_httpstatus_all</code> such that the response doesn't get filtered out by HttpErrorMiddleware or fetched by RedirectMiddleware</li>
</ul>
