<p>I think that the :encoding field in database.yml
is just what is used when creating a new database.</p>

<p>It won't break your app if you change this field</p>

<p>(in fact I think it won't do anything, unless you use <code>rake db:create</code>)</p>

<p>I suggest, if your app is targeting anyone outside of the US or western europe
you should be using utf8.
I find it surprising that Ubuntu still ships with the default as latin1.</p>

<p>This may be "optimised" for space
but causes a hassle for almost anyone with a client facing website.</p>

<p>There are various links on google for how to convert your database to UTF8

<p>something like</p>

<pre><code>/* convert the default character set (used for new tables) */
ALTER DATABASE db_name DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

/* convert a specific table */
ALTER TABLE db_table CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
</code></pre>

<p>of course....</p>

<p><strong>always back up your data, and try it out on a staging machine first</strong></p>
