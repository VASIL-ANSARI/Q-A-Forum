<p>You can start up a simple HTTP server for debugging purposes from any directory, if you have Python installed. Run:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can access the directory as a web site directory using:</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:8000
</code></pre>

<p>You'll need better alternatives as you explore more advanced stuff, but this works just fine as a starting point.</p>
