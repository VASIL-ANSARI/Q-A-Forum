<p>The question you linked to gets you most of the way there. Add a breakpoint action to the breakpoint you set for the assertion. Select the breakpoint from the breakpoint navigator, right-click, and choose Edit Breakpoint. Choosing Edit Breakpoint opens a pop-up editor. In the pop-up editor you should see an Action line with the text Click to add an action. Click that text to open a menu. Choose Log Message from the Action menu. Select the Automatically continue after evaluating actions checkbox to automatically continue after logging the message.</p>
