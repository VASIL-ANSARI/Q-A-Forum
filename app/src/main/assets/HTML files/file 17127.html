<p>Depends on your DB engine.
In mysql, solution looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>    mysql&gt; SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM tbl_name
        -&gt; WHERE id &gt; 100 LIMIT 10;
    mysql&gt; SELECT FOUND_ROWS();
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, you add another attribute on your select (SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS) which tells mysql to count the rows as if limit clause was not present, while executing the query, while FOUND_ROWS actually retrieves that number.</p>

<p>For oracle, see this article :

<p>Other DBMS might have something similar, but I don't know.</p>
