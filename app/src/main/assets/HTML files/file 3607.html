<p>To my knowledge there is no way you can achieve that.<br>
Simply because the OS manages running threads and distributes resources according to it's scheduler.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
Since your goal is to have a "spare" core to run other processes on I'd suggest you use a thread manager and get the number of cores on the system (x) and then spawn at most x-1 threads on the specific system. That way you'll have your spare core.</p>

<p>The former statements still apply, you cannot specify which cores to run threads on unless you in the OS specify it. But from java, no.</p>
