<p>I don't see anything wrong with generic ViewModels. It is a good way to remove duplication and keep compile-time checks, as opposed to ViewBag.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Imagine you have a set of Model classes for <code>Product</code>, <code>Category</code>, etc.
Each class (<code>ProductModel</code>, <code>CategoryModel</code>) has an associated display and editor template, which generates appropriate view.</p>

<p>Now you want to construct a set of pages for view and edit.</p>

<p>I usually create a Layout (Master page in web forms) to render the common content (header, footer, menu, etc.)</p>

<p>Then I would create individual, strongly-typed views that accept as model <code>ProductViewModel</code>, <code>CategoryViewModel</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Now we need to define those view model classes. Each view model class should take an instance of <code>ProductModel</code>, <code>CategoryModel</code>, etc (which will be passed to the template). But the layout often requires some additional data (ie. selected menu, logged-in user name, etc). My solution is to create a generic ViewModel that encapsulates this duplicate data for the Layout:</p>

<pre><code>public class EntityViewModel&lt;T&gt;
    where T : EntityModel
{
    public T Entity { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string SelectedMenu { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can easily create a <code>ProductViewModel : EntityViewModel&lt;ProductModel&gt;</code>, which contains everything the Layout need to render the page, and you can add there any additional, product-specific data.</p>
