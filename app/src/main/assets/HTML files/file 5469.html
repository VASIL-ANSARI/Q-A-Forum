<p>To answer your question, line-height is pretty safe. However, <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> is not. It was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and is dropped from HTML5. You should use CSS for font colors and font family. The reason it didn't appear to change in the other browsers you mention might have something to do with <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> being a presentational tag and not structural, but that's just a guess.</p>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.specialText {
    color:#000;
    font:bold 13px Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif;
    line-height:20px;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="specialText"&gt;My special text&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
