<p>One suggestion that i can give you regarding design of WCF layer is that keep is as thin as possible. The WCF layer should only be responsible for send and receiving data and should be voided of any business functionality\validation. Most of the time it should be delegating work to the service layer. This way maintenance of the service layer is the only major task to take care. WCF wrapper then should be easier to create and maintain. This way you can continue using the old approach with all the performance benefits.</p>
