<p>Hard to give a good answer without a sqlfiddle or the entire sql query, but what about :</p>

<pre><code>   SELECT â¦ column names â¦ (calculation for distance)â¦ as distance 
   FROM table 
   WHERE (col1 = 'value1' AND col2 = 'value2' OR col1 = 'value1' AND col2 = 'a different value')
   HAVING distance &lt; 1
</code></pre>
