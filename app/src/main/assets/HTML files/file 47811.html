<p>You are observing a <strong>symptom</strong>. And it is not the problem with quotes. In the trace a string parameter is shown with doulbe quotes. i.e.</p>

<pre><code>value="20150621235959"
</code></pre>

<p>means the client passed a string '20150621235959' and</p>

<pre><code>value=""   
</code></pre>

<p>means the client passed an empty string ''. Which leads the the ORA-12801</p>

<p>The <strong>root cause</strong> is that the client is able to pass an empty string to the database.</p>

<p>The predicates  </p>

<pre><code>action_date BETWEEN date1 and date2
</code></pre>

<p>returns no row if one or both of the dates is NULL. If you don't trust simple run this query</p>

<pre><code> -- return nothing
 SELECT * FROM dual where sysdate between to_date('','ddmmyyyy') and to_date('','ddmmyyyy');
</code></pre>

<p>There is no point why the client should send empty strings to the database, if you know, that nothing will be returned.</p>

<p>So IMHO there should be some validation in the client enforcing only valid strings (at least the proper lenght) are accepted. This will resolve the problem.</p>
