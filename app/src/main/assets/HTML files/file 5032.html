<p>As the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Diagnostic-Pragmas.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a> note, you can only control options that show up for <code>-fdiagnostics-show-option</code>.  It does not show up for me.  I'm running 4.4.1, but I doubt it would for 4.2.1 either.</p>

<p>You may want to <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/#where" rel="nofollow">file a bug</a> to get it included in the diagnostic system.</p>
