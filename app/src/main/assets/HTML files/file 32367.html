<p>Are these .speed all the same? I'm not sure whether this may help, but if the boards are relative static to each other all the time, maybe you can put all the boards under a 'root', and each board holds the relative position to the 'root'. Then you can move the world by changing the position of 'root', and get the absolute position of a board by root.position + board[i,j].position. Good luck.</p>
