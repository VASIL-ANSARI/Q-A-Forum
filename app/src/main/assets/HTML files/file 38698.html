<p>Firstly, don't do <code>FROM sometable1 AS t1, sometable2 AS t2</code>. Always join explicitly. Secondly, from the way your case looks, some variant of <code>APPLY</code> would suit nicely.</p>

<p>Here's my version:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.Order_no
      ,a.Customer_no
      ,a.BILL_LAST_NAME
      ,a.BILL_FIRST_NAME
      ,b.email
      ,a.BILL_ADDRESS1
      ,a.BILL_ADDRESS2
      ,a.BILL_CITY
      ,a.BILL_STATE
      ,a.BILL_POSTAL_CODE
      ,a.BILL_COUNTRY
      ,b.Address_Type
      ,a.BILL_PHONE
      ,a.BILL_PHONE_EXT
      ,a.Order_Date
      ,a.billing_status
      ,a.PO_Number
      ,a.Customer_comments
      ,a.ShipMethodShipperDesc
      ,a.ShipRate
      ,a.CouponDiscountCode
      ,a.CouponDiscount
      ,a.CustomerDiscount
      ,a.CustomerDiscountPercent
      ,a.SalesTaxTotal
      ,a.Payment_Method
      ,a.Credit_Card_Type
      ,a.Credit_Card_Number
      ,a.Order_Date
      ,a.BILL_TYPE
      ,a.Order_Net
      ,li.SHIP_ADDRESS1
      ,li.SHIP_ADDRESS2
      ,li.SHIP_CITY
      ,li.SHIP_STATE
      ,li.SHIP_POSTAL_CODE
      ,li.SHIP_COUNTRY
FROM Orders AS a
INNER JOIN Customers AS b
    ON a.customer_no = b.customer_no
CROSS APPLY
(
    SELECT TOP 1 c.SHIP_ADDRESS1
                ,c.SHIP_ADDRESS2
                ,c.SHIP_CITY
                ,c.SHIP_STATE
                ,c.SHIP_POSTAL_CODE
                ,c.SHIP_COUNTRY 
    FROM LineItems c
    WHERE c.ORDER_NO = a.ORDER_NO
    ORDER BY c.Id -- or whatever
) AS li
WHERE a.AccountName = 'mywebaccount'
AND a.billing_status &lt;&gt; 'Canceled'
AND a.transferred = 0
AND a.order_status &lt;&gt; 'Canceled'
-- no need for that exists since CROSS APPLY works like INNER JOIN
ORDER BY a.order_date,a.order_no
</code></pre>
