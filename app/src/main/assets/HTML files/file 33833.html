<p>Taking the file from your question it works fine for me too.</p>

<p>However, when I changed <code>puts &lt;&lt;MESSAGE</code> to be:</p>

<pre><code>puts &lt;&lt; MESSAGE
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. with a space between &lt;&lt; and MESSAGE I get exactly your error.</p>

<p>You must have some character in your file at that position that is missing when you copy/paste the file to here.</p>
