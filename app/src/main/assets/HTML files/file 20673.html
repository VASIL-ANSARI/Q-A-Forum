<p>You need to type cast Animal into a Dog. Do some reading on what static_cast and dynamic_cast are. But generally static_cast is if you know what type you are converting to, and dynamic_cast is a guess and will return null if it not that type.</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 0; i &lt; animals.size(); i++)
{
    Animal* a = &amp;animals[i];

    if(typeid(a).name() == "class Dog")
    {
        dogs.push_back(static_cast&lt;Dog&gt;(a));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ps.Im at work so I cant check that code, looks rightish tho =D</p>
