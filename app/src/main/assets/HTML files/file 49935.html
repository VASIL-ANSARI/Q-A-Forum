<p>According to FontAwesome's documentation, it has a lot of classes for each of the icons provided. The <code>star</code> icon has a couple of classes which may interest you:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;i class="fa fa-star"&gt;
&lt;i class="fa fa-star-o"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The second one is just an outline for it. To get the desired effect, you can give it the <code>.fa-star</code> class and then use CSS to color it.</p>

<p>Example:
<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/hdkzfue1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/hdkzfue1/</a></p>

<hr>

<p>You can use the <code>icon-star</code> class which will give you a filled star; you can, later, color it using the <code>color</code> rule.</p>
