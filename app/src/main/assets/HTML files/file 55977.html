<p>The way I do it is to just pass the dependency variables I need directly to the functions that handle that specific route. In your case :</p>

<p><strong>index.js</strong> (or wherever your route is being defined)</p>

<pre><code>app.post('/someRoute', require('routes/login').submitLogin(dependency1, dependency2));
//If you are using express.Router() to handle routes/sub-routes,
//then this line could be different
</code></pre>

<p><strong>routes/login.js</strong></p>

<pre><code>exports.submitLogin = function(dependency1, dependency2)
    return function(req, res){
       // do a bunch of stuff that requires the dependencies referenced in index.js
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, in this practice I'm banking on the fact that you're not going to use <em>every single dependency</em> in every function, which would defeat its point.<br>
This also lets me pass other context or state dependent variables to my route handlers.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is also the practice of simply putting your dependency variable in the <code>app</code> variable, like :</p>

<pre><code>app.dependency=someobject;
</code></pre>

<p>While this would hypothetically let you access your dependency using <code>req.app.dependency1</code>, this practice is not recommended as it can interfere with the already existing children of the <code>app</code> object.</p>
