<p>Don't sure if this is the cause, but consider what mention in docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>getExternalStorageDirectory()</strong> Return the primary external storage directory. <strong>This directory may not currently be accessible</strong> if it has been mounted by the user on their computer, has been removed from the device, or some other problem has happened. You can determine its current state with getExternalStorageState().</p>
