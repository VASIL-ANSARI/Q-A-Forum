<p>By doing <code>hash = response</code> you are only setting the local variable to reference another object. The receiver of the original returned object still keeps that object. A quick solution is to do <code>angular.extend(hash,response);</code>. This will copy all members of respose into the object referenced by <code>hash</code>, which is the original returned object. So the receiver will suddenly see those members.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: will neither work for values (strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null) nor for arrays.</p>

<p>This is a fiddle with the above suggestion that works: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/sVRCg/3/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/sVRCg/3/</a></p>

<p>However I get the feelig that the entire setup is wrong. How will you know that the <code>hash</code> is actually extended with <code>response</code>? Polling (e.g. <code>setTimeout</code>) is an awkward solution. I suggest you returned the promise instead; this way you can find out exactly when the response is available.</p>

<p>Another way is how <code>ngResource</code> does it; this is quite complicated, check out the code.</p>
