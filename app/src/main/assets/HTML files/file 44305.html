<p>Fortan's shared libraries are compatible with C, so JNA should be able to access any interfaces exported, including those that have callback inputs.</p>

<p>The advantages of JNA over JNI:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Speed of development</strong>  You don't have to configure or compile any native code, which can significantly speed up your development/build cycle.  </li>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong>  JNA's mappings look just like the functions you'd be calling in native code, but you get to use Java semantics instead of translating Java into C/JNI, and then C/JNI into appropriate wrappers around Fortran</li>
<li><strong>Maturity of Code</strong> JNA has already worked out the gotchas and details of managing the native interface, so you can focus on solving your real problems instead of doing plumbing.  However, if you <em>like</em> to do plumbing, JNI is always there.</li>
</ul>
