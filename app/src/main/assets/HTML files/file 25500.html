<p>That's an intended behaviour.</p>

<p>Since most web sites still specify their text size in pixels (12px), a retina screen would results in text that is much too small. To avoid this, Safari on the iPad 3rd gen and iPhone 4/4s tell web servers that they have 1/4 the resolution they really have. The text is then rendered in finer details by Safari but it also retains its intended size.</p>

<p>As a workaround, try setting the meta tag "viewport" in your site to allow for a greater resolution.</p>
