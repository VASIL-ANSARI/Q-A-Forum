<p>I figured out an answer. Running <code>ruby18</code> at the command line produced a "command not found" error. So I created a symlink to the system ruby (which is ruby 2.0) with that name:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /usr/bin/ruby /usr/local/bin/ruby18
</code></pre>

<p>That seems to have worked. Still not sure if that's the best solution. Open to any other ideas. </p>
