<p>So you say tcp://192.168.49.1:26666 is the address of your Android host, but so far as I can tell you're trying to publish <em>and</em> subscribe from your ios device, at least for this example. So, let's be explicit: for this example, ignore your Android device and just try to get your ios application talking to itself. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1: use the ip:port for your ios device</strong></p>

<p>ZMQ has two sides to every connection, one side that "binds" (and could be considered the <em>server</em>) and one side that "connects" (and could be considered the <em>client</em>). Your choices are flexible, but for the sake of example it's probably best for your publisher to bind and your subscriber to connect. Right now, you have both sides connecting. This is likely the cause of the error you're seeing. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2: change your pub socket to bind on its address rather than connect</strong></p>

<p>When using PUB/SUB, you must subscribe to the "topics" you want. In your example code you're subscribing to "NASDAQ". For you to receive messages, the text of the message must begin with your subscriber topic, for instance "NASDAQ:hi" would get through your subscription filter. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3: change your zmq_subscribe option to subscribe to an empty string "" to get <em>every</em> message that comes through</strong></p>

<p>Making those three changes should put you on the right track. I highly suggest you <a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all" rel="nofollow">read the guide</a>, it covers these sorts of basic usage guidelines and has a fair body of ios example code to boot. </p>
