<p>Putting all contents into an UIWebView (implementing in HTML &amp; CSS) is generally a bad idea performance wise.</p>

<p>What Feedly seems to do is use an <code>UIScrollView</code>.
The ScrollView sends several events including when it's moved and tapped.</p>

<p>They then update the green scroll bar on top whenever the ScrollView is moved.
Likely, they will also load the actual contents within the ScrollView as the user approaches their position to conserve memory.</p>

<p>You can implement something like this yourself in a few days of coding work.</p>

<p>(Disclaimer: This is just how I would implement what you showed. How it is actually done - only Feedly knows.)</p>
