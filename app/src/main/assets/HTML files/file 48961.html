<p><code>BOUND</code> is a self-declared macro in the code, that does <code>MIN(MAX(VALUE, LOWER), UPPER)</code></p>

<p>where <code>MIN</code> and <code>MAX</code> are just C macros to get the min and max values between the values passed in. It gets the minimum value between the maximum value of value and lower, and upper (kind of confusing I guess). </p>

<p>Swift has these macros defined:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24186648/swift-equivalent-for-min-and-max-macros">Swift equivalent for MIN and MAX macros</a></p>

<p>Make a method that does what <code>BOUND</code> is doing and call that instead, it is pretty well explained with examples in the above post.</p>
