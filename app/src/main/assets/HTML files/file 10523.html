<p>I think the error is pretty clear here.  What user is your Java code running as?  It most likely doesn't have permissions to run <code>chmod</code> on that directory.</p>

<p>Do a <code>ls -l</code> on that directory to see who it is owned by.  Make sure that your Java code is running at that same user.</p>
