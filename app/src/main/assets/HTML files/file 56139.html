<p>The <code>Using Native Libraries</code> documentation on the Xamarin developer portal explains half of this:</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/using_native_libraries/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/using_native_libraries/</a></p>

<p>The ABIs supported by your Android application are determined by the presence of .so files inside your APK, under the <code>lib/&lt;ABI&gt;</code> folders where ABI can be one or more of armeabi, armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, mips, mips64, x86, x86_64 (the current seven ABIs).</p>

<p>I personally use an application from the Google Play Store that helps assist in what files get deployed:</p>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xh.nativelibsmonitor.app" rel="nofollow">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xh.nativelibsmonitor.app</a></p>

<p>So what happens is that most devices typically support multiple ABIs. Thus you will get a list of supported ABIs that the Android Package Manager uses to install the .so files the device prefers.</p>

<p>Basically the best practice here is to ensure you are putting the optimized libraries in each of the <code>&lt;ABI&gt;</code> folders as listed above. Just know that when the application gets installed on the device, only one of the supported architectures will be getting installed.</p>
