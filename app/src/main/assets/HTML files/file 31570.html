<p>The issue is that in the <em>Assembly</em> containing the <code>Product</code>, could be some <em>object/entity</em>, with such a "missing parameterless constructor" <em>(some helper object)</em>. You have to be more specific, try to use the <code>.Where()</code> to narrow the set of auto-mapped objects/entities</p>

<pre><code>.Mappings(m =&gt;
    m.AutoMappings
     .Add(AutoMap.AssemblyOf&lt;Product&gt;()
                 .Where(t =&gt; t.Namespace ==...
</code></pre>

<p>...or something like that. Just be precise what should be auto-mapped.</p>
