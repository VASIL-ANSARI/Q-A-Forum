<p>When you assign the parent object's id to the children in the array, it is the value of the id that is copied. So the ng-model on your input tag does not bind to the children's obj_id property at all. </p>

<p>Here is a much more thorough explanation of the problem:</p>

<p>Perhaps what you need is a property on each child that references the parent object? That way you could get the parent's id from any child object.</p>

<pre><code>$scope.obj = {
    id : 0,
    name : 'parent',
    childs : []
};
$scope.obj.childs.push({
    parent : $scope.obj,
    name : 'child1',
});
$scope.obj.childs.push({
    parent : $scope.obj,
    name : 'child2',
});
</code></pre>
