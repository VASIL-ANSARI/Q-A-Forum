<p>I don't think that the all-in-session way is the best way, it's only another way. If you store serialized objects in the session and then deserialize them it will be certainly faster, but you must store a large amount of data. Personally i prefer the object regeneration on every page load and i use the session serialization only when the creation of the object is very slow.</p>
