<p>One solution would be to use IIS Manager to configure the website (created for your ASP.NET app by Visual Studio) and add a virtual directory for each of the common folders so that (by the 'virtual' nature of the virtual directory) they will 'appear' to be in the same root folder as your ASP.NET app.</p>

<pre><code>/root
  app_1
  app_2
  dotnetapp_1
    &lt;virtual&gt;img
    &lt;virtual&gt;js
  ...
  img
  js
  style
</code></pre>

<p>You can probably script IIS or edit an XML file if you need to do this in bulk, and I'm sure there must be an even more elegant way to do something similar that doesn't require to much mouse work!</p>
