<p>There are two ways I can think of to accomplish your requirement. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you can keep your app in the foreground, you can prevent the device from going to sleep by adding <code>android:keepScreenOn="true"</code> to your activity (for more info, see <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/scheduling/wakelock.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/training/scheduling/wakelock.html</a>). </p></li>
<li><p>The second way is to fake that your app is playing music in the background, and hence doesn't get killed by the OS. You can just play an silent mp3 that is stored locally within your app, and repeat it for unlimited amount of time. The OS will never kill your app, until it runs out of battery :)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
