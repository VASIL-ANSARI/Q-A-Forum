<p>maybe you should take the approach of defaulting to: "the filename is correct" and work from there to disprove that statement:</p>

<p>with the fact that you only allow filenames with: 'show name', 'season number x episode number' and 'episode name', you know for certain that these items should be separated by a "-" (dash) so you have to have 2 of those for a filename to be correct.<br>
if that checks out, you can use your code to check that the show name matches the show name as seen in the parent's parent folder (case insensitive i assume), the season number matches the parents folder numeric value (with or without an extra 0 prepended).</p>

<p>if however you don't see the correct amount of dashes you instantly know that there is something wrong and stop before the rest of the tests etc.</p>

<p>and separately you can check if the file <code>folder.jpg</code> exists and take the necessary actions. <strong>or</strong> do that first and filter that file from the rest of the files in that folder.</p>
