<p>It will serialize the entire object graph (the object and any objects it exposes through public members, recursively) as long as all objects in the graph are serializable. Different serializers have different rules for what is serializable. For example the XmlSerializer needs a default public constructor.</p>

<p>Also, the XML serializer needs to be able to tell what kind of types it will serialize based only on the type info and attributes on those types. So say for example you have a class that has a property of type Animal, yet at runtime XmlSerializer finds an object of type Dog in there. To support this you will need to use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.xmlincludeattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow">XmlInclude</a> attribute to let it know ahead of time that it needs to support Dog.</p>

<p>In order to keep parts of the object graph out of the serialized output, you would use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.serialization.xmlignoreattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow">XmlIgnore</a> attribute. Different serializers also have different attributes for including/ignoring, etc.</p>

<p>Hope this helps clarify a little bit. You may also want to read up on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/182eeyhh.aspx" rel="nofollow">this topic in MSDN</a>.</p>
