<p>In Windows opengl32.dll contains both a software rasterizer fallback and so called trampolines into the OpenGL-ICD shipping with the GPU driver.</p>

<p>The opengl32.lib ist not really a library but a cross reference for the linker to add entries into the executable that make the OS dynamically link the program against the DLL at runtime.</p>

<p>On Linux in the current implementation the libGL.so ships with the graphics driver and contains the vendor specific implementations. The linkers used in *nix systems don't rely on an extra crossreferencing .lib but can take the information directly from the .so</p>

<p>On Android the libGLES you see is only a kind of placeholder to make linking possible. But ultimately the GPU vendor provides the proper library, which drops into the place where the phony libGLES resided.</p>

<p>The .in files are nothing special in particular. They are input files used by configure and build systems to build source files from a template (the .in file) with fields filled in by configuration values.</p>
