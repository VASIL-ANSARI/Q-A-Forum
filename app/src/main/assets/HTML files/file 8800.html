<p>I'm not sure I understand all of your requirements correctly. It looks to me that all you need is a <strong>service component that tracks the transactions</strong>. Rather than rewriting everything as WPF/SL, why not modify your current application (you didn't mention the technology used nor if you can modify it) to log any transaction to a service endpoint.</p>

<p>The service endpoint records the transactions in a database (e.g., WCF over https, storing data in SQL Server). From there you can either <strong>expose the information as part of the dashboard software</strong> you mentioned, or you can <strong>create your own reporting application</strong> using something like <strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong>.</p>
