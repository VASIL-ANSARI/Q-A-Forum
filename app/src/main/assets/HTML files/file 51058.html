<p>The problem probably is, that this cell is already being reused in the tableView. So the cell that you are actually seeing is not the one that dissapeared, but the one that was reused and is being showed in the table.</p>

<p>If you want to get the cell, you have to manually call cellForRowAtIndexPath</p>
