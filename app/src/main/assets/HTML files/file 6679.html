<p>If you're looking for information about the tables and databases themselves, you may be looking for INFORMATION_SCHEMA <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/information-schema.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/information-schema.html</a></p>

<p>If you're attempting to add your own "metadata" about items in tables or databases, I would suggest creating a parallel table/database to store the information and do your own operations on it. Alternatively, change the layout of your tables to include fields for comments such that comments are in a definite position with respect to the data is concerns.</p>
