<p>Sure. Set the scroll viewâs content size smaller than the actual width of your contentâsay if you have three 320pt-wide views in it and you only want the first two accessible, set its content size to <code>(640, &lt;whatever&gt;)</code>. The third of the views will be visible at the end of the scroll view when itâs bouncing but otherwise inaccessible.</p>
