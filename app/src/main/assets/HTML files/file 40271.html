<p>The reason that <code>cal.getTime()</code> is still printing EST is because java's <code>Date</code> object (which is what <code>cal.getTime()</code> returns) <strong>does not contain timezone information</strong>.</p>

<p>The String representation of a <code>Date</code> object is misleading, as it includes the timezone of your computer (in your case, EST).  I live in Oregon, so if I were to run your code I would get PST.  But in spite of this String representation, the <code>Date</code> object does not have any TimeZone field in it.</p>

<p>In your code, you are successfully setting the TimeZone of your calendar, but unfortunately when you extract a <code>Date</code> object from your calendar you can't get the TimeZone with it.</p>

<p>Why did the creators of Java do it this way, you may ask?  Well, there is no good answer to that, other than that it was a poor decision, and also explains why in Java 8 they made a whole new library for dealing with date/time.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that a <code>DateFormat</code> object <strong>does</strong> contain a TimeZone field, and so you can use it to print out the time as it would be in a particular time zone.
