<p>Are you building the unmanaged DLL as 32-bit or 64-bit? Remember that the "long" type in C# is the same as System.Int64. That could be the source of your marshalling problem. If your DLL is 32-bit try changing your C# code to:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport("MY_C_DLL.dll")]
extern static int add_num(int a, int b);
</code></pre>
