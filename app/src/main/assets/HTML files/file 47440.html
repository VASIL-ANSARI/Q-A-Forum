<p>On your detail view controller you can create a UIActivityIndicatorView variable. </p>

<p>In viewDidAppear you can call the activity indicator, bring it to front and start animating it. </p>

<p>The create a function that populates an array that will store the data your cells will use and re work your cellForRowAtIndexPath to use it. (Instead of fetching the data in each cell).</p>

<p>Then in your function to fetch data, right after (or before) you update your table tell the activity indicator to stop animating. </p>
