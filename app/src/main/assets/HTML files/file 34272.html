<p><code>Merge</code> is definitely a great way of accomplishing this task.  Your code should look something similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>cmd.CommandText = 
@"
    Merge into Table as Target 
    Using (Select @PrimaryKey As PrimaryKey) As Source
        On Target.PrimaryKey = Source.PrimaryKey
    When not matched then
        Insert (PrimaryKey, Value)
        Values (@PrimaryKey, @Value)
    When matched then 
        Update 
        Set Value = @Value
    ;
";
</code></pre>
