<p>You don't need inheritance:</p>

<ul>
<li>To shape the result to <code>Request</code> , you even don't need inheritance, just shape it.</li>
<li>To add a method to <code>RequestMaster</code>, you don't need inheritance, just crate another file and create a <code>public partial class RequestMaster</code> and add your method <code>public List&lt;RequestMaster&gt; SelectAll()</code> or <code>public List&lt;Request&gt; SelectAll()</code> to it.</li>
<li>To drive a class from your base entity and have mapping still work, you should use standard mechanism of inheritance in EF like <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/cc716702(v=vs.90).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Table Per Type</code></a> for example.</li>
</ul>

<p>But in general I strongly recommend to not do that and instead, separate concerns and use a different class called for example <code>RequestMasterBusinessLogic</code> to contain that logic, 
you can also shape your entities here in this class and if you really need a Request class too, write this code in <code>RequestMasterBusinessLogic</code> without deriving from <code>RequestMaster</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class RequestMasterBusinessLogic
{
    private YourDataContext Context;
    public RequestMasterBusinessLogic()
    {
        Context= new YourDataContext();
    }
    public List&lt;RequestMaster&gt; SelectAll()
    {
         Context.RequestMaster.Include("RequestType").ToList();
    }
    public List&lt;Request&gt; SelectAllRequests()
    {
         Context.RequestMaster
                .Include("RequestType")
                .Select(x =&gt; new Request()
                {
                    RequestId = x.RequestId,
                    RequestType = x.RequestType,
                }).ToList();
    }
}
</code></pre>
