<p>There are all sorts of potential reasons this isn't working, but there's not enough information here to be certain why.  Here are a couple potential reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most likely, the <code>checkTags()</code> Javascript function is performing some sort of validation on the tags.  Judging by the GET request you showed, it's doing some AJAX to the server, and it's probably looking for blacklisted tags.  Or, it could just be sending them to the server to have their format "validated" (less likely).  In order to test this out, I'd try playing around with some GET requests to that URL, putting different tags in the GET parameters.  By seeing what comes out, you might get a better idea of what tags you're allowed to send.  You might also try using your browser's developer tools (like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9163251/chrome-source-of-post-data">Chrome's</a>) to view the POST data as you send it to this form.</li>
<li>It's also possible that there is some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" rel="nofollow">CSRF</a> token in the form.  The server generates such a token when it sends the form, and it's valid for a short period of time afterwards.  It is sent back to the server with the form data.  The server will check the token for validity when it receives the form.  It exists to prevent other people (especially malicious websites) from submitting form data to their form.  It could be that, for security reasons, the server won't mention the CSRF token in its response, and instead says that the tags are the reason for the error.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these possibilities can be checked by examining the requests the webpage sends in the developer tools, and also examining the entire source of the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, not just that specific <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.  Hopefully this helps!</p>
