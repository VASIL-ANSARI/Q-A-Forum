<p>Sorry to do the question+answer thing. Hopefully this is helpful to someone else...</p>

<p>Looking at (only) the stacktrace provided, it looks like the issue occurred when the <code>DelegatingFilterProxy</code> asserted if the <code>BeanFactory</code> was active (this is a good start, sounded like the application context had an issue initialising...).</p>

<p>Upon getting access to the FULL logs, I found out the application context had failed much earlier on (issue with creating a bean - a missing file), and that this message was just the "ripples" from that original issue.</p>

<p>Moral of the story (<strong>tl;dr</strong>):</p>

<ul>
<li>this stacktrace is a symptom, look for the root cause (&amp; check the full logs)</li>
</ul>
