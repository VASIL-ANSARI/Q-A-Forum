<p>Using .trim().isEmpty() would work. Try implementing something as follows:</p>

<pre><code>if (massTextField.getText().trim().isEmpty()) {
    //Call method to determine mass.
}
else if (rangeTextField.getText().trim().isEmpty()) {
    //Call method to determine range.
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and so on, for each TextField you want to test.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The boolean array idea would work. I cannot think of a very nice, flexible way to implement this solution, as it requires that you know exactly which variables are missing, and must calculate the answer differently depending on that case. </p>
