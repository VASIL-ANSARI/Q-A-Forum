<p>In your case, this would suffice:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src = "screenshot.jpeg" width ="100%" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this will only do what you want if <code>body</code> is the same size as the viewport. This basically tells the browser that the <code>img</code> should be just as big as its parent (in this case the <code>body</code>).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Javascript does not work the way you expect it. <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> is an HTML element, that lets you embed scripts (Javascript mostly) into your document. You cannot change the HTML source with Javascript on the client side (like you can with PHP, Python, etc. on the server side). You can modify the DOM though.</p>
