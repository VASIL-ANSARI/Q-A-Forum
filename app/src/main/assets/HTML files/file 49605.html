<p>What you are probably experiencing is submitting a job before the workers have registered at the master.</p>

<p>A 5GB JVM heap is initialized fast, and the TaskManager can register almost immediately. For a 70GB heap, the JVM takes a while to initialize and boot. Consequently, the worker registers later, and the job cannot be executed when you submit it, due to a lack of workers.</p>

<p>That is also the reason why it works once you re-submit the job.</p>

<p>JVMs are initialized faster, if you start the cluster in "streaming" mode (standalone via start-cluster-streaming.sh), because then at least Flink's internal memory is initialized lazily.</p>
