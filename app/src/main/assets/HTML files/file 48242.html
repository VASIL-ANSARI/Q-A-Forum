<p>What you are looking for is to use <code>midnight</code> rather than <code>yesterday midnight</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$timestamp = strtotime('midnight');
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that the <code>strtotime</code> works backwards, so <code>yesterday midnight</code> would be yesterday at <code>00:00</code>, so it allows all 24 hours of the next day (yesterday) to be allowed to book in.</p>

<p><code>midnight</code> would go to the current day's midnight (starting at that current date's <code>00:00</code>.</p>

<p>If you were worried about getting today's midnight, that would be:</p>

<pre><code>$timestamp = strtotime('today midnight');
</code></pre>

<p>So it's quite easy to understand once you learn that.</p>
