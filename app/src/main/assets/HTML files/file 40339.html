<p>You should clean up your property definition as your iVar is getting mixed up with your property.  If you declare a property you don't need to declare an iVar.  You also don't need <code>@synthesize</code> unless you want a specific name for the backing variable.  If you use the <code>self.</code> notation then you can be sure that you are referring to the property and not an iVar.</p>

<p>Your .h file should be -</p>

<pre><code>@import CoreBluetooth;

@interface BlueToothLEManager : NSObject &lt; CBCentralManagerDelegate, CBPeripheralDelegate&gt;

@property (strong, retain) CBCentralManager *mBTCentralManager;

-(void) initializeCBCentralManager;

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then your .m file will be</p>

<pre><code>#import "BlueToothLEManager.h"
#import "Constants.h"

@implementation BlueToothLEManager


-(void)initializeCBCentralManager{
    NSLog(@"initializing CBCentral Manager"); 
    self.mBTCentralManager = [[CBCentralManager alloc] initWithDelegate:self queue:nil];

}

#pragma mark - CBCentralManagerDelegate

// method called whenever you have successfully connected to the BLE peripheral
- (void)centralManager:(CBCentralManager *)central didConnectPeripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral
{
}

// CBCentralManagerDelegate - This is called with the CBPeripheral class as its main input parameter. This contains most of the information there is to know about a BLE peripheral.
- (void)centralManager:(CBCentralManager *)central didDiscoverPeripheral:(CBPeripheral *)peripheral advertisementData:(NSDictionary *)advertisementData RSSI:(NSNumber *)RSSI
{
    NSLog(@"Discovered %@ at %@", peripheral.name, RSSI); 
}

-(void)centralManagerDidUpdateState:(CBCentralManager *)central{
    NSLog(@"Start scan"); 

    if(central.state == CBCentralManagerStatePoweredOn){
        NSLog(@"Scanning for BTLE device"); 
        [central scanForPeripheralsWithServices:@[[CBUUID UUIDWithString:DEVICE_NAME]] options:@{ CBCentralManagerScanOptionAllowDuplicatesKey : @YES }];
    }
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>I have tested this and it works</p>
