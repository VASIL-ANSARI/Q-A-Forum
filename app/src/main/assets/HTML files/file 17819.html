<p>Because most languages (even advanced/high-level ones) in creation do it? You will have the same behaviour on integer in C, C++, Java, Perl, Python... This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division" rel="nofollow">Euclidian Division</a> (hence the corresponding modulo <code>%</code> operator).</p>

<p>The integer division operation is even implemented at hardware level on many architecture. <a href="http://www.peterbe.com/plog/blogitem-040804-1" rel="nofollow">Others</a> have asked this question, and one reason is symetry: In static typed languages such as see, this allows all integer operations to return integers, without loss of precision. It also allow easy access to the corresponding low-level assembler operation, since C was designed as a sort of extension layer over it.</p>

<p>Moreover, as explained in one comment to the linked article, floating point operations were costly (or not supported on all architectures) for many years, and not required for processes such as splitting a dataset in fixed lots.</p>
