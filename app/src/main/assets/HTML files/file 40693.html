<p>In your seeds.rb file, wrap your code in a check for the current tenant. I don't have anywhere to test this right now, but the following code should get you close:</p>

<pre><code>unless Apartment::Tenant.current_tenant == 'public'
    #Insert seed data
end
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to seed a tenant manually you should be able to run <code>Apartment::Tenant.seed</code></p>

<p>To get the seeds.rb file to run when a tenant is created add:</p>

<pre><code>config.seed_after_create = true
</code></pre>

<p>to your apartment initializer file.</p>

<p>For your example:</p>

<pre><code>Apartment.configure do |config|

  config.excluded_models = ["Admin","Contractor", "ContractorPackage","ContractorTransaction","Country","Currency","Faq","FaqCategory","Language","Package","Page","PaymentType","Setting","TempTransaction","Testimonial","Timezone","Tutorial"]

  # use postgres schemas?
  config.use_schemas = true

  config.tenant_names = lambda{ Contractor.pluck("CONCAT('contractor_',id)") }

  config.seed_after_create = true
end
</code></pre>
