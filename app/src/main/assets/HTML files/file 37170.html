<p>The average is the maximum minus the minimum divided by one less than the number of days.  So, you can get it as:</p>

<pre><code>select datediff(day, min(myDate), max(myDate)) / cast(count(*) - 1 as float)
from temp;
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to be real careful, you might prevent the potential divide-by-zero error:</p>

<pre><code>select (case when count(*) &gt; 1
             then datediff(day, min(myDate), max(myDate)) / cast(count(*) - 1 as float)
             else 0
        end)
from temp;
</code></pre>
