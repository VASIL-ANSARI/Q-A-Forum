<p>You haven't thought out your solution well enough. If you only have one item, why are you using a DataList? You should directly bind in the markup using <code>&lt;%=MyObject.artikli_na_skladistu.skladista.Adresa%&gt;</code>. If you have more than one item in your DataList, how are you going to figure out which one to show?</p>
