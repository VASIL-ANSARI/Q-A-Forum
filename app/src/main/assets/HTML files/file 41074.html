<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "solving the query", but that query is not valid in its current form. I think you want a pipeline like the following:</p>

<pre><code>db.cancer_stats.aggregate([
    { "$match" : { "cname" : "lung and bronchus" } },
    { "$group" : { "_id" : "year", "t_count" : { "$sum" : "$count" }, "t_population" : { "$sum" : "$population" } } },
    { "$project" : { "result" : { "$multiply" : [100000, { "$divide" : ["$t_count", "$t_population"] } ] } } }
])
</code></pre>

<p>Does that answer your question?</p>
