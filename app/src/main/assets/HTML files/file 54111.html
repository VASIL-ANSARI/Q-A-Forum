<p>@Tom - I use the same classes in one of my projects, and I installed it in exactly the same way as you do.  I can generate the same errors that you're seeing - but only if I remove <code>import Charts</code> from my class definition.</p>

<p>Here's what the start of my class definition looks like</p>

<pre><code>import UIKit
import Charts

class SharePriceGraphViewController: UIViewController, ChartViewDelegate
{
    var myStickChart: BarChartView!  // I don't really have this - added for this test :-)
</code></pre>

<p>as it stands, this compiles nicely.  if I remove the import - I get the same error as you do.</p>
