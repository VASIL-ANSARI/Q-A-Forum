<p>So, in order to have a formal answer here on Stack Overflow, here's my comment again as an answer.</p>

<p>From the way it looks, you're using an outdated jOOQ code generator version with a newer jOOQ runtime version. The two won't match, which is why you're getting those exceptions.</p>

<p>I've noticed because that <code>PublicFactory</code> class is no longer generated by the jOOQ 3.x code generators.</p>
