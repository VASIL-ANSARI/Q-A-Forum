<p>This makes sense. I believe you could use</p>

<pre><code>l = new Location(null);
</code></pre>

<p>So that you don't have to get your current location. This should still create a new Location, but with a provider string of null, using the other Location constructor:</p>

<pre><code>Location(String provider)
</code></pre>
