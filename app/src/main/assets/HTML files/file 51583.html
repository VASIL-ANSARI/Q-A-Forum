<p>I don't know about anything that would disassemble a whole in-memory assembly into text. And I don't know how could you save an in-memory assembly to disk to use a file-based disassembler (like ildasm).</p>

<p>But if all you want is to find out what constant strings are used by methods, you don't need all that.</p>

<p>To access the IL of a method (that you have as <code>MethodInfo</code>), you can use <code>method.GetMethodBody().GetILAsByteArray()</code>. As the method name implies, this gives you a <code>byte[]</code>, which is not easy to work with. But you can use Jb Evain's <a href="https://github.com/jbevain/mono.reflection" rel="nofollow">Mono.Reflection</a> to do the hard work for you (despite the name, it's not really related to Mono and can be used from normal .Net too).</p>

<p>The only step remaining is to realize that constant strings are accessed using the <code>ldstr</code> instruction, so that's what we need to look for.</p>

<p>Knowing all this, finding the constant strings used by a method is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>method.GetInstructions().Where(i =&gt; i.OpCode == OpCodes.Ldstr).Select(i =&gt; (string)i.Operand)
</code></pre>
