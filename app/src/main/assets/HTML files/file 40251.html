<p>Your query is not a useful one. You've told it to get every player, and every team, and it's done that. How should it match a player with the correct team? You haven't told it, so it matches every player to every team. This is called a Cartesian join, and can be very very bad news. You need add a section on how to join the players to the correct team. You can do it two ways:</p>

<pre><code>select *
from Players, Teams
WHERE Players.team = Teams.teamiD
</code></pre>

<p>That is the 'old-fashioned' way of doing it. The newer way, which does exactly the same thing but can be easier to read is:</p>

<pre><code>select *
from Players p
inner join Trans t on t.Id = p.teamID
</code></pre>

<p>Look up the syntax for Joins. Joins are either inner or outer or cross, and then either left or right or full. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia article</a> is probably not a bad place to start. Then look at the docs for whichever database system you're using (I see a MySQL tag, so that would be <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/join.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>
