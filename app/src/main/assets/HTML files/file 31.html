<p>Are you just talking about the interface and storage, or the implementation of sending the emails as well?</p>

<p>Yes, a SQL table with FROM, TO, Subject, Body should work for storage and, heck, a textbox or even maybe a RichText box should work for editing.</p>

<p>Or is this a web interface?</p>

<p>For actually sending it, check out the System.Web.Mail namespace, it's pretty self explanatory and easy to use :)</p>
