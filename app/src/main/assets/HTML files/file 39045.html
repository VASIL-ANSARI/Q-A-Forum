<p>Lots of things that look like arrays &mdash; that have a <code>.length</code> property and numerically-indexed properties &mdash; work with the built-in Array methods, but you have to call them explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>randPositions = [].slice.call(positions, n, n + 100);
</code></pre>

<p>That trick grabs a reference to the "slice" method from a throw-away Array instance and calls it via <code>.call()</code> to make your "positions" array be <code>this</code> inside the function.</p>
