<p>The cause of this exception could be due to the amount of data that is attempting to be retrieved at once.</p>

<p>As first suggestion I would tell you, that you use <code>âresult limitsâ</code> in your script. But I can see that you are using this. In that case, you may reduce the values of your result limits.
Other reason could be the query generated from that <code>âobject masksâ</code> is too intensive and is causing the failures. In that case it is recommended that you please reduce the values in the <code>âobject masksâ</code>, maybe splitting the retrieval of all those properties into multiple calls and additionally adding a cool down period in the iteration of their virtual guests.
This is pseudo code what I trying to explain:</p>

<pre><code>for x in myVsis:
vsiId = myVsis.id
tempVsiObject1 = getVsi('[property1,property2, property3, property4]') // Call 1 with reduced properties in the mask
tempVsiObject2 = getVsi('[property5, property6, property7 ]') // Call 2 with reduced properties in the mask
tempVsiObject3 = getVsi('[property8[property9[property10[property11]]]]') // Call 3 with reduced properties in the mask
vsi = merge_objects(tempVsiObject1, tempVsiObject2, tempVsiObject3)
sleep(1) // cool down 1 second before moving to the next VSI
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this alternative help you, where the result will have in lighter queries each time.</p>
