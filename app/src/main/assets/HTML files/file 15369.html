<p>Check to see how many times the outer loop:</p>

<pre><code>while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
</code></pre>

<p>is executing for contact A. For each iteration of that loop, print out contactId and contactEmail like this:</p>

<pre><code>Log.d("debug for stack overflow", contactEmail + " : " + contactId);
</code></pre>

<p>This will help determine what is happening.</p>

<p>If you still need more help after this, post the results of what I just suggested.</p>
