<p>Do this in your cpp file:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned CPassant::LastID = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>This is called defining the static class member, If you dont do this you will end up getting linker errors. You just declared the static member but did not define it.    </p>

<p>Note that access specifiers do not matter here while defining the static member.</p>
