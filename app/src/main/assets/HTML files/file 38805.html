<p>Easiest way is to have your <code>IntentService</code> send a <code>Broadcast</code> once it is done gathering data from the server, which you can listen to in your UI thread (e.g. <code>Activity</code>). </p>

<pre><code>public final class Constants {
    ...
    // Defines a custom Intent action
    public static final String BROADCAST_ACTION =
        "com.example.yourapp.BROADCAST";
    ...
    // Defines the key for the status "extra" in an Intent
    public static final String EXTENDED_DATA_STATUS =
        "com.example.yourapp.STATUS";
    ...
}

public class MyIntentService extends IntentService {
    @Override
    protected void onHandleIntent(Intent workIntent) {
        // Gets data from the incoming Intent
        String dataString = workIntent.getDataString();
        ...
        // Do work here, based on the contents of dataString
        // E.g. get data from a server in your case
        ...

        // Puts the status into the Intent
        String status = "..."; // any data that you want to send back to receivers
        Intent localIntent =
            new Intent(Constants.BROADCAST_ACTION)
                    .putExtra(Constants.EXTENDED_DATA_STATUS, status);
        // Broadcasts the Intent to receivers in this app.
        LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).sendBroadcast(localIntent);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then create your broadcast receiver (either a separate class or inner class within your Activity)</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre><code>// Broadcast receiver for receiving status updates from the IntentService
private class MyResponseReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    // Called when the BroadcastReceiver gets an Intent it's registered to receive
    @
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        ...
        /*
         * You get notified here when your IntentService is done
         * obtaining data form the server!
         */
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the final step is to register the BroadcastReceiver in your Activity:</p>

<pre><code>IntentFilter statusIntentFilter = new IntentFilter(
      Constants.BROADCAST_ACTION);
MyResponseReceiver responseReceiver =
      new MyResponseReceiver();
// Registers the MyResponseReceiver and its intent filters
LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).registerReceiver(
      responseReceiver, statusIntentFilter );
</code></pre>
