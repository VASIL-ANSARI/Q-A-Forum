<p><code>ng-include</code> would not work without a web-server to serve your application, as some browsers would restrict the template from loading due to <code>Cross Origin</code> issues or due to the <code>file://</code> protocol.</p>

<p>As per documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, the browser's Same Origin Policy and Cross-Origin
  Resource Sharing (CORS) policy may further restrict whether the
  template is successfully loaded. For example, ngInclude won't work for
  cross-domain requests on all browsers and for file:// access on some
  browsers.</p>

<p>TL;DR - ng-include would not work without a web server.</p>

<p>P.S: as mentioned in the link, there is a workaround, you can include the template in the same html file by using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/ng-template" id="sample.html"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;This is my sample template&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
