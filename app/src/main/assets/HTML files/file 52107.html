<p>The difference between the mean and the sum is just the multiplication by 1/N. </p>

<p>The problem with using the sum is that the batch size (N) will influence your gradients. The learning rate indicates how much in the direction of the gradient you want to adjust your parameters. </p>

<p>If your gradient is larger for larger batch sizes (N), it means that you will need to adjust the learning rate as you increase the batch size (N).</p>

<p>In practice, in order to keep these two (learning rate and batch size) independent, it is common to use the mean instead of the sum. This makes the gradient magnitude independent of N.</p>

<p>If you are not using a batch, then N=1 and the mean is the same as the sum.</p>
