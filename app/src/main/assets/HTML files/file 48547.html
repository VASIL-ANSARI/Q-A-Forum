<p>Google answered me the following :</p>

<p>"Are RecyclerView 2 and 3 large enough to scroll? v22.2.1 will no longer scroll  Views do not need to be scrolled."  (Project Member #1 chrisba...@google.com)</p>

<p>Indeed,  RecyclerView 2 was not large enough which explained the issue but  RecyclerView 3 was large enough. However, since then, for some reasons (maybe an update of 22.1.1) my RecyclerView 3 now works as expected.</p>

<p>So just remember that there is a design intent modification in 22.1.1 (not documented if I am not wrong) that "won't scroll  Views that do not need to be scrolled".</p>
