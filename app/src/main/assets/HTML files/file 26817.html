<p>The trailing <code>%</code> that you have in your <code>LIKE</code> clause is present in your exact search.  The <code>%</code> only has meaning when using <code>LIKE</code>, so it is looking for an exact match of whatever you're passing, but with a <code>%</code> on the end.</p>

<p><code>LIKE 'criteria%'</code> will find anything that BEGINS with <code>criteria</code></p>

<p><code>= 'criteria%'</code> will match that literal <em>exactly</em>, including the %.</p>
