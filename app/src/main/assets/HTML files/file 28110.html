<p>Public key ciphers are not used in any mode of operation, so the technically correct term is "NONE", though the JCE does accept "ECB" as a synonym for legacy compatibility reasons. The string to pass to <code>Cipher.getInstance()</code> should be <code>"RSA/NONE/OAEPWithSHA1AndMGF1Padding"</code>.</p>
