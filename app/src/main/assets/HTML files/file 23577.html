<p>The problem is your constructor is expecting a <code>double array</code> called <code>rainfallArray</code> and the constructor does not contain any arguments; it's empty. Initialize with a double array and it will construct. </p>

<p>Like so:</p>

<pre><code>double [] rain = {1.3, 2.4, 3.5, 6.2}; 
 Rainfall rain = new Rainfall(rain);
... rest of code in main
</code></pre>

<p>Also, your <code>for loops</code> should look like:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; months.size(); i++) 
     {
        if (months[i] &lt; most) 
        {
           m=i;
        }
     }
</code></pre>

<p>If you do it the way you had it before, you will get null pointer exceptions if you don't have an array that is 12 elements in size. Also, keep in mind that arrays are 0 based, so you would want to start your for loop with 1, or set your <code>month</code> variable to 11 if you use the logic you are using now. </p>
