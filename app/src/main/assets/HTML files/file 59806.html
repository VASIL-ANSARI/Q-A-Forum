<p>The problem is not with the length of the string, but that you're trying to update the value in the input field on screen 240k~ times.</p>

<p>A better solution would be to copy the field value to a variable, perform the string concatenation in-memory and then update the finished string only once in the DOM (on screen).</p>

<p>Adding to your code, it would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>i = 1;
var str = i;
i++;
for (i;i&lt;=tableEntries;i++){
str = str + "," + i;
}
selectionField.value = str;
</code></pre>
