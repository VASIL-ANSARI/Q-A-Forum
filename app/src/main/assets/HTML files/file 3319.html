<p>Based on your mapping, the Owner table should have a column called "animal_id" that stores <strong>its</strong> ID (its primary key).  But that's the same as the name of the column that stores the ID (foreign key) of the animal that this instance of Owner has.</p>

<p>Can you post your actual DB schema?</p>
