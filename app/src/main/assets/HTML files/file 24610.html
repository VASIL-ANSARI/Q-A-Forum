<p>Since this sounds like a homework problem, I won't give you the answer straight out, but I'll point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>Let's say you're transposing a 4x4 matrix:</p>

<pre><code>A B C D      A E I M
E F G H  -&gt;  B F J N
I J K L      C G K O
M N O P      D H L P
</code></pre>

<p>If we break that down into four sub-matrices:</p>

<pre><code>A B | C D      A E | I M
E F | G H      B F | J N
----+----  -&gt;  ----+----
I J | K L      C G | K O
M N | O P      D H | L P
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the resulting four sub-matrices are all transposes of the four you started with (with the upper right and lower left matrices swapped). How can you make use of this? :)</p>
