<p>That's really harsh... Alright, You haven't mentioned this, but I suppose, that you try to solve the problem of navigating from UserControl to other page/uc(is it true?). </p>

<p>A couple of edits:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, You don't need an <em>object of class</em> to use a
    NavigationSevice. </li>
<li>Second, the NavigationService is most usually used with <em>pages</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you really <em>do</em> want to use it with UserControl, you should transfer an instance of page to control. But, in my experience, usually, this is not required. I would rather recommend to do in this way:</p>

<p>In your UserControl you will most definitely have the controls with tap/click events. No need to describe their logic in user control class. When you add the user control to page, you should declare it there. Like:</p>

<pre><code>someUserControl.buttonNavigate.MouseLeftButtonUp += new MouseButtonEventHandler(buttonNavigate_Click);
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can use navigation service.</p>

<pre><code>NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri(...));
</code></pre>

<p>That's the easiest solution. Hope it helps.</p>

<p>There are another ones, but I hope this one will solve the problem.</p>
