<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/madr/css3-sass-mixins/blob/master/_all.scss" rel="nofollow">CSS3 Mixin</a> I use that has a variable for IE filters. You could do something similar by having a global variable, $forIE or something, wrap the media query mixin within an if and then generate the stylesheet with or w/o the queries. </p>

<pre><code>@if $forIE == 0 {
    // Media Query Mixin
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or use the @if to import a 3rd scss (_forIE.scss?) that will override things with your IE specific styles.</p>
