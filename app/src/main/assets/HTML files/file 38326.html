<p>I would suggest you make your typeahead code work with any of your possible items on the combobox.  Using SSJS or Java you can build a HashMap of possible typeahead examples but looping through multiple collections.  It works really well.  We use this at the day job effectively.</p>

<p>I did a brief NotesIn9 on this in show 24:  <a href="http://notesin9.com/index.php/2011/02/11/notesin9-24-fancy-type-ahead-in-xpages/" rel="nofollow">http://notesin9.com/index.php/2011/02/11/notesin9-24-fancy-type-ahead-in-xpages/</a></p>

<p>In that show I have a type ahead that works if you type a persons last name OR the first name.  (That's not my best video but you get the concept)</p>

<p>so in your example you could have your typeahead that works against: RecordID OR Requestor OR any other choice.  Then if you really do want to know what was in the combobox you'll gain access to that on the submit.</p>

<p>Works really well....</p>
