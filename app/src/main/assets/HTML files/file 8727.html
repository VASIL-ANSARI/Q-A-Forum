<p>Currently wordpress isn't supported on GAE because of the Wordpress backend (PHP).</p>

<p>I suggest you to switch to another hosting provider with PHP and MySQL support, use the answers in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1086465/blog-engine-for-google-app-engine">Blog engine for Google App Engine</a> or roll your own.</p>

<p>Anyways, its your call... but i strongly suggest you not to try to fit PHP software on GAE, it 's not suited for that.</p>
