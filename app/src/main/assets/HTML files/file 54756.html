<p>I am actually not Mac user but for curiosity I tried to find solution. I see that there is an incompatibility of software with particular OS X version. Most of the solution is shows to upgrade software. Out of many answers following seems correct to me :</p>

<pre><code>gem uninstall therubyracer
gem install therubyracer -v '0.12.2' -- --with-system-v8
</code></pre>

<p>In my Ubuntu system, I am using NodeJS as a javascript runtime. I suggest to use it if possible.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!! </p>
