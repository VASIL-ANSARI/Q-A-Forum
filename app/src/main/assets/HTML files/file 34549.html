<p>So this is a little embarrassing, I have discovered exactly what the problem was. This whole exercise is related to a science fair project my son is doing. He had been programming the Raspberry Pi through WebIDE logged on through his Google Account. I had set up the project to access Glass through my Google account in a separate Chrome browser. Each time I ran get-credentials.py on the Raspberry Pi and it directed me to copy the URL into the browser for approval, I was doing so in my son's browser with his Google account. The credentials were being saved correctly and cards were populating a timeline correctly, but all against my son's Google account and he has no Glass!</p>

<p>I re-ran get-credentials.py, ran the URL in a browser session associated with my own account. Copied the code back to the Pi and now send-to-glass.py works perfectly. My son thinks I'm an idiot and is getting plenty of laughs out of it, but I am pleased to report everything is now working.</p>
