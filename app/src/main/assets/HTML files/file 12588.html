<p>Given that the exact value is 0.3 recurring, neither of them is "correct" - and if you're trying to match <em>exact</em> results of binary floating point calculations, that's generally a bad idea to start with due to the way they work. (See my article on <a href="http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/FloatingPoint.aspx">binary floating point in .NET</a> for some more information.)</p>

<p>It's <em>possible</em> that you shouldn't be using binary floating point in the first place (e.g. if your values represent exact, artificial amounts such as money). Alternatively, it's possible that you should only be doing equality comparisons with a particular tolerance.</p>

<p>It's <em>also</em> possible that C# and C are producing the exact same bit pattern - but you're seeing different results because of how those values are being <em>formatted</em>. Again, I wouldn't use the text representation of numbers for comparisons.</p>
