<p>The <code>distinct</code> is a major problem.  Also, you are turning the <code>left join</code> into an <code>inner join</code> because of the <code>where</code> clause, so this may be what you want:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.id, a.title, a.thumb_image 
FROM artwork a JOIN
     galleries_artwork ga 
     ON a.id = ga.artwork_id 
WHERE ga.galleries_id = $gallery_id 
ORDER BY ga.position
</code></pre>

<p>Indexes on <code>galleries_artwork(galleryies_id, position, artwork_id)</code> and <code>artwork(id, title, thumb_image)</code> would be optimal for this version of the query.</p>
