<p>You can't hide a result if its the same as the previous row. Instead, you would handle it in the code or report.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you are displaying it in a report, you would group the results in the report manager. </p></li>
<li><p>If you are iterating in code, have a variable that keeps track of that column variable. </p>

<p>Initialize the variable with a blank string. Then as you iterate the query's dataset:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the current row value is the same as the variable's value, display a blank. Otherwise, show the row value.</li>
<li>Set the variable to the current row's value.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
