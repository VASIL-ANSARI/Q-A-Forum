<p>NSMutableArray is not guaranteed to be thread-safe â not even just adding objects, because making that thread-safe would require <code>addObject:</code> to be an atomic operation, which is not part of the class's contract.</p>

<p>In general, if the documentation says "This is thread-safe," it is thread-safe (at least in isolation), but if the docs don't say that, you should assume it is unsafe and you need to use synchronization.</p>
