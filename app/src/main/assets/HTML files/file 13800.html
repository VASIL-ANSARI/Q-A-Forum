<p>One way is to create an inline view that gets the customers that have more than one order and the inner join to it. You could also do an IN or EXISTS if you don't like the JOIN</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    `customers`.`id` AS `cust_id`,
    `orders`.`id` AS `order_id`
FROM
    `customers`
LEFT JOIN `orders` ON
    `customers`.`id` = `orders`.`customer_id`
INNER JOIN 
      (SELECT `customer_id `    
       FROM `orders`
       GROUP BY `customer_id`    
       HAVING COUNT(id) &gt; 1) as `morethanone`
On
    `customer`.`id`  = `morethanone`.`custmor_id`
ORDER BY
    `cust_id`
</code></pre>
