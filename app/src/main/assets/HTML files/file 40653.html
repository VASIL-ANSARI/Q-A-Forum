<p>Strings, Booleans and Numbers are passed by value in javascript. You could however wrap <code>targetVariable</code> in an object which would be passed by reference.</p>

<p><code>ctx.target = JSON.parse(data);</code> actually just sets a value for the key <code>target</code> in the <code>ctx</code> object, which would be the <code>window</code> object in your case. It has nothing to do with the parameter <code>target</code> that you pass in as a parameter to your function.</p>

<p>Also your <code>assignDataTo()</code> function runs asynchronously, so calling <code>valueOf(targetVariable)</code> is not going to work, since the Promise is probably not going to be resolved yet ie. the result of the XHR has not arrived yet. A better solution would be something like this.</p>

<pre><code>function assignDataTo(url) {
  // Return a Promise
  return getJSON(url)
    .then(function(data) {
       //resolve the Promise with this value
       return JSON.parse(data);
     }, function(error) {
       console.log(error);
     }
  );
}

var targetVariable;
//wait for the Promise to be resolved and then assign the variable and do whatever with it
assignDataTo(url).then(function(result) {
  targetVariable = result;
  valueOf(targetVariable);
});
</code></pre>
