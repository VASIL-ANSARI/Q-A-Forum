<p>If by "instruction" (which isn't even a thing when it comes to C++'s wording), you mean "expression", then sure: parentheses and the comma operator to the rescue!</p>

<p>SSCCE:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

int main()
{
    int x = (1, 0) ? 2, 3 : (4, 5);
    printf("%d\n", x); // prints 5
}
</code></pre>
