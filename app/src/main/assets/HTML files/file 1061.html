<p>I don't know of a way to do this in CSS. I think your best bet would be to use Javascript: </p>

<ol>
<li>Put the text in a div</li>
<li>Get the dimensions of the div</li>
<li>Make the text smaller if necessary</li>
<li>Go back to step 2 until the text is small enough</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's some <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-7594.html" rel="nofollow">sample code to detect the size of the div</a>. </p>
