<p>I'm no codeigniter expert but using a raw sql query you can do this rather easily. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>$query = "SELECT * FROM activity_feed_table_name GROUP BY post";
</code></pre>

<p>I'm checking the codeigniter docs and its active record implementation supports the groupBy clause.</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;db-&gt;get('yourActivityFeedTable');-&gt;group_by("post");
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't used CI in quite a while so I don't remember exactly the syntax but this might get you on the right track. Let us know if it works!</p>
