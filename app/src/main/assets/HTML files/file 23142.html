<p>What's the type of <code>current_move</code>? If it's <code>char*</code> (or <code>char[]</code>), you are comparing pointers, not strings. Better use <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/" rel="nofollow"><code>std::string</code></a> for <code>current_move</code>, then the comparison with <code>==</code> will work intuitively.</p>

<p>You need to add <code>#include &lt;string&gt;</code>. (In MSVC certain parts of strings also work without that, but it's nonstandard and leads to errors e.g. when passing strings to <code>cout</code>).</p>
