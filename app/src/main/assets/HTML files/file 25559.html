  <p>Exporting packages contained in the Guava jar in the core project has the same results: does not work.</p>

<p>Have your wondered on this ?
As far as I am aware, In eclipse equinox is osgi-container and in osgi we have the facility of using other bundles resources.</p>

<p>So, here make sure that you are exporting the right things from the right place.
Probably, the other bundles are not able to recognize the classes exported from core bundle (check import-package here in all your child bundles) OR 
something mis happenings in classloaders.</p>

<p>Try using "Eclipse-Buddy policy" attribute in manifest .
It may work :-)</p>
