<p>So basically what you tried is what is called chained indexing and may or may not work:</p>

<pre><code>df.iloc[start_ix]['start'] = True
</code></pre>

<p>It may help to think of this as chaining function calls, the problem here is that sometimes it returns a view which is what you intended, but other times it returns a copy resulting in no change in the original df.</p>

<p>So you should use <code>ix</code> which allows you to be explicit in indexing by integer value (or label) and then specifying the column label you want to set the data:</p>

<pre><code>df.ix[start_ix,'start'] = True
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing" rel="nofollow">docs</a> detail the recommended methods, normally a warning will be raised when you are setting the value of a potential copy but it cannot catch all instances.</p>
