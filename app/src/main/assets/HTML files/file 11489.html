<p>are you sure the error is pointing to this .h file? there shouldn't be this error...</p>

<p>if you write the implementation (in .cpp) like this</p>

<pre><code>Room * Graph::findRoom( int roomNumber );
</code></pre>

<p>it should complain, because Room is a part of Graph:</p>

<pre><code>Graph::Room * Graph::findRoom( int roomNumber );
</code></pre>
