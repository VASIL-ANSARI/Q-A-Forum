<p>What you tried has multiple errors:</p>

<pre><code>spot['tipo'] = np.where(['programa']=='CLASSIFICADOES' &amp; ['espec']=='', 'N')
</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>spot['tipo'] = np.where((spot['programa']=='CLASSIFICADOES') &amp; (spot['espec']==''), 'N', spot['tipo'])
</code></pre>

<p>notice the use of brackets which are required due to operator precedence and you need to index the df itself, what you compared was a list with a single entry which was a string.</p>

<pre><code>spot.ix('programa'=='CLASSIFICADOES' &amp; ['espec']=='', 'tipo') = 'N'
</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>spot.ix[(spot['programa']=='CLASSIFICADOES') &amp; (spot['espec']==''), 'tipo'] = 'N'
</code></pre>

<p>for the same reason as above</p>
