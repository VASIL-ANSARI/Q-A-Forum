<p>This is a new feature in iOS 10.</p>

<p><em>From the iOS 10 beta 1 release notes:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>To improve accessibility on websites in Safari, users can now pinch-to-zoom even when a website sets <code>user-scalable=no</code> in the viewport.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I expect we're going to see a JS add-on soon to disable this in some way.</p>
