<p>You are referring to the <em>model</em>, you need to refer to the <em>instance</em> (the object for which the view is showing the details) as relations are for instances and not models. You can get the instance with <code>self.get_object()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
    context = super(QuizDetail, self).get_context_data(**kwargs)
    obj = self.get_object()
    passed_questions = obj.quizquestion_set.filter(...)
    return context
</code></pre>
