<p>This is a known issue which will be fixed in the next release of the <strong>iOS Dropbox app</strong> (not the SDK).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I misdiagnosed this based on the error message. The actual issue is likely that once you've initialized a <code>DBRestClient</code>, it continues to try to use the same user ID for authentication throughout its lifespan. If you unlink that user (even if you've added another user instead), it will fail to authenticate API calls because it no longer has credentials for that user.</p>

<p>The fix is to create a new <code>DBRestClient</code> when you switch to a new user.</p>

<p>This issue is present in the DBRoulette sample app. We're going to try to put in a fix for the next SDK release.</p>
