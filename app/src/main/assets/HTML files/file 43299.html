<p>I'm not sure why you need to process the ajax response via jQuery method. When you can do the same in <code>success</code> method of angular. Anyways, just to process the server response, you just need to pass the data like below:</p>

<pre><code>$http.get(httpUrl).
        success(function(data, status) {
            ajaxHandler(data, status);
         });
</code></pre>
