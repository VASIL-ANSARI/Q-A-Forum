<p>You can't change the mode without reopening because the fstream uses system calls to open files which in turn do not allow a mode change. You can use <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/tellg/" rel="nofollow">tellg</a> / <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/seekg/" rel="nofollow">seekg</a> to save and later restore the reading position, respectively.</p>
