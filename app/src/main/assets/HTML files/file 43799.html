<p>You haven't posted enough here, but usually the cause of an unexpected slowdown in TCP will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Nagle's algorithm</a>. This is triggered when you write small chunks of data to a socket. These would be inefficient to put on the wire on their own so the TCP stack waits for the user program to add more data before it sends out the packet. Only if nothing is added for 'a while' does it actually send an incomplete packet.</p>

<p>This can be disabled, but as your aim is an efficient bulk transfer you probably shouldn't.</p>
