<p>The closure captures the variable not the value. This means that by the time the delegate is executed, ie sometime after the end of the loop, the value of i is 6.</p>

<p>To capture a value, assign it to a variable declared in the loop body. On each iteration of the loop, a new instance will be created for each variable declared within it.</p>

<p>Jon Skeet's <a href="http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter5/Closures.aspx" rel="nofollow">articles on closures</a> has a deeper explanation and more examples.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++)
{
    var copy = i;

    Button newButton = new Button();

    newButton.Text = "Click me!";

    newButton.Click += delegate(Object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("I am button number " + copy);
    };

    this.Controls.Add(newButton);
}
</code></pre>
