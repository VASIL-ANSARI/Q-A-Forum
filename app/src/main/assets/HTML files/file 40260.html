<p>You have to store/remember result of strstr() call, it is where your substring in a string is located</p>

<p>Your manipulation with strlen is useless, as far as I can see, and assigning to <code>c</code> is wrong because you're loosing pointer to heap string which is surely a memory leak</p>

<p>Update</p>

<p>something like</p>

<pre><code>char* r = NULL; // result to be stored here
char* q = strstr(c, p);
if (q != NULL)
{
    r = malloc(200);
    strcpy(r, q);
}
if (r)
    printf("%s \n", r);

// cleanup
if (r)
    free(r);
free(c);
free(p);
</code></pre>
