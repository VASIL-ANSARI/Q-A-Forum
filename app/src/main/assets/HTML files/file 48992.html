<p>This is a common mistake when you are newer to swift.<br>
 - When you segue to VC2, and pass a value to "userToShowDetail".The "didSet" method of "userToShowDetail" will be called.<br>
 - Unfortunately, at this point, your VC2's views are still nil.So you will get this error.<br>
 - The solution is simple,add a "?" after each view in your "didSet" func.
And don't forget to call "didSet" func in VC2's viewDidload.</p>

<pre><code>func configureView() {
if let userToShowDetail: PFUser = self.userToShowDetail {
    if let label == self.userName? {//add "?" to VC2's subviews 
        userName?.text = userToShowDetail["name"] as! String?//add "?" to VC2's subviews 
    }
  }
}

override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  configureView()//call mothed in didSet()
  // other thing you need to do
}
</code></pre>
