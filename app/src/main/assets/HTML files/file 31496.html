<p>Why can't the user just enter "mumble.mydomain.net:64739" if the mumble server is running on 64739? If you really do require the user to not enter the port, and do not want your mumble server to listen on 64738, you may be able to use lighttpd to reverse proxy 64738 to 64739 on your server. See the <a href="http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs_ModProxy" rel="nofollow">mod_proxy</a> documentation for more information. You would want to reverse proxy to host 127.0.0.1 and port 64739.</p>
