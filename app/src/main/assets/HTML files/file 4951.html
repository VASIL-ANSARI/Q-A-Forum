<p>Performance between processes will never match local COM to an in-process server, since in-process COM calls reduce to a simple function call on the calling thread.  For inter-process traffic, there is ALWAYS going to be marshaling and context switching overhead that makes this slower.</p>

<p>Taking that one step further, it's unlikely you will build anything as simple as what you have with COM that performs anything like as well as COM.  For local out-of-process servers, COM will run over an optimized RPC stack called <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc738291%28WS.10%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">LRPC</a>.</p>
