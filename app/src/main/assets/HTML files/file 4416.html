<p>I don't know about MySQL, but here's how I would try to do it in SQL Server, and bringing perhaps some adjustments depending on the results which make sense.</p>

<pre><code>select Category
        , Film
        , MAX(Votes) as Votes
    from (
        select TOP 3 c.category_name as Category
                , vd.video_id as Film
                , COUNT(vt.votes) as Votes
            from Category c
                inner join Video vd on vd.category_id = c.category_id
                inner join Votes vt on vt.video_id = vd.video_id
            where c.category_id = 10 -- HipHop
            group by c.category_name
                , vd.video_id
        union
        select TOP 3 c.category_name
                , vd.video_id
                , COUNT(vt.votes) as Votes
            from Category c
                inner join Video vd on vd.category_id = c.category_id
                inner join Votes vt on vt.video_id = vd.video_id
            where c.category_id = 11 -- Rap
            group by c.category_name
                , vd.video_id
        -- You need as much UNION as there are categories.
    ) Top3VotesPerCategory
    group by Category
        , Film
</code></pre>

<p>Depending whether you accepte downvotes on a film, one could register a negative vote a film, and this wouldn't mean that he recommends this video. If you do support such functional feature, then you might want to consider a conditional <code>SUM()</code>, instead of a <code>COUNT()</code>, for the number of votes, so that negative votes would be considered and would decrease its overall points in regards of votes.</p>
