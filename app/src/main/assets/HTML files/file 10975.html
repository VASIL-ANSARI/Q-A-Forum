<p>In Android activities are managed on a (back-) stack. Which means you can start a new activity and it is pushed onto the stack and is the activity shown. When going back via finish() this top activity is popped from the stack. </p>

<p>Stacks and trees work together quite well. When you move around in a tree you can keep the path to the root on a stack. This way managing trees of activities is what Android is actually made for. </p>

<p>Going down in the tree means calling the activity of the child node. Going up again is done by simply finishing your activity. You automatically appear at the activty one level up in the tree.</p>
