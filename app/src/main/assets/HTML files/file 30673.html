<p>What the <code>(Weapon[]) null</code> means would be that the parameter you are sending will be null. So your constructor in the <code>WeaponCombination</code> class would be <code>(String, null)</code> rather than <code>(String, Weapon...)</code> . This means that you are effectively not passing any weapons into the class. A possible workaround is to check for null in your <code>WeaponCombination</code> class and if you get it then you should include all the weapons. Or you could cycle through all the item ids in a for loop and create an array of weapons that way</p>
