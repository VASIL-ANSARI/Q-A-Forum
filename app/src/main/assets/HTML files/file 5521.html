<p>i guess that happens because rails tries to protect your form CSRF attacks.</p>

<p>you can comment out the <code>protect_from_forgery</code> line in your ApplicationController to test it.</p>

<p>but im not sure if thats the right way of dealing with this issue in the production environment.</p>
