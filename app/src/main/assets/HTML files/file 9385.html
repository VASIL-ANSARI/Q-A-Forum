<p>Do you need to convert a decimal string to a binary string or to a value?</p>

<p>Rule of thumb 10^3 ~= 2^10, therefore 10^20 ~= 2^70 > 64 bits (67 to be accurate).</p>

<p>==> A 64bit integer will not not be enough. You can you a structure with 2 64bit integers (long long in C) or even a 8bit byte for the upper part and 64 for the lower part.
Make sure the lower part is unsigned.</p>

<p>You will need to write code that checks for overflow on lower part and increases upper part when this happens. You will also need to use the long division algorithm once you cross the 64bit line.</p>
