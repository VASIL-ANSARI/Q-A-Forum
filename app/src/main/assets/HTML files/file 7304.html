<p>It can help performance a little bit, but only if you are accessing the object directly through its declaration. Reference parameters and such cannot be optimized, since there might be other paths to an object not originally declared const, and the compiler generally can't tell if the object you are referencing was actually declared const or not unless that's the declaration you are using.</p>

<p>If you are using a const declaration, the compiler will know that externally-compiled function bodies, etc. cannot modify it, so you get a benefit there. And of course things like const int's are propagated at compile time, so that's a huge win (compared to just an int).</p>

<p>References and pointers are stored exactly the same, they just behave differently syntactically. References are basically renamings, and so are relatively safe, whereas pointers can point to lots of different things, and are thus more powerful and error-prone.</p>

<p>I guess the const pointer would be architecturally identical to the reference, so the machine code and efficiency would be the same. the real difference is syntax -- references are a cleaner, easier to read syntax, and since you don't need the extra machinery provided by a pointer, a reference would be stylistically preferred.</p>
