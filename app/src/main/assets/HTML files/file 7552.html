<p>Why not use a static variable <code>static volatile int threadRuns</code>, which is initialized with the number threads Method_01 and Method_02 will be run.
Then you modify each of those two methods to decrement <code>threadRuns</code> just before exit:</p>

<pre><code>...
lock(typeof(MyClass)) {
    --threadRuns;
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the beginning of Method_03 you wait until threadRuns is 0 and then proceed:</p>

<pre><code>while(threadRuns != 0)
   Thread.Sleep(10);
</code></pre>

<p>Did I understand the quesiton correctly?</p>
