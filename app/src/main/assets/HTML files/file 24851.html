<p>You're not running an event loop anywhere. Instead, you're just initializing everything, and then going to sleep for 10 seconds. During that 10 seconds, your code is doing nothing, because that's what you told it to do. That means no updating the screen, responding to mouse clicks, or anything else.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to drive pygame, but the simplest is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: sys.exit()
        # any other event handling you need
    # all the idle-time stuff you want to do each frame
    # usually ending with pygame.display.update() or .flip()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>As a side note, your initialization code has a bunch of problems. You iterate through three drivers, but you only set <code>SDL_VIDEODRIVER</code> once, so you're just trying <code>'fbcon'</code> three times in a row. Also, you've got code to detect the X display, but you don't allow pygame/SDL to use X, soâ¦ whatever you were trying to do there, you're not doing it. Finally, you don't need a <code>found</code> flag in Python for loops; just use an <code>else</code> clause.</p>
