<p>I don't think there is a setting for such things.</p>

<p>But, there is a tool called Resharper that do something like what you need. Instead of replacing <code>T</code> you get an empty <code>&lt;|&gt;</code> with the cursor ready to write the <code>type</code>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There may be other tools that do the same.</p>
