<p><code>nn_</code> is a macro. You can find the definition by searching the repository for <code>"#define nn_"</code>; it's in <a href="https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/fdfcd12d789a885458222e4f7475e74a3ebc516f/init.c"><code>init.c</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>#define nn_(NAME) TH_CONCAT_3(nn_, Real, NAME)
</code></pre>

<p>You can keep following the chain of macro definitions, and you'll probably end up with some token pasting thing that makes <code>nn_(Tanh_updateOutput)</code> expand to the name of the function.</p>

<p>(It's weird that <code>generic/Tanh.c</code> doesn't have any includes; <code>generic/Tanh.c</code> must be included by some other file. That's unusual for <code>.c</code> files.)</p>
