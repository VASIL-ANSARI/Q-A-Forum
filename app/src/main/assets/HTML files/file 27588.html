<p><code>com.mycompanyname.beta</code> and <code>com.mycompanyname.android</code> are different package names, so no, they won't conflict. </p>

<p>If a user has the first app installed (<code>com.mycompanyname.beta</code>), and then installs the second one (<code>com.mycompanyname.android</code>), they will end up with both apps installed on their device.</p>
