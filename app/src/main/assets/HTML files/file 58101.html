<p><code>abs(x)</code> is always somewhat dangerous as it is non-differentiable. Most solvers expect problems to be smooth. Note that we can drop the <code>log</code> from your objective function and then drop the <code>1</code>, so we are left with minimizing <code>abs(x)</code>. Often this can be done better by the following.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>min abs(x)</code> use </p>

<pre><code>min t
-t &lt;= x &lt;= t
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this requires a solver that can solve (linearly) constrained NLPs.</p>
