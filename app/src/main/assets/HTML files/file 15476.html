<p>There is a hard limit of 4 allowed regex criteria per query.  It was fixed in the core mongo code about six months ago: <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/62554d064a264f9b6c28099ba71421f250bbbba9" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/62554d064a264f9b6c28099ba71421f250bbbba9</a></p>

<p>It looks like this fix has not been pulled into the 1.8 or 2.0 branches of mongo yet, here's the v1.8 branch showing the hard limit: <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/v1.8/db/matcher.cpp#L159" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/v1.8/db/matcher.cpp#L159</a></p>
