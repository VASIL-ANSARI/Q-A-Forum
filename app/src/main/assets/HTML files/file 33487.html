<p>You are not actually passing the volumeInfos variable to your template as such, but you are passing the "books" array.</p>

<p>Try something like :</p>

<pre><code>{% for book in books %}
    {{ book.volumeInfo['title'] }} // Might not be the right syntax but the idea is to iterate over "books"
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure about your definition of books though, what error message do you see exactly ?</p>
