<p>As Vincent has mentioned in his comment, the table needs a value or the lack thereof for the 'HUN2' column. Either ways, it needs to stated either explicitly or implicitly :</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>If you have a value to insert for that particular column, insert it. If you don't have a value (<em>for this particular record</em>) then you
  need to state that explicitly (by inserting a <code>NULL</code> value).</li>
  <li>If the value of 'HUN2' is most likely to be a particular value for most records or atleast to begin with, (<em>but, might change
  thereafter</em>), then you might set that value as default.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This aforementioned particular value can be an actual value or the lack thereof (<code>NULL</code>). That is, NULL itself can be set as the default value.</p>

<p>Based on business rules, you can decide which of the two options mentioned above you'd like to go with.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!!!</p>
