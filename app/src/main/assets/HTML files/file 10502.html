<p>Try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `name`, COUNT(id) as operations
FROM myTable
WHERE create_time BETWEEN DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL -7 DAY) AND NOW()
GROUP BY `name` 
ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
LIMIT 50;
</code></pre>

<p>This will count the number of operations for each operation name, sort the results by the count and only return 50 records. Please note that this is exactly seven days of history, in other words if you run the query at noon, the beginning of the range will be noon 7 days ago. </p>
