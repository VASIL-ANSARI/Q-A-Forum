<p>Seems that creating maps for each nullable type to itself like: </p>

<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>Mapper.CreateMap&lt;int?, int?&gt;()
    .ConvertUsing(v =&gt; v);
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to work as a fix. But I would rather have a complete solution with all nullable types then specifiyng them one by one. Easy to miss something. </p>
