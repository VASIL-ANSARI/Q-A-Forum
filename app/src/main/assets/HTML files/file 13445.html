<p>From the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/debugging/debugging-projects-cmdline.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are not using Eclipse to develop, you can still take advantage of all the tools that the Android SDK provides for debugging. A basic debugging environment consists of:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>ADB</li>
  <li>DDMS</li>
  <li>Java Debugger</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You need to obtain a JDWP-compliant Java debugger to properly debug your application. Most Java IDEs will already have one included, or you can use a command line debugger, such as JDB, if you are using a simple text editor to develop applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JDB seems to come standard with the JDK.</p>
