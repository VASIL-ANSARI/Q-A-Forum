<p>As the link you posted says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interface definition for a callback to be invoked when the focus state of a view changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and if you read what the <code>params</code> mean</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parameters</p>
  
  <p>v         The view whose state has changed.</p>
  
  <p>hasFocus  The new focus state of v.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you set this on a <code>EditText</code>, or multiple <code>EditText</code>s, you can use the <code>v</code> param to know which <code>View</code>s focus has changed. And you can use <code>hasFocus</code> to determine if it did just gain focus (<code>returns true</code>) or if it has just lost focus because it was given to someone else (<code>returns false</code>).</p>

<p>So, maybe you want to start some <code>animation</code> on a <code>View</code> when focus is changed on it or another <code>View</code>, you set this listener and when it is invoked you can start the <code>animation</code> if <code>hasFocus</code> returns <code>true</code>. </p>

<p>If you are still confused then please explain <em>what</em> you don't understand about it.</p>

<p>As for the docs not giving much information, they assume that when reading this you have adequate information of what <code>listeners</code> and methods do and about how to use <code>parameters</code> that it takes and returns. The docs also expect a certain knowledge of Java. So for your other question, I know if I don't understand something because I don't think the Android docs have covered it thoroughly, then I would check the Java docs.</p>
