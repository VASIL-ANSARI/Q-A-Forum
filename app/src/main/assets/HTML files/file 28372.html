<p><code>number1</code> and <code>number2</code> are both parameters. Parameters are declared when you write:</p>

<pre><code>(int number1, int number2)
</code></pre>

<p>This means that whenever you call the function, you are passing values into those two variables automatically as parameters.</p>

<p>For example, when you write: <code>add(n1, n2)</code> you are telling it to run that function and substitute n1 in for number1 and n2 in for number2.</p>
