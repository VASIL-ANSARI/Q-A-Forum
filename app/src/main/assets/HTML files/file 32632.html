<p>You should definitely use the <code>websocket-rails</code> gem, I am personnaly using it for a debate website which I'm creating from scratch.</p>

<p>It is using, as the name refers, <strong>Websockets</strong>. This technology is being more and more used, and is now compatible with most of the browsers, it has indeed an excellent compatibility.</p>

<p><code>websocket-rails</code> has a lot of documentation, I also had some trouble using it for advanced usage, and got my happiness contacting their devs directly on their irc channel, they are very nice.</p>

<p>For your need, I think that <strong>Websockets</strong> are much more convenient than <strong>Ajax</strong>, for for your need, <strong>Ajax</strong> needs to ask the server each x second if there's something new to refresh. That will exhaust your server, but when using <strong>Websockets</strong>, the server will send you directly the new data that you need. You can find more info for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10029326/1468585">this choice on this SO answer.</a></p>

<p>It handles private channels, if the data exchanged need not to be public as well, <code>websocket-rails</code> is definitely the way to go !
