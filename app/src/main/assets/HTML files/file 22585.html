<p>Everything you need to do is enumerate all processes and find the process
to which your handle belongs to.
..NET doesn't provide the AFI for this, you need to dive deeper, more deep
then WINAPI - to the nt.dll level, where you can find undocumented ZwQueryObject().</p>

<p>Using this methods is not a simple task, because it returns name and info
about handle belonging to the YOUR process.
So, you need to perform additional task - use DuplicateHandle() to bring
external handle to your process.</p>

<p>I recomend you to study this sample <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/W-P/system/processesmodules/article.php/c2827" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/W-P/syst...icle.php/c2827</a></p>

<p>which provide all functional u requre.</p>
