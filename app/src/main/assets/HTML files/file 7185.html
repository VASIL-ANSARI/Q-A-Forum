<p>getResponseCode() shouldn't be causing it to get stuck, as it simply reads the response that it got after making the connection. My guess is its actually the connection attempt that is hanging. If you're developing for 5.0 or higher, take a look at the <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/5.0.0api/net/rim/device/api/io/transport/ConnectionFactory.html" rel="nofollow">ConnectionFactory</a> class to make sure your connection is being created properly.</p>
