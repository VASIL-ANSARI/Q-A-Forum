<p>Depending on how regular your file is, it may be this simple in python:</p>

<pre><code>with open('inputfile.txt') as fh:
  # To iterate over the entire file.
  for country in fh:
    cityLines = [next(fh) for _i in range(2)]

    # read a blank line to advance countries.
    next(fh)
</code></pre>

<p>That's not likely to be exactly right, because I imagine many countries have variable numbers of cities.  You could modify it like so to address that:</p>

<pre><code>with open('inputfile.txt') as fh:
  # To iterate over the entire file.
  for country in fh:
    # we assume here that each country has at least 1 city.
      cities = [next(fh).strip()]

      while cities[-1]: # will continue until we encounter a blank line.
        cities.append(next(fh).strip())
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't do anything to put the data into an output file, or store it much past the file handle itself, but it's a start.  You really should choose a language for your questions though.  A lot of the time until </p>
