<p>Use a second <code>cmd</code> prompt.</p>

<p>Or use a terminal emulator which supports multiple tabs. I don't know if Windows <code>cmd</code> supports the <em>send to background execution</em> command, like the <code>&amp;</code> of the Unix <code>sh</code>.</p>

<p>If it is available, you should be able to run the <code>serve</code> in background and have your prompt ready for other commands. Under <code>sh</code> I would do</p>

<pre><code>$ php artisan serve &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>but I usually don't send to background so that I can kill it easily.</p>

<p>I would definitely go for two terminals.</p>
