<p>You can't access the variable but you can access the variable from the the value stack using OGNL. See <a href="http://struts.apache.org/docs/ognl-basics.html" rel="nofollow">OGNL Basics</a> to learn more about variables in Struts and how to use them. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Besides the examples and descriptions given above, there are a few major changes in the EL since WebWork 1.x. The biggest one is that properties are no longer accessed with a forward slash <code>/</code> but with a dot <code>.</code>. Also, rather than using <code>..</code> to traverse down the stack, we now use <code>[n]</code> where n is some positive number. Lastly, in WebWork 1.x one could access special named objects (the request scope attributes to be exact) by using <code>@foo</code>, but now special variables are accessed using <code>#foo</code>. However, it is important to note that <code>#foo</code> does <em>not</em> access the request attributes. Because XWork is not built only for the web, there is no concept of "request attributes", and thus <code>#foo</code> is merely a request to another object in the <code>OgnlContext</code> other than the root.</p>

<p>To include JSP content dynamically use <a href="http://struts.apache.org/docs/include.html" rel="nofollow"><code>s:include</code></a> tag</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Include a servlet's output (result of servlet or a JSP page).</p>
  
  <p>Note: Any additional <code>params</code> supplied to the included page are not accessible within the rendered page through the <code>&lt;s:property...&gt;</code> tag since no valuestack will be created. You can, however, access them in a servlet via the <code>HttpServletRequest</code> object or from a JSP page via a scriptlet.</p>
  
  <p><strong>How To access parameters</strong></p>
  
  <p>Parameters are passed as request parameters, so use the <code>${param.ParamName}</code> notation to access them. Do not use the property tag to access parameters in included files.</p>
