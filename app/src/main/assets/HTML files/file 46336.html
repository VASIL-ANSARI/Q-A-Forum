<p>It is a bad idea to have JAVA_HOME set to a folder in "c:\program files..." because of the space in the folder name. Whenever this value is used as a command line argument, the receiver would interprete it as two arguments ("C:\program" and "file...").</p>

<p>Move your jdk into a folder without space in the name, and correct your JAVA_HOME variable.</p>

<p>BTW: eclipse resolves first the system PATH variable in order to find a suitable java SDK. It's a good practice, to declare the desired SDK in the eclipse.ini file (in eclipse install-folder). Add there an argument:</p>

<pre><code>....
-vm 
C:\JDK8\bin\javaw.exe
-vmargs 
-Xms40m 
-Xmx384m
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the -vm arg and its value must appear on separete lines and must be placed just before the -vmargs argument.</p>
