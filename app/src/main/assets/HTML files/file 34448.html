<p>At the login time you take username, loginid in session variable, right!
Same as just take the user type value to as the session user type, and then based on this user type session you can go for further.
If your are login as admin take user type as admin or else whatever kind of user you are, just take it as user type.
Hope it will work for you.</p>
