<p>If you want your function to be executed after the page load, you simply need to invoke it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$( document ).ready(function() {
    myFunction();
});
</code></pre>

<p>It will be executed only once but note that it may overlap with the setInterval call if the they are executed asynchronousy (they are by default).</p>
