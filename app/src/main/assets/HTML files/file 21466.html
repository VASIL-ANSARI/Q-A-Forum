<p>Variable substitution in PDO prepared statements doesn't support arrays.  It's one for one.  </p>

<p>You can get around that problem by generating the number of placeholders you need based on the length of the array.  </p>

<pre><code>$variables = array ('1', '2', '3');
$placeholders = str_repeat ('?, ',  count ($variables) - 1) . '?';

$query = $pdo -&gt; prepare ("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IN($placeholders)");
if ($query -&gt; execute ($variables)) {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
