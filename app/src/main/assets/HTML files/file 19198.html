<p>Server's work folder has apparently become dirty. Can happen. There are too many possible factors which can cause this. The server is intensively hotpublishing/hotdeploying during development and perhaps, at a concurrent moment, a file becomes locked whereby an unlock is overlooked/cancelled for some reason, which in turn causes that a clean is impossible during hotdeploy. That could be a bug in the IDE, the server or the plugin used, who knows.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to shutdown the server and then perform the usual clean/rebuild/redeploy/restart process.</p>
