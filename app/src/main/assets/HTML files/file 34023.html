<p>If "b" is embedded in a container view of "a", then it is already instantiated when "a" gets instantiated. Therefore, when you use instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:, you are creating a new instance, NOT the one you have on screen. Your viewDidLoad should look like this instead,</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad]; 
    _viewControllers = self.childViewControllers[0];
    .....code....
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to get a reference to the embedded view controller is in prepareForSegue, which will be called right after your "a" controller is instantiated. Your "b" controller will be  segue.destinationViewController.</p>
