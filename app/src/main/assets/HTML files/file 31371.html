<p>I added code to run closeBT function at the end of the sendData function. if you don't close the connection, I think it is hanging in the process of sending.</p>

<pre><code>void sendData() throws IOException {
try {

    // the text typed by the user
    String msg = myTextbox.getText().toString();
    msg += "\n";

    mmOutputStream.write(msg.getBytes());

    // tell the user data were sent
    myLabel.setText("Data Sent");

}   catch (NullPointerException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
     } catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
   }
}
</code></pre>
