<p>After long time, I saw this without an answer. I discovered the fail of this some time ago. This issue occurred because, when reaching server side, for some reason a batch file I did not noiced was adding an additional line to my content, and whenever I read the request content with my proxies, I used a "\n" delimiter, I mean, I have been reading my data using as the EOF indicator a line jump, that's why the content was never shown. I had to modify the code inside my proxy to allow reading the request until the end, not when finding a "\n" character. I mean, the content of the post was set in every case, but a batch process was corrupting that data. So thata was the issue, I just solved it by making sure that my reader always read my entire file considering even line jumps and white lines.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
