<p>Unless your heavy function calls are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm" rel="nofollow">deterministic</a>, and you can prove that they are always called with the same parameters, you can't do it.</p>

<p>For example, in C#</p>

<pre><code>var lst = new List&lt;string&gt; { "Foo", "Bar" };

bool r1 = lst.Remove("Foo"); // true, and has modified lst
bool r2 = lst.Remove("Foo"); // false, and hasn't modified lst

bool r3 = lst.Remove("Bar"); // true, and has modified lst, note different parameter
bool r4 = lst.Remove("Baz"); // false, and hasn't modified lst, note different parameter
</code></pre>

<p>How can you detect if <code>Remove</code> is deterministic or not? You can't (technically you could disassemble it and check it, but it is very difficult)... And then how could you detect if it is being called with the same parameters? This is doable, but quite difficult.</p>

<p>Now... as a test job... I see three possibilities: </p>

<ul>
<li>it is a false test, where you must comprehend this and report it</li>
<li>you didn't comprehend the test job</li>
<li>you didn't give us some important informations (for example that you have to replace some specific method calls that don't have parameters and are static or something similar, and that are guaranteed to be deterministic)</li>
</ul>
