<p>.IIF files have been deprecated, and officially unsupported, for 10+ years now. </p>

<p>They are known to cause corruption to QuickBooks data files. </p>

<p>Do not use them. </p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/docs/0250_qb" rel="nofollow">QuickBooks SDK</a> instead. It provides a XML/COM interface directly to QuickBooks that is very well documented and reliable. </p>
