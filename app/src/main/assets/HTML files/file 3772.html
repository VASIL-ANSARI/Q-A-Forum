<p>What about the code that registers your click events? Can you show that? </p>

<p>I don't see any id attribute for your RelativeLayout, so my stab is that you haven't even registered an OnClickPendingIntent for the RelativeLayout for which you want to handle click events. And perhaps you <em>have</em> created an intent for the ImageView, which is receiving the touch events, but not the dpad click events, because it's parent (the RelativeLayout) has requested focus (and has no click event-handler).</p>
