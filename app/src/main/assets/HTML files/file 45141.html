<p>Not sure if this is the reason, but in your code example</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a class="menu-toggle"&gt;menu&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Should not be ending in <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> but the <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> tag it was started in.</p>

<p>Also, this sounds like there could be a <code>walker</code> that's affecting your Wordpress menu, usually found within your functions.php file.</p>
