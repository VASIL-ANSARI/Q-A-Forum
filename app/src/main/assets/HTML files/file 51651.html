<p>I now understand the issue. The last time I implemented an interface, the interface itself had been imported from another file. I didnt know that I needed to actually write the interface out. I thought it might have been included in Java frameworks like Lists, Sets, Maps, etc... </p>

<p>Anywho I needed to create a Buffer.java:</p>

<pre><code>public interface Buffer {
    public void put(int value) throws InterruptedException;

    public int get() throws InterruptedException; }
</code></pre>
