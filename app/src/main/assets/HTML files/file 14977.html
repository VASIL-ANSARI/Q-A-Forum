<p>No, using a MouseListener for this is kind of crazy, and you yourself say that it's a dirty solution. Instead I think you're much better off using a PropertyChangeListener to listen to the states of your classes, most likely the Model class, and none of the view classes.</p>

<p>For example, the user pushes a JButton (a component in the view class), the control class reacts to this button push and tells the model to change its state. Your status pane's PropertyChangeListener will then respond to the model's state change and update its own view. It's the cleanest most OOPs way to solve this problem.</p>

<p>For this to work well, your program should be based on one of the variants of the model-view-controller pattern, but then it should be doing this anyway.</p>
