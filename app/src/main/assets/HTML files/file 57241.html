<p>The purpose of overriding the toString class is to format it however you want it. Yes, the format is typically an object or class name with a comma-separated list of all of the fields that you would like displayed with an accompanying name for the fields (e.g. 'date='datevalue). toString is a very useful debugging tool if you write the method to display the variables that you are testing. </p>
