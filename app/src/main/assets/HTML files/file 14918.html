<p>If I understand your question correctly, something like this might work.</p>

<pre><code>def dostuff():
    ABC = raw_input("Enter Number (q exits): ")

    if(ABC.lower() == 'q'):  #Allow the user to enter q at this point to exit
       return False

    Product = int(raw_input("Enter Product:"))

    #do stuff to print out the cost of these items.

    #We could forgo the next lines and always return True here assuming the user
    #has more input if they didn't input 'q' for 'ABC'.  That's up to you.

    #return True

    print "Do you have more purchases [Y/N]?"
    answer=raw_input()
    return answer.upper() == 'Y'

while dostuff():
    pass

#same as:  
#while True:
#   if(not dostuff()): 
#      break
</code></pre>
