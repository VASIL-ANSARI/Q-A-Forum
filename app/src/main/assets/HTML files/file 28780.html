<p>This is the way things are supposed to work when the user clicks on a button that fires a PendingIntent created with PendingIntent.getActivity(); presumably if a button in a notification navigates to a new activity, you want the notification panel to get out of the way so you can see it.</p>

<p>If you want to implement transport controls in your notification, use <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html#getBroadcast%28android.content.Context,%20int,%20android.content.Intent,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">PendingIntent.getBroadcast</a> or <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html#getService%28android.content.Context,%20int,%20android.content.Intent,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">.getService()</a>.</p>
