<p>You have to bind the source on every postback in the init event of the page.</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Binding here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then read the .SelectedValue or SelectedItem in the Page_Load, Button_Click or whatever method that comes at or after the load event.</p>

<p>If you don't use a bound datasource control(eg DataScource in the page itself) a controls ViewState will not be filled. The DataSource is responsible for that (eg caching). ViewState values are mostly state values of the control. A datasource has to be populated every time the page is rendered, unless the data is kept in the ViewState as well which is again the responsibility of the DataSource providing the data.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, it's been a long time for me since ASP.NET forms.</p>

<p>From what I remember is that WebForms can be simple as long as you follow this pattern of populating during init and doing logic in or after the load events.</p>

<hr>

<p>Additional:
I overlooked what 'anonymous' is saying, you are indeed creating the control in your code, but by the looks of it you are not adding it to the page controls. Look whether you can add it to the aspx itself and then populate it or add it by using this.Controls.Add(fooBar) or this.Page.Controls.Add(fooBar). where this should refer to the Page instance.</p>

<p>Still the same principles as above apply. Good luck!</p>
