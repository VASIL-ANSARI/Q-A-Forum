<p>This appears to be a classpath error relating to Slf4j. Looking at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opennetinf/source/browse/build/build.xml#74" rel="nofollow">build file</a>, this project seems to use Slf4j 1.5.6.</p>

<p>Make sure that the following 2 jar files are in your classpath:</p>

<pre><code>slf4j-api-1.5.6.jar 
slf4j-log4j12-1.5.6.jar
</code></pre>

<p>Also make sure that there are no other slf4j jars in the classpath.</p>
