  <p><strong>PublicKeyToken = null</strong> tells you that the <code>CLR</code> is looking for the unsigned assembly. Since you signed them, that's not going to work
  well and this behavior is expected.</p>

<p>You will have to rebuild the program so it uses the updated signed assembly and embeds the non-null <strong>PublicKeyToken</strong> into the manifest. You may have to remove the existing assembly reference and add it back, it isn't clear from the question whether you built the program using an unsigned copy.</p>

<p>If you still can't figure out which file fails loading, try using a tool such as <code>Fusion Log Viewer</code> (run <code>fuslogvw.exe</code> from the Visual Studio command prompt), to determine which files the <code>CLR</code> was trying to load and from where, so that you can see exactly what failed.</p>
