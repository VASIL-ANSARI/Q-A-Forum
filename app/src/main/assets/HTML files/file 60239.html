<p>According to Danielle Mead, "You'd have to make the brand a category and then you could apply a custom page template to it. You can't apply custom templates to brands."  David Inman also contributed, "We do this all the time. Just redirect the Brand URL to your Category and apply the custom template to that."</p>

<p>Since BigCommerce doesn't allow custom templates to be added to the brands, a new category with the desired products must be added.  Categories <em>do</em> allow custom templates, so applying the custom template to the category will allow both custom category content and the desired products to be displayed.  A redirect can then be applied to send users to the category page rather than the brand page.</p>
