<p>What are you using for your repeater?</p>

<p>Have you looked at the default "DataBound" application template? This displays a collection of objects in a ListBox using data binding.<br>
It sounds like you're trying to do the same thing, only your collection (array) is first populated by parsing an XML feed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>

I've now got a complete working example available for download at <a href="http://cid-cc22250598bf7f04.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/ShowCommentsDemo.zip" rel="nofollow">http://cid-cc22250598bf7f04.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/ShowCommentsDemo.zip</a></p>
