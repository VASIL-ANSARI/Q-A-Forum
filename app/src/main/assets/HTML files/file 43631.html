<p><strong>For your first question:</strong> </p>

<p>What kind of hosting (Tomcat, GlassFish or whatever...) are you using, and what is the Java version of the host? I know from experience that different version of Tomcat in combination with Jersey sometimes gives problems with <code>@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>About your second question:</strong></p>

<p>You want to build a RESTful webservice, the right name for a path should be; <em>VehicleTrackingData</em> (or whatever you like). This path will work (request/response) with the known HTTP verbs; GET, POST, PUT or DELETE.</p>
