<p>You have property for UITextField like inputAccessoryView so it is over riding it. If possible</p>

<p>Just change the name of the view from</p>

<pre><code>-(UIView *)inputAccessoryView;
</code></pre>

<p>to some name</p>

<pre><code>-(UIView *)alertDisplayView;
</code></pre>

<p>This will fix..! Exactly I don't no why u have taken view with name inputAccessoryView..!</p>

<p>Hope it helps you..!</p>
