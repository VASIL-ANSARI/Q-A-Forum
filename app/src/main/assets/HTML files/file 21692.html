<p>This might not be doable with MediaPlayer, but for audio you can do it with <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/SoundPool.html" rel="nofollow">SoundPool</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The playback rate can also be changed. A playback rate of 1.0 causes
  the sound to play at its original frequency (resampled, if necessary,
  to the hardware output frequency). A playback rate of 2.0 causes the
  sound to play at twice its original frequency, and a playback rate of
  0.5 causes it to play at half its original frequency. The playback rate range is 0.5 to 2.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn't mention this in your original question, but if you want to maintain pitch while changing the frequency, you'd need to provide a pitch-shift algorithm.  Perhaps there's one in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">android.media.audiofx</a> package - there's a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/AudioEffect.html#queryEffects%28%29" rel="nofollow">queryEffects()</a> method that might return some type of pitch shifter.</p>

<p>For MediaPlayer, you might look at the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html#attachAuxEffect%28int%29" rel="nofollow">attachAuxEffect</a> method that would let you process the audio stream.</p>
