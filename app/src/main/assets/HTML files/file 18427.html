<p>I'm not sure it's possible. Besides, there is no guarantee the RingtonePreference is going to open the System's ringtone picker. The user might have another app installed that has an activity with the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/RingtoneManager.html#ACTION_RINGTONE_PICKER" rel="nofollow">android.intent.action.RINGTONE_PICKER</a> intent filter declared in the manifest and he might even have it as the default Ringtone picker.</p>

<p>You might implement a custom RingtonePreference and a custom RingtonePickerActivity and force your custom Ringtone picker to be open but you might irritate your users.</p>

<p>If I may ask, for what reason would you like to change it anyway?</p>
