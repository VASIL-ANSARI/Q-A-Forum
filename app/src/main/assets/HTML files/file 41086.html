<p>If your inner loop starts with <code>i</code>, it has to end with <code>height + i</code>, not just <code>height</code> for the output to be square, otherwise it will be a triangle. You want to learn about the <em>modulo</em> operator <code>%</code> to determine the <em>remainder</em> of a division in order to handle the "overflow".</p>

<p>The specification you gave is unclear about what should happen regarding the "overflow" if <code>startNum != 1</code>.</p>

<p>Besides, the guard condition <code>(startNum == height)</code> is clearly wrong if <code>height</code> actually means <em>height</em> (and, because it says <em>printSquare</em>, the <em>width</em>). I would expect <code>printSquare(4, 4)</code> to print four rows and columns, not just one row and one column. Something  seems to be wrong with the naming.
<em>In general such guards are suspicious. The code of algorithms should be so generic that it doesn't need to handle such special cases separately.</em></p>

<p>Here's a possible implementation which works for the cases <code>printSquare(1, 5);</code> and     <code>printSquare(1, 1);</code>. For other cases, your specification wasn't clear enough.</p>

<pre><code>public class Main {
    public static void main(final String... args) {
        printSquare(1, 5);
        printSquare(1, 1);
        //printSquare(2, 6);
        //printSquare(4, 4);
    }

    public static void printSquare(int startNum, int height) {
        for (int i = startNum; i &lt; startNum + height; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j &lt; height + i; j++) {
                System.out.print((j - 1) % height + 1);
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the end number is not determined by <code>height</code> alone but by <code>startNum + height - 1</code>, a possible solution looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    public static void printSquare(int startNum, int height) {
        for (int i = startNum; i &lt; startNum + height; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; height; j++) {
                System.out.print((j + i - startNum) % (height) + startNum);
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
</code></pre>
