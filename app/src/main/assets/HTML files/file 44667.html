<p>As aspsmn said, try ...</p>

<pre><code>svg:hover .st1 {
    transform: scale(0.8);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I built a fiddle (<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/rfornal/pv0np9pw/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/rfornal/pv0np9pw/</a>) to test this and actually tried with a scale up to 1.2 ... this became an issue since I hadn't changed the size of the viewbox.</p>

<p>However, this did prove the working concept.</p>
