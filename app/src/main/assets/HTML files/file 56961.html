<p>You created a <code>Runnable</code> type and never passed it into a thread context. You'll want to add it to the Thread. I would do something like:</p>

<pre><code>String threadName;
Thread thread;
public ThreadExample() {
    thread=new Thread(this);
}

public void startThread() {
   thread.start();
} 
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Thread</code> class accepts a <code>Runnable</code> as an argument.</p>
