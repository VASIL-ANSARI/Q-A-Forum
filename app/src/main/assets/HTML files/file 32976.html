<p>As said, if you have an identity field on the column which you have mentioned and if there was some data that was inserted in a transaction and rolled back after that, the identity field is still set to that value.</p>

<p>meaning, if I have an auto incrementing field and a transaction with 10 records, my auto increment field is now at 10 and starts for 11. I rollback the transaction, but the auto incrementing number doesn't go back to 1, but it will still start at 11.</p>

<p>Unless and until there is something behind the screen other than straight forward inserts, this should cause no issues to you, as said.</p>
