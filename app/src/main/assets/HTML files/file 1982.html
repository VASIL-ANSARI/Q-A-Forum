<p>Although the iPad SDK is still under NDA at this time, the iPhone SDK which preceeds it introduced the ability to change the screen size:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)opts
{
  UIScreen *s = [UIScreen mainScreen];    // ask for the main screen
  [window setFrame:[s applicationFrame]]; // get the application Frame for the screen
  return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have used NIBs for the UI construction, you need to ensure that they're auto-resizable in order for them to flow properly.</p>
