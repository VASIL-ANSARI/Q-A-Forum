<p>After several years of Joomla development, I recommend using <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/contacts-and-feedback/forms/4964" rel="nofollow">RSFORM PRO</a> by RSJOOMLA to send mail for you after the visitor to your website fills out the form. It is much easier to manage than having to deal with the internal mail server.</p>
