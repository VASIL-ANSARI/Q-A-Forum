<p>You mention Chainsaw is opening the log file, but it's not clear how. </p>

<p>You can open an xmllayout-formatted log file using the file-open menu in Chainsaw.  </p>

<p>You can load a regular text log file in chainsaw by configuring Chainsaw to use a LogFilePatternReceiver, which can parse &amp; tail the log file (LogFilePatternReceiver allows you to define the pattern in your log file, and will then parse and tail the log file).</p>

<p>An example receiver configuration is available from Chainsaw's Welcome tab, and LogFilePatternReceiver javadoc is available from Chainsaw's help menu.</p>

<p>If you have a custom xml format, you need to either create your own XmlDecoder implementation that will convert your xml to logging events (and configure Chainsaw to use an xml-based receiver with your decoder), or you can pre-process your xml file and output a file conforming to log4j's dtd.  </p>

<p>The 'found non-matching line' message above looks like it is an xmllayout-based format.  If you're having problems loading a log file that conforms to log4j's dtd, I'd suggest posting an example chunk of your log file with a question to the log4j-dev mailing list.</p>
