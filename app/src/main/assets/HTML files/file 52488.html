<p>This seems very confused.</p>

<p>You have to use AddStreamSink, when you want EVR to display frames from several sources.</p>

<p>Reading your post, you want to display frames only from your camera (one source).</p>

<p>So you don't need to use AddStreamSink.</p>

<p>And you get error from AddStreamSink, because there are some limitations about media types to use when adding streams to EVR (it depends on your GPU characteristics).</p>
