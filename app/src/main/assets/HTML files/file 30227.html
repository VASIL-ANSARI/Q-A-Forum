<p>you have got gem <code>validate_timeliness</code> <a href="https://github.com/adzap/validates_timeliness/blob/master/Gemfile#L13" rel="nofollow">which requires</a> <code>sqlite3</code>. As far as I know you can not use anything other than Postgres on Heroku, so you have to get rid of it somehow*. You can use <code>gem dependency -R</code> to see dependency tree (but only first level) of your gems.</p>
