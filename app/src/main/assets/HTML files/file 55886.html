<p>It is not iterpolation that is the problem.</p>

<p><code>{ symbol: value }</code> is a new syntax, which is a shortcut for <code>{ :symbol =&gt; value }</code>. In its first iteration, I don't think it supported <code>{ "symbol": value }</code> automatic string symbolification feature. Use the old-fashioned <code>{ "symbol".to_sym =&gt; value }</code> if backward compatibility is a goal.</p>

<p>(If you <em>know</em> that all you're doing is converting to JSON, you can even just leave it as <code>{ "string" =&gt; value }</code>, comforted by the knowledge that JSON does not make a distinction between strings and symbols; but I'd consider it a code smell.)</p>
