<p>Most likely you have Rails squirreled away in some particular gemset in some rvm-managed Ruby version, but you haven't told rvm to <em>use</em> it again yet.</p>

<p>Look at your installed Ruby versions (with <code>rvm list</code>).  Chances are that the one you were using before is still there.  If you recognize one, use it (with <code>rvm use ruby-2.2.4</code> or whatever version), else start looking in all the versions.</p>

<p>For each Ruby version you inspect, look at the gemsets rvm is managing under it (with <code>rvm gemset list</code>).  Chances are, you either created one for some Rails project, or as a starter for Rails projects in general (that's what I do), or maybe you just left all the gems to be installed into the <code>default</code> or <code>global</code> gemsets.</p>

<p>If you recognize a particular one, use it (with <code>rvm gemset use rails_4_2</code> or whatever gemset name), else start looking in all the gemsets.  You'll eventually find the right combination.</p>

<p>If you don't, then go through the same process as from scratch.  First make sure you're using the Ruby version you want (you may need to install it, with <code>rvm install 2.3</code> or whatever version).  Then create a new gemset (with <code>rvm gemset use --create rails_4_2</code> or whatever you want to call it).  Lastly, <code>gem install rails</code>.</p>
