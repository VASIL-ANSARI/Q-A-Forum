<p>Do a <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_45_0/libs/graph/doc/BFSVisitor.html">breadth-first search</a> on the graph.  At every even depth, color the nodes one color, say red, and at the odd-depths, you color the nodes blue.  Every time you have a non-tree edge (an edge between two nodes you have already visited) verify that the colors are different.  If the graph has several connected components, you just repeat the search on each component.</p>
