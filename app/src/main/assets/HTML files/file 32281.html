<p>You're trying to compile and link that piece of code as an EXE, but there's no <code>main</code> function; there's only a <code>CaptureBMP</code> function. If all you want the program to do is call that function, you'll need to implement a stub <code>main</code> that does just that. The compiler won't guess what function you want called (and how); you must make it explicit.</p>
