  <p>How do I populate the existing one and not creating a new one?</p>

<p>This is quick'n'dirty but should do it: Before you send the AJAX request, remove the existing <code>&lt;select id='dimensions'&gt;</code> from the DOM. Then you can safely insert it later on.</p>

<p>To keep the amount of time short, you can also remove it before inserting it. So at the time you get the AJAX response.</p>
