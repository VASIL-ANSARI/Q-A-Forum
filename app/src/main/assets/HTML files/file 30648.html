<p>No. You should choose the name that best describes what the method does. Using get/set prefixes is an accepted convention to access properties of an object, but this method is not a getter.</p>

<p>I personally would use create, since the method creates things, and doesn't simply get them. But I would drop the "Instances" suffix, which adds needless noises. Every object is an instance of a class. Given what I know, I would thus probably name the method <code>createNewTypes()</code>.</p>

<p>That said, and without knowing anything about your software, <code>OldType</code> and <code>NewType</code> aren't really descriptive names. </p>
