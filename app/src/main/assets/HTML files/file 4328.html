<p>The problem is not your database. It doesn't even get that far. You are relying on Python's string manipulation here:</p>

<pre><code>insert("INSERT INTO urls (url) VALUES (%s)" % (url, ))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Never do this.</strong> It is bad because not only are you trying to insert a unicode string into an ASCII one, you are also leaving yourself open to SQL injection attacks. Instead, do this
(assuming your <code>insert</code> function maps to some call in MySQLdb):</p>

<pre><code>insert("INSERT INTO urls (url) VALUES (%s)", (url, ))
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is that you are now getting MySQLdb to insert the values, thus ensuring they will be encoded and quoted properly.</p>
