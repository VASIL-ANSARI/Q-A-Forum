<p>One tip is that these statements do nothing:</p>

<pre><code>x.divide(i).equals(x);
i.subtract(i);
</code></pre>

<p>Same with part of your <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>i.add(i)
</code></pre>

<p>They don't modify the instances themselves, but return new values - values that you're failing to check and do anything with.  <code>BigIntegers</code> are "immutable".  They can't be changed - but they can be operated upon and return new values.</p>

<p>If you actually wanted to do something like this, you would have to do:</p>

<pre><code>i = i.add(i);
</code></pre>

<p>Also, why would you subtract <code>i</code> from <code>i</code>?  Wouldn't you always expect this to be 0?</p>
