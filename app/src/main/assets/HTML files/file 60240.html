<p>I have figured this out.  After Inspecting the Elements, I saw that all of the <code>input</code>, <code>textarea</code>, and <code>select</code> had a <code>max-width</code> of <code>280px</code>.</p>

<p>So all I had to do was give the <code>textarea</code> a class and set its <code>max-width</code> to something that I prefer.</p>
