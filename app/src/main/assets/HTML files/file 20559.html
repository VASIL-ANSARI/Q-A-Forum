<p>You're calling <code>return</code> <em>inside</em> the loop because of where it is indented currently, so it gets executed after the very first iteration. Likely you want to move it <em>outside</em> the loop (the same indentation level as the <code>for</code> itself) so it gets called after the iteration is complete:</p>

<pre><code>def computeBill(food):
    total = 0.0
    for item in food:
        total += prices[str(item)] + stock[str(item)]
        print total

    return total
</code></pre>
