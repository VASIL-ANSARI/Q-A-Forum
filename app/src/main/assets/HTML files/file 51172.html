<p>If you don't care about any request data, you could just add <code>req.resume();</code> after you add your <code>end</code> event handler.</p>

<p>The reason it's getting "stuck" is that since node v0.10, streams start out in a paused state, so you need to unpause them by reading from them in some way. <code>req.resume();</code> accomplishes this. Once there is nothing left in the request stream (which there could be nothing), the <code>end</code> event will be emitted.</p>
