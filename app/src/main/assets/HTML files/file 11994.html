<p>First off, as stated by Bjoern above: this should be a <strong>temporary</strong> workaround as it's not so much of a solution.</p>

<p>Your problem is that you're trying to restart your mysql client, rather than the daemon (mysql <strong>d</strong>), try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>0 * * * * /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
</code></pre>
