<p>Although the UIImageView is square, the UIImage's height is much larger than the width. The default content mode for UIImageView is <code>UIViewContentModeScaleToFill</code> which scales the content "to fit the size of itself by changing the aspect ratio of the content if necessary." To make the image centered and filling the UImageView you must use:</p>

<pre><code>self.avatarTwo.contentMode = UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill;
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIView_Class/UIView/UIView.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/UIViewContentMode" rel="nofollow">contentMode</a> for more information on this.</p>

<p>In essence, your UIImageView is being cropped fine, but the content in that image view is being scaled to not crop any of the content.</p>
