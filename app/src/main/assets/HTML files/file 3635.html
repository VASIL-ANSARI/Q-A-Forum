<p>To optimize performance and reduce your roundtrips, i would like to suggest you get the time on the server once at start up of you page. Then calculate the difference between the server and client clock. Now you can use Javascript (Client side only, no more roundtrips to the server) to update your clock on your screen every second.</p>

<p>This should also solve your problem IF the issue is caused by the the topic you mentioned. Regardless, i think youÂ´ll do yourself and your app users a great benefit by not requesting the server time every second.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>
