<p>I faced a problem like this before myself, below was the reason what I found it to be.</p>

<p>As the list view uses view object recycling to save memory we need to have some sort of mechanism to store the selection state of each list item and then use it in the get view method to check or uncheck(imp) the selection when the view is being retrieved.</p>

<p>I hope it helps</p>
