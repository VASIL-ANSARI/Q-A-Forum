<p>Any HTML in a textbox in asp.net web forms (assuming web forms) will cause this error.  You need to encode it in JavaScript, set the ValidateRequest property on the @Page attribute to false, or use some other utility (there are some out there, don't know of a specific one, maybe the HTML agility pack?).</p>
