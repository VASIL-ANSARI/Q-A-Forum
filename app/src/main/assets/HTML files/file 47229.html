<p><code>RenderTransformOrigin</code> is <strong>relative</strong>, but <code>CenterX</code> and <code>CenterY</code> are <strong>absolute</strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose you have an element with width and height of 100. Then if you set <code>RenderTransformOrigin = "0.5,0.5"</code> and <code>CenterX = 10</code> and <code>CenterY = 10</code> then the center is shifted 10 pixels in both vertical and horizontal directions from the origin point which is at [X = 100 * 0.5 = 50 , Y = 100 * 0.5 = 50].</p>
