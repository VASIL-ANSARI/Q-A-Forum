<p>I think you can add the whole content disposition in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>multipartFormDataContent.Headers.Add("Content-Disposition", "form-data; name=\"values\"; filename=\"name.txt\"");
</code></pre>

<p>From what I understand from what you wrote, you need the file name as part of the Content-Disposition so you can add it through the Headers propery.</p>
