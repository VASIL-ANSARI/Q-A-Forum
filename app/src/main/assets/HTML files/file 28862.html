<p>One quick answer so that others may find it useful. I had a very similar problem a little while ago, and had a lot of trouble finding a quick workable solution anywhere, not even google.</p>

<p>I somehow figured out that the solution was to simply create a virtualenv folder with the version of numpy I wanted, and then pointed the "virtualenv" property for NinjaIDE project to that folder. I restarted NinjaIDE and boom, instantly worked.</p>

<p>To set the virtualenv property for your project via the GUI, go to the Project menu:</p>

<pre><code>Project &gt; Open Project Properties &gt; Project Execution
</code></pre>

<p>and you should see a variable called "Virtualenv Folder". Point that to the folder for your virtualenv, and it should work. (May need to restart NinjaIDE.) </p>

  <p>This worked for me, NinjaIDE version 2.2 under Ubuntu 12.04.</p>

<p>Edit by asker: If the above doesn't fix the problem, try PyCharm-- it works for me.</p>
