<p>You have a part of your query as:</p>

<pre><code>FROM AnalysisItems INNER JOIN Transactions ON AnalysisItems.Pmid = Transactions.Pmid
WHERE (((Transactions.TransactionDate) Between #4/1/2011# And #4/30/2011#) 
</code></pre>

<p>The inner join that you have specified, does not give the results that you asked for - ideally, you want to use a left join for your purpose. Replace</p>

<pre><code>FROM AnalysisItems INNER JOIN Transactions
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>FROM AnalysisItems LEFT JOIN Transactions
</code></pre>

<p>I think it should work fine</p>
