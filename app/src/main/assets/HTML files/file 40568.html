<p>I would try the following and put this in a loop for all of your:</p>

<pre><code>// Define the characters to look for:
$charToCheck = array(".", "!", "?");

// Loop through each character to check
foreach ( $charToCheck as $char) {

    // Gives you the last index of a period. Returns false if not in string
    $lastIndex = strrpos($cut, $char);

    // Checks if character is found in the last 20 characters of your string
    if ( $lastIndex &gt; ($max_chars - 20)) {
        // Returns the shortened string beginning from first character
        $cut = substr($cut, 0, $lastIndex + 1);
    }
}
</code></pre>
