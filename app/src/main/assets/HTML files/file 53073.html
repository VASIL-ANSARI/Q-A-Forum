<p>Looks like you are using nested states such that <code>q.explorer.detail</code> is a child of <code>q.explorer</code>. To render the child state's template, you also need a specific <code>ui-view</code> where it can be placed into. And this will be searched in the template of the parent state. Getting the console.log() output just means the controllers are instantiated, but that even happens if the template isn't rendered at all.</p>

<p>So check if you have an <code>ui-view</code> in the template of the <code>q.explorer</code> state.

<p>You could also fix this by not making <code>q.explorer.detail</code> a child of <code>q.explorer</code>. A child state is created as soon as you need the dot notation.</p>
