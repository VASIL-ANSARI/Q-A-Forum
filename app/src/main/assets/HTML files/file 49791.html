<p>Check that your source is encoding per the <a href="http://www.jaggersoft.com/csharp_standard/9.1.htm" rel="nofollow">C# language specification</a>. It must use one of the allowed Unicode encodings. UTF-8 is always allowed. (I'd say preferred.) Your editor should be able to tell you which your using and/or allow you to re-save it with a specific encoding.</p>

<p>In Visual Studio, you can re-save the file with a specific encoding using File Â» Advanced Save Optionsâ¦, then File Â» Save.</p>
