<p>By the time <code>temp1</code> is null, it means you've hit the end of the list. You'll need to stop when the check for <code>temp1.next</code> is <code>null</code>.</p>

<pre><code>if (!head)
   return; // or throw ... no element to pop

while(temp1-&gt;next){
    temp2 = temp1;
    temp1 = temp1-&gt;next;
}

if (temp2) // If the element had a single element, we've just popped head.
  temp2-&gt;next = NULL;
else
  head = null;

delete temp1;
</code></pre>

<p>As an aside, you'll want to add robustness to guard against a list with a null head or a single element.</p>
