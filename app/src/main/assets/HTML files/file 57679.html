<p>Change the line</p>

<pre><code>if @transaction.status == "authorized" || "submitted_for_settlement"
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>@transaction.status == "authorized" || @transaction.status == "submitted_for_settlement"
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>==</code> has higher priority than <code>||</code>, <code>@transaction.status == "authorized" || "submitted_for_settlement"</code> is equivalent to <code>(@transaction.status == "authorized") || "submitted_for_settlement"</code>. So if the status is "authorized", this expression returns <code>true</code>, otherwise it returns the string <code>"submitted_for_settlement"</code>, which is also considered truthy in Ruby.</p>

<p>I'd suggest to define some methods to the <code>Braintree::Transaction</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Braintree::Transaction
  %w(authorized submitted_for_settlement settled).each do |status|
    define_method("#{status}?") do
      self.status == status
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your controller</p>

<pre><code>if @transaction.authorized? || @transaction.submitted_for_settlement?
  # ...
elsif @transaction.settled?
  # ...
end
</code></pre>
