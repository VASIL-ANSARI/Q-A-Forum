<p>Why do you need it to be random ? You could simply use a list, and append every new object to the list, with its index being its unique identifier :</p>

<pre><code>items = []
items.append( Class_Item(item_type, item_number) )
</code></pre>

<p>But if you really need random identifier, maybe you can use a dictionary :</p>

<pre><code>items = dict()
items[random_id] = Class_Item(item_type, item_number)
</code></pre>

<p>This requires random_id to be hashable (but it should be if it is a number or a string).</p>
