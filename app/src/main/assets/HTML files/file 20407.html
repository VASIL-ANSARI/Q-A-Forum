<p>you are not initializing the property <code>ChartSettings chartOne</code> but you are creating an instance inside constructor, and it is disposed when constructor finishes. It means you have never initialized the class level property chartOne; thus it will be always null.</p>

<p>When you use this.chartOne you are declaring that you want to use the property defined in the class.</p>

<p>Change it to;</p>

<pre><code>public ChartSettings chartOne{ get; set;}

public Form1(bool archivePlotPreview)
{
    InitializeComponent();
    chartOne = new ChartSettings(this.chart1, archivePlotPreview);
}
</code></pre>
