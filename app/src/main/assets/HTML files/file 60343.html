<p>You can use Gson's pretty printing.  JSON.org's library has something similar as well. (I'm sure Jackson does as well).  Note: this will also format it so it's very readable.</p>

<pre><code>Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
String json = gson.toJson(obj);
System.out.println(json);
</code></pre>
