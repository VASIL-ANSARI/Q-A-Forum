<p>In order for an image to have a transparent background the image itself must have a transparent background.  Then when loading the image from file into an <code>UIImageView</code> the background will also be transparent.</p>

<p>Try using the image I've provided:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2jNLu.png" alt="Circle"></p>
