<p>You don't have to copy anything around. As you said, those methods could be static. So make them and pass the result to the base class constructor.</p>

<p>The current code you have doesn't make that all to simple, because <code>MakeInputLayout</code> depends on a value created in the constructor of the base class. While you could somehow extract that as well, I think this would be getting messy.</p>

<p>Therefore, I propose a different approach:</p>

<p>Create an <code>IInputLayoutProvider</code> interface along with its implementations and pass that to the base class.</p>
