<p>It's not only a question of coupling (far from it, actually : dynamical allocation becomes really interesting if you use polymorphism). The classical rule of thumb, there, is : if you can have the object in your class, do it. It's exactly the same thing as in a function : if you can have a local variable, take it, don't go allocating memory for the sake of nightmarish debugging. </p>

<p>For instance, if your going to need an aggregation of an unknown numbers of components, pointers (shared, smart, or dumb) are your friends. Here, for instance, if you don't know how much doors your garage is going to have, pointers (actually, not shared ones) and dynamical allocation is a good idea.</p>

<p>If you have an object used by another object, that is always going to be of the same class, and that is not useful after it's owner is dead, why on earth would you need to go through dynamic allocation ?</p>

<p>In short : the context is everything, but, for your own sake, try to have as few dynamic object as possible. </p>
