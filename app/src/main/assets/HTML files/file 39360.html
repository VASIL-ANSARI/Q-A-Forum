<p>If you check the console, you will find the error: "t3 is not defined". This comes because you never defined <code>t3</code>. If I put in the following near the top of your function, it works (up to a point):</p>

<pre><code>var t3 = document.getElementById("Text1").value;
</code></pre>

<p>It will eventually break, since you have more problems than that. For one thing, a big reason why your <code>array</code> isn't printing is because you never defined its contents.</p>

<p>Please note that it is a hell for anyone to read code where the variable <code>t1</code> is contents of element <code>Text2</code>, and <code>t3</code> content of <code>Text2</code>, and where a loop counters are <code>a</code>, <code>i</code> and <code>n</code>. Consider changing variable names to <code>className</code>, <code>methodCount</code>, <code>variableCount</code>, etc. It is hell for me right now, and I guarantee it will be hell for you too in about a week, if it isn't already.</p>

<p>Also, be aware that <code>document.write</code> is a very dangerous and destructive force. Use it only when it is absolutely necessary, and even then think thrice. Use <code>element.innerHTML = ...</code>, or <code>element.appendChild(...)</code> with <code>document.createElement(...)</code>. The first method is easier, and it is almost always a better idea and more controllable than <code>document.write</code>. I see you are already using <code>innerHTML</code>, so this should not be hard. Treat <code>document.write</code> as if it is radioactive: if you absolutely <em>have</em> to touch it, be smart, and wear a biohazard suit.</p>

<p>Finally, your loops do not do what you want, not even close. As I said, it was hard to even follow your logic there due to nonsensical variable names and weird limits. You will find that when you give your variables better names, you will get clarity to see what your program is actually doing.</p>

<p>Post-finally, a silly observation: "floot" is not a word, and I'm reasonably certain you wanted to put "float" there.</p>
