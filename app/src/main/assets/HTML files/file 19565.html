<p>I'm not sure if that book is great for Python 3. There is a Python3 APK(http://code.google.com/p/python-for-android/downloads/detail?name=Python3ForAndroid_r6.apk), but the other one, the standard PythonForAndroid is 2.6(?) based. You need to use the same version of python across both your android device and your local machine for what you're trying to do. I'm not sure which Python 3 ve</p>

<p>When I was playing with this and the same book, I had to install the same version of python on my local machine that was used in the APK I installed on my device. It was still a lot of screwing around to get it to work and wasn't really worth the effort in the end. </p>

<p>However, I found that just pushing the script across and instantly running it was way easier than trying to play with IDLE remotely. This is now how I rapidly prototype any Android apps I'm planning to work on.</p>
