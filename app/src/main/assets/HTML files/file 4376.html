<p>A looong time ago I wrote a connector for <a href="http://www.octave.org" rel="nofollow">Octave</a> to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL</a> (which is still on its webpage <a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/octave-pg.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>).  Maybe you could use that a starting point? </p>
