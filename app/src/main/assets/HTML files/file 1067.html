<blockquote>
  <p>Function names should be lowercase,
  with words separated by underscores as
  necessary to improve readability.</p>
  
  <p>mixedCase is allowed only in contexts
  where that's already the prevailing
  style</p>

<p>Variables...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the function naming rules:
  lowercase with words separated by
  underscores as necessary to improve
  readability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I deviate from this because I also prefer <code>mixedCase</code> over <code>lower_case</code> for my own projects.</p>
