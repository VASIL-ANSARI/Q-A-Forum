<p>A better solution might be to have a <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#libraryProject" rel="nofollow">library project</a> that contains your base code and then your projects that use the library can then override your existing resources by simply having the same name.  Hopefully this will be helpful..</p>
