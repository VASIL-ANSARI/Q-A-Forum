<p><code>SharedPreferences</code> is a Singleton object so you can easily get as many references as you want, it opens file only when you call <code>getSharedPreferences</code> first time, or create only one reference for it.</p>

<p>So if turned off your application and Android didn't clear your static values your object will be not created again.</p>

<p>More about <code>SharedPreferences</code> <a href="http://yakivmospan.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/best-practice-sharedpreferences/" rel="nofollow">you can find in my article here</a></p>

<p>Instead of copying your object to Server try to create JSON from it and than send. And on application start, download JSON from server and put it in Preferences</p>
