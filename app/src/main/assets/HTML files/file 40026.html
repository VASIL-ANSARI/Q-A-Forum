<p>Only one tokenizer can be used by an analyzer(per <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html" rel="nofollow">Elasticsearch Analysis reference page</a>).  You'll need to use a TokenFilter to take to the place of one of them (<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-word-delimiter-tokenfilter.html#analysis-word-delimiter-tokenfilter" rel="nofollow">Word Delimiter Token Filter</a> should do nicely), or use a Tokenizer that accomplishes both.</p>
