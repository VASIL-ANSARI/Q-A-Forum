<p>I got answser by spannable method.</p>

<p>With in spanable method i am comparing string with pattern so whenever that pattern matches in text, it will show emoji of relavent pattern.</p>

<p>I called this method when ever i selected emoji from gridview, on msg recieved, and ontextchanged so whenever it found pattern it will changed to emoji. so like this  it is saving data in text formate of :) and showing emoji as icon.</p>

<p>Hope this will be helpful.</p>
