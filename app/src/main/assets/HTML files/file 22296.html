<p>You can add the <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> handler lower in the hierarchy: </p>

<pre><code>for folder in folders:
        try:
             retval += search(folder,filename)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
               print retval
return retval
</code></pre>

<p>You could test that, although I'm not quite sure how that handles inside a loop like the one you have.</p>
