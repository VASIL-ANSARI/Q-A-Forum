<p>I think View Composers are what you need:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>View composers are callbacks or class methods that are called when a view is rendered. If you have data that you want to be bound to a view each time that view is rendered, a view composer can help you organize that logic into a single location.</p>

<p>I use view composers for the exact situation you describe. When a particular sidebar view is rendered, Laravel automatically calls the view composer that prepares the data for that sidebar.</p>
