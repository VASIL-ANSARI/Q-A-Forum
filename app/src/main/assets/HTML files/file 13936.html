<p>One thing:</p>

<p>((CountT*60*60)+(CountM*60)*1000); // expand it a bit:</p>

<p>( (CountT*60*60) + (CountM*60)*1000 ); // hours/CountT not multiplied by 1000</p>

<p>If there is any doubt whatsoever about operator precedence, use extra brackets.<br>
If there is no doubt whatsoever about operator precedence, use extra brackets.</p>

<p>Debugging 101 tip #34 - break up complex expressions into simpler ones that load separate local vars so that the exact sequence of operations can easily be seen in the debugger.  If you had written:</p>

<pre><code>int minsTicks=CountM*60*1000;
int hoursTicks=CountT*60*60;
int totalTicks=hoursTicks+minsTicks;
</code></pre>

<p>you would have seen straightaway the problem, in fact, you would probably not have made it in the first place!</p>
