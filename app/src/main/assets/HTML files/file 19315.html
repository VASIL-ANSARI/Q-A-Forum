<p>If this is meant to be a correlated sub-query, you need a way to refer to the outer statement's table inside the inner query. In MySQL you'd do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, start, outgoing_tasks FROM sheet1 foo WHERE main_project = 'A' AND main_link = '1' AND outgoing_tasks IS NOT NULL AND start &gt; (SELECT start FROM sheet1 bar WHERE main_project = 'A' AND main_link = '1' AND bar.name = foo.outgoing_tasks);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I give the outer query's table an alias of <code>foo</code> and the inner query's table the alias of <code>bar</code>. Then I can refer to the outer table in the <code>WHERE</code> predicate of the nested (inner) query: <code>... AND bar.name = foo.outgoing_tasks ...</code></p>
