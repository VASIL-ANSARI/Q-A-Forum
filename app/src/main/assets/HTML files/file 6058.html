<p>The reason this doesn't work is because your ASP code is running in the context of the full .NET framework and while trying to instantiate Silverligt control - just like the exception says - the assembly <code>System.Xml</code> with the version 2.0.5.0 is not loadable/found.</p>

<p>Note the version: 2.0.5.0. All of the Silverlight core DLLs have this version instead of 'normal' .NET version like 2.0.0.0.</p>

<p>This is no accident - Silverlight runs inside the context of the small CLR which is a subset of the regular CLR. It's not the same CLR, though most of it is completely identical and while your C# source code is exactly the same, the runtime <strong>isn't</strong> identical.</p>

<p>At the moment, you can't mix Silverlight code with the full .NET based code like ASP.NET.</p>

<p>There is some work being done inside Microsoft on extracting common core of regular .NET and Silverlight (a couple of libraries actually) for better sharing, but that's not yet publically available.</p>

<p>Also note that if the <em>source</em> code of one of your Silverlight 4.0 libraries does not use Silverlight specific code, you are able to load it into regular .NET process, but the reverse is obviously not possible (Silverlight being the subset, not the other way around).</p>

<p>All this aside, you might achieve your goal by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Running your Silverlight app OOB on the server and communicating with the ASP.NET pages via some IPC mechanism</li>
<li>Recompiling the code into WPF and load that; when I say recompile, I really mean adapt/refactor since Silverlight UI is not a pure subset of WPF</li>
</ol>

<p>Neither is particularity easy, though I'd lean towards the second option it's cleaner.</p>
