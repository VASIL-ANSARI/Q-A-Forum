<p>The correct way to run code periodically is to set up a cron job that runs a django command.
You should set the cron job for the www-data user if running under apache (or in the <code>runserver</code> case probably your own user if you are in development mode)  This will ensure that the code is executed with the same permissions and ownerships as the web code.</p>
