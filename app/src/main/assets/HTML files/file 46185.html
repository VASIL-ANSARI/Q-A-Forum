<p>I guess since you said difficulty, I'll have to answer this! :)</p>

<pre><code>map.entrySet().stream().map((entry) -&gt; //stream each entry, map it to string value
            "--" + entry.getKey() + " \"" + entry.getValue().replaceAll("\"", "\\\\\"") + "\"")
            .collect(Collectors.joining(" ")); //and 'collect' or put them together by joining
</code></pre>

<p>I personally don't like using streams because it gets ugly pretty quick, but its useful for simpler loops. (join all values with some character for example) With this however you can easily parallelize it by using <code>parallelStream()</code> instead of <code>stream()</code></p>

<p>If you wanted the values in some sort of order so its not so random (as it will be with <code>HashMap</code>) you can do a sort before map:</p>

<pre><code>.stream().sort((e1, e2) -&gt; e1.getValue().compareTo(e2.getValue()))
.map(...)...
</code></pre>

<p>Just remember that those are <code>Map.Entry</code> objects.</p>
