<p>It's a known MySQL problem. <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/old-client.html" rel="nofollow">C.5.2.4. Client does not support authentication protocol:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MySQL 5.1 uses an authentication protocol based on a password hashing algorithm that is incompatible with that used by older (pre-4.1) clients. If you upgrade the server from 4.0, attempts to connect to it with an older client may fail with the following message: "Client does not support authentication protocol requested
  by server; consider upgrading MySQL client".</p>
  
  <p>To solve this problem, you should use one of the following approaches:<br>
     1. Upgrade all client programs to use a 4.1.1 or newer client library.<br>
     2. When connecting to the server with a pre-4.1 client program, use an account that still has a pre-4.1-style password.<br>
     3. Reset the password to pre-4.1 style for each user that needs to use a pre-4.1 client program.<br>
     4. Tell the server to use the older password hashing algorithm.</p>
