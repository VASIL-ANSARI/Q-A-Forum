  <p>How is JVitela's method passed to a vertex or fragment shader?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is passed like any other texture:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a texture</li>
<li>Set filtering and wrapping</li>
<li>Upload data via <code>GLUtils.texImage2D(GLES20.GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, bitmap, 0);</code></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the section about the background necessary, or will leaving the background out result in just the text over the rest of the GL Surface?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not necessary (there will be just a background), leaving it out will write black pixels (because the code erases the bitmap pixels before with black. If you wanted to just draw the text, you'd need to enable blending or use a special shader that knows the color of the text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What exactly is the textures variable he used?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is an <code>int[1]</code>, see <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/microedition/khronos/opengles/GL10.html#glGenTextures%28int,%20int%5b%5d,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">API docs on GL10</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think it's a texture data handle (comparing his bind() to at that of learnopengles) but why an array? is it shared with other textures?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This way, more than one texture handle can be created using <code>glGenTextures</code>.</p>
