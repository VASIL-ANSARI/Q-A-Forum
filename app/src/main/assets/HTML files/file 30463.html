<p><code>shadowCellHash</code> is not initialized with all of the <code>ShadowCell</code>s before you start looping through every cell looking for neighbours. When the loop checks <code>[5,-1]</code> for neighbors, it doesn't find <code>[6,-1]</code> because it's not in <code>shadowCellHash</code>. Since <code>[6,-1]</code> is not found, a new <em>dead</em> <code>[6,-1]</code> is created, and <code>[5,-1]</code> is not born because it does not have enough live neighbours.</p>

<p>I think I've resolved your issue by eagerly re-populating <code>shadowCellHash</code> at the beginning of each <code>World.tick</code></p>

<pre><code>  // This hash goes out of scope after each tick allowing any dead shadowCells to be garbage collected
  if (!this.settings.wrap) {
    var shadowCellHash = {};
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; this.lifeList.length; i++) {
        var cell = this.lifeList[i];
        if (cell.key) {
          shadowCellHash[cell.key] = cell;
        }
    }
  }
</code></pre>
