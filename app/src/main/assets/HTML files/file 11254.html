<p>The standard dictates nothing about how a function <em>can</em> be inlined. And compilers can inline functions if they have access to their implementation. If you only have a header with binaries, it would be impossible. If it's in the same module, the compiler <em>can</em> inline the function even if it is in the <code>cpp</code> file.</p>
