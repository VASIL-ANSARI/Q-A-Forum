<p>If you can't predict what the data is, then IMO you shouldn't be serializing that element.</p>

<p>Since it appears you are using <code>BinaryFormatter</code>, perhaps add some <code>[NonSerialized]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[NonSerialized]
private List&lt;object&gt; foo = ...
</code></pre>

<p>Also, <em>events</em> are the usual cause of confusion on this; I would annotate any events, too:</p>

<pre><code>[field:NonSerialized]
public event EventHandler SomeCrazyEvent;
</code></pre>

<p>or if you are doing explicit event implementations, set <code>[NonSerialized]</code> on whatever backing field is holding the <code>delegate</code> or <code>EventHandlerList</code>.</p>

<p>(well, <em>strictly speaking</em> I just wouldn't be using <code>BinaryFormatter</code> in the first place - using a serialize that isn't so tied to the internal class structure can only be a good thing; but that is a rant for another day...)</p>
