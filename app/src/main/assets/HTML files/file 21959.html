<p><code>classpath</code> should point to the root folder where your top level package (JNI) goes to, not to the folder where your class is physically located.</p>

<p>Class name should not include <code>.class</code> extension.</p>

<p>Think about it as operating on classes and not physical files.</p>

<p><code>javah -jni -classpath "C:\Users\GETH COMMANDER\Documents\NetBeansProjects\JNI Test Project\build\classes" JNI.Main</code></p>

<p>Also you should follow Java naming conventions and make your package names lower case.</p>
