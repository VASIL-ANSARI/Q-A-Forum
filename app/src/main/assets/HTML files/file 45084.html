<p>It looks like you are doing this all in your controller, so try this following pattern for now. You should be able to see what is going on here, basically we're placing a <code>$watch</code> on <code>$scope.signuser</code> which will keep track of it's value so we can log it out after our promise has resolved.</p>

<pre><code>$scope.signuser = null // for now - until promise is resolved

Login.query({ email: $scope.user.signemail }).then(function(response) {
    $scope.signuser = response.data[0];
});

$scope.$watch('signuser', function(newValue, oldValue) {
    console.log(newValue);
});
</code></pre>
