<p>You should declare your teams first and your array afterwards like this:</p>

<pre><code>var team1 = {
     name: "team 1",
     matches: 5 
}

var team2 = {
     name: "team 2",
     matches: 4 
}

var team3 = {
     name: "team 3",
     matches: 3 
}

var teams = [team1, team2, team3];
</code></pre>

<p>Also note there is a space between <code>team</code> and <code>2</code> in your code which is incorrect.</p>
