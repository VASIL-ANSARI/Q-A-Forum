<p>I like the <code>&lt;more&gt;</code> idea. You could also add an <code>after_create</code> observer for the article that parses what they wrote and creates a teaser if the <code>&lt;more&gt;</code> keyword is in what they posted. That way you're not querying a giant article for just a snippet.</p>
