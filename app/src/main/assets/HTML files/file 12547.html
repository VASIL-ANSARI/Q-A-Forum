<p>To implement basic authentication for your web request you will have to use NetworkCredential for your request. </p>

<pre><code>NetworkCredential creds = new NetworkCredential(user,password);

WebRequest req = WebRequest.Create(Url);
req.Credentials = creds;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using Web Reference for accessing web service; while you create a object of your proxy class just assign credentials to it.</p>

<pre><code>NetworkCredential creds = new NetworkCredential(user,password);
proxy.Credentials = creds ;
//call your web methods here.
</code></pre>

<p>For dynamic URL the article, you have mentioned, should work.</p>
