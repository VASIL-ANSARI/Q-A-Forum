<p>AJAX allows us to post and get data <em>asynchronously</em> - removing the need for page refreshes. If you don't want your page to refresh, you'll need to call <code>preventDefault()</code> on the submit event to override the browser's default form submission.</p>

<p>Your page here is refreshing because you're automatically and somewhat unnecessarily triggering <code>$(form).submit()</code> and have no checks in place to prevent the default browser behaviour.</p>
