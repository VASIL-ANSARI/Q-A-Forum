<p>I would try using <a href="http://directwebremoting.org/" rel="nofollow">DWR</a> to integrate JavaScript with your Java app. It makes Java to JavaScript communication transparent and only requires one servlet + configuration of what to expose. I havenÂ´t done this with JMS, but it should work the same. There are three technologies that together solve all my integration problems, <a href="http://springframework.org" rel="nofollow">Spring</a>, <a href="http://mulesource.org" rel="nofollow">Mule</a>, and DWR.</p>
