<p>Well, if its a view and you can't adjust it, there's not much you can do with this query to make it more efficient(every think is just basic filter conditions).</p>

<p>What I can suggest is this:</p>

<p>Create a temp table containing the view's data, index this table and then run the select on the table. You can do this as many times as you need.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE tmp_for_select AS
SELECT * FROM TABLE.View_xy;

CREATE INDEX IND_NAME ON tmp_for_select(location,b,c,d,e,f,g,manDate) ;

select * from tmp_for_select
where location=1 and b=2 and c=3
  and d=4 and e=5 and f=6
  and manDate between (TIMESTAMP '2016-06-01 00:00:00') and (TIMESTAMP '2016-06-02 23:59:59') 
  and g=7;

DROP TABLE tmp_for_select;
</code></pre>
