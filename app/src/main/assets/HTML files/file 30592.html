<pre><code>negfeats = [(word_feats(reviews.words(fileids=[f])), 'neg') for f in negReviews]
posfeats = [(word_feats(reviews.words(fileids=[f])), 'pos') for f in posReviews]
</code></pre>

<p>Did you mean to have <code>dict</code> calls here? <code>negfeats</code> and <code>posfeats</code> are lists of <code>(word, 'neg')</code> and <code>(word, 'pos')</code> tuples. <code>compare</code> will search these lists for words and not find any, because the words are nested in the tuples. Of course, it'd be better to use <code>set</code>s for unordered collections without duplicates.</p>
