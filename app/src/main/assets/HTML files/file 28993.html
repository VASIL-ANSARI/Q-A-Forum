<p>You probably want to extract this functionality away from the context. As you are using an image, use an image view. At the start of the touches, create the image and the image view. Set the image view frame to the touch point with a size of {1, 1}. As the touch moves, move / scale the image view by changing its <code>frame</code>. When the touches end, use the start and end points to render the image into the context (which should be the same as the final <code>frame</code> of the image view).</p>

<p>Doing it this way means you don't add anything to the context which would need to be removed again when the next touch update is received. The above method would work similarly with a <code>CALayer</code> instead of an image view. You could also look at a solution using a <code>transform</code> on the view.</p>
