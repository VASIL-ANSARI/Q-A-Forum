<p>The use of <code>top</code> without an <code>order by</code> is discouraged.  There is no guarantee that you will get the rows that you want, so you should not include the <code>top</code>.  Or, you should include an <code>order by id</code>, if that is the ordering that you want.</p>

<p>The user of <code>top</code> doesn't affect the <code>row_number()</code> calculation, because that calculation is going to be done before the <code>top</code> is applied.  You can imagine having another window function there, such as <code>sum() over ()</code> to understand that the <code>top</code> cannot generally be applied before the <code>row_number()</code> and finding the circumstances where it is safe would be hard work.</p>
