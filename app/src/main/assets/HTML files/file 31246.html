<p>You can override <code>onBackPressed()</code> method, like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
   // Your code
}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure not to call super.</p>

<p>In general, I would advise against that because it breaks the UX. The user expects the back button to kill the entire window and it is not going to happen. Think about it!</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
