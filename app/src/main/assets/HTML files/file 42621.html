<p>Not a problem.
The get call is asynchronous: 
<a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qnetworkaccessmanager.html#details" rel="nofollow">http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qnetworkaccessmanager.html#details</a></p>

<p>QNetworkAccessManager queues the requests it receives, and runs 6 asynchronous tasks per time.
So there's no much room to an error as you point.</p>

<p>But if you're afraid you can try the first example, connecting the signals of the manager: </p>

<pre><code>QNetworkAccessManager *manager = new QNetworkAccessManager(this);
connect(manager, SIGNAL(finished(QNetworkReply*)),
        this, SLOT(replyFinished(QNetworkReply*)));

manager-&gt;get(QNetworkRequest(QUrl("http://qt-project.org")));
</code></pre>
