<p>What I do is create a new file that continues the partial class <code>ohmioNETEntities</code>. In there, you can define a new constructor that takes in a string param, that calls the base constructor. </p>

<p>So - here's your new file ( which will not be overwritten when re-generating entities ) :</p>

<pre><code>public partial class OhmioNETEntities {
    public OhmioNETEntities(string connectionstring) : base(connectionstring) {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's the beauty of partial classes ( and the reason the code generation template uses them here ). You can safe keep your own logic in those while still being able to generate everything.</p>
