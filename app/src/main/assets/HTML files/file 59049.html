<p>I had the same issue. Also noticed that it worked in Edge, but not in Chrome. After I tried stripping the config down to the minimum, it suddenly started working for some reason. After digging some more, it seems like this happens whenever youre <em>logged in</em> to the same site. </p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
  url: "/wp-json/wc/v1/products",
  beforeSend: function(xhr) { 
    xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic " +btoa(username+':'+password)); 
    return true; 
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, exposing your API keys to the browser is a very bad idea, if youre using this for something important :)</p>
