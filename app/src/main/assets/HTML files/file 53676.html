<p>Writing my solution as an answer and not just a comment for future visitors:</p>

<p>If you're looking for the index of a value in a list you can use <code>yrList.index(year)</code>, which will either return the index of the element in the list or throw a ValueError which you'll have to catch, instead of <code>.find</code> that does not exist.</p>
