<p>Here is how you can do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup a queue using an array of "requests" (I see you already have that).</li>
<li>Then start the queue by executing the first request.</li>
<li>On the callback of that first request, move your iterator onto the second request, and start it (could be just a simple int that starts at 0 and that you increment every time). The callback of that second request is the same as the first one.</li>
<li>When your iterator reaches the end of the array, all your requests are complete, you can call your final method.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this method, only one request is running at a time. If you want them all at the same time, then you need another array to track the status of each request. Every time a request completes, check your status array to see if they are all complete by looping through it.</p>
