<p>AFAIK, <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/RAP/Protocol" rel="nofollow">RAP</a> is just a JSON format based on HTTP.</p>

<p>If so most probably you have an issue in your recording setup.</p>

<p>If you are trying to record a localhost hosted application, did you ensure that in your browser options for Proxy, you don't have "localhost" excluded (by default), if so remove it.</p>

<p>To test that your browser is passing through JMeter recorder, stop the JMeter Recorder and test your application, if it answers then your browser is misconfigured.</p>
