<p>I'd say start adding some extra logging calls before calling delay on server2 just to make sure your celery config is correct when running it as a webserver (as opposed to the manage.py shell instance). It sounds like some startup script for gunicorn / uwsgi / apache / magic isn't loading some variable needed to actually configure the celery correctly. Or it's just being overridden somehow in that context.</p>

<p>Really horrible method is run your webserver on server2 as manage.py runserver and put a PDB in there right before your call to <code>.delay()</code> and poke around. Not exactly something you want open to the general internet while you're doing that but when all else fails...</p>
