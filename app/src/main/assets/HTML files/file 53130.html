<p>Well I got it working,</p>

<p>Decided to go look at where exactly the AttributeError was being thrown from so I inspected the <code>reportlab/rl_config.py</code> and <code>reportlab/lib/utils.py</code> files and found that it was checking objects recursively looking for directories (as insinuated by <code>rl_isdir</code>). Some how the FrozenImporter got stuck being checked with a list of other objects </p>

<p>so I replaced the line:</p>

<pre><code>return len(list(filter(lambda x,pn=pn: x.startswith(pn),list(__loader__._files.keys()))))&gt;0
</code></pre>

<p>with:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    return len(list(filter(lambda x,pn=pn: x.startswith(pn),list(__loader__._files.keys()))))&gt;0
except AttributeError:
    return False
</code></pre>

<p>This may not have been the cleanest most efficient way to resolve the issue but it only touches one line of the original code so I found this to be the most straight forward solution.</p>
