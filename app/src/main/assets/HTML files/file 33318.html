<p>According to the scrapy <a href="http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html" rel="nofollow">Architecture Overview</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Item Pipeline is responsible for processing the items once they
  have been extracted (or scraped) by the spiders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically that means that, first, scrapy spiders are working, then extracted items are going to the pipelines - no way to go backwards.</p>

<p>One possible solution would be, in the pipeline itself, check if the Item you've scraped is already in the database.</p>

<p>Another workaround would be to keep the list of urls you've crawled in the database, and, in the spider, check if you've already got the data from a url.</p>

<p>Since I'm not sure what do you mean by "start from the beginning" - I cannot suggest anything specific.</p>

<p>Hope at least this information helped.</p>
