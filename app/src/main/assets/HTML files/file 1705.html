<p>No, this is not grammatically correct. Curtis's is the correct way to say that something belongs to Curtis, since Curtis is singular. If a noun is plural you would using the trailing apostrophe to indicate the possessive.</p>

<p>Edit:
Shaun, in my most humble opinion as person with experience as a writer and editor of the English language as well as a programmer, I don't feel that there is any easy answer to this problem. I do not feel that it is correct to write "Curtis'" to express the possessive, and I also feel that there is widespread -- though not universal -- agreement on the subject.</p>

<p>The real work of any algorithmic approach to solving this problem is determining whether or not the noun is singular or plural, and that is an exceedingly difficult problem to solve, one that is well beyond the scope of a StackOverflow answer. Best of luck to you.</p>
