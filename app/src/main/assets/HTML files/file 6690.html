<p>Because it's an instance method, if you want to call it, you need an instance. That's simply how the CLR works. However, there are two options you could go with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make the member functions static.</strong> If they're as simple as returning a static value, there's no reason for them to be instance methods. However, if you do actually require instance data...</li>
<li><strong>Use a singleton instance.</strong> This way you don't need to create a new instance every time you want to call your static method.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do the latter like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
    private static MyClass singletonInstance;
    public static MyClass SingletonInstance
    {
        get
        {
            if (singletonInstance == null)
            {
                singletonInstance = new MyClass();
            }
            return singletonInstance;
        }
    }

    // the rest of your class implementation
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can call your static method like so:</p>

<pre><code>AnotherClass.UseMyClass(MyClass.SingletonInstance.Zero);
</code></pre>
