<p>We had exactly the same problem.  What we had to do is write a script at the bottom of the page that quickly blurs then refocuses to the textbox.  You can have a look at the (terribly hacky) solution here: <a href="http://www.drive.com.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.drive.com.au</a> </p>

<p>The textbox id is <code> MainSearchBox_SearchTextBox</code>.  Have a look at about line 586 &amp; you can see where I'm wiring up all the events (I'm actually using prototype for this bit.</p>

<p>Basically on the focus event of the textbox I set a global var called <code>textBoxHasFocus</code> to true and on the blur event I set it to false.  The on the load event of the page I call this script:</p>

<pre><code>if (textBoxHasFocus) {
    $get("MainSearchBox_SearchTextBox").blur();
    $get("MainSearchBox_SearchTextBox").focus();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This resets the textbox.  It's really dodgy, but it's the only solution I could find</p>
