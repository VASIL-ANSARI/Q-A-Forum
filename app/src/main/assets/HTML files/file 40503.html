<p>You're capturing a reference to the <code>cardNum</code> parameter. I would think you want to capture that one by value.</p>

<p>It's not clear to me what <code>delegate</code> is. Assuming it's a class member then I think you just need <code>[this, discardedCard, cardNum]</code>. Which you could abbreviate to just <code>[=]</code>, although I think the explicit one is clearer.</p>
