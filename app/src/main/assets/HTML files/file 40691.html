<p>You should be able to access those variables easily as they have the access modifier "public" which means they are globally accessible. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$dbc = new Main( 'val1', 'val2', 'val3' );

echo $dbc-&gt;email, ' ', $dbc-&gt;password1, ' ', $dbc-&gt;password2, PHP_EOL;
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet would work fine</p>

<p>Edit : I would also like to add that an active MySQL connection or available MySQL resource would be required to use the mysql_real_escape_string function.</p>
