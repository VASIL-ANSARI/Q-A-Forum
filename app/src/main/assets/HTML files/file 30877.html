<p>The <code>d__5</code> portion is a prefix that is generated by the C# compiler to keep the construct unique from other generated members / types.   In this case the <code>d</code> prefix means that it is an iterator or async method generated class (<code>d</code> is used for both).  The number is just incremented for every name that is generated</p>
