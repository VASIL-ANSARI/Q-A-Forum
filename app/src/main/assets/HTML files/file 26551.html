<p>Try this query</p>

<p>It works on the assumption that the id of parent are less than child as the records are being sorted in descending as a derived table before actual query.</p>

<pre><code>select 
  @parent:=parent_id as prnt, title, id
from
  (select @parent:=8 ) a
join 
  (select * from tbl order by id desc) b
where 
  @parent=id
</code></pre>

<h2><strong><a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/ce21a/1" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a></strong></h2>

<pre><code>| PRNT | TITLE | ID |
|------|-------|----|
|    7 |     q |  8 |
|    6 |     a |  7 |
|    0 |     d |  6 |
</code></pre>

<p>Note Best way is to do it is using a stored proc..</p>
