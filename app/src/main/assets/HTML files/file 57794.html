<p>I was able to re-produce this error on my test server. You should check following:</p>

<p>â You will have to make sure that the user you have added in your connection string is able to login to mysql server with the password you have entered in connection string. So, make sure that the username and password is correct.</p>

<p>â Make sure that you have entered correct servername for mysql. If you are using local mysql (installed in same server), you should use 'localhost' in connection string. If you are using remote mysql server, make sure that you have entered it in connection string properly and that user must have remote access.</p>
