<p>You'll have to disallow double-newlines. If your engine allows lookaheads:</p>

<pre><code>/^A:([a-z]*)(?:(?!(?:\r?\n){2,}).)*^C:([a-z]*)/sm
</code></pre>

<p>This will work on Windows/UNIX newlines, but not with Mac's. This will also make sure that A and C are at the start of a line (note the <code>m</code> modifier).</p>
