<p>I think you basically have two realistic approaches to solving this.  An unrealistic approach is to lock the table while browsing -- then new users can't go in.  Another approach is to create a temporary table for each user when they start the page.  Yuck!  </p>

<p>The second is to put a timestamp in when users register.  Then fetch this timestamp and use it for scrolling.  You need to get the timestamp from the database, to avoid slight differences in times on the application side and database side.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>select now() as as_of_date
</code></pre>

<p>Then put this in a variable and change the query to:</p>

<pre><code>select * from users where CreationTime &lt;= @as_of_date order by id desc limit 0, 20;
select * from users order CreationTime &lt;= @as_of_date by id desc limit 20, 20;
select * from users order CreationTime &lt;= @as_of_date by id desc limit 40, 20;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in more recent versions of MySQL you can set the current time as a default for a <code>datetime</code> time (instead of having to deal with a <code>timestamp</code> for this purpose).</p>
