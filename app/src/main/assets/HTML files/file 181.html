<p>The easiest would be to get the second value from this result set in the application:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT value FROM Table ORDER BY value DESC LIMIT 2
</code></pre>

<p>But if you must select the second value using SQL, how about:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT MIN(value) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT value FROM Table ORDER BY value DESC LIMIT 2) AS t
</code></pre>
