<p>Assuming you're using numpy, this is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>M = np.asarray(M) # make sure M is an array...it presumably would be
rav = np.mean(M, axis=0)
diffs = M - rav
</code></pre>

<p>which works due to <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html" rel="nofollow">broadcasting</a>.</p>

<p>If you're using plain lists, it's a little more complicated and the code will be much slower, but something like this should do it:</p>

<pre><code># M is a list of num_rows lists of num_cols floats
rav = [sum(row[j] for row in M) / num_rows for j in range(num_cols)]
diffs = [[x - mean_x for x, mean_x in zip(row, rav)] for row in M]
</code></pre>
