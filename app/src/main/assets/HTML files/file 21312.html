<ul>
<li>If the directive needs to change the value, use = to get bi-directional binding.  </li>
<li>If you want to make it clear to other people reading your code that you are only using one-way binding, use @.  </li>
<li>If you need access to the value in the linking function synchronously, use = (see note about @ and $observe's asynchronous behavior <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Directives">here</a>).  </li>
</ul>

<p>For your case, @ seems best.  (An example of how you would use the directive and elementID in an HTML element would be helpful though.)</p>

<p>I have no idea which is slower/faster.</p>
