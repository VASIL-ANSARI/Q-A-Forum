<p>Depending on the collation, those two characters might be treated as equivalent.
You could try another collation - utf8mb4_bin, but then you have to take care for lower-casing all the values in your application code to make sure the primary key is case-insensitive.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could lookup the characters you gave in your example in this database (I cannot post more than 2 links, sorry):
<a href="http://codepoints.net/" rel="nofollow">http://codepoints.net/</a></p>

<p>Their UTF Code Points are:
U+20089
U+2000B</p>

<p>Check here for the standard collation maps: <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/uca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicode.org/charts/uca/</a></p>

<p>I could not find those two characters in any Unicode collation maps, but there are many cases with Latin characters with diacritics (e.g. 'Ã' and 'C'), which are defined as equivalents in the utf8 case-insensitive collation maps.</p>
