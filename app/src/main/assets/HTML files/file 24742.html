<p>I think I figured out this. 
I initialized the tab in <code>WM_INITDIALOG</code> which turned out to be the problem, because each time the application showing the tab dialogs it send this message and initialize them again. I remove this part from initdialog to initialization of the application before entering the message loop</p>
