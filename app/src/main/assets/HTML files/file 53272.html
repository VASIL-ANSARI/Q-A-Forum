<p>Javascript engine used in ReactNative is headless, meaning it does not provide global objects like <code>navigator</code>, <code>document</code>, <code>location</code>, etc. Other than that the browser is fully functional and has all <code>XHR</code> functionalities of a normal browser. </p>

<p>Storephe's communication with the server is all based on XHR requests. You only need to mock the document object to prevent Strophe from raising an exception when it can't find the <code>document</code> object. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-browser" rel="nofollow">mock-browser</a> build for that exact reason. A simple example of how to use it:</p>

<pre><code>let MockBrowser = require('mock-browser').mocks.MockBrowser;
let mock = new MockBrowser();
GLOBAL.window = mock.getWindow()
GLOBAL.document = mock.getDocument()
GLOBAL.navigator = mock.getNavigator()
</code></pre>
