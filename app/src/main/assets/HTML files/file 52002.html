<p>In a nut shell <code>await</code> makes sure that for I/O operations (like database queries, file reads, network writes, etc) that the thread is released back to the O/S while the code waits for the result on a completion port. This way your threads or not sitting around indling waiting on I/O to complete, now they can be reused by the O/S for other activities. Once the I/O completes the O/S will reassign a new thread OR use the original thread (depending on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task.configureawait(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">ConfigureAwait</a>) to resume the operation. </p>

<p>So this is not parallel or concurrent programming, it is simply allowing the thread to service other requests while a process (code point) waits on I/O to complete.</p>
