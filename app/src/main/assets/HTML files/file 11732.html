<p>You could try DOM Mutation Events, which are dispatched eg. when a property of an element is changed.</p>

<p>There are plugins for jQuery, which mimes the behavior of event mutation (although I haven't tried any of those).</p>

<p>But feel free to google about mutation events in jQuery and that should probably help you.</p>
