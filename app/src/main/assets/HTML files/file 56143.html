<p>Both C and B should be interfaces.
Example below (I used <code>Closeable</code> interface in one of the blanks, but you can use any known from JDK)</p>

<pre><code>public interface C {}
interface B extends Closeable, C {}
</code></pre>

<p>When interfaces inherit one another, they use the <code>extends</code> keyword instead of <code>implements</code> (which is used when class is inheriting from interface).</p>
