<p>Delete the line </p>

<pre><code>import playfaircrack
</code></pre>

<p>in <code>playfair.py</code> and it should work.</p>

<p>Alternatively, rename <code>playfaircrack.so</code> to something else or moved it to a different directory.
Python gets confused if you have two files with the same module name, i.e.
<code>playfaircrack.py</code> and <code>playfaircrack.so</code> in the same directory. Python tries to import <code>playfaircrack.so</code>, which is no valid Python module, before it gets to <code>playfaircrack.py</code>.</p>
