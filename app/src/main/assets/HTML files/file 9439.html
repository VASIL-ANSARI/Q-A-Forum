<p>Sure, this is called a proxy (or if you're using JSON, it can be JSONP), and it's platform independent.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Browser makes an Ajax request to somewhere the same domain that you control, such as /AjaxProxy.aspx</li>
<li>You have an ASP.NET page at AjaxProxy.aspx that makes a call out to the web service with some parameters</li>
<li>AjaxProxy.aspx spits out the results of the web service call to Response.Output (or however else you choose to display it on the page)</li>
<li>Browser receives those contents and you can work with it just like you'd made a call to the actual web service.</li>
</ol>
