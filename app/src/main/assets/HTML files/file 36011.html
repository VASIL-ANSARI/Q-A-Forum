<p>You can use a template engine that fills your data in to a template that you can write like HTML with some additional placeholders. A template engine has some great advantages over echoing out the values:</p>

<ul>
<li>separate code from layout</li>
<li>reusable</li>
<li>better maintainability and readability</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the template engines I used in PHP, they also have good documentation to get you started:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.smarty.net/" rel="nofollow">Smarty</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/" rel="nofollow">Twig</a></li>
</ul>
