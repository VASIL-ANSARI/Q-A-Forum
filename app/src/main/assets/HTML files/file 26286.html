<p>Not possible, You can generate a PDF using DocRaptor, or you can use a ruby gem: <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=pdf</a></p>

<p>Alot of people like Prawn, i like flying saucer but it requires jRuby.</p>

<p>Pdfkit is a great option also as it uses Webkit which is the same engine as browsers like chrome.</p>

<p>Also after you've generated your PDF you can use a rails mailer and use the pdf as an attachment giving a similar email pdf functionality that you are looking for. Or you could save the file to public and launch a mail to that includes a link to the pdf you generated.</p>
