<p>You are doing a SELECT without an ORDER BY clause, therefore you cannot expect a deterministic order of rows returned.</p>

<p>In practice it is very difficult to make a working application against different versions of MySQL; 4.1 is very old, consider upgrading as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Supporting different versions of PHP is even harder (they frequently make incompatible changes).</p>

<p>I am assuming that you believe these two environments have identical data. Construct a test case which demonstrates, with known data, what output you're expecting and what output you're getting. Post that then people might be able to tell what you're trying to do.</p>
