<p>If the records have sequential id's you could do a self join like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t2.*, t2.timestamp - t1.timestamp AS timediff
FROM foo t1 inner join foo.t2 on t1.id = t2.id-1
</code></pre>

<p>You'd probably need to tweak this to handle the first and last records, but that's the basics.</p>
