<p>this should work if you replace the Â´Meteor.startupÂ´ with Â´Template.entergame.createdÂ´</p>

<p>Â´Meteor.startupÂ´ is for the server and will not execute every time your template is rendered. This is why for every template you have a Â´createdÂ´ event.</p>

<p>emgee is right: you should use <a href="https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router" rel="nofollow">iron-router</a> for your client side routing (no server side for now). especially so since iron-router allows you to set the default data for your template on render.</p>
