<pre><code>xo = ((temp.npieces%2)==1)? 1 : 2;
</code></pre>

<p>if <code>temp.npieces</code> is Even (therefore division remainder is 0) xo is now equal to 2
other wise xo is now equal to 1;</p>

<p>Edit : It does not check if it is Odd, it checks whether the remainder is positive 1.</p>

<pre><code>X ? A : B 
</code></pre>

<p>is another way of writing</p>

<pre><code>if(X)
{
    A
}else
{
    B
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit2 :</p>

<p>The purpose of the conditional operator is not to be faster, or more consise. The conditional operator returns a value. <code>if</code> does not. That's the main difference. <code>Therefore x ? A : B isn't exactly the same as if( x ) { A; } else { B; }</code></p>

<p>in C Something is true if it is not equal to 0. (even if it is -145)</p>
