<p>Based on exception:</p>

<pre><code>org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type [org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSenderImpl]
</code></pre>

<p>it seems that Spring can't find bean to be injected into </p>

<pre><code>@Autowired
JavaMailSenderImpl mailSender;
</code></pre>

<p>in <code>SendMail</code> class.</p>

<p>Are you sure there is a bean of class <code>JavaMailSenderImpl</code> defined?</p>

<p>BTW It's a little bit unusual that an implementation class is injected directly (and not its interface).</p>
