<p>You cannot put assignments outside the context of a function in C++. If you're puzzled by the fact that you sometimes saw the <code>=</code> symbol being used outside the context of a function, such as:</p>

<pre><code>int x = 42; // &lt;== THIS IS NOT AN ASSIGNMENT!

int main()
{
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's because the <code>=</code> symbol can be used for <em>initialization</em> as well. In your example, you are not initializing the data members <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, you are assigning a value to them.</p>
