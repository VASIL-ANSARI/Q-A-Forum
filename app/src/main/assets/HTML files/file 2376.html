<p>Everything depends on your database engine/implementation.</p>

<p>For me simple queues on tables with following columns:</p>

<pre><code>id / task / priority / date_added
</code></pre>

<p>usually works.</p>

<p>I used priority and task to group tasks and in case of doubled task i choosed the one with bigger priority.</p>

<p>And don't worry - for modern databases "thousands" is nothing special.</p>
