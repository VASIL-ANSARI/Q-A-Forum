<p>Your question doesn't make it clear for which dates you want to get <code>0</code>: you can't just list all dates which aren't present in your data, there is an infinite number of them! However, I guess that you meant to get <code>date, 0</code> for those dates where there <em>are</em> transactions, but none of them have category <code>'Food'</code>. In this case you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>select date, sum(case when category = 'Food' then amount else 0 end)
from transactions
group by date
</code></pre>
