<p>There isn't any request throttling for making <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/available-phone-numbers" rel="nofollow">requests to the API</a>.  Are you making each request sequentially or are you doing it in parallel.  </p>

<p>Remember that by default Windows limits the number of outbound HTTP connections to 2, so you might be asking Windows to make a bunch of requests that its dropping onto the floor.  You can change that by setting the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.defaultconnectionlimit(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">DefaultConnectionLimit</a> property.</p>

<p>Another suggestion for debugging is to break out fiddler and see if there are 1000 outbound requests being made, where some % are not receiving a response, or if for some reason requests are not even being made.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
