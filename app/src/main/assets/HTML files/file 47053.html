<p>In Oracle Community I was helped by Florin Marcus:</p>

<p>I quote the answer that works for me:</p>

<p>"Probably you are still propagating the event to the server. You can easily double-check this with a  browser plugin like Firefox/Firebug, see if there is any server request being sent.</p>

<p>Normally, you will need to explicitly cancel the event from propagating to the server. For example, if you have a clientListener on a button, you do something like below:</p>

<pre><code>function showPopupFromAction(actionEvent)
{
  actionEvent.cancel();
//your logic here

}
</code></pre>

<p>"</p>
