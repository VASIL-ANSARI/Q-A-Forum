<p>Replace Solr with <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/text.112/e24435/overview.htm#i1007403" rel="nofollow">Oracle Text</a>.</p>

<p>Before I get down-voted: normally I would <em>not</em> recommend replacing existing code built with a popular, open-source program with a seldom-used, proprietary product.  But if you want to use a lot of space and CPU on your database servers then Oracle Text can definitely help.</p>

<p>As more generic advice, the primary role of a database is not to store data.  A file system can do that.  Databases are built to join data.  If an application is reading a large amount of data and doing ad hoc joins, those are the jobs you want to move to the database.</p>
