  <p>Let's say that I want to get the lastLocation but with an accuracy no better than 1km, how can I do that?</p>

<p>You don't. You get a location. It will have whatever accuracy it has, which you can determine via <code>getAccuracy()</code> on the <code>Location</code> object. Other than by choosing coarse versus fine, you do not have control over the actual accuracy.</p>
