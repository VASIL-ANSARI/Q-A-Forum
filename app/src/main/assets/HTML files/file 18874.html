<p>I've managed correct and stable image centering. Instead of calculating center of image I'm calculating UIImageView's frame's origin coordinates like this: </p>

<pre><code>CGPoint newOrigin = CGPointMake((-zoomRect.origin.x * delta) + superCenter.x - (zoomRect.size.width / 2) * delta, 
                                (-zoomRect.origin.y * delta) + superCenter.y - (zoomRect.size.height / 2) * delta);
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out there is some difference between calculating center and origin. Anyway problem is solved. Thanks everybody.</p>
