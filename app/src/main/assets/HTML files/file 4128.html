<p>Just add a Setup project to your current solution. A setup project uses the Windows Installer technology which gives you the repair and remove option for free. Use this type of project when you have a "simple" installation. If you want more control (custom dialogs) you should install <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Wix</a>. It plugs into VS and you can define an installation file in XML which is then compiled to a Windows Installer package.</p>
