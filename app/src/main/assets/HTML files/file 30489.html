<p>how i might do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>get an image showing up in the ui, running on the phone, base case :)</li>
<li>make a 'ThreeSixtyImageView' (subclass of UIView) that contains a big UIImageView.</li>
<li>keep an NSArray of UIImages in your ThreeSixtyImageView class; load up all your UIImages into that array.</li>
<li>keep a number that's an index into that array.  when it changes, set the UIImageView image to the UIImage at that array index!  hook up a button that increments the index (and show that image) to make sure that works.</li>
<li>add a UIPanGestureRecognizer to track touch state</li>
<li>when the pan gesture begins, remember which image you're on, and where they tapped (as an anchor point)</li>
<li>when the pan gesture updates, subtract the anchor and divide by something that feels nice to get 'how much user wants images to rotate'.  this gives you a new image index value.</li>
<li>update your main UIImage with that new image index (into your array)</li>
</ol>

<p>if there's a step here you don't understand, look in the examples included in the xcode/iOS documentation, and copy their code!  the sample code is pretty good, and helped me a lot with editing XIB documents, and learning about GestureRecognizers.</p>

<p>good luck!</p>
