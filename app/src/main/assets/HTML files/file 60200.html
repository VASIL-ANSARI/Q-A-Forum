<p>your inner loop never finishes, because its stop condition will never be reached.</p>

<pre><code>for (int j = 0, n = strlen(argv[i]); j &lt; n; j = 0)
</code></pre>

<p>You most likely meant</p>

<pre><code>for(int j = 0, n = strlen(argv[i]); j &lt; n; j++)
</code></pre>

<p>As pointed out by Varsha, you have the same problem with the outer loop too. Seems that you need to freshen up your knowledge of C loops :)</p>
