<p>I don't see a way for a single regex to count the uppercase letter amid the other lowercase letters and digits.  As they say, regular expressions can't count.</p>

<p>So, I think your solution will entail a regex to determine that the appropriate <em>kinds</em> of letters are present and then in a separate step you can count the upper-case characters afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>/[A-Za-z0-9]{8,16}/
</code></pre>

<p>For the subsequent steps (validating that the string has at least two uppercase characters, two lowercase letters, and two digits), try these three regexes:</p>

<pre><code>/[A-Z].*[A-Z]/
/[0-9].*[0-9]/
/[a-z].*[a-z]/
</code></pre>

<p>Any string that matches all four regexes will be one that meets your password criteria.</p>

<p>That being said, it may be easier to make a function without regexes and just do simple character counts in a loop.</p>
