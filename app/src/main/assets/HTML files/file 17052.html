<p>In which iOS have you tried.? I tried on iOS 6 simulator works fine, opens the map app directly. In iOS simulator it opened safari has it doesn't have map app on simulator.</p>

<p>I have tried the below code on button action, its similar the one you used.</p>

<pre><code>NSString* url = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"http://maps.apple.com/maps?daddr=%f,%f&amp;saddr=Current%%20Location", 40.7142, 74.0064];
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:url]];
</code></pre>
