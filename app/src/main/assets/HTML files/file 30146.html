<p>The <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/Sprite.html#setColor%28com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Color%29" rel="nofollow">Sprite#setColor</a> method, sets the Color that will be used to tint the sprite when rendered with <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/SpriteBatch.html" rel="nofollow">SpriteBatch</a>.</p>

<p>The default color is white, if you set the color to white again, what you are doing is rendering the image exactly as it is (i.e. No tint).</p>
