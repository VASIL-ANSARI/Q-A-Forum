<p>If you want to include your form on the same page, then you need to include it in your main signup.php file, like so;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--your html form goes here--&gt;

&lt;?php
  //all php code goes in here

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anything outside of the PHP opening and closing tags in a .php file will be treated as HTML markup.</p>
