/*End goal is to display the $price variable next to the product depending on if client has the High, medium, or low rate. Rate will be pulled from "client" data, m_type and multipliers will be pulled from "Product group" data, and all other variables will be found in the "product" data. 
If client is not logged in, multiplier uses high value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
