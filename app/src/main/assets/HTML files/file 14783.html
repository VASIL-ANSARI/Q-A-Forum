<p>Set the socket to non-blocking prior to calling <code>connect()</code>, and then do a <code>select()</code> or <code>poll()</code> on it to find out any events going on on it. </p>

<p>Note: Using this setup you'll be getting a non-zero return from <code>connect()</code> and <code>errno</code> is set to <code>EINPROGRESS</code> in the case <code>connect()</code> returns without having connected but still is trying to do.</p>

<p>Please see the <code>ERRORS</code> section of <code>connect()</code>'s man page for more on this.</p>
