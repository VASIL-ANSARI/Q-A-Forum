<p>u can try self-join</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p1.* FROM products AS p1 
INNER JOIN
     (SELECT id
     FROM products
     ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20) AS p2
ON p1.id = p2.id
ORDER BY p1.price ASC
</code></pre>

<p>Im not sure about joining to temporary tables in laravel query-builder. 
At least u can do this in raw-way:</p>

<pre><code>$results = DB::select(DB::raw("
    SELECT p1.* FROM products AS p1 
    INNER JOIN
            (SELECT id
            FROM products
            ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20) AS p2
        ON p1.id = p2.id
    ORDER BY p1.price ASC
"));
</code></pre>
