<p>If you are using <code>16-bit</code> integers, you could just have <code>numerator = 59578</code> and denominator just hold a power factor of <code>10</code>, for instance <code>5</code>.  So the answer would be <code>59578/(10^5)</code>.</p>

<p>With this approach you would at least keep <code>4</code> places of precision. 
 Just a thought...</p>
