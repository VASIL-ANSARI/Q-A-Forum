<p>Just comment the statement , <strong><code>echo "sall goodman"</code></strong> and you are good to go such that you won't get the repeated success message.<br><br>
I have extended your example a bit, If all files are uploaded successfully you get the message <strong><code>All files have been successfully uploaded</code></strong> , else say if some 2 files failed on upload then you will get <strong><code>2 file(s) have been failed during upload</code></strong>.</p>

<pre><code>$totFiles = 0;
$successUploadFiles=0;
foreach (glob("black/*") as $filename)
 if(ftp_put($conn, $ftpFolder . basename($filename) , $filename, FTP_BINARY)) {
 //echo "sall goodman";
 $successUploadFiles++;
 }
 else { echo "not goot bruh"; }
$totFiles++;
}

if($totFiles == $successUploadFiles)
{
echo "All files have been successfully uploaded";
}
else
{
echo $totFiles-$successUploadFiles." file(s) have been failed during upload";
}
</code></pre>
