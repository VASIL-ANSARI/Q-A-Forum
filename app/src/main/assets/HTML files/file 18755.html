<p>Have you double-checked the order of precedence of the following line? </p>

<pre><code>((x + y * (mCanvasWidth/tile_width)))
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting question though: are you drawing solid colors? I would also see if this is actually making a Bitmap:</p>

<pre><code>mBackgroundImages.add(Bitmap.createBitmap(tile));
</code></pre>

<p>You might actually be able to just keep references instead of creating a lot of bitmaps, but that can come later</p>
