<p>Stack memory is consumed by both automatic variables and recursive function calls.  You use large amounts of both.</p>

<p>You can replace recursion with iteration (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/159590/way-to-go-from-recursion-to-iteration">Way to go from recursion to iteration</a>) and you can replace your automatic variable (the giant array) with a heap-allocated one (using <code>new</code>).</p>

<p>Doing both of these things should help you here.  Just make sure when you go to an iterative approach for your Collatz function that you use a heap-allocated stack so you don't get the same problem all over again!</p>
