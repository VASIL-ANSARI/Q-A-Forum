<p>I've found that, by default, decompressing an image to a bitmap doesn't scale with high density screens.  You have to set the density to none.  In other words, you specify that the image is meant for an unknown density.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap b = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(filepath);
b.setDensity(Bitmap.DENSITY_NONE);
</code></pre>
