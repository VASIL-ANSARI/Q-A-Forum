<p>The issue has been solved by updating Visual Studio's tools and updating the Windows SDK to the Windows 10 Anniversary  Update SDK, build 14393.</p>

<p>After I updated the XAML designer was not bringing up any errors regarding an incorrect installation of either Visual Studio or the Windows 10 SDK</p>
