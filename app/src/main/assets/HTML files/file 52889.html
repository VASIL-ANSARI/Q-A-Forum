<p>If you're using MySQL this would work:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(DATE, '%Y %b') AS MONTH,
    SUM(AMOUNT) AS TOTAL,
    SUM(IF(CATEGORY='A', AMOUNT, 0)) AS `Category-A`,
    SUM(IF(CATEGORY='B', AMOUNT, 0)) AS `Category-B`,
    SUM(IF(CATEGORY='C', AMOUNT, 0)) AS `Category-C`
FROM your_table
GROUP BY MONTH;
</code></pre>

<p>For other database engines you might have to change that a little.</p>
