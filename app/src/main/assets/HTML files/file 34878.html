<p>AutoLayout is allegedly a good layout engine. But I've never seen this demonstrated in the real world, for me it just ends up being a headache.</p>

<p>I suggest disabling AutoLayout (which you can do in the document inspector for the xib file) and using the old/proven springs and struts system. When you need layout too complex for springs/struts, write some custom code in a view controller to handle it.</p>
