<p>You could use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg" rel="nofollow">ffmpeg</a> for that. Of course, this is not a Java library, so you'd have to use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html" rel="nofollow">NDK</a>. There are various ways to concatenate video files with ffmpeg, as described <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/faq.html#How-can-I-join-video-files_003f" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few multimedia containers (MPEG-1, MPEG-2 PS, DV) allow to
  concatenate video by merely concatenating the files them.</p>
  
  <p>Hence you may concatenate your multimedia files by first transcoding
  them to these privileged formats, then using the humble cat command
  (or the equally humble copy under Windows), and finally transcoding
  back to your format of choice.</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input1.avi -qscale:v 1 intermediate1.mpg
ffmpeg -i input2.avi -qscale:v 1 intermediate2.mpg
cat intermediate1.mpg intermediate2.mpg &gt; intermediate_all.mpg
ffmpeg -i intermediate_all.mpg -qscale:v 2 output.avi
</code></pre>
