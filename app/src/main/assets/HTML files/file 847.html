<p>Your post has far too many questions in it to be answered easily in one response, so you might try re-posting with specific questions. Data visualization is a HUGE area of study and it's not significantly different for web applications versus desktop applications. </p>

<p>Put simply, it's the display of data in a way that visually tells the story of the data. It's most useful in cases where the volume of data is such that tabular display isn't effective. Trends, outliers, and abnormal occurrences can sometimes only be seen when data is represented visually. Visually can be a simple chart, or it can be more advanced visualizations such as treemaps or thematic mapping/GIS presentations.</p>

<p>If it's an area you're interested in studying, look into:</p>

<p><a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home">Many Eyes</a> - from IBM AlphaWorks</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0596514557">Visualizing Data</a> - An O'Reilly book by Ben Fry, one of the co-creators of Processing</p>

<p>Beyond that, I think specifics would depend on what you want to accomplish -- what data is being analyzed, who the audience is, and what the desired "message" is.</p>
