<p>I will program something like this</p>

<pre><code>collection = [(0, 33), (3, 26), (4, 95), (0, 28), (1, 12), (2, 3), (4, 69)]
output = 0
for elem in collection:
    collection.remove(elem)
    new_collection = collection
    part_output = 0
    for new_elem in new_collection:
        if elem[0] == new_elem[0]:
            part_output = (part_output * new_elem[1]) if part_output != 0 else (elem[1] * new_elem[1])
            collection.remove(new_elem)
    output = output + part_output

print output
</code></pre>

<p>The tuple-list is iterated only once and elements are removed as those are not needed.</p>
