<p>Ok, I finally got it, the above code was working alright.</p>

<p>When you reload a page, the browser will try to check each resources with the server. He'll then compare the cache cache content with what's on the serveur using the etag and issues 304 responses.</p>

<p>So, one should never test his http cache settings by reloading his page (f5). Just follow a link, or use a bookmark.</p>

<p>An easy-to-make mistake.</p>
