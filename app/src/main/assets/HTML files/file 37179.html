<p>It's no problem at all to use <code>memcpy</code> here. However, you will need to use <code>VirtualProtect</code> to change the protection flags for the destination to <code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</code>. Restore the original protection when you've finished writing. </p>

<p>If you are targeting x86/x64 that's all you need to do. For other architectures you need a call to <code>FlushInstructionCache</code>. </p>

<p>It is also a mistake to store a pointer to a <code>DWORD</code>. Don't cast the return value of <code>GetProcAddress</code>. It is a pointer. </p>
