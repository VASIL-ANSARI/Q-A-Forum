<p>As I could see you didn't make you images like block elements (images are inline elements by default). Try try use <code>display: block;</code> or <code>display: inline-block;</code> in your CSS classes and then use <code>text-align: left;</code>.</p>

<p>Also floated elements could behave wrong, because they "condensed" to the content even if you use a block level element. So also try to delete float rules from CSS classes or use <code>clear:left;</code>.</p>
