<p>See <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759262%28v=ws.10%29.aspx#BKMK_Uninstall" rel="nofollow">"To uninstall a product"</a>; you can specify a ProductCode, which is globally unique by definition. So you won't uninstall any other product. You can also specify the msi filename, but you have to be more carefull, as it can happen that different products get the same filename. So using the ProductCode is the best way to do this.</p>
