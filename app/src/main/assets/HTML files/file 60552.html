<p>The problem is that the content type is not automatically set.
You will need to override org.apache.wicket.request.resource.AbstractResource#setResponseHeaders() and set with via <code>resourceResponse.setContentType(String)</code>.</p>

<p>Maybe this should be done automatically by Wicket in org.apache.wicket.request.resource.DynamicImageResource, since it knows the format ("png", or "gif" as in your case). Please file a ticket in Wicket's JIRA for this improvement! Thanks!</p>
