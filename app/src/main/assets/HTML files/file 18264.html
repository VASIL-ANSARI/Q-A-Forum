<p>You can't.  There are no such standard messages for dumping the current patch, CC values, etc.</p>

<p>Some synths have sysex messages that can be used for this, but not all, and that message varies from device to device, manufacturer to manufacturer.</p>

<p>The best you can do is send new CC values, set the patch, etc., and store what it is.  If it changes on the synth end, and you have a return path set up, you can receive it and update what you have stored.</p>
