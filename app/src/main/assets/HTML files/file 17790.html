<p>Use the Android logging functions:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;android/log.h&gt;
.... 
__android_log_print(ANDROID_LOG_VERBOSE, "MyApp", "The value of n is %d", n);
</code></pre>

<p><sup><sub>Note to those reading this after the question was edited: the question originally didn't specify that the OP didn't want to use the functions in &lt;android/log.h>`.</sub></sup></p>
