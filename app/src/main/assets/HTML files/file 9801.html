<p>You could try <code>setAllowsInvalid(false)</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>JFormattedTextField txt = ((JSpinner.NumberEditor) mySpinner.getEditor()).getTextField();
((NumberFormatter) txt.getFormatter()).setAllowsInvalid(false);
</code></pre>

<p>By setting this property, the Jspinner will show only valid values in the field and ignores all other values entered by the user. also the user will not be able to delete the whole value entered in the Jspinner i.e. if the user tries to select the entire value and delete it will not be allowed. User can edit the field only with a valid value other wise the it will seem like un-editable.</p>
