<p>The MySQL client library tries to guess how to connect to your database. When you give <code>localhost</code> as the hostname, it assumes, that you're using a local socket (search your computer for a file named <code>mysql.sock</code>, probably under <code>/var/lib/mysql</code> or <code>/usr/local/mysql/</code>. </p>

<p>However, when you use <em>anything</em> else, like an ip address, a different hostname, or, in your case, <code>mysqldev</code>, it tries to connect to the host via tcp. From the error message, it seems as if your local mysql server is not listening on the tcp port 3306 (the mysql default)</p>

<p>Check, if your my.cnf (probably <code>/etc/my.cnf</code> or <code>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</code>) allows the use of tcp. If you find a line like</p>

<pre><code>skip-networking
</code></pre>

<p>comment it out:</p>

<pre><code>#skip-networking
</code></pre>

<p>and restart the server. Then try again to connect.</p>

<hr>

<p>To find out, where your socket is, connect through localhost and issue the following command:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; show global variables like '%socket%';
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| Variable_name | Value                       |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
| socket        | /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock |
+---------------+-----------------------------+
</code></pre>
