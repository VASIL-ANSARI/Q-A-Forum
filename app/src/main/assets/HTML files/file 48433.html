<p>I'm the creator of osc.js. Until recently, osc.js didn't directly support asynchronous module loaders. After seeing your question, I added support to the library for the <a href="https://github.com/umdjs/umd" rel="nofollow">universal module definition</a> style boilerplate, so osc.js <a href="http://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js" rel="nofollow">version 1.1.3</a> and above should work with Require.js now.</p>
