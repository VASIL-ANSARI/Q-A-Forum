<p>.NET stops you from assuming that a Thread is actually an operating system thread.  It is on any shipping version of the CLR but that was not originally the plan.  A project in the SQL Server team to implement Thread on top of a fiber failed.  You'll have to pinvoke GetCurrentThreadId().  Visit pinvoke.net for the declaration.</p>
