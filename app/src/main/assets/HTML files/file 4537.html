<p>lzo is an alternative to zlib, it </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>offers pretty fast compression and <em>extremely</em> fast decompression." It does not support streaming, as the similar compression library Zlib (http://www.gzip.org/zlib/) does. It's licensed under the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>However zlib is also a good choice. The advantage of lzo is the emphasis is on the speed of decompression, it is also faster than zlib however zlib provides better compression ratio.</p>

<p>Trade offs :)</p>
