<p>It says, that in a hosted environment, <code>main</code> should have a type.  Quote from C++ standard 3.6.1, paragraph 2</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An implementation shall not predefine the <code>main</code> function. This function
  shall not be overloaded. It shall have a return type of type <code>int</code>, but
  otherwise its type is implementation-defined. All implementations
  shall allow both â a function of () returning <code>int</code> and â a function of
  (int, pointer to pointer to char) returning <code>int</code> as the type of <code>main</code>
  (8.3.5).</p>
