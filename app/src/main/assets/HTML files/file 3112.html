<p>It depends on what you want to do with non-unique rows. If you want to not have them in the result set you could use group by and having:</p>

<pre><code>select Name, Parent, Max(Category) 
from Table
group by Name, Parent
having count(*) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>You need the Max(Category) because you aren't grouping by that column, even though there will only be one row per Name and Parent.</p>

<p>If, though, you want to include non-unique rows in the result, similar to:</p>

<pre><code>select distinct Name, Parent, Category from Table
</code></pre>

<p>except that two rows with the same Name and Parent but different Category only return a single row. In that case you need to decide what to show for Category, since more than one row will be condensed down to one. You could still use Max(Category) or Min(Category) and group by, but leave off the having.</p>

<pre><code>select Name, Parent, Max(Category) 
from Table
group by Name, Parent
</code></pre>
