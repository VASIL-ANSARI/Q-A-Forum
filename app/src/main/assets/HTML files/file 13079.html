<p>This is what your query would look like with a subquery:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
CONCAT(m.Nume,' ',m.Prenume) AS Medic,
  m.Specialty,
COUNT(v.Data_viz) AS nrviz
FROM
  visits v
INNER JOIN
  medics m
ON(v.Medic_id=m.id_med)
WHERE
YEAR(v.Data_viz) = (SELECT...)
GROUP BY
  Medic
ORDER BY
  m.Specialitate,
  nrviz DESC
</code></pre>

<p>The thing to know about subqueries is that they are executed before your main query,</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
