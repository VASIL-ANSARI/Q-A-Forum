<p>You could do this by means of a userscript (small snippets of JavaScript code that change the behaviour of a website).</p>

<p>Userscripts normally have a format similar to:</p>

<pre><code>// ==UserScript==
// @name Example Script
// @description Whatever it does
// @match http://www.example.com/*
// @require http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
// ==/UserScript==
alert("hello");
</code></pre>

<p>What is important here is the line beginning @match, which specifies when your script should run. The above example will alert "hello" whenever you visit a page whose url begins with <code>http://www.example.com/</code>. The @require allows you to import other scripts, such as jQuery.</p>

<p>To make life easier, most people use a userscript manager such as <a href="http://tampermonkey.net/" rel="nofollow">Tampermonkey</a> or <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/" rel="nofollow">Greasemonkey</a>. These allow you to edit, debug and generally your scripts within the browser. They also take care of the bolierplate for you.</p>
