<p>I think you misunderstand what hashing is.  You don't use a hash to "make data fields secure", because a hash can only be calculated in one direction. Compute and store the hash for your data, store the hash only, and you will be unable to retrieve your data later.</p>

<p>You might need to <em>encrypt</em> the data.  That is an entirely different can of worms with it's own set of problems: how do you store and protect the decryption key, what encryption algorithm to use, do you do the encryption at the database level (sql server supports this) or the application level?  How do you enforce encrypted transfer, and protect against copy of the data by the end user?</p>
