<p>The document is encoded in UTF-8. It has a byte order mark, smart quotes, and an ellipsis, all properly encoded in UTF-8. It begins with <em>two</em> byte order marks, which is invalid. You must remove one, and the validator also says that the presence of a BOM in a UTF-8 document may be confusing, so you may remove them both.</p>

<p>Since youâre outputting UTF-8, you must change the HTTP header to:</p>

<pre><code>Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>Since you are missing that header, you force the browser to guess. Additionally, the meta tag must be changed to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>for the same reason.</p>
