<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Actually, NSBundle has an even more convienient method :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>URLsForResourcesWithExtension:subdirectory:inBundleWithURL:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this you can get an array of all your png ressources and then use it to determine which image you want.</p>

<p>To get the ressources starting with image you can then use :</p>

<pre>
    NSArray * array = [NSBundle URLsForResourcesWithExtension:@"png" subdirectory:nil inBundleWithURL:[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleURL]];
    [array indexesOfObjectsPassingTest:^BOOL(id obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
        return [obj isKindOfClass:NSURL.class] && [[((NSURL *) obj) resourceSpecifier] hasPrefix:@"image"];
    }];
</pre>

<p>Of course, this is <strong>NOT</strong> the best way to retrieve it, I'm almost sure you have some simple logic to get the end of the image name, you can probably have a better algorithm (maybe you could just sort the array and use an enumerator). Also you might want to keep the final result (e.g. all ressources starting with image) in a static field to retrieve them faster, instead of redoing all the work each time.</p>

<p>Basically, you have to do the rest of the implementation according to what you really want to have (or give example of your logic to get the final image).</p>

<p><strong>Original response</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand what you want but I think it's something like that :</p>

<pre>
    NSArray * ressources = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath] error:&error];
</pre>

<p>You could also consider </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>contentsOfDirectoryAtURL:includingPropertiesForKeys:options:error:</p>
</blockquote>
