<p>Do it like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load the XAML into VisualStudio (in your case, d:\test.xaml)</li>
<li>Set a breakpoint inside the workflow (simply select an activity and press F9)</li>
<li>Start the application that contains your wfApp.Run() line in the VS debugger (F5)</li>
<li>As soon as your application loads the xaml and runs it, your breakpoint will be hit and you can inspect WF variables, step over the next activities etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>So nothing special at all, without specifying the activity by name, simply click and select.</p>

<p>In the real world, I always have some testcases that run the code, so I simply use the "Test -> Debug -> Test in current context" option from VS2010, not the F5 key. Put the cursor inside your test method, then press Ctrl-R Ctrl-T (this is the default binding for that action).
Alternatively, if you have ReSharper installed, you can click on the Debugger button in the "Unit Test Sessions" window.</p>
