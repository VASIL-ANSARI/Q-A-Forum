<p>Folks,</p>

<p>I found the problem. Actually there is nothing wrong with the javascript.</p>

<p>The problem was that the project had another file.js that had this instruction which screwed up my ajax call.</p>

<p>Then I commented _jquery.init and all works.  After 2 nights without sleeping and testing all the other things I got the error. :)</p>

<pre><code>_jquery.init()

    _jquery = {
        init: function () {
             $(document).ajaxSend(function (e, xhr, options) {
             xhr.setRequestHeader(sync.csrfHeader, sync.csrf);
    });
   }   };
</code></pre>

<p>Java project probably is treating this field, but I don't need it for now.</p>
