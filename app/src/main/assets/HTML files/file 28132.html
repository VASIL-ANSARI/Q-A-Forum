<p>You should understand first how routes work. You have a "root" route called <code>drink</code>. This route has a single child called <code>default</code>. Now is <code>drink</code> a literal route. That means, there are no parameters in this route and it's always a static url <code>/drink-management</code>.</p>

<p>The child-route <code>default</code> is a segment route, which you can give parameters. So if you use the child-route in a view helper, you can assign parameters with an array like <code>array('controller' =&gt; 'foo')</code>. </p>

<p>Now, the important part is you can point to this child route by using <code>/</code> and its parent. So your default can be reached via <code>drink/default</code>.</p>

<p>A TL;DR:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;url('drink/default', array('action' =&gt; 'drink-query'));
</code></pre>

<p>PS. A comment on your naming: I would advise you to rename your routes so they make more sense. In a way, <code>drink</code> is your route and that's fine. The child route <code>default</code> is confusing as it is no default in general, but just a catch-all for your drink controller. It makes more sense to merge it into the <code>drink</code> route. Then you have a single route where you can specify an action (and the controller just remains the same):</p>

<pre><code>'router' =&gt; array(
    'routes' =&gt; array(
        'drink' =&gt; array(
            'type'    =&gt; 'segment',
            'options' =&gt; array(
                'route'    =&gt; '/drink-management[/:action]',
                'defaults' =&gt; array(
                    '__NAMESPACE__' =&gt; 'DrinkManagement\Controller',
                    'controller'    =&gt; 'Drink',
                    'action'        =&gt; 'add',
                ),
            ),
        ),
    ),
),
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a drink route which you can give an action and it just stays on the drink controller:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;url('drink'); // to /drink-management
</code></pre>

<p>Or an action:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;url('drink', array('action' =&gt; 'query')); // to /drink-management/query
</code></pre>
