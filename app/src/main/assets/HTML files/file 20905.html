<p>Your painting code is completely wrong. You almost never call paintComponent directly, and certainly not in this situation. Your Graphics object is likely null because you're getting it by calling <code>getGraphics()</code> on a component, something you shouldn't be doing since this object won't persist. You will want to read the painting tutorials to see how to do this correctly as much needs to be changed. Recommendations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drawing in the paintComponent method</li>
<li>But not calling it directly</li>
<li>Using a Swing Timer for your timer loop rather than a while code.</li>
<li>Using repaint() to suggest to the JVM to repaint the component.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, the tutorials, which you can find with Google, will explain all of this and more.</p>
