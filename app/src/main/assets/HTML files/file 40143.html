<p>I guess the first question may be associated with Runloop:When you call release API , the system sends a  message to Runloop , then Runloop find the function and execute it, instead of executed immediately.</p>

<p>the second question , when autorelease pool drains, retain count of the autorelease object will -1ï¼if the retain count becomes 0ï¼the autorelease object will be destructed and become nil.In object-C ,you  are allowed to send msg to a nil object.</p>

<p>Hope to help you...</p>
