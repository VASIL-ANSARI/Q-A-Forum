<p>What the <code>bind</code> method basically does is something like (not exactly, because arguments are sliced to exclude the context):</p>

<pre><code>function bind(context) {
    var self = this;
    return function() {
        self.apply(context, arguments);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So basically it's returning another function which will call itself with the given context and arguments. If you then <code>bind</code> it again, you'll be binding this newly created function, which will be as if <code>bind</code> was implemented like:</p>

<pre><code> function bind(context) {
    var self = this;
    return function() {
        self.apply(context, arguments);
    }.bind(otherContext);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But because the inner function returned by bind acts as a closure where the original context is the one binded first (<code>self</code>), that one will be the context in with your function will be really executed.</p>
