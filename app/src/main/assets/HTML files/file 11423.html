<p>I used Lucene's port when I had this problem. I don't know whether it is available outside Symfony or Zend but it worked like a charm using the sfLucene plugin. It solved all my text-searching prblems. This site might help you: <a href="http://www.lucenetutorial.com/techniques/lucene-php.html" rel="nofollow">lucene tutorial</a></p>

<p>If you are looking for a MySQL replacement where you can have full text search and relation handling and still be compatible with MySQL go and look around <a href="http://mariadb.org/" rel="nofollow">MariaDB</a>. It has Shpinx integrated. You can read about the features <a href="http://kb.askmonty.org/en/mariadb-versus-mysql-features" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
