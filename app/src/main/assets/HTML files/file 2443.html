<p>There are several important aspects to this issue. The first part is determining each request's locale. You can use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>HttpServletRequest req ...;
String browserLocale = req.getHeader("Accept-Language"); // typically something like 'en'
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you need to decide how to manage the site's localized content. The most Java-like (not necessarily the best) approach is to externalize all messages using a ResourceBundle. You can learn about the core Java facilities for I18N, G13N in their <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/resbundle/index.html" rel="nofollow">Isolating Locale Specific Data tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Using only this approach is quite poor in my opinion. Different languages' content size differently, match better with different layouts, etc. So you can completely eliminate resource bundles (if you don't have a lot of multi-locale data) or augment the approach by using XSLT or other templating that is locale specific.</p>

<p>One very performant but high-development overhead approach is to use a servlet filter to redirect traffic to language- (or locale-) specific subsites. In this case, anyone hitting <code>http://my.domain.fake/xyz</code> would get redirected to <code>http://my.domain.fake/<strong>en</strong>/xyz</code></p>

<p>Finally, it is worth noting that most of the serious web frameworks have their own I18N support. Their approaches differ based on the framework philosophy.</p>
