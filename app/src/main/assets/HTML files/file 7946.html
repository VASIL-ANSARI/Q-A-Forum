<p>A dirty way of doing this would be using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh" rel="nofollow">Meta refresh</a> to redirect to the desired site (but don't beat me :D ).</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<pre><code>if($name_value == $name &amp;&amp; $date==$now)
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to use two if-statements. Bind the two conditions with a logical <code>AND</code>.</p>
