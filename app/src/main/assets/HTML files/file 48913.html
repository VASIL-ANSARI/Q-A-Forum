<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

    String Name;
    int Id;
    String Address;
    Boolean IsPack;

}
</code></pre>

<p>You can't create getters and setters for these, since they are not created in your class, but locally in your main method. What you want is:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass{

String Name;
    int Id;
    String Address;
    Boolean IsPack;

// getter for Name
public String getName(){
  return this.Name;
}
// setter for Name
public void setName(String name){
  this.Name = name;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {

}
}
</code></pre>

<p>For these you'll be able to create getters and setters.
It's (most likely) best to declare them private, though.
Also: following naming conventions could help other people easier read your code. Name (with capital N) is more suited as name of a class, while name (lowercase n) is the name of a variable.</p>
