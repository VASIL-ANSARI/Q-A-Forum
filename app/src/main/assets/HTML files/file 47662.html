<p>You could implement it with WriteableBitmapEx using Blit and n alpha mask for the region you want to crop. Just create the mask dynamically with the result from the Canny edge detection. Make sure all pixels you want to keep have an alpha value of 255 and the ones you want to crop have an alpha value of 0 in the mask bitmap. Then use the Blit method on the original image, supply the generated alpha mask bitmap as parameter and the BlendMode.Alpha as well. This won't really reduce the size of the original image but at least the unwanted pixels are gone. 
Before the alpha masking you could already crop rectangular using the min, max of x and y from your edge detection result. This way the size is also reduced and your alpha masking should be faster as a bonus.</p>
