<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>You should always try to keep the same frame in the real image and the imageview. Same pixel size (width and height)</p>

<p>You can use CGRectIntegral to arrange some minor mismatches. (Fixing the odd placing of the images for instance)</p>

<p>You should use file type .png and keep dpis at 72 at least.</p>

<p>If you want to scale the image for a bigger format you should scale it using the vector of the image or if that is not possible scale it and keep 72 dpis minimum</p>
