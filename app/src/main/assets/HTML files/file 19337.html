<p>You have a mistake which may not be directly connected to the issue. In for loop you always reset name and image for the same key. so at the end of the loop your dictionary must have one name and one image, not all the ones from the array. You should change it</p>

<p>UPDATE:probably something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int count = fetchedObjects.count;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
{
   NSString *image_key = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"player_imgUrl%d",i];
   NSString *name_key =  [NSString stringWithFormat:@"player_name%d",i];

  [_photos setObject:[[fetchedObjects objectAtIndex:i] image]  forKey:image_key];
  [_photos setObject:[[fetchedObjects objectAtIndex:i] name] forKey:name_key];
}
</code></pre>
