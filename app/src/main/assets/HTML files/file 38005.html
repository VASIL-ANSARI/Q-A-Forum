<p>You need to encapsulate the expression in <code>()</code>, </p>

<pre><code>a &amp;&amp; a.foo &amp;&amp; (b.foo = a.foo)
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise it will evaluate the comparison operations first before the assignment operations so it will evaluate as (order of precedence)</p>

<pre><code>(a &amp;&amp; a.foo &amp;&amp; b.foo) = a.foo;
//or basically
true = a.foo //or false/undefined or whatever depending on what a,a.foo equal
</code></pre>

<p>If you take a look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence" rel="nofollow">order of precedence at MDN</a> you will see that the assignment operator is 17th (third from last) in the order, so it gets evaluated nearly after all other operations.</p>
