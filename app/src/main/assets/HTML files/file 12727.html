<p>You get the specific row from the indexPath in the tableView:accessoryButtonTappedForRowWithIndexPath: function.  Specifically, the row that was tapped was indexPath.row.  (If your table has multiple sections, then you can read the section out of indexPath, too, but it sounds like you're just using a simple table.)</p>

<p>You can store the current row in a variable and then read it in prepareForSegue:sender to choose where to go.</p>
