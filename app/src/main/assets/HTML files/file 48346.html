<p>If the outage is predictable enough, can you can connect with windbg+SOS during the outage and:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pause the service twice during the outage</li>
<li>Each time run <code>!threads</code> and <code>~*e!dumpstack</code> to show the thread status and stacks</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have 100 threads doing nothing productive for 15 seconds this <em>should</em> be reflected in the stacks - with luck the bulk of your 100 threads are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stuck in one of your methods (check the 'current frame' for each thread)</li>
<li>Stuck in WCF methods</li>
<li>Executing a <code>*WaitFor*</code> call</li>
<li>Executing a Sleep/Delay/IO Completion call</li>
</ol>
