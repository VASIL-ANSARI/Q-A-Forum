<p>I would guess something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>IF EXISTS
(
    SELECT *
    FROM SYSPROCS
    WHERE SPECIFIC_SCHEMA = ???
      AND SPECIFIC_NAME = ???
      AND ROUTINE_SCHEMA = ???
      AND ROUTINE_NAME = ???
)
    DROP PROCEDURE ???
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if you actually need the SPECIFIC_* information or not and I don't know how to handle cases where you have two procedures with the same name but different call signatures, but hopefully this gets you on the right track.</p>
