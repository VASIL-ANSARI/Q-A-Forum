<p>My understanding is it was taken away because it wasn't used by the templates and thus it wasn't necessary to include to force anyone into specific class design.</p>

<p>If you miss it - you can use <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1192076/My%20Code%20Snippets.zip" rel="nofollow">my code snippets</a> to easily create one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put my snippets in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets</li>
<li>Type vm[tab] or vm[Esc][Tab] if you have ReSharper installed to drop the full bindable base snippet in your app. You could also use a bb snippet for just the <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> implementation. Once you find a version you like - you can also export it to a VS item template (VS File menu).</li>
</ol>
