<p>You can add any view inside a fragment, just like you would do in an activity.
For what I can tell, that button is inside the activity layout.
So:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go To <code>com.example.android.fragments.ArticleFragment</code></li>
<li>Go to its method <code>onCreateView</code> (ctrl+F to look for it)</li>
<li>It should have a return statement, something like
<code>inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_layout, container, false);</code></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, you should understand that this method returns the Fragment's layout.</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to the layout specified in that line (in this case, it would be
R.layout.fragment_layout).</li>
<li>Put in that layout the button, run the app and you should see it.</li>
</ul>
