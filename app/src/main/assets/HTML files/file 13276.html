<p>I'm going to assume, based upon the size of the data you are trying to store, that you are using this data in some kind of client-side processing. You might be displaying it in a tabular format, or using it as part of a search or sorting process. </p>

<p>When designing a data-driven site; processing-heavy operations should remain on the server-side, where it can be optimised, cached and processed faster by your server software or database manager. </p>

<p>The optimum size in this case varies so heavily that I doubt there is any single objective answer. I believe a number of browsers, particularly mobile browsers, have memory restrictions that prevent the entire device being rendered unstable by memory-hogging JavaScript. This memory restriction is probably very high, but it should be treated only as a fail-safe, not as the allowable upper-limit of memory you're allowed to use.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you re-evaluate the purpose of your JavaScript object and see whether the same thing can be accomplished server-side (maybe delivered in pieces, by AJAX, as it is required). This will reduce client-side processing overhead, bandwidth usage, and generally result in a more stable and responsive user-experience.</p>
