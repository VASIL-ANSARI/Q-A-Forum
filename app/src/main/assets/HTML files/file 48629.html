<p>If you put the line <code>"app:tabMode="scrollable"</code>, then the tablayout width will not fill the entire screen. The best solution is this.
Put this line in XML</p>

<pre><code>    app:tabMode="fixed"
</code></pre>

<p>and in Java, do</p>

<pre><code>    if(tabLayout.getTabCount() &gt; MAX_NUMBER) {
       tabLayout.setTabMode(TabLayout.MODE_SCROLLABLE);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>MAX_NUMBER is some number depending on your requirement. I have used 3, you may use 3,4 or whatever suits your requirement.
This will ensure that if there are only a few tabs, they will occupy the entire width, and be scrollable if not.</p>
