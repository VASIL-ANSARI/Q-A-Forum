<p>Ruby doesn't support "pass by reference" at all. Everything is an object and the references to those objects are always passed by value. Actually, in your example you are passing a copy of the reference to the <code>Fixnum</code> Object by value.</p>

<p>The problem with the your code is, that <code>x += 1</code> doesn't modify the passed <code>Fixnum</code> Object but instead creates a completely new and independent object.</p>

<p>I think, Java programmers would call <code>Fixnum</code> objects <strong>immutable</strong>. </p>
