<p>To get the items from OneDrive using the Microsoft Graph, we need to make the request to the endpoint. The âRequestâ method didnât make the real request until we call âGetAsyncâ method.</p>

<p>Here is an example that get the children items of the default drive:</p>

<pre><code>var items = await graphserviceClient.Me.Drive.Root.Children.Request().GetAsync();
</code></pre>

<p>Refer to <a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet/blob/master/docs/overview.md" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more detail about this SDK.</p>
