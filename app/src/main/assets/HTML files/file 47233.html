<blockquote>
  <p>Windows' "compressed folder" feature doesn't recognize any flag or extra field and creates archives using the platforms default encoding - and expects archives to be in that encoding when reading them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Windows' "compressed folders" is your primary consumer, then your best option is to explicitly set the encoding to the target platform. You may want to enable creation of Unicode extra fields so the tools that support them will extract the file names correctly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p>If you know that your Windows users are based in a limited region of the Earth and your filenames are limited to that region (e.g. all Latin), you could heed Apache's advice and define an 8bit code page for filename encoding, which would be respected by OS X's unzip. However, this would mean that it would not work on Windows machines in a different region or accidentally used a slightly different codepage (North American vs. Western Europe).</p>

<p>The sensible alternative would be to use an alternative archive tool on Windows and possibly an alternative archive format. Perhaps you could create self-extracting archives for Windows by prepending a suitable extraction tool to the zip file. For example, you can create a self-extracting 7zip archive in Java using the rough instructions here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/discussion/45798/thread/de8aa3c6" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/discussion/45798/thread/de8aa3c6</a></p>

<p>The pseudo format is:</p>

<pre><code>7z.sfx + config.txt + your-created-archive.7z your-created-archive.exe
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>7z.sfx</code> is a 7zip self-extracting executable "header" distributed with 7zip.</p>

<p>In response to comments in question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Windows uses UTF-16 for filenames and AFAIK uses UTF-16 in it's low level API, which Java calls. However, Windows console is very broken and doesn't quickly support UTF-8.</p>
  
  <p>(Java also uses UTF-16 internally for String objects)</p>
  
  <p>OS X enforces UTF-8 for filename encodings, so Java should also be respecting that when creating filenames.</p>
