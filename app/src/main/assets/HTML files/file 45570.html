<p>You are re-declaring "Board* game_board" in your constructor which shadows the member variable of the same name. It then uses that allocated local game_board in the constructor to print.</p>

<p>In the print_board() function it uses the unallocated member and therefore throws the error.</p>

<p>Change the allocation from</p>

<pre><code>Board * game_board = new Board(p_board_size);
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>game_board = new Board(p_board_size);
</code></pre>

<p>in the constructor to fix this.</p>
