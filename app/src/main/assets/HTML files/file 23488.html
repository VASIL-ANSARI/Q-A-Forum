<p>Try to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right click the project->Configure->Convert to Maven Project</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>---- Edit ----</strong></p>

<p>If this doesnt work, it is likely that someone checked in their environment files into your SVN.  If they checked in:</p>

<ul>
<li>.project</li>
<li>.classpath</li>
<li>.settings/</li>
</ul>

<p>They could be conflicting with your environment (different settings/plugins/versions of eclipse...).  Try dropping your project, deleting the folder/files, then remove these files from SVN, and repeat your initial process.  All of these files/folders will get generated during the import to eclipse.</p>

<p><strong>---- Edit 2 ----</strong></p>

<p>Per your recent edit to the question, you have a multi-module project.  If you only did this on the parent project, then there is no source folder.  So you wouldn't see it.  You should:</p>

<ol>
<li>File->Import...</li>
<li>Choose Existing Maven Projects, Next</li>
<li>Set the Root Directory to ecs/ecs-ejb, Finish</li>
<li>Repeat for all other modules.</li>
</ol>

<p>In eclipse, each module of a multi-module maven project needs its own eclipse project.</p>
