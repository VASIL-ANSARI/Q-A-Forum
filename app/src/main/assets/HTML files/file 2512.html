<p>Doesn't ring a bell, and presumably you've seen, but nothing obvious on Quest's <a href="http://www.quest.com/sql-server/" rel="nofollow">website</a></p>

<p>Perhaps a tool like Red Gate's <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/SQL_Prompt/index.htm" rel="nofollow">SQL Prompt</a> would help - the Pro edition does SQL reformatting.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br/>
Think i've found what you're looking for, mentioned <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/sqlservertools.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> - LECCO SQL Expert. The link to the Lecco website does indeed direct to quest, but a 404.</p>

<p>Looks like it's no longer about - all mentions of I could find indicated it supported up to SQL 2000, and stale links - looks like it wasn't a free tool. As said in my comments, I think this kind of thing is a skill well worth possessing and would benefit in the long run to not relay on a tool to try and do it for you. </p>

<p>I wasn't aware of this tool before now, so I have picked up something from this question - got me intrigued! </p>

<p><strong>Final Update:</strong><br/>
To confirm, that product has indeed gone as Lecco was acquired some years ago now. Thanks to Brent Ozar for confirmation.</p>
