<p>This may be complicated if you don't know exact dimensions of logo and your layout is fluid. </p>

<p>Width: 100% will stretch div to 100% and make next floating div to go to next line.</p>

<p>Why not use a large background image that will be say 1x6000px and make a y-repeat on it: you will cover the centre of it with overlaying image anyway so it matters not if you have anything under there or not.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="subcontent" style='width:100%; background: url("images/bg_pattern.jpg") repeat-y scroll center top #00CC66; border: 0 none; min-height:50px; text-align:center;'&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/bg.jpg" alt="Insert Logo Here" name="Insert_logo" width="400px" height="50px" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Where bgpattern.jpg is a loooong thin image... or if you need it to be some nice background (not just stretched one line of colour) then make it a huge image 3000x6000 or so and use it as a background - it will still work the same - centred under logo and sides will extend until you reach 6000px resolution.</p>
