<p><strong>Temporary tables are dropped when the transaction is over.</strong> </p>

<p>from <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/create-table.html" rel="nofollow">dev.mysql:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Temporary Tables</strong>:
  You can use the TEMPORARY keyword when creating a
  table. A TEMPORARY table is visible only to the current connection,
  and is dropped automatically when the connection is closed. This means
  that two different connections can use the same temporary table name
  without conflicting with each other or with an existing non-TEMPORARY
  table of the same name. (The existing table is hidden until the
  temporary table is dropped.) To create temporary tables, you must have
  the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES privilege.</p>
  
  <p>Note CREATE TABLE does not automatically commit the current active
  transaction if you use the TEMPORARY keyword.</p>

<p>So if you run all these sql in deferent transactions you temporary table wont exist when you run the insert statement. </p>

<p>If these executions are executed in diferent transactions depend on what interface you use. Thats wy if you "run the whole script it returns me the right result" because its all in the same transaction. </p>

<hr>

<p>You can try to force it to run on the same transaction with: </p>

<pre><code>START TRANSACTION;
&lt;SQL QUERYS&gt;
COMMIT;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>anyway i recomend you <strong>MySQL Workbench</strong>  as interface.</p>

<p>my best regards, i hope this help you.</p>
