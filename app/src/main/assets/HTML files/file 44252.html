<p>I have just faced the same  in my company. What we did we used the live server from which the process was being done and update the records on local server in sync. The problem was identified as database transfer in few complexities if stopped then sync or update stops. Now if the process stops on live/remote server it will be affecting the client process. On local server post the remote server we could be able to resolve any issue not affecting the other important one.</p>
