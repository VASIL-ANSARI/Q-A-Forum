<p>I just ran into this issue found out was the problem was. By removing the <strong>fetch = FetchType.Lazy</strong>, I was able to get around the error.</p>

<pre><code>public class EntityA {
@Id
private String id;

@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "entityB_id")
private EntityB entityB;

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "entityC_id")
private EntityC entityC;
}
</code></pre>
