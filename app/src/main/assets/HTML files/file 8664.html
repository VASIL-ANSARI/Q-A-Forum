<p>Define two type specific classes, one for each file.</p>

<pre><code>class FileOne
{ 
    public int LineNumber {get;set};
    public int Id{get;set;}; 
    public double Bal {get;set;};
...
}

class FileTwo
{ 
    public int LineNumber {get;set};
    public string TranType{get;set;};  // type = reserved word
    public int Id{get;set;}; 
    public double Bal {get;set;};
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Load your file into an IList&lt;> for each file so you have IList myFileOne and IList myFileTwo, and capture the line number of each entry so you know where they appear in the file.</p>

<p>Now use linq to query the differences between the two:</p>

<pre><code>var diffs = from f1 in myFileOne
            join f2 in myFileTwo on f1.Id = f2.Id
            where f1.Bal != f2.Bal // add whatever conditions you need here
            select new {
                f1.Id, f2.Bal, f2.Int, f2.Rate, f1.LineNum
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Diffs will become an enumerable collection of the 4 fields in the select.  Now you can iterate through that and using f1.LineNum find the right line number from myFileOne and update it with the values found in f2.</p>

<p>Does that help or were you more interested in how to access the file itself?</p>
