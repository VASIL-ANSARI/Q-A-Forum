<p>If your column id is "id" :</p>

<p>Googling "sql get last rows" (without quotes) leads to this page :</p>

<p>Pick up your db, and customize the request to get the 3 last lines. Then write a request querying a sub-request (this one who gets the 3 last lines) with your where statment...</p>

<p>So, assuming that your primary key is "id" :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM
  (SELECT id, name
   FROM lastest
   ORDER BY id DESC
   LIMIT 3) sub_lastest
WHERE `name` LIKE [name];
</code></pre>
