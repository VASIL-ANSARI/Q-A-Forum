<p>If you write the add on using <a href="https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/" rel="nofollow">Jetpack</a>, it automatically comes with <a href="http://jquery.com" rel="nofollow">jquery</a>. Since you are probably doing it sans Jetpack, I would include jquery with the add on and use the timing effects built in, such as <a href="http://api.jquery.com/animate/" rel="nofollow"><code>animate()</code></a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/toggle/" rel="nofollow"><code>toggle()</code></a>. Firefox uses XUL, so you can use any javascript framework to script things like the sidepane, since they are all part of the DOM.</p>
