<p>As @B.M. said in the comments you need to use <code>np.loadtxt</code>. As shown below:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np      

c = np.loadtxt('mytextfile.txt)
print (c.shape)
</code></pre>

<p>This gets the data from the file and puts it into a numpy array.
If the text file in my example is the same as yours then it will have the shape <code>(9,)</code> as you require.</p>

<p>Another method you can do is the following:</p>

<pre><code>with open('mytextfile.txt') as f:
    content = f.readlines()
</code></pre>
