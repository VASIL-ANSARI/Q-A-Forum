<p>I don't believe it's possible, since <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Date.html"><code>java.util.Date</code></a> is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a>, which is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, and the Gregorian calendar has no year zero.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the traditional proleptic Gregorian calendar (like the Julian calendar) does not have a year 0 and instead uses the ordinal numbers 1, 2, â¦ both for years AD and BC. Thus the traditional time line is 2 BC, 1 BC, AD 1, and AD 2.</p>
