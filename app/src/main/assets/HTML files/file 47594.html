<p>Use <a href="https://mongodb.github.io/morphia/1.0/javadoc/org/mongodb/morphia/query/QueryResults.html#fetch()" rel="nofollow"><code>query.fetch()</code></a> to get the <code>MorphiaIterator</code> and then handle each document as you get it.  It won't pull them all in to memory at once allowing you to process your hundred thousand+ documents.</p>
