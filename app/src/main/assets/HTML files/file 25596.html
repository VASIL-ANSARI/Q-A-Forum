<p>It is meant to be used with <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php">PHP's internal web server</a> which was introduced in PHP 5.4.</p>

<p>According to the PHP manual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>This web server is designed for developmental purposes only, and
  should not be used in production.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't emphasize this enough.</p>

<p>If you would like to use it with the Laravel <code>server.php</code> file you can head to your cli and start the server with the following command (from the root of your Laravel directory):</p>

<pre><code>php -S localhost:8000 server.php
</code></pre>

<p>You should then be able to head to <code>localhost:8000</code> in your web browser and begin using your Laravel application.</p>

<p>Alternatively as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/92753/anand-capur">Anand Capur</a> mentioned you can launch the server with:</p>

<pre><code>php artisan serve
</code></pre>

<p>Ultimately this just runs the aforementioned <code>php -S</code> command for you.</p>

<p>You can optionally specify the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> by doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>php artisan serve --port=8080 --host=local.dev
</code></pre>

<p>As with all <code>artisan</code> commands you can find out this information and additional information by doing:</p>

<pre><code>php artisan serve --help
</code></pre>
