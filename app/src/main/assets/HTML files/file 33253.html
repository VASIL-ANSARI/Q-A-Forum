<p>I think apply a custom annotation at Class level is a good way to do this validation.
You can see the <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#validator-customconstraints" rel="nofollow">Hibernate-Validator</a> to find how to do this.</p>

<p>I hope it may help you,
Best regards.</p>
