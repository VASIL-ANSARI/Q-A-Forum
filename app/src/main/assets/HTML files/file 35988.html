<p>Wow, 22mb and over 3 minutes to load. Do you expect anyone not to think their browser has crashed and leave?</p>

<p>Anyone, to get on topic I would think that the problem you are experiencing in Safari is due to the fact that your image is loaded from the stylesheet. So first the browser finds the stylesheet, downloads that and starts parsing it. While that happens, other parts of the html might have been parsed already and other resources might have been enqueued for download before it gets to your gif.</p>

<p>So try putting your loader in a regular img-tag at the top of your body to make sure that it is loaded as soon as possible, you can even put it off screen and then keep using your css solution to center it if you want but the img-tag should ensure that it's loaded as early as possible.</p>
