<p>You will have to import the view controller's header in your scene, but you need to get a reference to that view controller before you can access any of its properties. From within your SKScene subclass, you can access the view controller's <code>canDisplayBannerAds</code> property like this:</p>

<pre><code>DSViewController *viewController = (DSViewController *)self.scene.view.window.rootViewController;
BOOL iAds = viewController.canDisplayBannerAds;
</code></pre>
