<p>You can make use of canonical URLs to show users your preferred URL when they search for it.
On how to do that, you find more information here - <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en</a></p>

<p>Regarding on passing information to your App, since you are using canonical URLs, you can use either URL type for the deep links.
A deep link annotation will be similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>[android-app://apk_name/http/akcijeikatalozi.rs/katalog/katalog/view/id/8031]
</code></pre>

<p>In the Google documentation you have more information on how to construct and publish your deep links.
