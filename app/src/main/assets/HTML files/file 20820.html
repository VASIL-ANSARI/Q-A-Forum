<p>You can't using normal css.</p>

<p>Maybe you are looking for <a href="http://lesscss.org/" rel="nofollow">less</a>? Specifically the Nested Rules section further down the page.</p>

<p>This allows you to do what you are asking, along with many other useful functions, variables and mixins.</p>

<p>Alternatively there is the option of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" rel="nofollow">SASS</a>. Which is very similar to less.</p>
