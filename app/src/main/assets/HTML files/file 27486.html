<p>Seems that Azure Service Bus <strong>queues</strong> are the right solution for you.</p>

<p>Azure Service Bus can be used in 3 different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Queues</li>
<li>Topics</li>
<li>Relays</li>
</ul>

<p>From windows azure site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Service Bus queues provide one-way asynchronous queuing. A sender sends a message to a Service Bus queue, and a receiver picks up that message at some later time. A queue can have just a single receiver</p>
