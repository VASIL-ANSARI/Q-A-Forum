<p>Its not worth a violent discussion :)</p>

<p>The answer, as usual, is it depends on the requirements your applications have on resources, availability etc. There is no one size fits all answer or best practice. If you can articulate your requirements in your question then we can give specific pros/cons to each of them.</p>

<p>However, to your point about sharing TCP ports, many servers have the concept of domains which create individual contexts for resources like ports, JDBC connection pools etc. You can deploy WARs to different domains and they will get unique ports, context root, and other resources but all still share the same application server instance. </p>
