<p>As your entry comes from two different tables and, as I understand your request, it doesn't have to exist in both of them, you would need a <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> to do it with <code>OR</code>, which is not supported in MySQL.</p>

<p>However, you can use a <code>UNION</code> to get your desired result:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT entry_id FROM exp_category_posts WHERE entry_id = '999' AND cat_id IN(SELECT cat_id FROM exp_categories WHERE group_id = '5') LIMIT 1
UNION DISTINCT
SELECT entry_id FROM exp_matrix_data WHERE field_id = '19' AND col_id_7 &lt;&gt; '' AND entry_id = '999'
</code></pre>
