<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>Dim Test As String
Test = "*" &amp; Combo161.Value

Dim strSQL As String
Dim strWhere As String
strWhere = (Chr(34) &amp; Test &amp; (Chr(34)))

'MsgBox (strWhere)

strSQL = "SELECT * FROM Test_Query WHERE TestID Like " &amp; strWhere

'To test
'Debug.print strSQL
</code></pre>

<p>If this is a subform, then:</p>

<pre><code>Me.[Form_Test (subform)].Form.RecordSource = strSQL
''Not needed when changing record source
''Me.[Form_Test (subform)].Form.Requery
</code></pre>

<p>You did not have an equals sign / Like and the concatenator in VBA is &amp;, not +, using + can lead to problems with nulls, but in this case, I reckon the problen is the missing Like, that is </p>

<pre><code>TestID Like "*something"
</code></pre>

<p>You can control the contents of a subform with a combo and a link field:</p>
