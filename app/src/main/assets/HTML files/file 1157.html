<pre><code>SendKeys is a Python module for Windows that can send one or more keystrokes or keystroke combinations to the active window.

<p>If you need to do some automated work in the background, make another user/session and do it in that.</p>

<p>However if you must do something of this like on windows, I always reach for <a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/" rel="nofollow">autoit</a>.</p>

<p>It's M$ only and perfectly suited to automating tasks on that OS.</p>
