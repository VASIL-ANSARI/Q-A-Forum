<p>Currently the adb interface is one way. Flow is controlled by the host PC using adb. Looking at your requirement, looks like you might need to open up the source code, re-tune the USB driver to allow communication both ways. After that, you will need to design your very own API that allows an application to send messages via USB. This will require a lot of work as the current Android model does not support it.</p>
