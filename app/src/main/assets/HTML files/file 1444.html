<p>Since <code>Pad</code> is a <code>Dictionary</code>, you need an <code>IEqualityComparer&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;WorkItem, Canvas&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So, basically, the typeparams of the comparer you're passing to <code>Distinct</code> are insufficient. :(</p>

<p>So you're right, based on the code provided, it looks like <code>LambdaComparer</code> is not the problem. You just need to define your "comparer" variable differently. </p>
