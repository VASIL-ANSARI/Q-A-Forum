<p>Okay, it looks like it was a problem with the configuration of my system. I post the answer here because it's not obvious why one progress bar animation would work but not another.</p>

<p>In System Properties / Performance Options, I had "Animations in the taskbar and Start Menu" disabled. This option apparently disables the "indeterminate" animation but not the regular one. By re-enabling the option, the indeterminate animation works.</p>
