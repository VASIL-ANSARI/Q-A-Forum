<p>Well, I think you can simply use <code>:order =&gt; 'sum_deal_price ASC'</code> in the <code>sum</code> call of the original answer.</p>

<p>But you can also do it in Ruby, it's just a bit trickier:</p>

<pre><code># You can't sort a Hash directly, so turn it into an Array.
arr = var.to_a  # =&gt; [[2, "534.45"], [7, "10"], [153, "85.0"]]
# Looks like there's a bunch of floats-as-strings in there, fix that.
arr.map! { |pair| [pair.first, pair.second.to_f] }
# Now sort it by the value (which is the second entry of the pair).
arr.sort! { |a, b| a.second &lt;=&gt; b.second }
# Turn it back into an OrderedHash.
sorted_hash = ActiveSupport::OrderedHash[arr]
</code></pre>
