<p>When the form is submitted, the end point (action) will receive each of the inputs by name in the $_POST array. In this case, the PHP script will likely be expecting $_POST['username'] and $_POST['password'].    It will also get the contents of the hidden inputs and they too will appear in the $_POST super global.</p>
