<p>At first, one thing: You do not need a domain. You can simply address your server via it's IP. However, this is not a good idea. Whenever your IP changes, all the devices would have to update the IP, or they cannot connect anymore.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the <strong><em>RESTful</em></strong> API for example, which works with HTTP requests. But there are many possible solutions. Basically, what you need is a Server, and (what beginners always forget) a server process which is running on your server and manages the incoming requests.</p>

<p>There is not much more to say at the moment, as for the most part, it is on you to make the first steps. If you have specific problems with programming your server client or your application, we can definitely help you out!</p>
