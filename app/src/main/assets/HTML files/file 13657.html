<p>FTP supports restarting of transfer from given position (while not all servers supported it before, nowadays it seems that all but ancient servers handle REST command). If the log file is always appended, you know it's initial / previous size and you can restart transfer from that position. </p>

<p>Note that functionality of starting the transfer from specified position can be not supported by the FTP client component that you use.</p>
