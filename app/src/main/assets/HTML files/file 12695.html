<p>Well, if it is that simple, you can use a low level HTTP lib like <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/" rel="nofollow">libcurl</a> and code your request by hand or using an xml lib.</p>

<p>I do not know simplesoap. I've just browsed the site, it seems adequate ^^</p>

<p>I agree with you on gSoap :)</p>

<p>My 2 cents.</p>
