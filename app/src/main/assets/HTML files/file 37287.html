<p>Does the object have an ID ?
Does the object happen to have fields with "modified_date" or "created_date"?</p>

<p>I think the best approach would be to create 2 lists : 1 list contains the objects from the server, and one list contains the objects you have in your local database. Then you just compare the 2 lists, either by ID (which is supposedly unique) and / or by date.</p>

<p>From the 1st list of objects (webservice objects) you remove the ones you already have in the second list, and save only the new ones. Or if you are interested in updating the local ones, then update them.</p>
