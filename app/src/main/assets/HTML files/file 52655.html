<p>I would suggest using a <code>delegate</code>. For example, you can set you bottom <code>textView</code>'s <code>delegate</code> to <code>self</code> (add <code>UITextViewDelegate</code> first of course) and implement the <code>
textViewDidBeginEditing(_:)</code> method. When that's triggered, you will know that the user started editing this particular view.</p>
