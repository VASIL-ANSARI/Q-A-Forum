<p>The mistake is in the connection of the tables.
Joining only on the day is a n to m connection, but you need a unique field to get a 1 to n connection.</p>

<p>For example:
USER_DAYS</p>

<ol>
<li>Data from user A, 2014-12-08</li>
<li>Data from user B, 2014-12-08</li>
<li>Data from user C, 2014-12-08</li>
<li>Data from user A, 2014-12-09</li>
</ol>

<p>If you execute getDate(ID of user B)
You will get the entries 1, 2 and 3. The function will expect only one row, so it takes the first (from user A)</p>

<p>Join by the day id instead of the day</p>

<pre><code>WHERE d.dayDate = ? AND ud.day_id = d.id AND ud.user_id = ?
</code></pre>
