<p>Aviad P. is correct.  This is what I do:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Border Background="Transparent"&gt;
  &lt;Path ... /&gt;
&lt;/Border&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works because when "hit testing" to determine where a mouse click should be routed, the "Transparent" brush is considered as if it was a regular color.</p>
