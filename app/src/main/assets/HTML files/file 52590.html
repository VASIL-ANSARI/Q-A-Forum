<p>A primitive type can't replace a generic type parameter (and even if it could, it couldn't satisfy your <code>extends Comparable&lt;E&gt;</code> type bound, since primitive types don't extend any class and don't implement any interface). </p>

<p>You can replace your <code>int[]</code> with an <code>Integer[]</code> and it will work.</p>

<p>Beside that error, <code>sort(arr)</code> doesn't return anything, so you can't execute <code>toString</code> on it.</p>

<p>You can replace it with :</p>

<pre><code>new HeapSort ().sort(arr); // you must create an instance of the class that contains
                           // the sort method in order to call it
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
</code></pre>
