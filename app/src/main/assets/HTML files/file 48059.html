<p>No, java will not close the stream all by itself.
How badly leaving it open will affect your performance depends on the rest of the code. If the method is often, it will be a serious problem. Regardless of that, it's just way better practice to close your streams.</p>

<p>It's a great reason to upgrade to java 7, where you can write</p>

<pre><code>try (ObjectOutputStream stream = ...) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here java will close the stream for you when you're done with it, no matter how that happens.</p>

<p>Off course you can achieve the same behaviour in java 6 but it's <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-exception-handling/try-with-resources.html" rel="nofollow">more work</a>.</p>
