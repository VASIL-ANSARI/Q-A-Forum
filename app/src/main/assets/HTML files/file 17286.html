<p>Why not overload the function and not pass anything?</p>

<p>Btw, if you're working with MSVC, they have the <code>identity</code> class template, which has an overloaded <code>operator()</code> that returns the input. So in theory, you could pass <code>std::identity&lt;std::string&gt;()</code>, but I'd say, just build your own <code>identity</code> function.</p>
