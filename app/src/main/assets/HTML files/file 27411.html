<p>Your code looks more like C than like Python; it is quite unidiomatic. I suggest you read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow">Python tutorial</a> to find some inspiration. For example, iterating using a <code>while</code> loop is usually the wrong approach. The <code>string</code> module is deprecated for the most part, <code>&lt;&gt;</code> should be <code>!=</code>, you don't need to call <code>str()</code> on an object that's already a string...</p>

<p>Then, there are some errors. For example, <code>sorted()</code> returns a sorted version of the iterable you're passing - you need to assign that to something, or the result will be discarded. But you're calling it on a string, anyway, which won't give you the desired result. You also wrote <code>x[o]</code> where you clearly meant <code>x[0]</code>.</p>

<p>You should be using something like this (assuming Python 2):</p>

<pre><code>with open(r'C:\coordinates.txt') as infile:
    values = []
    for line in infile:
        values.append(map(float, line.split()))
values.sort()
with open(r'C:\coordinates_sorted.txt', 'w') as outfile:
    for value in values:
        outfile.write("{:.1f},{:.1f}\n".format(*value))
</code></pre>
