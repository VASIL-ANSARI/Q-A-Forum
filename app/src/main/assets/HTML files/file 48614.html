<p>I know my answer is maybe a bit late, but anyway:
In general 3d-edge-based tracking is a good choice here. You are using the hybrid version which is good if your AR world wont change (means your car stays on a static position and wont be moved).
The reason for your laggs is that you still have 7000 polygons. That's to much for mobile. Reduce it to 3000 or less (3000 is fine on iPhone6).</p>
