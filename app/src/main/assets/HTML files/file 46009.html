<p>I don't know exactly what the problem is, but there are a few suspects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are updating row and column indices while checking their neighbors. This is like removing an element from an array while iterating through it: it's well defined, but has tricky semantics. I suggest either bailing out (greedy algorithm) or keeping a stack of matches (deeper search, requires saving stack of visited cells too).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>for</code>s are missing opening braces, but the closing braces are there, suggesting missing code.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not familiar with boggle, but isn't it possible for a letter to have two similar neighbors, like <code>AXA</code>? By just doing <code>output.add(return1DIndex(x, y));</code> you may be outputting two ways to get the same letter. You may end up with <code>output</code> longer than <code>findMe</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My suggestion is to follow a more standard format of depth-first search while you iron out the bugs. Wikipedia has a non-recursive pseudocode implementation, for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search#Pseudocode" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search#Pseudocode</a> .</p>
