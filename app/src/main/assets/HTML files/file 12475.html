<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8514260/options-for-programmatically-serving-data-from-a-pc#comment-10541183">brianestey recommends using SMB shares</a>, but those are handled via system-level filesystem exporting code, which are executing with essentially administrator level privileges. I'm sure Microsoft has gone to great lengths in the last five or six years to really improve the security of this layer but it still seems a bit too much privileges to give away.</p>

<p>Instead, running a web server on the host allows you to configure the filesystem and system privileges for whatever account runs the web server, allowing you to confine the web server according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_authority" rel="nofollow">Principle of Least Authority</a>, and constrain the results of possible security flaws in the software.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're just going to run the web server as Administrator, then it is probably a moot point -- you need to ask yourself who you think can do a better job writing secure software, Apache or Microsoft.</p>
