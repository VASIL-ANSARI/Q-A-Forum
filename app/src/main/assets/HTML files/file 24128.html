<p>As people have said, you can't use 0, or 1 for a node in a list backed graph. This will work though:</p>

<pre><code>typedef adjacency_list&lt; listS,listS &gt; Graph;
Graph g;
typedef boost::graph_traits &lt; Graph &gt;::vertex_descriptor Vertex;
Vertex v0 = boost::add_vertex(g);
Vertex v1 = boost::add_vertex(g);
boost::add_edge(v0, v1, g);
</code></pre>

<p>You need to make a vertex to add.
