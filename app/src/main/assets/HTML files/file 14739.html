<p>As Felix pointed out concats need "+"</p>

<p>Also, I have found that if you want to log an entire object, you don't want to include strings inside your console.log().</p>

<p>Try <code>console.log(data)</code> instead of putting strings before it (like "data: ") this will guarantee that the whole object can be seen in the console.</p>
