<p>If you want to assign the position and limit of a buffer to 0, then it's possible to invoke flip by twice.<br />
But you should invoke position and limit method instead of invoking flip twice 
because to use flip, clear or rewind method is to accomplish the typical purposes and you should avoid to use this meshod unless you want to accomplish these purposes.<br /></p>

<p>I cite javadoc:
</p>

<p> Clearing, flipping, and rewinding </p>

<p><p> In addition to methods for accessing the position, limit, and capacity
 values and for marking and resetting, this class also defines the following
 operations upon buffers:</p>

<p><ul></p>

<p><li><p> <code>clear()</code> makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
   channel-read or relative <i>put</i> operations: It sets the limit to the
   capacity and the position to zero.  </p></li></p>

<p><li><p> <code>flip()</code> makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
   channel-write or relative <i>get</i> operations: It sets the limit to the
   current position and then sets the position to zero.  </p></li></p>

<p><li><p> <code>rewind()</code> makes a buffer ready for re-reading the data that
   it already contains: It leaves the limit unchanged and sets the position
   to zero.  </p></li></p>

<p></ul>
</p>
