<p><code>$count</code> is an <code>array</code>, not a scalar. Try <code>echo $count[];</code></p>

<p>There is a set of techniques called <code>debugging</code> when things don't work as expected. The very first step you make is "divide and conquer" by separating complex expressions into simple ones:</p>

<pre><code>$resource = mysql_query("SELECT count = count(post) FROM post");
if ($resource) {
    $count = mysql_fetch_row();
    if ($count &gt; 0) {
       echo $count[0];
    } else {
       echo 'it seems that post table is empty';
    }
} else {
    echo 'I need to figure out what went wrong by looking in PHP documentation for mysql error query functions';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, when debugging, instead of <code>echo</code> use <code>var_dump($resource)</code> or <code>var_dump($count)</code>. That way you will see the real type and value of a variables.</p>

<p>PS. <code>mysql_query</code> is deprecated and might be removed from PHP in any future version</p>
