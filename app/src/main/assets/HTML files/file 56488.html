<p>If you have a HDD disk on which the files are stored, you should know that seek times dominate heavily when trying to perform random access. You may find you're better off reading the entire file sequentially into memory (a relatively quick operation compared to seek) and then performing your processing on the memory data instead. You may find this is quicker even if you need only a relatively small percentage of the overall file data.</p>
