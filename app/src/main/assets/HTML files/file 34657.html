<p>There are a few ways to interpret your question,</p>

<pre><code>// this was missing a size. So we need to add one.
int x = 10;
String []s = new String[x];
String s[] = new String[x]; // This is the same as the previous line.
</code></pre>

<p>The other form type of question is this,</p>

<pre><code>//These are two null arrays.
String s[];
String []s;
</code></pre>

<p>So you can put the brackets before (or after) the array name in Java. That is a convenience the compiler offers, they're equivalent.</p>
