<p>I believe this line causes the issue:</p>

<pre><code>lp.addRule(RelativeLayout.RIGHT_OF, view.getId());
</code></pre>

<p>You basically say that, the view you're currently adding should be to the right of itself. Instead you need to provide the id of the previous item you added to the jar. To do that you can simply store the id of the item recently added. </p>

<p>Sample code to achieve this:</p>

<pre><code>//Create a variable that can be accessed and initialize it as -1
int mostRecentlyAddedView = -1;

//Then in the method you handle drag event
if(mostRecentlyAdddedView == -1){ //This is the very first view, therefore no need to add toRight layout.
   // update the variable
   mostRecentlyAdddedView = view.getId();

  // ... do other things here
} else {
  // ... other things
  RelativeLayout.LayoutParams lp = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(88, 88);
  lp.addRule(RelativeLayout.CENTER_HORIZONTAL);
  lp.addRule(RelativeLayout.RIGHT_OF, mostRecentlyAdddedView);
  // ... other things
}
</code></pre>
