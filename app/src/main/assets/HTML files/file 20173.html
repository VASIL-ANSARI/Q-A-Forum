<p>You're missing quotes and the closing <code>&gt;</code> of the start tag in your script tag, which means it's broken so the script isn't loading.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Your edited question shows the corrected <code>script</code> tag. If it still doesn't work, then your path to the <code>jquery</code> library is probably wrong.</p>

<p>When coding, you should keep your browser's developer console open. It'll show errors that are happening. There's probably a <em>ReferenceError</em> stating that <code>$</code> is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
