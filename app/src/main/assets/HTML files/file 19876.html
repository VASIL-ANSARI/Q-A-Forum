<p>Answer from Heroku's support team:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this is Rails weirdness. The API, up until very recently, also handled the web UI etc, so its normal in that case to presume XHR is not an API request, but a request from an end-user on the API web site.</p>
  
  <p>Hopefully in the not too distant future our API won't be tied to this behavior anymore and will also be announced as a proper product (with proper documentation).</p>

<p>So, the problem is with the API.</p>
