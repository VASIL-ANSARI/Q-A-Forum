<p>All Windows APIs throw structs around like crazy so obviously this is something that is done every day and it works.  Of course it doesn't mean that your concerns are not valid :) 
I would suggest making your structure's fields have explicit width types (int32_t etc) and maybe specify explicitly that that the packing in a way which would break on any compiler but yours, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>#if defined(_MSC_VER)
#pragma pack(0)
#elif defined ... handle gcc
#else
FAIL // fail compilation on unsupported platform
#endif
</code></pre>
