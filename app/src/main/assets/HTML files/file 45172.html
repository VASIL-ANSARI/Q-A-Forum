<p>As a matrix is an array (the rows) of arrays (the columns), it is better to first transpose your data. Then switching rows (the earlier columns) can be done efficiently:</p>

<pre><code>void switchRows(String[][] a, int i, int j) {
    String[] temp = a[i];
    a[i] = a[j];
    a[j] = temp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Transposing means a[i][j] should be filled as old a[j][i].</p>

<p>Also maybe you might consider using <code>char</code> instead of <code>String</code>.</p>
