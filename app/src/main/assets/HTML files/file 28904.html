<p>You can always delete names from the global namespace again:</p>

<pre><code>outer = 7, 40
for elm in outer:
    print elm * 2
    temp = elm * 3

del temp
</code></pre>

<p>but really, use functions to fill specific tasks. It <em>will</em> make your code more maintainable and easier to read.</p>
