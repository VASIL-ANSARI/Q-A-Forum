<p>Thanks RIAstar, you were right, it was imported badly.<br>
Though I had <code>import valueobject.Employee;</code> in my model but apparently you have to create instance variable from value object class also. After that it worked. What I don't understand is why instance variable is necessary.. it doesn't even matter in which method I create it.</p>
