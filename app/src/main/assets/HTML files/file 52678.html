<p>On run block, I don't see any function call to fetch the data. If your API  is promise based, you can hide the splashscreen on success or error function.  But I wouldn't encourage you to call it from the run block either, because it might cause problems that are hard to detect down the line. </p>

<p>I would suggest using <code>ui-router</code> and try the resolve function. This function is loaded before the transition into the view. </p>
