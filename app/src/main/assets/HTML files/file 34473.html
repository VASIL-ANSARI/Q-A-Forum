<p>Looks like the following line was introduced at this commit <a href="https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/bd8122700c2e70e5adbaddcd289fb1a974f981fe/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/NioEndpoint.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/apache/tomcat/blob/bd8122700c2e70e5adbaddcd289fb1a974f981fe/java/org/apache/tomcat/util/net/NioEndpoint.java</a></p>

<p>As far as I can tell this is NioEndpoint is using blocking ServerSocketChannel in order for it to block and wait for an incoming connection and only after it accepts it it processes this incoming socket channel in a non-blocking manner (see setSocketOptions method).</p>

<p>The alternative to make ServerSocketChannel a non-blocking one will result as author points out into a busy read - that is a thread will be constantly polling for incoming connections as accept() in non-blocking mode may return null.</p>

<p>You can find some useful explanation <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-nio/server-socket-channel.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>P.S.
I presume that cryptic APR stands for Apache Portable Runtime.</p>
