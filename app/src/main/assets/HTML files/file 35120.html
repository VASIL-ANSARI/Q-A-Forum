<p>If browser compatibility is not an issue, this can be done with HTML5 like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div contenteditable="true"&gt;
   This text can be edited by the user.
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you could either set the image as the background image for that div, or place the image within that div but set the z-index lower than that of the text.</p>
