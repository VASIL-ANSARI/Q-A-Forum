<p>Your table does not have any index on the "ordinal" column that would possibly get utilized.  Also, since your WHERE clause is on a fixed "1" value which is always true, but no column to compare or even LOOK for an index to help, it can't pick anything... So you are going through a filesort... no index applicable to the where and no index applicable to the order by clause.</p>
