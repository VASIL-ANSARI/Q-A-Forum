<p>When on a page you first get all the pages, then you can get the current page ID, get the children in an array and loop through this array like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    // First get all the pages in your site
    $wp_query = new WP_Query();
    $all_pages = $wp_query-&gt;query(array('post_type' =&gt; 'page'));

    // Then get your current page ID and children (out of all the pages)
    $current_page_id = get_the_id();
    $current_page_children = get_page_children($current_page_id, $all_pages);

    // Loop through the array of children pages
    foreach ($current_page_children as $child_page) {
        // Echo whatever you want from the pages
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: This has nothing to do with the structured menus you make in the backend, it has to do with making a page child of another page directly in the page edit section.</p>
