<p>PHP provides you with <code>class_exists()</code> for just that purpose. Check if the class is loaded with it - it will call the autoloader by default so no need to instantiate it with a try/catch block beforehand.</p>

<p>If you are trying to test for an extension by the way you can also use <code>extension_loaded()</code> or <code>function_exists()</code>.</p>
