<p>I think the issue may be coming from the initial declaration of the <code>journalCarouselItems</code> array.  That error message means that you're sending an objectAtIndex: messages to an object of type NSString (or possibly CFString). You are then expecing your <code>journalCarouselItems</code> to be an array, but it is probably being released (almost certainly autoreleased) too early and that by the time the method above is called the memory that was being pointed at by <code>journalCarouselItems</code> now holds something different.</p>

<p>Try <code>retain</code>ing the array at the very end of its declaration to ensure it stays at the correct memory location.</p>

<pre><code>journalCarouselItems = [[NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO1.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO2.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO3.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO4.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO5.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO6.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO7.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO8.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO9.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO10.png"],
                     [UIImage imageNamed:@"Icon-JCO11.png"],
              nil] retain];
</code></pre>
