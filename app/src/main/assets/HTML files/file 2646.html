<p>You should definitely put your menu code in a different view object. Don't just redraw the existing view in menu mode. That will make your code needlessly complicated.</p>

<p>You don't have to use UINavigationController to swap out one view for another, however. You write code yourself to remove the game view (<code>removeFromSuperview</code>) and add the menu view (<code>addSubview:</code>) to the application's window, using transition animations if you want.</p>

<p>You could also use UIViewController's <code>presentModalViewController:</code> method to push your menu view on top of the game view.</p>

<p>It's hard to say <em>exactly</em> what you need to do without knowing more about your code, but you should <em>absolutely definitely</em> keep different things as different classes, instead of making one class that acts as many things depending on a mode flag.</p>
