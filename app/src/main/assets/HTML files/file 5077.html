<p>You can make a registration form in your app. But you definately cannot show a website with other payment methods inside your app. Apple will reject the app.</p>

<p>It is best to hide other payment methods from apple alltogether. </p>

<p>As for the free downloads part. It's allowed, apple can't stop you from giving free stuff to your customers. A login authorizing at the external website is just fine. But as long as they can't see your using other payment methods :).</p>
