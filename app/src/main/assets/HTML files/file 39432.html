<p>"<em>how to access the value of the selected from the second drop down</em>"</p>

<p>I could identify this as your question so I think you need to find the value of selected option of the dropdown list..</p>

<pre><code> $("#list-select").change(function() {
     console.log($("#list-target option:selected").val());
 });
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you the value of selected option from the second dropdown (so that you can pass it into the URL, which is what you want).</p>
