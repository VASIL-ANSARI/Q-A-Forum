<p>The problem is you don't. WCF 'knows' the connection is lost after that timeout period.</p>

<p>You can try to set the timeouts lower (specifically the <code>OpenTimeout</code> and the <code>SendTimeout</code>), but that might affect other parts of your software.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh924831(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SendTimeout â used to initialize the OperationTimeout, which governs the whole process of sending a message, including receiving a reply message for a request/reply service operation. This timeout also applies when sending reply messages from a callback contract method.</p>
