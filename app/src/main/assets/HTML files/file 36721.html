<p>MVC looks for views (like Index) under the views folder but they also have to be under a folder named after their controller (with a few exceptions like partials).</p>

<p>So this is the structure you want to follow in your project</p>

<pre><code>Controllers (folder)
    HomeController (.cs)
    AccountController (.cs)

Views (folder)
    Home (folder)
        Index (.cshtml)
    Account (folder)
        Index (.cshtml)
</code></pre>
