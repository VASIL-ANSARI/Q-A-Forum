<p>You can modify web.config in following way to show user-friendly messages on any error:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;customErrors mode="on" defaultRedirect="otherError.aspx" redirectMode="ResponseRewrite"&gt;
  &lt;error statusCode="500" redirect="error.aspx"/&gt;
  &lt;error statusCode="404" redirect="404.aspx"/&gt;
&lt;/customErrors&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If you don't want to see compilation errors while updating your website, you can take it offline for the time of the update.
To do that, put a file named app_offline.htm in the root of your website.
The content of that file should state, that website is under maintenance/update. You can adapt content that it will be in the same style as your website.
When you are done with the updates, simply rename that file and website will work as supposed to.</p>
