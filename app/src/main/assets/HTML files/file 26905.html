<p>You have to have the column you reference in <code>add foreign key (</code><strong>role_id</strong><code>)</code> inside your user table. Otherwise you get that error.</p>

<p>You would have to have inside your user table something like:</p>

<pre><code>create table user(
  ...
  role_id varchar(15)
  ...
)
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you don't have it, you have to do:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE user ADD COLUMN role_id VARCHAR(15)
</code></pre>

<p>Before you set it as a foreigh key.</p>
