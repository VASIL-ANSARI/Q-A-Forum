<p>If you send the Spotify App a search intent (ie, <code>spotify:search:whatever</code>, or <code>http://open.spotify.com/search/whatever</code>), you should be able to get the app to play the content.</p>

<p>To search for both artist &amp; track, your URI would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>spotify:search:artist%3Atigerskin%20track%3Astella
</code></pre>

<p>If you know the specific URI for a track, then you can get spotify to play it directly, which would be much easier than using a search intent.</p>
