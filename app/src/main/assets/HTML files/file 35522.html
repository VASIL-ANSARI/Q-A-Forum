<p>Create one or more threads within your extension that run with priority <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadpriority%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ThreadPriority.Lowest</code></a>. Even better than manual throttling, this solution will use the CPU to its full extent unless another task (inside or outside Visual Studio) needs to compute something.</p>
