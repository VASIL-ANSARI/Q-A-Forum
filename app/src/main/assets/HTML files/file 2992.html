<p>IE doesn't recognize the CSS color name <code>grey</code>. Try using a hex color, e.g., <code>#ccc</code>, and it will work. Alternatively, using <code>gray</code> (with an 'a', not an 'e') also works.</p>

<p>Note that this is standards-compliant, because W3C doesn't say anything about supporting alternate spellings of <code>gray</code>, and <code>gray</code> is indeed the color name <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-color/#colorunits" rel="nofollow">according to the spec for CSS3</a>.</p>
