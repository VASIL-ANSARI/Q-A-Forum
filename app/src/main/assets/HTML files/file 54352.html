<p>A <code>Runnable</code> would work,</p>

<p>It matches a void return and no params.</p>

<pre><code>Runnable runnable = () -&gt; System.out.println();
</code></pre>

<p>And obviously it doesn't need to be <code>Runnable</code>, any <code>Functional Interface</code> that matches the signature will do.</p>
