<p>You mention in your comments above you got this working by removing SpringApplication.run(TraderApplication.class, args); but this would be removing spring-boot from your application so I'm going to assume since your question has a tag of [spring-boot] that this is not what you wanted. So here is an alternative way that you can configure beans using your xml.</p>

<pre><code>@ImportResource({"classpath*:public-api-client-spring-context.xml"}) //Proper way to import xml in Spring Boot
@SpringBootApplication
public class TraderApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

    ...code you had before goes here 

    @Autowired
    TraderApplication app;

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        .. your parsing logic here

        app.run(identifier, password, apiKey); //Now uses the autowired instance

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You didn't list your pom.xml or build.gradle but it's important to remember that components you have registered in your context xml may be automatically configured in Spring Boot and you may not need to register them yourself in your xml.(Depending on which items you have starters for in your build file)</p>
