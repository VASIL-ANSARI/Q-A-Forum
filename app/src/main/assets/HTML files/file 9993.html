<p>Just in case anyone's curious (which, judging by this question's stats, they're not), I was not able to determine what was causing the <code>SIGPIPE</code> error, but did eventually sort out my memory management issues (which were due to a faulty implementation of <code>onUdpSocketDidClose</code> in my delegate) so that I am able to reinitialize the socket each time the app restarts.</p>
