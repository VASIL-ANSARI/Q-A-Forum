<p>You had an extra /n in your else statement.. Try this now. Your code is slightly different from the output there so its hard to tell</p>

<pre><code>for(int x=1;x&lt;11;x++){
  if(x==11) 
  {
   longResultsString+="Question " + x + " " + isCorrect[9] + "\nYour  answer was: " + detailedResultsUserChoices[9] +" \nCorrect answer was: " + answerChoices[9][4];

  }
  else{
  longResultsString+="Question " + x + " "+isCorrect[x-1] + "\nYour answer was: " + detailedResultsUserChoices[x-1] +" \nCorrect answer was: " + answerChoices[x-1][4] + "\n";

  }
 }
</code></pre>
