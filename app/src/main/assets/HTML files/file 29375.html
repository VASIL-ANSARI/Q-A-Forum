<p>You probably need to use USB access to the printer for which you'll need something like <a href="http://jusb.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow" title="jUSB">JUSB</a>. I understand that the windows implementation has some limitations that carries from using libusb.</p>

<p>If you are lucky you'll be able to request the status using that. If not you'll have to use the GET_PORT_STATUS request for USB Class printer to get the status like explained in <a href="http://forum.silabs.com/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=38728" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't found a full working example of this yet.</p>
