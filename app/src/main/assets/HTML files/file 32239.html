<p>I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure a table scan will occur no matter what if the column you have in your <code>where</code> clause isn't indexed. Also, you could probably get better performance by reordering your <code>OR</code> clauses so that if <code>@ParA IS NULL</code> is true, it evaluates first and would not require evaluating the value in the column. Something to remember is that the <code>where</code> clause is evaluated for every row that comes back from the <code>from</code> clause. I would not recommend dynamic SQL, and honestly, even under relatively heavy load I'd find it difficult to believe that this form of filter would cause a significant performance hit, since a table scan is required anytime the column isn't indexed.</p>
