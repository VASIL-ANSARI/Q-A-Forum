<p>To repeat a texture, you need it to use UVs bigger than one, which you can do with a TextureRegion that is bigger than the Texture it references.</p>

<pre><code>TextureRegion backgroundTextureRegion = new TextureRegion(texture, bgWidth, bgHeight);

//...

batch.begin();
batch.draw(backgroundTextureRegion, 0, 0, cameraWidth, cameraHeight);
batch.end();
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>bgWidth</code> and <code>bgHeight</code> are how many texels wide and high you want to draw the background. For instance, if your camera's <code>viewportWidth</code> is 1920 and you want your texture to be drawn at 1:1 scale (texture pixels : camera units), then <code>bgWidth</code> would be 1920.</p>

<p>If you need to flip it vertically, you can use <code>-bgHeight</code> instead without messing with the camera.</p>
