<p>There does not seem to be anything wrong when it comes to the csv writing - as long a the form fields are initialized.
</p>

<p>What you want to make sure is you have permissions to write to that file<br>
_ if this is windows, create the file and give everybody permission to write<br>
_ if this is linux:  </p>

<pre><code>touch results.csv;  
chmod 777 results.csv
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, try executing it from the commandline php csvscript.php</p>
