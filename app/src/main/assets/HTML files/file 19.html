<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/unittest-cpp" rel="nofollow">UnitTest++</a>.</p>

<p>In the years since I made this post the source has moved from SourceForge to github.  Also the <a href="https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/wiki/Writing-More-Tests-With-the-Bowling-Game-Kata" rel="nofollow">example tutorial</a> is now more agnostic - doesn't go into any configuration or project set up at all.</p>

<p>I doubt it will still work for Visual Studio 6 as the project files are now created via CMake. If you still need the older version support you can get the last available version under the <a href="https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp/tree/sourceforge" rel="nofollow">SourceForge</a> branch.</p>
