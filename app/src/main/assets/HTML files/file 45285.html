<p>Yes, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the Jsonix context do <code>context.getTypeInfoByTypeNameKey('{urn:ns}TrackAdvanceNotificationStatusType')</code> to look up a type via XML Schema type name. In the next version you'll have a more convenient <code>context.getTypeInfoByTypeName(...)</code> which accepts qualified names or strings.</li>
<li>You'll get an instance of your type info. In case of an enum this will be an instance of <code>Jsonix.Model.EnumLeafInfo</code>.</li>
<li><code>typeInfo.entries</code> is a key/value hashmap of string value/unmarshalled value.</li>
</ul>

<p>But here's a warning: I have not introduced a notion of public/private API yet. So there is certain minimal chance that this API will change in future versions. It is quite unlikely, but it's fair to warn.</p>

<p>It is better to use the type info prepared by Jsonix as it will have string values of enums as well as parsed values. For string-based enums it's irrelevant, but if you have other, non-string simple types you may be interested in "real" values.</p>
