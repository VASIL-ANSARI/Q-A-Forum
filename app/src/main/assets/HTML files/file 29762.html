<p>This is an alert to developers when they make the Parse calls that would <strong>block</strong> the main thread.</p>

<p>To see where this is happening, add a <strong>symbolic breakpoint</strong> on <code>warnBlockingOperationOnMainThread</code> if you use a Parse API released from 2015+.Otherwise, put it on <code>warnParseOperationOnMainThread</code>.</p>

<p>It'll break on that function while you running your code, and will show you a stack trace which should help you to find the blocking function.</p>
