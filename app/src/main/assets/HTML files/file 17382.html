<p>It worked because you're unlucky. It's undefined what should happen. </p>

<pre><code>array[x] 
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>*(array+x)
</code></pre>

<p>so you're basically dereferencing a pointer that's <code>x</code> positions after <code>array</code>. In your case, <code>x</code> is negative, so you're accessing memory before the array. It's not guaranteed to work.</p>

<p>The fact that it compiles is natural, it's valid syntax and it's a well-formed program. The compiler isn't required to generate any diagnostics (but it might).</p>
