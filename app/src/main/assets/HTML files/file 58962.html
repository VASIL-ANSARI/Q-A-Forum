<p>Java lives on dependencies. For instance, bouncycastle is a crypto library. It's used for many things, including securing connections. It's probably a dependency of at least 10 other tools in Eclipse.</p>

<p>Whenever a Java tool in Eclipse declares a dependency, the installer is going to go out to a public repository and fetch that dependency so your program will build properly. That's generally true of installers and build tools beyond Eclipse as well.</p>
