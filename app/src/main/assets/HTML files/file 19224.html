<p>I suck at data structures but I believe your enqueue and dequeue are still behaving like pop and push. 
The front should point to the head of the queue and the tail one past the last valid object. So the tail should eventually point to null.. 
I think it should be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>  public void enqueue(Dog aDog)
     {
         Node dogNode = new Node(aDog);

         counter++;
         if (front == null)
             front = back = dogNode;
         else
         {
             back.nextNode = dogNode;
             back = dogNode;

         }
     }
  public Node dequeue()      
  {
      if(front == null) return null;
      Dog firstDog = front ;
      front = front.nextNode;
      counter--;
      return firstDog;
  }
</code></pre>
