<p>You are assigning a "solution_cluster" object to a "cluster_point" object. But the problem is that if you dont call <code>save()</code> method for your solution_cluster object <code>sc</code> , it will not has an ID, so doing this</p>

<pre><code>cp = Cluster_Point(solution_cluster = sc, point = point)
#lather
cp.save()
</code></pre>

<p>no gonna works. when you referenced <code>sc</code>, it has not an ID.   </p>

  <p>That means there is some problem with parental solution_cluster (it
  was created successfully though).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not, it was not created successfully, because you has not call <code>save()</code> method yet, so your <code>sc</code> object live in "memory" and has not a ID, and without an ID it can't be referenced as "parent".</p>

<p>Then, when you start to iterating through <code>objects_to_save</code> and save your first <code>sc</code> object, THAT object would has an ID, then, when you call <code>save()</code> over your <code>cp</code> object, that referenced <code>sc</code> object is not the same, it's a <strong>"copy"</strong> without an ID(here is the tricky part) and then you will get an error. </p>
