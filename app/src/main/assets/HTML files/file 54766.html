<p>This problem can be solved by using <a href="http://pexpect.sourceforge.net/pexpect.html" rel="nofollow">Pexpect</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pexpect is a Python module for spawning child applications and controlling
  them automatically. Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications
  such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup
  scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers. It
  can be used for automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don
  Libes' Expect, but Pexpect is pure Python. Other Expect-like modules for Python
  require TCL and Expect or require C extensions to be compiled. Pexpect does not
  use C, Expect, or TCL extensions. It should work on any platform that supports
  the standard Python pty module. The Pexpect interface focuses on ease of use so
  that simple tasks are easy.</p>

<p>Usage example taken directly from the Pexpect website</p>

<pre><code>child = pexpect.spawn('scp foo myname@host.example.com:.')
child.expect ('Password:')
child.sendline (mypassword)
</code></pre>

<p>you can spawn the terminal as a child process and then use this child to send commands when GUI generates an event.</p>
