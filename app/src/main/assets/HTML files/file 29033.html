<p><code>strtok</code> does some things that could be perceived of as dangerous.  Namely, when you call it and the first argument isn't <code>NULL</code>, it saves that argument and some other information in static variables (making it completely thread UNsafe).</p>

<p>As long as you keep passing null, it uses the same char array you originally passed it to look for more tokens.</p>

<p>Actually, more likely the implementation is that it saves the place it was in your string in a static variable.  It shouldn't care about where your string began; it only cares about where it is in your string.</p>

<p>Also, remember that <code>strtok</code> is changing the actual string you pass it, so if you needed that string to not have a bunch of '\0's in it, you should have made a copy of it before invoking <code>strtok</code>.</p>
