<p>The Java Persistence wikibook has a section called <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Identity_and_Sequencing#Primary_Keys_through_OneToOne_and_ManyToOne_Relationships" rel="nofollow">Primary Keys through OneToOne and ManyToOne Relationships</a> which seems to indicate that what you want is possible.</p>

<p>If I'm reading it right, for your case, it would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>class Vehicle {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "EXTRAS_ID")
    private long extrasId;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy="vehicle", cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
    private TravelExtra extras;
}

class TravelExtras {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "VEHICLE_ID")
    private long vehicleId;

    @OneToOne
    @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="VEHICLE_ID", referencedColumnName="EXTRAS_ID")
    private Vehicle vehicle;

    public TravelExtras(Vehicle vehicle) {
        this.vehicleId = vehicle.getId();
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that one of your entities will need to make sure it has the same id as the other, which is accomplished in the example by the TravelExtras constructor requiring the Vehicle it is bound to.</p>
