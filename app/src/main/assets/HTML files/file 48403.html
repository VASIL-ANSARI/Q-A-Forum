<p>My Moto G (4.4.4) shows the same problem. Sending UDP-packets works, but receiving UDP-packets does not. I found several websites describing the same problem for several other vendors.</p>

<p><strong>Workaround:</strong>
I solved the problem for my Moto G, by using MulticastSocket (instead of DatagramSocket) with TTL=1 and IP=224.0.0.1.</p>
