<p>If your barcode has always the same structure (<code>[0-9]{3}[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{5}</code>) you can split it into 3 cols (<code>part1</code> <code>part2</code> <code>part3</code> ) and then split user's string and make a query that will operate with that three cols.</p>

<p>It is not optimal solution but I have no other right now.</p>
