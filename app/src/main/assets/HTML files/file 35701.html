<p>I don't think you need the cast <code>(MyDTO)base.CommonMethod&lt;MyDTO&gt;();</code> as your base method is already casting the result.</p>

<p>You will need to make sure that <code>CustomObject</code> can be cast to <code>T</code>, that bit looks fishy to me.</p>

<p><code>CustomerObject</code> must inherit from <code>MyDTO</code>, therefore <code>T</code> must implement <code>MyDTO</code> (<em>I think</em>) </p>
