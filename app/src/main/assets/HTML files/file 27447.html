<p>I saw your other question about getting MySQL2 installed. </p>

<p>My recommendation is that you train using Railstutorial. The link is <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=4.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>It will walk you through the process of getting a working environment running and writing Rails code.</p>
