<p>The Spring transaction manager is active in the scope of a job launched via the application, but it's not active when the same job is trigerred via JMX.</p>

<p>How are you registering the Job to be launchable via JMX, can you post the code ?</p>

<p>The best way would be to use JMX Spring integration facilities, where a Spring bean can be registered via JMX, see the documentation <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.3.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/jmx.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There is <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/exposing-pojo-jmx-mbean-easily" rel="nofollow">here</a> an example of how to publish a Spring bean in JMX. </p>
