<p>I'm confused - having an instance variable for the class loader is exactly what the Thread class uses to implement this. What's different in your solution?</p>

<p>Do you mind about the setter? Setting the class loader is important to be able to reuse the same thread (e.g. in the servlet container) for a completely different environment (web application). Thread instances are considered expensive...</p>
