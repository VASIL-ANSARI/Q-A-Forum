<p>To answer your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.What is exactly the difference between them, especially between Alpha and Beta?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn't much difference between the two aside from the fact that you just start with a small number of testers for alpha testing and switch to a bigger group for beta</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.Only the production stage is available for people on the play store, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that is correct.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.which one/s allow to publish only to specific people/percentage , and in which way do you do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can do that for both. To do alpha,beta testing you need to send invites to people on their google+ accounts so that they can access your app and be able to download it. The invites is usually in the form of a link directing them to your app on the play store which is only visible to them after they accept the invite</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4.which stage allows in-app billing, at least for testing ? I don't get why can't i test it out even before uploading the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can do in-app billing for both alpha,beta testing. Check the link:

<blockquote>
  <p>5.in the percentage method, if I publish a new app version using the same way, will it first update for the people who were lucky enough to install the previous version?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as my experience goes, i have seen people who were testers get the update for the app first than everyone else. But i am not so sure about how does it work exactly.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
