<p>the syntax is like this:</p>

<pre><code>with unwanted as (select num from sometable)
select count(*) from everything where num not in (select * from unwanted)
</code></pre>

<p>obviously this makes only sense if the <code>select num from sometable</code> part is a bit more complex or used several times later...</p>
