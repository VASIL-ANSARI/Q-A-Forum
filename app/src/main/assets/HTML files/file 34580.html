<pre><code>&lt;form action="Delegate_update.php" method="post"&gt;
Name
&lt;input type="text" name= "Name" value= "&lt;?php echo $row['Name']; ?&gt; "size=10&gt;
Username
&lt;input type="text" name= "Username" value= "&lt;?php echo $row['Username']; ?&gt; "size=10&gt;
Password
&lt;input type="text" name= "Password" value= "&lt;?php echo $row['Password']; ?&gt;" size=17&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" name= "submit" value="Update"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You didnt closed your opening Form in the first place, plus your code is very very messy. I wont go into the "use pdo or mysqli statements, instead of mysql" thats for you to find out on yourself. Also you have a php tag open and close below it, not sure what is needed there. Something else is that your code refers to an external page, which you didnt post, so if something isnt working there, might be handy to post it too. </p>

<p>Please also note that you had spaces between your $row array variables in the form. You have to link those up together by removing the space (see edited section from me). PHP isn't forgiving when it comes to those mistakes.</p>

<p>Then your HTML. I took the liberty to correct that too</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt; Delegate edit form&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Delegate update form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;?php
$usernm="root";
$passwd="";
$host="localhost";
$database="swift";

mysql_connect($host,$usernm,$passwd); 
mysql_select_db($database);

$sql = "SELECT * FROM usermaster WHERE User_name='".$Username."'"; // Please look at this too.
$result = mysql_query($sql) or die (mysql_error()); // dont put spaces in between it, else your code wont recognize it the query that needs to be executed
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){     // here too, you put a space between it
    $Name=$row['Name'];
    $Username=$row['User_name'];
    $Password=$row['User_password'];
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, try to be specific. "It doesnt work" doesnt help us much, a specific error type is commonly helpful, plus any indication what the code should do (well, it was kinda obvious here, since its a login/register edit here, but for larger chunks of code it should always be explained)</p>

<p>Anyway, welcome to Stack Overflow</p>
