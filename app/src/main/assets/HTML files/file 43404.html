<p>Assuming your invoices table is called <code>invoices</code>, run the following SQL query:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE SQLITE_SEQUENCE SET seq = 909 WHERE name = 'invoices'
</code></pre>

<p>You can set the initial value in a migration right after creating the table.  In your migration use:</p>

<pre><code>ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("UPDATE SQLITE_SEQUENCE SET seq = 909 WHERE name = 'invoices'")
</code></pre>
