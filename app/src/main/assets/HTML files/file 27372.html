<p>It is done intentionally by jQuery. See <a href="http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11382" rel="nofollow">this bug</a> from jQuery</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This was done intentionally in jQuery.event.dispatch based on #6911 to
  normalize a cross-browser behavior. However it seems inadvisable for
  us to do it, at least for some set of events. We can easily revert the
  change but it will cause other bug reports.</p>
