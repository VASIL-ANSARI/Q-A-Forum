<p>What a weird error! The best i can think of is don't rely on the <code>System32</code> version of the <code>DLL</code>, copy it into your folder and call it from there. From my knowledge, i don't think the DLL should conflict with the different bit computers, but if they do then just obtain a different DLL from a 32 bit computer and have separate downloads for <code>x64</code> and <code>x86</code>. Good luck!</p>

<p>EDIT: Also, i have had some trouble with programming in 3.5 or lower in <code>VS2010</code>. Try to get a version of <strong>visual c# express 2008</strong> and try with that (usually fixes a lot of errors with downgrading <code>.net</code> versions)</p>
