<ul>
<li><code>mylen=len(length)</code> doesn't give you the length you're trying to send. it gives you how many bytes were read in the previsous <code>recv</code>. So you get the wrong lenght there.</li>
<li>on your client side, you use <code>String xyz = in.readLine();</code> which will block until a newline character is encountered. but you never send a <code>'\n'</code> on the server side, instead you go waiting for a response from the client. so you have a deadlock there.</li>
<li>you use <code>data.decode("hex")</code> on your recieved data. unless you do the equivalend of <code>data.encode("hex")</code> in java on the other side, that won't work. it should give you an error if the string is not a valid hex-representation of a binary string.</li>
<li><code>result</code> is an <code>array.array</code>, which you write to file. <code>file1.write</code> expects a string as argument, it gives you an error if you pass your <code>result</code> object.</li>
</ul>

<p>so i can't even see why your code works at all, and why there's anything at all in your file.</p>
