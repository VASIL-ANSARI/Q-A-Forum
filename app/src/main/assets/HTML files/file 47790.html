<p>This is, in fact, a problem related to VSColorOutput and, according to the VSColorOutput's author, it's caused by a bug in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>You can see the whole conversation regarding this issue here: <a href="https://github.com/mike-ward/VSColorOutput/issues/4" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mike-ward/VSColorOutput/issues/4</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, you can try the workaround they propose there:
Go to Tools --> Options --> Environment --> Fonts and Colors</p>

<p>Show settings for:Output Window</p>

<p>Set Item background to Black (not Default or Automatic)</p>

<p>It worked for me after I restarted Visual Studio.</p>
