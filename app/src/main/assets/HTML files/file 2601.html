<p>A class is loaded only when it is first referenced.</p>

<p>Though you need an array of 10000, you may not need all at once. Here is where the concept of paging comes in. This link indicates that <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/c1346ec6e2310c0c/74c55c59ef0d1402?lnk=raot" rel="nofollow">Paging is often done in Android</a>.Initialy have only a small amount of array in memory, and as you need it, keep loading it in to memory and unloading any previous data from memory if not wanted.</p>

<p>For e.g. in any table, at one shot, the user may see at best 50 records, then he will have to scroll(considering his screen is not size of an <code>iMax movie theatre</code>). When he scrolls, load the next chunk of data and unload any data that is now inivsible to the user.</p>
