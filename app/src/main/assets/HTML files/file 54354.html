<p>The <code>JOIN</code> condition you provide in your query does not put any constraint on <code>f5</code>, so it will certainly return too many records, and in many cases duplicate records as well.</p>

<p>Secondly there is also no link between the pair <code>f1</code>, <code>m1</code> on the one hand, and the pair <code>f2</code>, <code>m2</code> on the other. So again, this will lead to a Cartesian product and return far too many records.</p>

<p>There are several ways to write an SQL statement to get mutual friends for two given persons, based on your table structure.</p>

<p>Here is one:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT      fr1.id
FROM        (
            SELECT CASE WHEN one = 'Helene' THEN two ELSE one END id
            FROM   friends
            WHERE  'Helene' in (one, two)
            ) AS fr1
INNER JOIN  (
            SELECT CASE WHEN one = 'Eric' THEN two ELSE one END id
            FROM   friends 
            WHERE  'Eric' in (one, two)
            ) AS fr2
        ON  fr2.id = fr1.id;
</code></pre>

<p>Just make sure to insert the name of the first person twice in the first sub-query, and the name of the second person twice in the second sub-query. I have taken the names "Helene" and "Eric" in the above example.</p>
