<p>It looks to me like you remove the 'current' class right after you add it:</p>

<p>Added here:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).addClass('current').
</code></pre>

<p>Removed here: </p>

<pre><code>.find('a.current').removeClass('current')...
</code></pre>

<p>The .find will find the previous tab which already has class='current' as well as your clicked-tab which you just applied class='current'</p>
