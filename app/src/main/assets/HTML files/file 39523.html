<p>I didn't get what you really want but if your trying to let the user enter number of days and you will get his birthday it's easy,just write
struct tm a = { 0, 0, 0, a, b, c}; /* my birthday */
and if number of days is 8706 
int c=8706/365; // the greatest divisor it should give u 23
and you will get the remaining by 
  int temp=23*365=8395;
 and then you will make
int remaining =8706-8395=311;
 and u continue to find the months and days..
Hope this is your question.</p>
