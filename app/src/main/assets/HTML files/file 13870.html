<p>If you want to test for the value <code>O</code> you could shorten this to:</p>

<pre><code>//...
cbCategory1.Checked = (gvAuto.SelectedRow.Cells[12].Text == "O");
//...
</code></pre>

<p>From your question it's a little unclear if <code>cbCategory1</code> is a child control of your <code>GridView</code> which would require a different solution.</p>

<p>Try to debug and step into your event handler and check if the cell value is read correct.</p>
