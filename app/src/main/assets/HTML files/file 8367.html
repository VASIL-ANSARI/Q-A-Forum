<p>You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188006.aspx" rel="nofollow">parsename</a> if you have a four part string separated by <code>.</code>. Since you have five countries you can get the first with a regular substring and then remove the first country, replace all <code>,</code> with <code>.</code> and use <code>parsename</code> for the rest</p>

<pre><code>declare @T table(Id int,  CountryName varchar(50))
insert into @T values
(1,   'India,Australia,Singapore,Pakistan,Bangaladesh'),
(2,   'Norway,Argentina,Brazil,WestIndies,Burma')

select Id,
  substring(CountryName, 1, charindex(',', CountryName)-1) as Country1,
  parsename(T.N, 4) as Country2,
  parsename(T.N, 3) as Country3,
  parsename(T.N, 2) as Country4,
  parsename(T.N, 1) as Country5
from @T
  cross apply(select replace(stuff(CountryName, 1, charindex(',', CountryName), ''), ',', '.')) as T(N)
</code></pre>

<p>If you know that you have 8 countries you can do this.</p>

<pre><code>declare @T table(Id int,  CountryName varchar(100))
insert into @T values
(1,   'India,Australia,Singapore,Pakistan,Bangaladesh,Denmark,Germany,France'),
(2,   'Norway,Argentina,Brazil,WestIndies,Burma,South Africa,Spain,Portugal')


select Id,
  parsename(T1.N, 4) as Country1,
  parsename(T1.N, 3) as Country2,
  parsename(T1.N, 2) as Country3,
  parsename(T1.N, 1) as Country4,
  parsename(T2.N, 4) as Country5,
  parsename(T2.N, 3) as Country6,
  parsename(T2.N, 2) as Country7,
  parsename(T2.N, 1) as Country8
from @T
  cross apply(select charindex(',', CountryName, charindex(',', CountryName, charindex(',', CountryName, charindex(',', CountryName)+1)+1)+1)) as S(P)
  cross apply(select replace(substring(CountryName, 1, S.P-1), ',', '.')) as T1(N)
  cross apply(select replace(stuff(CountryName, 1, S.P, ''), ',', '.')) as T2(N)
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know how many countries you have you need to build the query dynamically. <a href="http://www.sommarskog.se/dynamic_sql.html" rel="nofollow">The Curse and Blessings of Dynamic SQL</a> </p>
