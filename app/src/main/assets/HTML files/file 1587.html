<p>I suggest you do a larger grid with more vertices, preferably n by n squares. Try not to have too long thin triangles. This will make it easier to see where the light seem to be as the light is calculated for each vertex and not per pixel for the surface.</p>

  <h3>2. Poor Tessellation Hurts Lighting</h3>
  
  <p>OpenGL's lighting calculations are done per-vertex. This means that the shading calculations due to light sources interacting with the surface material of a 3D object are only calculated at the object's vertices. Typically, OpenGL just interpolates or smooth shades between vertex colors. OpenGL's per-vertex lighting works pretty well except when a lighting effect such as a specular highlight or a spotlight is lost or blurred because the effect is not sufficiently sampled by an object's vertices. Such under-sampling of lighting effects occurs when objects are coarsely modeled to use a minimal number of vertices.</p>
  
  <p>:</p>
  
  <p>Novice OpenGL programmers are often tempted to enable OpenGL's spotlight functionality and shine a spotlight on a wall modeled as a single huge polygon. Unfortunately, no sharp spotlight pattern will appear as the novice intended; you probably will not see any spotlight affect at all. The problem is that the spotlight's cutoff means that the extreme corners of the wall where the vertices are specified get no contribution from the spotlight and since those are the only vertices the wall has, there will be no spotlight pattern on the wall.</p>
