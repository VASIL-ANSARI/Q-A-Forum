<p>I don't think there's a built-in control that can do it in .NET.  I'm poking around in the MSDN documentation for the standard Windows Button control, but it doesn't look like it's there.</p>

<p>I did find a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/buttons/SplitButton.aspx" rel="nofollow">Code Project article</a> with a custom implementation; this might help a little.</p>
