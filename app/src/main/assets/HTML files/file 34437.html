<p>Not just subclasses, they're accessible as though they were instance variables within the class itself as well. It's just a quirk of Java syntax, it's mentioned in the JLS, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.3.1.1" rel="nofollow">Â§8.3.1.1</a> and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.11" rel="nofollow">Â§15.11</a> (specifically <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.11.1" rel="nofollow">Â§15.11.1</a>). Basically, the expression prior to the <code>.</code> is evaluated (in your case, it's a very simple expression: <code>this</code>) and, if it refers to an instance, that result is discarded and only the type information is used.</p>
