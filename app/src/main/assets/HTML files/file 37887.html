<p>It looks like you don't have jQuery itself in your javascripts directory, or your jsSources in gulpfile.js.  If you're not including it on your site, before loading the output of the gulpfile, you'll get the errors you're seeing.</p>

<p>Just add jQuery to jsSources (probably first in the list?) and it should work.</p>
