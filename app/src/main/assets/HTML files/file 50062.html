<p>There are two ways I can think of to accomplish your goal:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
   You could place each element of your column in its own div tag. Make the column that contains these smaller divs "position: relative;" and each of the smaller divs inside "position: absolute;"
    <br><br>
   From there, you assign "top: 200px;" or whatever you wanted for each small div. This is starting at top of screen, working downward. Then set "left: 50px;" or whatever distance you want it from the left-hand side of the screen.
    <br><br>
I'm not saying this is the most elegant solution, but it will be an exact solution because you control down to the pixel where every element in your component ends up.
    <br><br>

    <br>
    </li>
    <li>
You're alternative is to create specific height values to these smaller divs (ie "height: 50px;") and then use "margin-top: 10px;" (numbers are for you to decide) to place where those tags will start in reference to the div above it.

    </li>
</ol>

Hope this helps.</p>
