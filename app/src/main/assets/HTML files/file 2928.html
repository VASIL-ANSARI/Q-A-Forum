<p>There's no clean way to background a J2ME app that works generically across all phones.  In most cases phones can only run one app at a time, so even if your app <em>were</em> backgrounded, if another app starts, yours could well get terminated.</p>

<p>Having said that, you can for some Sony Ericsson and non-old Nokias at least hide you app with something like this in your MIDlet subclass:</p>

<pre><code>Display.getDisplay( this ).setCurrent( null );
</code></pre>

<p>On your other question about vibration alarms: yes, you can use the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/javax/microedition/lcdui/Display.html#vibrate%28int%29" rel="nofollow">Display.vibrate()</a> method:</p>

<pre><code>Display.getDisplay( this ).vibrate( duration );
</code></pre>
