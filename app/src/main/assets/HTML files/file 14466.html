<p>The following lines in <code>main</code> are declaring the functions, but do not <em>call</em> thyem</p>

<pre><code>void initialize(struct meletes projects[10]);
struct meletes newp(struct meletes projects[10]);
struct meletes deletep(struct meletes projects[10]);
struct meletes list(struct meletes projects[10]);
</code></pre>

<p>You need to <em>call</em> the functions, like this:</p>

<pre><code>initialize(projects);
newp(projects);
deletep(projects);
list(projects);
</code></pre>

<p>The last three seem to return a <code>meletes</code> structure as well, you need to declare an new variable of type <code>meletes</code> and use it as appropriate:</p>

<pre><code>struct meletes proj = newp(projects);
// use proj as appropriate
</code></pre>

<p>On second look the functions <code>newp</code>, <code>deletep</code> and <code>list</code> <em>do not</em> return anything, which will casue problems if you go with the above suggested assignment.  You either need to return a project (and the assignment will be fine) or change their return type to <code>void</code> (and don't do the assignment).</p>
