<p>Do you send a csrf token with the form you submit? If not: how did you build up your form, with FormBuilder or Html?</p>

<p><strong>FormBuilder</strong></p>

<p>In the formbuilder the CSRF token is already posted so it's not needed to send it.</p>

<p><strong>Html</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method="POST" action="/profile"&gt;
    {{ csrf_field() }} //This is what you need!
    ...
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You did not provide an error log, check in your laravel project for storage/logs and then provide us the error so we can help you.</p>
