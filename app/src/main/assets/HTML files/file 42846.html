<p>From the design and usability perspective you should not allow any pop-up on your web page to exceed the given view-port limit, for example half of the window height.</p>

<p>Try to make the pop-up div with fixed height and with <code>overflow-y: scroll</code>, so if there is more content - the user will be able to scroll down and read it.</p>

<p><em>In general, you should use Pop-ups carefully.</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the bad pop-ups give all pop-ups a bad name. Some users even turn off JavaScript in their browsers or download special software utilities to kill all pop-up windows.</p>

<p>Many do this in desperation because pop-up windows are stalking them wherever they go on the Web - and most people don't realize that they are partly to blame. Often, they've downloaded some free utility or music-sharing program that contains a scum-ware program that tracks your movements online, steals your personal information, and makes your online life miserable by continually harassing you with pop-up advertising!</p>
