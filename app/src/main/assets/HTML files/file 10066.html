<p>A Type0 font references glyphs directly (and not characters) avoiding the usage of a cmap entirely. Also note that text in a type0 font uses two bytes/octets per glyph id like so:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;000100020003&gt; Tj
</code></pre>

<p>Will render glyph 1, 2, and then glyph 3.</p>

<p>In the font PDF dictionary there is usually some ToUnicode reference to a stream that contains a mapping of converting the glyph id back to some Unicode characters. This is a small text document that is fairly simple to parse.</p>

<p>given the glyph IDs in the text emitting commands and the ToUnicode stream you can derive the Unicode string that generates the same data.</p>

<p>If there is no ToUnicode... you're on your own. Perhaps the embedded font contains a cmap (unlikely, this is usually stripped to conserve space) fro  which you can derive the information. but this is probably too far fetched.</p>
