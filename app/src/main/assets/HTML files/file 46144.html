<p>I would suggest not to take blob area approach as a way to distinguish pedestrians from vehicles. An obvious drawback has been already explained by you - more distant cars would be for sure taken as a pedestrians.</p>

<p>There is a necessity to involve more complicated logic between steps 2 and 3 e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>person detector based on HOG - see <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pd" rel="nofollow">http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pd</a>. Already implemented in OpenCV, empirecally to have good accuracy in person detection.</li>
<li>car detector / car  features detector (wheels, plate number etc) based on Haar  classifier - need to prepare your own with the tools opencv provided. Having good classifier for detecting some car feature, you will increase accuracy of overall detection by increasing number of car detected positives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having at least one of those bullets in your final solution would be a must-have for me to have a good accuracy solution. Having them both will even have accuracy better.</p>
