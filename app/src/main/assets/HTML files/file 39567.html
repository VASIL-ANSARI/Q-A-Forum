<p>I am not too familiar with how PDFBox works, but to answer your follow up I know you can accomplish what you want to do in a fairly simple manner with the <a href="http://www.datalogics.com/products/pdf/pdflibrary/" rel="nofollow">Datalogics APDFL SDK</a>. A free trial exists in case you want to look into it. Here is a code snippet so you can see how it would be done:</p>

<pre><code>Document Doc1 = new Document("/Users/test/Desktop/A1.pdf");
Document Doc2 = new Document("/Users/test/Desktop/B1.pdf");

/* Delete pages on the page range 3-3*/
Doc2.deletePages(3, 3)

/* LastPage is where in Doc2 you want to insert the page, Doc1 the document from which the page is coming from, 0 is the page number in Doc1 that will be inserted first, 1 is the number of pages that will be inserted (beginning from the page number specified in the previous parameter), and PageInsertFlags which would let you customize what gets / doesn't get copied */
Doc2.insertPages(Document.LastPage, Doc1, 0, 1, PageInsertFlags.All);

Doc2.save(EnumSet.of(SaveFlags.FULL), "out.pdf")
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, there is another method called replacePages which makes the deletion unnecessary. It all depends on what your end goal is, of course.</p>
