<p>So the issue was the console input, as theSmallNothing said. There wasn't really a way around this limitation without serious hacking, so I proposed to improvise. My solution was to create a web app with python instead of using a console. There were a few advantages to this.</p>

<ul>
<li>the server can handle multiple inputs at a time easily</li>
<li>things can happen while input is being entered(the solution to my problem)</li>
<li>no files need be downloaded for the user as everything can be accessed simply by entering the web address.</li>
</ul>

<p>While not a perfect solution, sometimes finding an alternative is the next best thing. </p>

<p>Thanks all for your awesome help!</p>
