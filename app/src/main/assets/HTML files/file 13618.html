<p>How about:</p>

<pre><code>obj_permissions["type"] = [ permission_type[0] ];
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>obj_permissions["type"] = permission_type;
</code></pre>

<p>See the difference?  You're working with arrays.</p>

<p><em>[EDIT: actually there isn't much difference, but this still clarifies.  See comments.]</em></p>
