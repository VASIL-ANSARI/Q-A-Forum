<p>You probably want to create a <strong>database</strong> which contains a <strong>table</strong> of units and a set of <strong>columns</strong> (or fields) for the respective attributes. This is most abstract example I can provide.</p>

<p>An implementation without a server would instead entail a <strong>flat file database</strong> such as <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLite</a>. Of course, if you want to build your own custom database as your friend suggests, it would be the same.</p>
