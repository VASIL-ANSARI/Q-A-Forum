<p>The problem is that your new project has been created as a <code>Win32 GUI project</code>, when it should have been created as a <code>Console application</code>. The former requires that a function with the signature <code>int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)</code> exists, while the latter requires one of the usual form taken for C or C++ projects, namely <code>int main()</code> or <code>int main(char *argv[], int argc)</code>. </p>

<p>Either create a new project of the console type and copy your code into it, or use the 'sticky-tape' solution, and change <code>int main()</code> to <code>int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)</code> You would also need to navigate to the project's properties and change the Build Target from <code>GUI application</code> to <code>Console application</code> - failing to do so would mean that you would not see any output, since you're using cout, which prints to <code>stdout</code>, which is shown by the console. This window is always available for a console application, but is only available for the Debug version of a GUI application.</p>

<p>I reccomend doing it properly and creating a new project of the appropriate type, namely a <code>Console application</code>. :)</p>
