<p>The value of <code>&lt;a&gt;value&lt;/a&gt;</code> is echoed with <code>echo $link-&gt;nodeValue;</code> remove that code and you resolved the issue.</p>

<p>However, internal links of the website are not really handled here.
Perhaps add something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$url = 'http://example.com';

... # other code.

foreach($links as $link){
    if($link[0] == '/'){ #link is a string, [0] refers to the first character.
        echo $url, $link-&gt;getAttribute('href');
    } else {
        echo $link-&gt;getAttribute('href'), "\n";
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>One other thing, suppressing errors (<code>@</code>)is not the way to go. Find another resolution that works without errors.</p>
