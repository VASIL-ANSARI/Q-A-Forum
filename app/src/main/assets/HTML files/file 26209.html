<p>Everything in rbenv's Readme is assume a local (per-user) installation in <code>~/.rbenv/</code> so i would assume that the official recommendation is to install it on a per-user basis.</p>

<p>Still, it's possible to install it globally. But you'll need <code>sudo</code> for all commands that need to writing rights. Installing new rubies, installing gems* and changing the global ruby  version are the ones coming to my mind here, there might be more.</p>

<p>(*) Needing sudo for installing new gems is the default when you install your ruby through the default system routines like apt on debian, not needing sudo for it is actually a positive side effect of using ruby version managers that work on a per-user basis</p>
