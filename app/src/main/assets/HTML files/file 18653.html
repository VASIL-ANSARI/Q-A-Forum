<p>Here is some obvious errors:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> <code>preg_match_all()</code> expects at least 3 parameters, so it has to be</p>

<pre><code>preg_match_all(
    '#(?:\$|\Â£|\â¬|\&amp;pound;|\&amp;#163;)(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)#', 
    $string, 
    $matches
);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$matches</code> variable will contain the matched strings. Your <code>$price</code> will contain the number of times the pattern matched. Please see <a href="http://php.net/preg_match_all" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/preg_match_all</a> for further information.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> You have an unescaped delimiter:</p>

<pre><code>'#(?:\$|\Â£|\â¬|\&amp;pound;|\&amp;#163;)(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)#'
 ^                       ^                    ^
 Start                   Unescaped            End
</code></pre>

<p>Fixing these two issues will make the <a href="http://codepad.viper-7.com/AbEh7a" rel="nofollow">code run without any parsing errors</a>. It should also answer your literal question about matching entities. </p>

<p>However, I somewhat doubt the Regex achieves what you are trying to do. Prices are not always listed <code>[CurrencySymbol][Amount]</code>. For instance, Euros are usually written as 100â¬ or 100 â¬. So you'd have to check for digits before the symbols and whitespace after as well.</p>
