<p>The problem is that your data is not complete enough.  So, enhance it with what you need:</p>

<pre><code>with d as (
    select RptLOB1, RptLOB2, Correlation from t union all
    select RptLOB2, RptLOB1, Correlation from t union all
    select distinct RptLob1, RptLob1, 1.0 from t
)
select RptLOB1, RptLOB2, Corr
from d
pivot (max(correlation) for val in ('AE', 'Bail', 'Commercial')) as corr
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know the names of all the values, then you will need dynamic SQL for the general case.</p>
