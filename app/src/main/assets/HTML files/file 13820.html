<p>I suggest you start debugging from the server end and start working your way backwards.</p>

<p>First, start logging the response text from your HttpResponse.</p>

<p>Echo the mysql query text in your php file, and make sure it looks the way you're expecting it to.</p>

<p>If it looks correct, check your database structure.</p>

<p>If not, try doing a <code>var_dump($_POST)</code>, and check to see if your parameters are being sent correctly.</p>

<p>If you run through these steps, you should have a better idea of where the problem is.</p>
