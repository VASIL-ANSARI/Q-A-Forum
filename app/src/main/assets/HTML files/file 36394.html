<p>I'm not sure what you mean by Android Browser (default). Is there a Samsung Browser already preinstalled on the phone that isn't Chrome?</p>

<p>My guess, off the top of my head, is that JavaScript is disabled on this other browser. If you were to create your own browser with an Android WebView, JavaScript is disabled by default and must be manually set to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>A quick Google search for 'Samsung Note JavaScript' doesn't return anything readily apparent, but here are a few different Samsung Models with directions on how to enable JavaScript on their browsers. I would imagine the process is similar for the Note 2.</p>
