<p>I would suggest you create a list of links. Each link corresponds to a panel below. The panels are absolutely-positioned one on top of the other. When you click a link, it fades out all non-corresponding panels, and shows its own.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://jsbin.com/ubebo/2/edit" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/ubebo/2/edit</a></p>
