<p>Some more information about the problem would be useful to understand what's going on, but based on what you posted my guess would be that you are setting a <code>delegate</code> for something (the <code>NSXMLParser</code> or the url connection, or maybe something else) and when you go back to <code>view1</code>, <code>view2</code> gets destroyed, destroying the delegate object and leaving whoever it was with a dangling <code>delegate</code> pointer.</p>
