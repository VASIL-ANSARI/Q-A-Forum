<p>One error right away: you are accessing an array element that's out of bounds:</p>

<pre><code>    highest = numbers[ARRAY_SIZE];
</code></pre>

<p>Arrays are indexed starting from 0, so the highest index is <code>ARRAY_SIZE - 1</code>.  You make the same mistake with <code>lowest</code>.</p>

<p>The easiest solution is to do this:</p>

<pre><code>highest = numbers[0];
//...
lowest = numbers[0];
</code></pre>

<p>The second error is that you haven't read all your numbers into the array first.  Since this program wants you to use arrays, more than likely you're supposed to read all the numbers in the array, and once read in, you loop to figure out the highest and lowest.</p>

<pre><code>while (count &lt; ARRAY_SIZE &amp;&amp; fs &gt;&gt; numbers[count]) 
   count++;
// after this, loop for computing the highest and lowest 
</code></pre>

<p>The third mistake is that you closed the file after confirming that it exists.  You should keep the file open.</p>

<pre><code>if (fs.is_open())
{
   cout &lt;&lt; "Successfully opened numbers.txt\n";
   // do not call fs.close()!!
}
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, if the file does not exist, return right away and don't attempt to process the highest and lowest values.</p>
