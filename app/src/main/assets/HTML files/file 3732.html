<p>The simplest way is to use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php" rel="nofollow"><code>preg_replace()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>$output = preg_replace('!&lt;b&gt;.*?&lt;/b&gt;!s', '', $input);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>s</code> on the end is a flag. See <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php" rel="nofollow">Pattern Modifiers</a> for a list of flags.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>s</strong> (PCRE_DOTALL)</p>
  
  <p>If this modifier is set, a dot
  metacharacter in the pattern matches
  all characters, including newlines.
  Without it, newlines are excluded.
  This modifier is equivalent to Perl's
  /s modifier. A negative class such as
  [^a] always matches a newline
  character, independent of the setting
  of this modifier.</p>

<p>Generally speaking however regexes are a poor tool for querying and manipulating HTML or XML. PHP has a number of inbuilt HTML parsers and for a robust solution you should use those instead, as a general rule.</p>
