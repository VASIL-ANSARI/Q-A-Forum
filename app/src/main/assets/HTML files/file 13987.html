<p>Just a observation. There is a better way to detect if a Intent can be called</p>

<pre><code>private boolean isCallable(Intent intent) {
        List&lt;ResolveInfo&gt; list = getPackageManager().queryIntentActivities(intent, 
            PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY);
        return list.size() &gt; 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok just to be clear on KF it never fires first activity then it fires second and then KF takes over and takes you to the YouTube app.</p>

<p>If so all i can think is that your details in first Intent is not correct or for KF its not the same as in other phones/tab</p>
