<p>Detect the user agent first, then according to that navigate the user to different locations. here is the simple javascript code which you can add up in your site, then give the site url in the email. Hope this help. </p>

<pre><code>//Useragent detection from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21741841/detecting-ios-android-operating-system
        function getMobileOperatingSystem() {
          var userAgent = navigator.userAgent || navigator.vendor || window.opera;

              // Windows Phone must come first because its UA also contains "Android"
            if (/windows phone/i.test(userAgent)) {
                //Code here for windows phone.
            }

            if (/android/i.test(userAgent)) {
                window.location = 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=YOUR_APPLICTION_ID';
            }

            // iOS detection from: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9039885/177710
            if (/iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(userAgent) &amp;&amp; !window.MSStream) {
               //Code here for itunes. 
            }

           //Code to navigation for your website.
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Opening apps in Android needs specific URI implementation in android, then you can redirect the users to that URI to open your application.</p>
