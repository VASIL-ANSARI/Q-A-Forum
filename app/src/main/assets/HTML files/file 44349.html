<p>I think instead of checking in C# application run following query with your ado.net. </p>

<pre><code>IF OBJECT_ID (N'mytablename', N'U') IS NOT NULL 
     DROP TABLE 'mytablename'
</code></pre>

<p>Because it will load meta data when you use ado.net instead of that execute simple query with execute non query.</p>
