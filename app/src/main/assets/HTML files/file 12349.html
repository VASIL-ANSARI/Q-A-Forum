All the annotations will do is create a layer.xml file for you (At runtime I think).</p>

<p>You can still create your own layer.xml file and change the order of the toolbars in there. Just make sure that your layer file is being referenced in the manifest.</p>

<p>At Runtime all the layers will be merged together - including the one that you manually create and the one derived from the annotations</p>
