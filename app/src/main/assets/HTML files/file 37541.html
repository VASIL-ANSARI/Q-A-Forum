<p>How about applying the function twice?  The second time you need to re-aggregate the values into a new row.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>select r.*
from t cross apply
     (select data
      from split(t.col, ';')
     ) di cross apply
     (select max(case when did.id = 1 then did.data end) as isactive,
             max(case when did.id = 2 then did.data end) as year,
             max(case when did.id = 3 then did.data end) as anniversary,
             max(case when did.id = 4 then did.data end) as startperiod,
             max(case when did.id = 5 then did.data end) as endperiod
      from split(di.data) did
     ) r;
</code></pre>
