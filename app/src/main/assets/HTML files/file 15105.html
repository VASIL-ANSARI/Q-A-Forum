<p>I'm not sure if I understood the question correctly. I believe u are trying to achieve something like loading new content when the page reaches its bottom? (forgive me for assuming)</p>

<p>I think you are looking for some javascript gesture library, if your event is based on touches. </p>

<p>There are Mootools library on this

<p>Drag.Flick: <a href="http://mootools.net/forge/p/drag_flick" rel="nofollow">http://mootools.net/forge/p/drag_flick</a></p>

<p>There should be equal implementation in other framework as well. (jQuery: <a href="http://jgestures.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jgestures.codeplex.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Possible solution is to look for an event that can return the current position of touches that exceeds document.body.clientHeight (read: not cross platform) .</p>

<p>Hope I manage to point to the right way.</p>
