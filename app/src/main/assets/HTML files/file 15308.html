<p>You'd need to read it as a byte stream and know beforehand at which byte positions the characters start and end, or to use some special separator character/byterange which indicates the start and end of the character group. This way you can get the bytes of the specific character group and finally decode it using the desired character encoding.</p>

<p>This problem is not specific to Java. The requirement is just strange. I wonder how it makes sense to mix character encodings like that. Just use one uniform encoding all the time, for example UTF-8 which supports practically all characters the mankind is aware of.</p>
