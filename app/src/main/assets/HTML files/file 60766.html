<p>This misrendering often appears.
You can try <code>transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0)</code> or <code>transform: translateZ(0)</code> und the element with the animation, but it doesnt works always.<br/>
<code>-webkit-font-smoothing: antialised</code> is another option but that never worked for me.</p>
