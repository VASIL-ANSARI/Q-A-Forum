<p>You cannot animate attributes with CSS animation and in SVG 1.1 (which Firefox implements) y and width are attributes. In SVG 2 they are CSS properties. Chrome (and its clone Opera) is currently the only UA to have implemented this part of SVG 2. </p>

<p>For Firefox support you'll have to use SMIL. There are <a href="https://github.com/ericwilligers/svg-animation" rel="nofollow">polyfills</a> to add SMIL support to Chrome. </p>
