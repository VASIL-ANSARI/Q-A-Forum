<p>You can use java generics in order to replace types that you don't need full type information on. Similar to this</p>

<pre><code>public static &lt; K, V &gt; List&lt; Map&lt; K, V &gt; &gt; test( List&lt; Map&lt; K, V &gt; &gt; list ) {
    return list;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will let you work with both the list and map type fully without knowing what the key and value types are for the map, but you can not operate on the types contained within the map without more type information.</p>
