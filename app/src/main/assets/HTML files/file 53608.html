<p>In other words, you need some kind of privilege escalation from the user account of the webserver to a (specific?) different user. This has security implications, but I assume that you have considered the possibilities.</p>

<p>Anyhow, following steps should work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a program (albeit just a shell script) that runs the according code.</li>
<li>Put the program into a place where the webserver can access it.</li>
<li>Make the target user the owner of the program and set the SUID bit. That way, executing it will cause it to run under the user's account.</li>
<li>Make the webserver group the group of the program and only allow it (not other users) to run the program via the executable bit.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the manpages of <code>chown</code> and <code>chmod</code> for further info.</p>
