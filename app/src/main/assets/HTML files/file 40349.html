<p>This SQL code will give you the rank as column "rank" and works well with partial results, so you always have the right rank even when showing the second page of multiple pages:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) + 1
    FROM jss1_prelim ref
    WHERE ref.score &gt; main.score) as rank,
    id, term, idnumber, subject, score, teacher
FROM jss1_prelim main
ORDER BY score DESC
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to put an index on <code>score</code> for better performance.</p>
