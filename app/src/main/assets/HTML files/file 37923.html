<p>You didn't <a href="http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/pip.html?highlight=proxy#cmdoption--proxy" rel="nofollow">specify the proxy</a> to pip?</p>

<p>EDIT: summary of the comments: proxy was specified, by ENV <code>HTTP_PROXY</code>, but didn't work
at first, and works now.</p>

<p>I looked a bit into urllib, and there is code to handle the windows registry settings by 
default. There is <code>getproxies()</code>, which returns <code>getproxies_environment() or getproxies_registry()</code>, so you <em>should</em> have been OK already without any modifications to
the EMV <em>or</em> the command line.</p>
