<p>I'm not familiar with Java regex but documentation for the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#special" rel="nofollow">Pattern Class</a> would suggest you could use (?!X) for a non-capturing zero-width negative lookahead (it looks for something that is not X at that postision, without capturing it as a backreference). So you could do:</p>

<pre><code>foo.*(?!bar) // not correct
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Apocalisp's right, you want negative lookbehind. (you're checking that what the .* matches doesn't end with bar)</p>
