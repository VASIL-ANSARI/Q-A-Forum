<li>You suggest to use a function of an object for a builtin function on all objects. Why should this function be specific to this object?</li>
<li>Semantics: the <code>getattr</code> function works on objects, not as part of an object.</li>
<li>Namespace: The functions of an object are defined by you, not by the language. Internal functions are of the form <code>__getattr__</code> and you will find this function on your object ;-). And getattr uses it internally, so you can even override it (if you know, what you're doing).</li>
</ul>
