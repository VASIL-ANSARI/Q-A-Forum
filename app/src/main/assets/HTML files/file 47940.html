<p>Applying a boost there doesn't really accomplish anything.  Boosts are used to enhance the impact of a subquery within the overall query.  So it would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>QueryBuilders.boolQuery
    .should(mltQuery.boost(50))
    .should(someOtherQueryBuilder);
</code></pre>

<p>There, your mlt query would be boosted to 50 times it's normal score <em>relative to the other subquery</em>.</p>

<p>The particular reason that changing the boost may even result in lower scores is because of the queryNorm scoring factor.  The overall score is multiplied by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 / ( q.getBoost()<sup>2</sup> Â· â ( idf(t)  Â·  t.getBoost() )<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is designed to make the overall score of results sets be very roughly comparable.  For more, check out <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_2_1/core/org/apache/lucene/search/similarities/TFIDFSimilarity.html" rel="nofollow">Lucene's documentation of the scoring algorithm</a>, and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/practical-scoring-function.html#query-norm" rel="nofollow">Elasticsearch provides an explanation as well.</a></p>

<p>The thing to bear in mind is that scores are really only useful within the context of that particular query.  Attempting to save scores and/or compare them against the results of other queries is not a good idea (even with queryNorm around).  I get the impression you are trying to normalize scores.  Please see this question:</p>
