<p>Steven, I believe that this is a real bug in Rails. I submitted a bug report on this at one point, but it never gained traction. I think the problem is non-trivial, and I don't yet have time to dig into the Rails code and figure out the right fix.</p>

<p>My workaround was simply to be sure that somewhere along the line I "dirtied" the parent record. I believe that simply being sure that you set a value on the parent record will do the trick, even if that value is not different than the one in the db.</p>

<p>When I was working on this issue, I created a jQuery dynamic parent/child/grandchild form method. You can find it here if it might be of some use to you: <a href="http://amillionbetterthings.com/2010/06/24/rails-nested-forms-with-ajax-add-and-remove/" rel="nofollow">http://amillionbetterthings.com/2010/06/24/rails-nested-forms-with-ajax-add-and-remove/</a>.</p>
