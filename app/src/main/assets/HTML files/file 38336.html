<p>This is extremely timely, I am actually working on the same problem today and ran into the exact same issue. I'm returning true in shouldVisit for PDF urls, however I wasn't seeing them show up in the visit(Page page) like you. I traced the source to the CrawlConfig:</p>

<pre><code>config.setIncludeBinaryContentInCrawling(true)
</code></pre>

<p>Setting that to true will cause the PDFs to show up in the visit method. Though it looks like reading the binary data will have to be done on the implementor's side with either Apache PDFBox or Apache Tika (or some other PDF lib). Hope this helps.</p>
