<p>It depends on your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> setting and the structure of your projects and apps.</p>

<p>We have many, many projects.  Each with several apps.  All are on our <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, so the project name is essential.</p>

<p>If you have only one project, and the top-level project directory is on your <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, then each app can be resolved separately and you can't use the project name.</p>
