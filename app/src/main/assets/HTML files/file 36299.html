<p>A backup uses the normal transacation mechanism to access the database, so it is not possible for the backup to be in an inconsistent state.
(When in journal rollback mode, the backup transaction would be blocked while somebody else is writing; when in WAL mode, the backup has the state before the write transaction began.)</p>
