<p>Man your code looks good. As i see it maybe the DomainManager have something wrong but cant tell if you dont post it or there is some problems with the EntityFramework( was common for me ).</p>

<p>You better provide us with the Error exception from the Stack. </p>

<p>Last check your database schema it must be exactly the same as your models including the EntityData properties or if you go Code-First set up your Initializer right. Use a ClearSchemaIfModelChanges Initializer. Maybe there are some changes since your Seed.</p>
