<p>Since this data is not yet an <code>Action</code> object, perhaps it would make sense to remove the word <code>Action</code> from its name. You could call it <code>RecordedUserData</code> or <code>RecordedUserBehavior</code>. Your <code>CreateAction()</code> function may turn it into an <code>Action</code> object, but that doesn't mean that it has to be named <code>Action</code>. In fact, (as you have noticed) that can be confusing.</p>
