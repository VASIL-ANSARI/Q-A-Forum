<p>Regular variables should not be tracked in threads. This is done to prevent race condition. You must use thread-safe constructs to communicate between threads. For a simple flag use <code>threading.Event</code>. Also you cannot access local variable <code>flag</code> via thread object. It is local, and is only visible from scope. You must either use a global variable, as in my example below or create an Object before calling your thread and use a member variable.</p>

<pre><code>from threading import Event
flag = Event()

def Read(x,y):
    global flag
    flag.clear()
    ...
    if flag.is_set():
        return
</code></pre>

<p>main thread:</p>

<pre><code>sleep(5)
flag.set()
</code></pre>

<p>P.S.: I just noticed that you attempted to use lock() in the thread, but failed to use it in the main thread. For a simple flag go with Event. For a lock() you need to lock both parts and mitigate a risk of a deadlock.  </p>
