<p>Assuming that your progress on just two lists so far works, you can try this.</p>

<pre><code>def merge(a, b):
    return [a[item_indx] if item != '*' else b[item_indx] for item_indx, item in enumerate(a)]

reduce(merge, crazy_list)
</code></pre>

<p>What <code>reduce</code> does in this case is take the resulting list of the last merge and then does it with the next element. So for a crazy list of [a, b, c, d], a and b will merge, and the resulting list will merge with c, and that result will merge with d. And so forth. In general, <code>reduce</code> applies the function supplied as an argument in a comparable fashion.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Okay, I see what you were saying now. So I defined another method to handle lists of lists. I realize you've already accepted an answer, but I'll just leave this as an alternative.</p>

<pre><code># a and b are lists of lists.
def merge_lists(a, b):
    for i, v in enumerate(a):
        a[i] = merge(a[i], b[i])
    return a

reduce(merge_lists, (c, d))
</code></pre>
