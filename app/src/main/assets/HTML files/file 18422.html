<p>Your algorithm, which looks like a straight-forward implementation of the definition formula, is in <code>O(n!)</code>.</p>

<p>A standard algorithm in <code>O(n^3)</code> consists in first transforming it into a triangular matrix using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination" rel="nofollow">Gauss elimination</a>. Once you have done this, the determinant is the product of the diagonal elements.</p>
