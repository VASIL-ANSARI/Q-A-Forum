<p>You have 2 options. In your MainActivity, you could pass your adapter a copy of your data with only the isConsumido == false entries. Alternatively, you could add some logic to your adapter to skip over the items where isConsumido == true. You would have to update the getCount() and getView() methods to take into account the items to skip over.</p>

<p>It's the usual trade off of memory (more memory in the first solution) versus complexity (the 2nd solution is more complex, but more memory efficient as it uses a single list).</p>
