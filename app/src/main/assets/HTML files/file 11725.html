<p>Hi this is how it is done in excel VBA. I am not sure whether this can be manipulated with vb.net</p>

<pre><code>Sub Macro1()
Application.DisplayAlerts = False 'supress all alerts in excel
ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename:= "C:\f.csv"
Application.DisplayAlerts = True 'enables alerts
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>This code usually overwrites the file without any prompt. An issue occurs if the file is in use.</p>
