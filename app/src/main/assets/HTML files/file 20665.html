<p>It's hard to tell without breaking the performance estimate into their components, but the Morris Traversal essentially traverses part of the tree twice when tracing back the nodes with the fake right part.  You're also doing more work inside the Morris loop, so the constant factor is going to be larger.  It's curious that it's almost 2x, but I wouldn't rely on that being the actual cost without further details.</p>
