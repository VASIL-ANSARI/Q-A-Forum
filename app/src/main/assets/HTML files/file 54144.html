<p>The outer query using the <code>IN()</code> expression serves no purpose is entirely unnecessary. This will produce the output you need:</p>

<pre><code>select e.*
from Project p 
inner join Employee e on p.emp_id = e.id 
where p.project = 'project1' and e.dept = 'dept1'
order by joining_date
</code></pre>
