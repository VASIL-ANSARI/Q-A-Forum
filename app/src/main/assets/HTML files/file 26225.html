<p>I would recommend starting the process directly using the Process Start function - I think if I'm reading your post properly, you're actually directly calling the 'Main' function of your program, which means you're not actually creating a new process at all (just calling a function in the Windows Explorer process which is what the shell extension is loaded into). This means that the program you're running is running in the process of the Windows Shell, which is not too friendly, as if it crashes, it can crash explorer.</p>

<p>Kick off the program using Process start. If you need to configure how it will connect, consider passing command line arguments to your program (such as a service address) and building the WCF client binding manually (in fact, you may find that once you've got used to creating WCF clients programmatically, they config file method is more long-winded and less intuitive!)</p>

<p>As a last option, for serious Windows software architectural over-the-top-ity, you could create a Windows Service that hosts a 'coordinator' service of some kind. The shell context menu can invoke the coordinator service (saying 'do something') and the service can kick of the process, or the process can start on start-up and poll the service if it needs to do something.</p>
