<p>You could port the TMX writer of Kobold Kit: <a href="https://github.com/KoboldKit/KoboldKit/tree/master/KoboldKit/KoboldKitFree/Framework/TilemapModel/TMX" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/KoboldKit/KoboldKit/tree/master/KoboldKit/KoboldKitFree/Framework/TilemapModel/TMX</a></p>

<p>It actually originates from the KoboldTouch project for cocos2d-iphone, dependencies on the engine is minimal for the entire tilemap model. However there's no renderer for this model available for cocos2d (except in KoboldTouch), and cocos2d's own renderer does not retain all of the tmx information in memory, and certainly not in a way that makes it easy to write back.</p>
