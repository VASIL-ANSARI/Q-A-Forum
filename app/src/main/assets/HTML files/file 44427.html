<p>Your code is correct provided that HttpResponseMessage is a class and not a struct. Lambdas will capture reference types by reference and value types by value. Once captured by reference, it will write to the exact same variable you are returning.</p>

<p>One caveat to be aware of is if you are doing this inside of a for loop and you capture the loop variable by reference, then if the lambda executes after the loop is finished (which is usually the case) it will read the final value from the loop variable.</p>

<p>A lambda together with its captured variables is called a closure if you'd like to look it up for more information;</p>
