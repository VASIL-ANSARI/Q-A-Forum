<p>1.First of all, check if your source is where it is mentioned in the error log. </p>

<p>2.If it is, check if you've made any typing mistakes</p>

<p>3.If it still isn't working, it would be easier (In my opinion) to create a new project and rename what is missing (I've done this several times already and it has always worked) Of course, make sure you copy all of your code</p>

<p>your error does not belong to the manifest, cuz this would be mentioned in the log like this: <code>have youe declared &lt;yourClass&gt; in AdroidManifest.xml?</code></p>
