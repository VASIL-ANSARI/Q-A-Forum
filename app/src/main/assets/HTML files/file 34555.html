<p>In Python you can override many different operators, some of which are for emulating numeric types. You can find out more <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of multiplication, all you need to do is override <code>__mul__(self, other)</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>def __mul__(self, other):
    return self.value * other
</code></pre>

<p>You can also override other numeric operations like <code>__add__(self, other)</code> (for addition), <code>__sub__(self, other)</code> etc.</p>

<p>On a somewhat unrelated note, you might also want to think about what you want the behaviour be if one wanted to multiply to diameters together or add a weight to a diameter.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Based on your comment, you are probably better off overriding the the object's float representation as also mentioned by John, though it's not as clean as overriding the mathematical operators:</p>

<pre><code>def __float__(self):
    return self.value
</code></pre>
