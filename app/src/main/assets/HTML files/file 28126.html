<p>You might want to listen for <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> events on <code>window</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(window).on('focus', function() {
    //(...)
});
</code></pre>

<p><code>blur</code> event is fired when you go to another tab or to another window than browser window. <code>focus</code> event does the opposite.<br>
I could add an jsfiddle here but it uses <code>iframes</code> so it couldn't be properly tested.</p>
