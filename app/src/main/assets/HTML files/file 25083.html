<p>you will have to use Proxy while opening a connection...
the use of proxy provides always a new IP address for the server so you can be sure that the server maintains different session for each request...</p>

<p>your code will be something like following...</p>

<pre><code>CookieHandler.setDefault(new CookieManager(null, CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ALL));
URL url = new URL("http://google.com");
HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(new Proxy("some_proxy"));
</code></pre>
