<p>I suspect you are selecting from the wrong table, the logic seems correct but the fact that you are selecting from a table call <code>departments</code> is a little suspicious.</p>

<p>Do you have an employee tables? Does it contains a <code>manager_id</code> column? If so:</p>

<pre><code>select count(*),manager_id
from employees
group by manager_id;
</code></pre>

<p>If employee tables has only <code>department_id</code> column then :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT d.manager_id,count(*)
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
 ON(e.department_id = d.id)
</code></pre>
