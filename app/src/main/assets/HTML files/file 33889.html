<p>You can't do <code>[[Note alloc] init]</code> because <code>Note</code> is an NSManagedObject subclass. </p>

<p>The designated initializer is <code>awakeFromInsert:</code> which is called after you insert the Note object in a managedObjectContext.</p>

<p>That gets called if you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>self.note = [Note [NSEntityDescription
    insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Note"
    inManagedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext];
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdCreateMOs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001654-CJBDBHCB" rel="nofollow">"Creating and Deleting Managed Objects" in the Core Data Programming guide</a>.</p>

<p>To be clear, you should not be subclassing NSManagedObject manually.  You would create an entity called Note in the xcdatamodeld file, declare that it's represented by the class Note, create a new file of the type "Core Data" which would allow Xcode to properly create the class with an <code>awakeFromInsert:</code> function prototype in it.   And if you start editing the Note class a lot, you want to look into the MOGenerator tool.  xcdatamodeld might be sufficient without having XCode create the class files for you to edit.</p>
