<p>I would suggest you go down the path of a jquery plugin. Doing a search for "jquery select box" returns a number of useful results, eg:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.designdim.com/2011/07/10-important-jquery-selectboxdropdown-plugins/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designdim.com/2011/07/10-important-jquery-selectboxdropdown-plugins/</a></p>

<p>I have tried out a number of these before, and some are more flexible than others.</p>

<p>One that I really like that is not in that list is <a href="http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/" rel="nofollow">Chosen</a>, although it doesn't fully support IE7 and 8.</p>
