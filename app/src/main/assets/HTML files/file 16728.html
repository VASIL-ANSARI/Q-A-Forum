<p>I think that for OAuth you have to use "oauth2:URL_OF_THE_SERIVE" instead of "ah".</p>

<p>A possible URL of the service (to get user information such as the e-mail address) is: <a href="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email" rel="nofollow">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email</a></p>
