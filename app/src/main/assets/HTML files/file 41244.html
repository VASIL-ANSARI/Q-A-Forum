<p>If you <strong>don't have a popup</strong> (nothing shows when you click the button), then there is an event that will fire when the button is clicked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction#event-onClicked" rel="nofollow"><code>chrome.browserAction.onClicked</code></a></p>
  
  <p>Fired when a browser action icon is clicked. This event will not fire if the browser action has a popup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To use:</p>

<pre><code>// In your background script
chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener( function() {
  // Do stuff
});
</code></pre>

<p>If, however, you <strong>do have a popup</strong>, then, as the docs mention, this event will not fire. Then your code is more appropriate: you just need to send a message from the popup and catch it in the background script whenever it is opened. See a full example in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/23317011/934239">this answer</a>.</p>
