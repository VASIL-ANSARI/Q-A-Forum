<p>What Kennebec alluded to in the comments is correct.  There are events (<code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code>) which simply do not bubble, but they will still capture.  This allows one to still use event delegation with those events.  Event delegation using bubbling/capturing is often times cleaner and more efficient.</p>

<p>Here is a good article from Quirks explaining event capturing and why it makes sense when using events like <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code>:

In my projects, I haven't run into a situation where event capturing was required.  However in many places where I've used event bubbling I could have used event capturing instead.</p>
