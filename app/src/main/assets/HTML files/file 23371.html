<p>My guess is that it's because functions and objects in PHP are still not treated quite equally (even though recent versions of PHP have tried to fix this). I suspect there's a language limitation that doesn't allow for the <code>obj</code> in <code>$this-&gt;obj()</code> to be treated as an object (since that syntax would normally refer to a method), and so it instead inspects only the methods exposed by the class.</p>

<p>I've not tested it, but this might work:</p>

<pre><code>$obj = $this-&gt;obj;
return $obj('c');
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, ideally, <code>$this-&gt;obj</code> should be accessible as an object whether it's a field of the class or a method defined by the class. This way, it wouldn't matter that there's an ambiguity in the syntax since there's no need for a distinction in the first place, but PHP doesn't work like this!</p>
