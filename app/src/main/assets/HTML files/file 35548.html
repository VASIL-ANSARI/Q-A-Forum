  <p>code that I knew wasn't working before started working again.
  Nothing can explain that, usually it's because you ran the code without re-compiling, or changed the file, or another simple explanation. It's frustrating but the compiler always produces the same result when given the same input ;)</p>

<p>The code looks good (storing an int in a float* is a bit unusual but should work). Did you touch the Node class ? Compiler sometimes adds padding to align data on 32 bits boundaries, that could be an issue. Is Node a class or a struct ? I mean if it has any virtual method that will blow up when you call one, though it looks like you don't have any virtual method.</p>

<p>Other think you could check is if byteOffsetToNodeLocation is smaller than totalNumOfBytes. If it is not, you are pointing outside of the savedData buffer and then the behavior of a read from  *node.position might be randomly crashing.</p>

<p>Another possible issue could be a previous instance having a lock on the file, preventing your code from reading it. (I don't know what is the sharing policy of ifstream). You should check that totalNumOfBytes is at least as large as sizeof(Node).</p>
