<p>This is explained in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2930.html">N2930</a>, which proposed the change to add the overloads in question.
Emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Summary of proposed changes</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Specify range-based for statements without the use of concepts, using argument-dependent lookup of begin and end (which always includes those <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> functions in namespace <code>std</code>) to provide the iterator to the beginning and ending of the sequence.</li>
  <li>Specify range-based for statements <strong>so that arrays and initializer lists have no dependencies on <code>&lt;iterator&gt;</code>.</strong></li>
  <li>Refactor <code>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</code> so that it as no dependencies on other headers and includes no other headers.</li>
  <li>Specify the library headers that are to <code>#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like they didn't explain <em>why</em> they wanted <code>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</code> to have no dependency on <code>&lt;iterator&gt;</code>, but I think a reasonable guess is that the former is supposed to be available in a freestanding implementation whereas the latter might not be (Table 16, รยง17.6.1.3)</p>
