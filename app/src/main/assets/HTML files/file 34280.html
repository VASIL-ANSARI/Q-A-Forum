<p>If you are looking to have a single column (or if that is acceptable), you could add 'clear:left' to your div css.</p>

<p>You could also mix it up by having some classes 'float:right' while others 'clear:left'.</p>

<p>You will have to play with it to get exactly what you are looking for, but I warn you: if you cannot change the HTML at all (including class assignments), then it may be difficult to accomplish consistent behavior.</p>
