<p>The <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#prefixing-the-named-route-helpers" rel="nofollow">docs</a> explain this with the following example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can prefix routes with a named parameter also:</p>

<pre><code>scope ':username' do
  resources :posts
end
</code></pre>
  
  <p>This will provide you with URLs such as /bob/posts/1 and will allow you to reference the username part of the path as <code>params[:username]</code> in controllers, helpers and views.</p>
