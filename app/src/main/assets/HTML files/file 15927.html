<p>Microsoft have made available a set of WPF controls that make it very easy to add things like presence into existing applications. I blogged about it last week here: <a href="http://thoughtstuff.co.uk/2012/05/microsoft-lyncs-development-secret-its-easy/" rel="nofollow">http://thoughtstuff.co.uk/2012/05/microsoft-lyncs-development-secret-its-easy/</a></p>

<p>However, this is only for Silverlight and WPF. If you're developing in classic WinForms, it's possible to host WPF controls within a WinForms app: MSDN has information on doing this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742215.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and there's a good walk-through <a href="http://www.programmerfish.com/how-to-add-wpf-controls-in-simple-windows-forms/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
