<p>This is a known limitation reported <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=95842#c4" rel="nofollow">here</a> with anonymous classes. Also discussed on this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12496842/cannot-see-final-variable-content-inside-anonymous-class-when-debugging-in-eclip">SO</a> thread. </p>

<p>From the comments on the eclipse issue it seems like the local final variables are visible in the debugger as members of anonymous class object this. (I don't see it in my local workspace though):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those fields are usually named <code>val$&lt;original_var_name&gt;</code>, if the class
  was compiled with the jdt compiler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The comments also hint that it is JVMDI API (jvm debugger interface) limitation and not a problem in eclipse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I assume that someone somewhere has asked for that feature,  and I
  assume that they were told that it was not possible using JVMDI API...
  ?</p>
