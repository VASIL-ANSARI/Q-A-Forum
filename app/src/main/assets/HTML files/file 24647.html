<p>Use C++11 user-defined literals:</p>

<pre><code>constexpr unsigned long long operator"" _M(unsigned long long lit) {
    return lit * 1024 * 1024;
}

//use: 128_M
</code></pre>

<p>The underscore is there because all user-defined literals defined by you need to begin with one. The ones that do not are reserved and will start to be used by the standard come C++14.</p>
