<p>An excellent book I have, which covers this topic, is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0131401572" rel="nofollow">Data Access Patterns</a>, by Clifton Nock.  It has got many good explanations and good ideas on how to decouple your business layer from the persistence layer.  You really should give it a try.  It's one of my favorite books.</p>
