<p>As i can see from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-faq-090281.html#01_02" rel="nofollow">Oracle FAQ</a>, the jdbc driver you are using is not compatible with the Database Version and JDK8. </p>

<p>I think this must be your problem. Maybe if you used ojdbc7.jar might help (not sure about this cause I haven't tested it yet - MOST PROBABLY THIS WOULD FAIL)</p>
