<p>It's setSeed(). It does not do what you think it does: it just adds the entropy of the given seed to the underlying algorithm. You'll probably find out that it returns somehthing different on both platforms. SHA1PRNG <em>is</em> a pseudo random function, but if it is already seeded, it's likely to return different results.</p>
