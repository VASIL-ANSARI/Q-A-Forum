<p>It sounds like what you want may be a longest substring match. That is, in your example, two files like</p>

<p>trash..thash..song_name_mp3.mp3
and
garbage..spotch..song_name_mp3.mp3</p>

<p>would end up looking the same.</p>

<p>You'd need some heuristics there, of course. One thing you might try is putting the string through a soundex converter. Soundex is the "codec" used to see if things "sound" the same (as you might tell a telephone operator). It's more or less a rough phonetic and mispronunciation semi-proof transliteration. It is definitely poorer than edit distance, but much, much cheaper. (The official use is for names, and only uses three characters. There's no reason to stop there, though, just use the mapping for every character in the string. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex">wikipedia</a> for details)</p>

<p>So my suggestion would be to soundex your strings, chop each one into a few length tranches (say 5, 10, 20) and then just look at clusters. Within clusters you can use something more expensive like edit distance or max substring.</p>
