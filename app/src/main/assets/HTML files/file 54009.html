<p>Unfortunately you cannot search "inside" a string with P/CouchDB _ids - you can only do prefix searching. And of course, prefix searching does not fix your integer problem, because in terms of strings, <code>1 &lt; 10 &lt; 2</code>.</p>

<p>One option is to use <a href="https://github.com/pouchdb/collate" rel="nofollow">pouchdb-collate</a> directly. So for instance, your ID could be generated from an object like <code>[2, 'someText']</code>. This allows you to easily search for integers above and below a certain value, although the downside is that it makes it difficult to search for <code>'someText'</code>.</p>

<p>Another option is to just bite the bullet and use map/reduce or pouchdb-find. If your query needs are complex enough, you might have to.</p>
