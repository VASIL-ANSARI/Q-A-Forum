<p>Your question is too broad. </p>

<p>There are many different approaches to maintain the visibility and enabled/disabled status of your controls in your GUI. As long as you are using .Net I would recommend looking at <a href="http://www.switchonthecode.com/tutorials/wpf-tutorial-command-bindings-and-custom-commands" rel="nofollow">Commands in WPF</a>: here you can bind the enabled property of your controls to <code>CanExecute</code> property of command and just maintain the availability of your commands -- your controls will automatically reflect the changes.</p>
