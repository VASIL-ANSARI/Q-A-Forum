<p>Many apologies here guys.  As usual with these types of things, its developer (me) error.  I'm posting what happened in case someone else gets here.</p>

<p>This is for a static library implemented in a third party application.  (Flash, in this case) for which I do not have the source code.  Some deep debugging revealed what should've been obvious I guess-  the third party application using my library was making some questionable calculations in its own shouldAutoRotate function, and returning NO for -any- toInterfaceOrientation argument in certain conditions (not right.)</p>
