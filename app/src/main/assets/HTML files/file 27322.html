<p>it's about your "<code>button7.setOnClickListener()</code>". you can check your button7 definition, like this; </p>

<pre><code>button_name = (Button) findviewbyId(R.id.button7);
</code></pre>

<p>and you should add clicklistener after the definition.
By the way, if you want to define &amp; use any view in your activity, first you should load required xml file. Using "<code>setContentView();</code>"</p>

<p>that is just an assumption, because i need to view your codes. </p>

<p>and maybe <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6388070/1763249">this</a> can help you.</p>
