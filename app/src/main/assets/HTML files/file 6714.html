<p><code>pr_nm_del</code>? You might as well let a cat name it. I believe abbreviations should be avoided at all cost, except well-known/obvious ones (like <code>del</code>, as mentioned in the comments - that one's even a language keyword!) that save a whole lot of typing.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean overly verbose identifiers. Just as context is important to understand statements in natural languages, identifiers can often be kept much shorter (and just as understandable) by referring to context. In your example, <code>project_name</code> is perfectly fine - the procedure is already called <code>delete_project</code>, so <code>project_name</code> obviously refers to the name of the project to be deleted. Even <code>name</code> alone might be fine. No need to state that again by appending <code>_to_be_deleted</code>.</p>
