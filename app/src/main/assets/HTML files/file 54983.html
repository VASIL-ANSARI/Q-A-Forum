<p>If you understand the three different terms, it's pretty obvious:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Program counter: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15739489/program-counter-and-instruction-register">The program counter (PC) holds the address of the next instruction to be executed</a></p></li>
<li><p>Thread: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5201852/what-is-a-thread-really">This</a> explains a thread much better than I could. In short, a thread has a program counter.</p></li>
<li><p>Breakpoint: A breakpoint is a point in a program where execution will pause if the PC reaches it. So if the program counter hits line 30 and you have a break point on line 30, it will pause execution.</p></li>
</ol>
