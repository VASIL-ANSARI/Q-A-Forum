<p>There the <code>import</code> statement is for. The other class only has to be in the classpath. The classpath is basically a collection of file system paths pointing to the package root and/or individial JAR file(s). Using the <code>import</code> statement is indeed not necessary when the class is in the same package as the current class (the same directory, as you say), or when you're referencing them by the full qualified name like</p>

<pre><code>com.example.OtherClass otherClass = new com.example.OtherClass();
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the classes of the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow"><code>java.lang</code></a> package is always implicitly imported, you don't need to explicitly import them nor explicitly specify their path in the classpath.</p>
