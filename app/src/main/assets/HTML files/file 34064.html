<p>There are a bunch of articles (and StackOverflow posts) on how to send email using C#, just do an internet search on "send email c#" <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9201239/send-e-mail-via-smtp-using-c-sharp">this post</a> can get you started.</p>

<p>The only thing you really need to make sure of, is that you have an smtp server (outgoing mail server) that you have permission to send through. Usually, that means the ourgoing mail server of your company of internet service provider, but that would need checking as it tends to differ for everyone.</p>

<p>Also: be aware that most (if not all) "regular" smtp servers will have a cap on the amount of emails per minute or hour you can send, so don't <em>overdo</em> it.</p>
