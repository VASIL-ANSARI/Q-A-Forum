<p>Link procided esentially shows you how to build a Ridge Regression on top of polynomial features. Consequently this is not a "tight fit", as you can control it through regularization (alpha parameter) - prior over the parameters. Now, what do you mean by "best model" - there are infinitely many possible criterions for being a best regression, each tested through different criterion. You need to answer yourself - what is the measure that you are interested in. Should it be some kind of "golden ratio" between smoothness and close fitness? Or maybe you want a model of at most some smoothness, which minimizes some error measure (mean squared distance to the points?)? Yet another would be to test how well it captures the underlying process - through some kind of typical validation (like cross validation etc.) where you repeat building the model on the subset of the data and check error on the holdout part. There are many possible (and completely valid!) approaches - everything depends on the exact question you want to answer. "What is the best model" is not a good question, unfortunately. </p>
