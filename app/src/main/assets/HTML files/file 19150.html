<p>It depends on what you are trying to achieve.</p>

<p>If what you need is to set up a very simple communication between threads, you can use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html" rel="nofollow">BlockingQueue</a> from java.util.concurrent to distribute your message objects.</p>

<p>If the reason why you don't want to use message queue software is just that you don't want anything heavy, then you may consider using <a href="http://www.zeromq.org/" rel="nofollow">ZeroMQ</a> - a lightweight messaging library. It is easy to set up and provides simple API known from sockets. I don't know if it is popular in the Java world, but it is used in C++ and Python worlds.</p>
