<p>The easiest and the best way is to send this array from php to javascript in json format... ie,</p>

<p>You can code it as </p>

<pre><code>echo json_encode($YOUR_PHP_ARRAY);
</code></pre>

<p>and when you receive at javascript side.. it always treats json well so you can easily use it directly as it is on client side..</p>

<p>As you shared your json_encode with me... here is the javascript code to read your array.. I used document.write to print it over your page..
and I saved your json which javascript will receive from your php in <code>var x</code></p>

<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>    	var x = [{"weight":"950.500","date":"27"},{"weight":"800.100","date":"31"},{"weight":"25ââ0.250","date":"03"}];
    	// console.log(x);
    
    	for(var i = 0;i&lt;x.length;i++){
    		console.log(x[i]);
    		document.write("Weight : "+x[i].weight);
    		document.write("Date : "+x[i].date);
    		document.write("&lt;br/&gt;");
    	}
    </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Here is how it looks when you run the code snippet..

<p>And using smarty you can code like</p>

<pre><code>var graph = {$graph|json_encode};
</code></pre>

<p>And get the graph variable which is a javascript variable to be traversed as shown in my snippet.
And for viewing the array structure, you can </p>

<pre><code>console.log(graph);
</code></pre>

<p>and see it in your browser console.</p>
