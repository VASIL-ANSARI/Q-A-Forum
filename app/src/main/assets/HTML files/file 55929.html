<p>The aggregate function SUM don't handle NULL in the same way as ordinary functions and operators. Instead of returning NULL as soon as a NULL operand is encountered, it only take non-NULL fields into consideration while computing the outcome.</p>

<p>So, you can resolve it this way..</p>

<pre><code>select id, sum(column_a) as column_a, 
sum(column_b) as column_b 
from tbl1
group by id;
</code></pre>
