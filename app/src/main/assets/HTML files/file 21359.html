<p>You can use the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009696699/functions/fseek.html" rel="nofollow"><code>fseek</code></a> function to jump the file cursor to an arbitrary offset in the file, provided that you know the number of bytes that you need to skip.</p>

<p>If you don't know in advance how many characters you need to skip over, your best option would be to continuously read lines from the file and skip over those that don't match your criteria.  In your case, you could skip all lines that just have one space character in them, and could resume reading once you find a line that has two spaces in it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
