  <p>Is there any way I can set array1 to array2, so that any changes made to array1 will be reflected into array2 automatically?</p>

<p>Automatically, not. Once you've initialized <code>array1</code> and <code>array2</code> with something, you can't re-initialize them again, since they're both <code>final</code>.</p>

<p>However, you could manually <em>copy</em> <code>array2</code>'s content to <code>array1</code>.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    array1[i] = array2[i];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will work, because the <code>final</code> modified doesn't guarantee immutability - it just makes sure that once the reference to a variable is set, it cannot change anymore.</p>
