<p>With the code above you are not doing the fetching in the backgroud as <code>dispatch_get_main_queue()</code>gives you the queue the interface is running on. To perform a background fetch you have to open another queue with <code>dispatch_queue_create("image_queue", NULL)</code>.</p>

<p>When the backgroud fetch is finished and you want to do something with the UI you have to do this in the main queue. </p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(),^{
  if(block) {
    block(user,nil)
  }
});
</code></pre>
