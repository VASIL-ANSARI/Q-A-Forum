<p>For this purpose, I think that an embedded web browser would be absolutely great. Alot of applications use a web browser control for navigation, information, training, etc. <a href="http://steampowered.com" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> is one example. In addition, reusability is almost always a best practice.</p>

<p>But I would use <a href="http://webkitdotnet.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">WebKit</a> instead of the built-in IE web browser control.</p>
