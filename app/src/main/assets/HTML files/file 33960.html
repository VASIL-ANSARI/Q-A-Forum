<p>Your problem is not related much to HTTP server. You seem to have general problem to control Oracle daemon from Python code.</p>

<p>Try first writing a simple python script, which does what you need.</p>

<p>My guess is, that your attempts are having problems with reading output from daemon control script. </p>

<p>See also  <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate" rel="nofollow">Popen.communicate()</a> for reading output from the command. Other option could be to call subrocess.call()</p>

<p>There are many tutorials for calling system command from Python, e.g. <a href="http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/os/subprocess-for-system-administrators" rel="nofollow">this one</a></p>

<p>Apart of purely Python related problems you may run into problems with permission - if your user, running the script/HTTP server is not allowed to call oracle control script, you have another problem (which might have a solution, on Linux adding that user into sudoers).</p>

<p>After you resolve problems with calling the script, it shall be easy to make it working inside of your HTTP server.</p>
