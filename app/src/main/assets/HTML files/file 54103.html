<p>First, I hope you do run CMake <strong>outside</strong> your sources, in a separate directory. Not doing that is really not recommended</p>

<p>To understand the error message you have to know a little bit on how CMake works. </p>

<p>Basically, when you run</p>

<pre><code>cd /path/to/opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
</code></pre>

<p>CMake generates a cache in the build dir (It's a simple file named <code>CMakeCache.txt</code>). This file contains some information like:</p>

<ul>
<li>The path to the sources /path/to/opencv</li>
<li>The path to the build dir /path/to/opencv/build</li>
<li>The CMake Generator used (Ninja, Unix Makefiles ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you ever re-run CMake and change one of these values, (by re-running cmake with different arguments, setting an other generotor or moving files), CMake will complain with this kind of message.</p>

<p>A good solution is then to delete the CMakeCache, or even the whole build dir to be safe.</p>
