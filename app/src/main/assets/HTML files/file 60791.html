<p>Well, one way to make it clear is to use discrete distribution with a peak, and Poisson might be a good choice</p>

<p>Sample Poisson up to 9, if it is above 9 reject and resample. Otherwise shift it by 1 and return.</p>

<p>Some pseudo-code based on <a href="http://numerics.mathdotnet.com/api/MathNet.Numerics.Distributions/Poisson.htm" rel="nofollow">MathDotNet</a></p>

<pre><code>using MathNet.Numerics.Distributions;

int Sample(Random rng, double lambda) {
    for( ;; ) {
        int r = Poisson.Sample(rng, lambda);
        if (r &lt; 10)
            return r+1;
    }
    return -1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Checking Mode of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution" rel="nofollow">Poisson distribution</a>, it is clear that for peak at 4 you'll have to have <code>lambda</code> between 3 and 4. For <code>lambda=3</code>, you'll get two equal peaks in your sampling at 3 and 4, for <code>lambda=4</code> you'll get two peaks at 4 and 5 (remember shift by 1). Just play with it and try to set it to something in between which fits your requirements</p>
