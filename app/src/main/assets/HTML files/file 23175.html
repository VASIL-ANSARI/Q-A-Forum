<p>Im sorry... But please look at the code first.
You are beginning with a <code>&lt;/tr&gt;</code> That means you want to close a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code></p>

<p>And at the end you dont close the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code></p>

<p>Second point, why a table inside of a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> ?</p>

<p>I think if you fix those minor faults.. it will be fine.
