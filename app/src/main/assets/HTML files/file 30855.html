<p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/EmbeddedPython" rel="nofollow">Python runs on various embedded platforms</a>. E.g. <a href="http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">OpenEmbedded</a> project is an umbrella project for cross-compiling and distributing Linux for various embedded platforms, including ARM. They provide "full" and minimal Python ports (not sure how much ROM and other resources your board has).</p>

<p>What I would look is that</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What embedded Linux distributions your board uses</p></li>
<li><p>How I can get distribution X on it</p></li>
<li><p>Then just install Python using the distribution package manager </p></li>
</ul>
