<p>Displaying a window from a service is not a good idea as you would have to find out the "correct" session (Windows allows several users to be logged on) and also requires the service to have access to the user's desktop.</p>

Then you can attach to these trace messages, e.g. by using SysIntenal's <strong><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx" rel="nofollow">DebugView</a></strong>.</p>
