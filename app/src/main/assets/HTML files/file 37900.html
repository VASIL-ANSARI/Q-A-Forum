<p>Google hosted libraries are basically a content delivery network (CDN). You can read up more about CDNs here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network</a></p>

<p>Content hosted on CDNs is replicated across data-centers around the world so that it can be accessed quickly wherever your end-user is located.</p>

<p>The content located on your web-domain might be accessible to you or a specific sub-set of your end-users fairly quickly but as the geographic distance between your webhost and the end-user grows, the page load times might become more noticeable.</p>

<p>CDNs also provide some additional benefits like: preventing DDOS attacks, isolating your host from security holes found in third-party libraries which otherwise may have rendered your host vulnerable if not patched in time, etc.</p>
