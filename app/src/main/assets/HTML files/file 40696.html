<p>The only way to do lookups for all columns is by mentioning all the columns in the SQL query.
This could be done with one left join for each column, or with correlated subqueries:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT (SELECT colB FROM Table2 WHERE colA = Table1.colA) AS colA,
       (SELECT colB FROM Table2 WHERE colA = Table1.colB) AS colB,
       (SELECT colB FROM Table2 WHERE colA = Table1.colC) AS colC,
       ...
FROM Table1
</code></pre>

<p>You cannot use <code>SELECT *</code>. If you do not know the columns of <code>Table1</code>, you can read them from the database, and construct the query dynamically.</p>
