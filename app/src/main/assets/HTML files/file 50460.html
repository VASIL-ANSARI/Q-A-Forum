<p>This might be possible, but first things first: A timestamp isn't unique, and you don't ever want sessionIDs to be guessable. That's why default SessionIDs are 120-bit numbers that are generated by a cryptographic random number generator (details <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479041.aspx#aspnetsessionstate_topic7" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Anything deterministic like a timestamp should be avoided unless you and your users are ok with the contents of a session being available to the entire world.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm not aware of a way to swap out the session ID for a single page. Your browser associates a session cookie with a host, not an individual page, so it'll send your session cookie to every page on your site. If you're not using sessions anywhere else on your site then you could get away with the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Disable session state for every page except the one in question by using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ydy4x04a(v=vs.100).aspx" rel="nofollow">Page directive's</a> <code>EnableSessionState</code> attribute. When the user clicks the finish button, call Session.Abandon in the handler.</li>
<li>Use your own session ID generator by implementing and registering your own <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.sessionstate.isessionidmanager(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">ISessionIDManager</a> implementation. But please, please don't use a timestamp for your IDs.</li>
</ol>
