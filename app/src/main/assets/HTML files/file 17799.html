<p>This link will take you through a full tutorial of exactly what you want to do: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130214003927/http://tech.pro/tutorial/921/combining-images-with-csharp" rel="nofollow">Web Archive - Combining Images with C#</a></p>

<p>In the tutorial, the author first creates a List of image objects and then iterates through the list adding each image to a new merged image.  It's a bit of overkill for what you're trying to do but it is a full code solution.</p>
