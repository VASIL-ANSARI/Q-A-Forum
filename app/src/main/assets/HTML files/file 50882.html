<p>At the top of the model, you can:</p>

<pre><code>has_secure_password validations: true, unless: :new_guest?


def self.new_guest
 new { |u| u.guest = true }
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can also look into STI and Polymorphic Associations for creating two types of users (i.e. models/member.rb and models/guest.rb for STI).</p>
