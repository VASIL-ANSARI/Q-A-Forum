<p>You're initializing <code>stdData</code> to be an array of students but you don't create a new Student in each entry and then you try to access a student in an entry where it doesn't exist.</p>

<p>What you should do is, after the lines:</p>

<pre><code>Student[] stdData = new Student[splitLine.length];
    for(int i=0; i&lt;splitLine.length; i++){
</code></pre>

<p>add an initialization:</p>

<pre><code>stdData[i] = new Student();
</code></pre>

<p>and then continue as you do - later in the code you'll be able to do stuff like:</p>

<pre><code>stdData[i].setID(stdDataStr[0]);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong><br>
When you post a question - try to post only the relevant code, add a stacktrace and mark the line which triggers the compilation/run-time error.</p>
