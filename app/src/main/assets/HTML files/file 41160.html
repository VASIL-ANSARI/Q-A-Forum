<p>If you really want to do this, you can do</p>

<pre><code>FragmentManager fragmentManager = getActivity().getFragmentManager()
</code></pre>

<p>and get information about the backstack from <code>fragmentManager</code>. If your fragment has a tag, you could assert that <code>findFragmentByTag(tag)</code> returns something non-null.</p>

<p>But it's normally better to make assertions about the view hierarchy. It's what Espresso was designed for, and it's more in the spirit of white-box testing.</p>

<p>So I would suggest finding some distinguishing feature of the new fragment, such as the page title if there is one, and asserting that that view is present using the usual Espresso methods, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>onView(withText("Page Two Title")).check(matches(isDisplayed());
</code></pre>
