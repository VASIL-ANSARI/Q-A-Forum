<p>It's not surprising that an application running from Apache cannot access the X11 as nicely. I'd use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb" rel="nofollow">xvfb</a> + <a href="http://www-linux.gsi.de/cgi-bin/man2html?xvfb-run+1" rel="nofollow">xvfb-run</a>. </p>

<p>On the other hand, while playing with <code>xte</code> in extreme cases is fine, it's a bit hacky when you have clean solutions; try projects like <a href="http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">cutycapt</a> or similar.</p>
