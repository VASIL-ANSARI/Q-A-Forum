<p>I am assuming that <code>cv::Rect(...)</code> methods (or family of them) returns a rectangle object. The line that you do not understand, I assume is an overloaded operator (<code>==</code>) that compares rectangles.</p>

<p>But I am making a lot of assumptions here as I do not have the code for <code>cv</code> class.</p>

<p>As to the <code>&amp;</code> overloaded operator - one assumes that this is doing an intersection or union. Once again without the code it is hard to say.</p>
