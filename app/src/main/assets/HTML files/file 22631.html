<p>The easiest way for you is to put your label in an UpdatePanel (AJAX) and place a client-side timer (javascript) in your page that sends an update request every few seconds (or whatever you wish). On the server-side, simply update your Model asynchronously and the function that updates the label value should read from the Model directly. Hope that helps.</p>
