<p>It's totally fine to treat enums as integers, as long as you're clear about what you're doing.  Usually, like this:</p>

<pre><code>enum Axis { 
    X=0, 
    Y=1, 
    Z=2,
    //axis_count=3, If you intend to iterate over values, add this
};
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it blatantly clear to yourself and other developers that the integer values of each are important, and therefore that the enumerations will sometimes be used as integers.</p>

<p>Vaguely related, it's also common to use enumerations for bitflags, which usually looks more like this:</p>

<pre><code>enum ThingFlags {
    IsTall    = 1&lt;&lt;0,
    IsWide    = 1&lt;&lt;1,
    IsLong    = 1&lt;&lt;2,
    IsHollow  = 1&lt;&lt;3,
    IsColored = 1&lt;&lt;4,

    Mask      = (1&lt;&lt;5)-1, //common to have a mask of all meaningful bits.
    SizeMask  = 0x7,      //sometimes other masks too
};
</code></pre>

<p>And this makes it clear that the least-significant bit signifies height, the next bit is width, the next is length, etc.</p>
