<p>Once you're persisted the object, you should be able to call getId() or whatever your @ID column is, so you could return that from your method.  You could also invalidate the Hibernate first level cache and fetch it again.</p>

<p>However, for portability, you might want to look at using Hibernate with sequence style ID generation.  This will ease the transition away from MySQL if you ever need to.  Certainly, if you use this style of generator, you'll be able to get the ID immediately, because Hibernate needs to resolve the column value before it persists the object:</p>

<pre><code>@Id
@GeneratedValue (generator="MY_SEQ")
@GenericGenerator( name = "MY_SEQ",
    strategy = "org.hibernate.id.enhanced.SequenceStyleGenerator",
    parameters = { 
        @Parameter(name = "sequence_name", value = "MY_SEQ"), 
        @Parameter(name = "initial_value", value = "1"), 
        @Parameter(name = "increment_size", value = "10") }
        )
@Column ( name = "id", nullable = false )
public Long getId () {

        return this.id;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It's a bit more complex, but it's the kind of thing you can cut and paste, apart from changing the SEQUENCE name.  </p>
