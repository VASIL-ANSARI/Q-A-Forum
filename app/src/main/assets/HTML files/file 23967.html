<p>That's easy enough</p>

<pre><code>ssEntities sss = new ssEntities();
  var c1 = sss.table1.ToList().Where(x =&gt; x.date &gt;= DateTime.Today)
                            .Select(x =&gt; new { x.Prop1, x.Prop2 });
  var c2 = sss.table2.ToList().Where(x =&gt; x.date1 &gt;= DateTime.Today)
                            .Select(x =&gt; new { x.Prop1, x.Prop2 });
  var ll = c1.Union(c2).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>You have to only select the properties you want from each table , and they have to be the same, so that the union will work, you can't do a Union on 2 different types.</p>
