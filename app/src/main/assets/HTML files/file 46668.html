<p>In Python there are no true constants. The closest thing you can do is create a variable and never reassign it. Your attempt looks like it will work fine.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that "constant and true" does not mean "global". The distinguishing feature of a global variable has nothing to do with constancy, but the scope at which the object can be referenced (namely, all). You can have global variables that aren't constant (in languages that allow constants, of course), and constant variables that are not global.</p>
