<p>If you know the dimensions of the navigation, I would say the following steps might help:</p>

<ol>
<li>Always have an ellipsis element, with a hidden class, toggled as needed.</li>
<li>Using jquery $('navElement').offset().left + $('navElement').width you get the right end position for the nav. </li>
<li>Now you can get the element at this position, maybe using Document.elementFromPoint(), </li>
<li>Identify all elements after this element, you'll have to figure out the logic for this, make them display block, and wrap all of them within a container dynamically.</li>
<li>now showing hiding that container will result in a dropdown effect.</li>
<li>As long as you can identify the logo and other components you want toshow/hide when sticky using css selectors, when your nav goes sticky, add a parent class to your nav and write css to hide these elements when inside the sticky class.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is the logic I would follow at a broad level based on your question.</p>
