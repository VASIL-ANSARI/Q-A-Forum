<p>A true restart is not possible <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/AFAIK">AFAIK</a>. (Please correct me if I'm wrong!).</p>

<p>However, if you want to set it to 0, you can just delete and recreate it.</p>

<p>If you want to set it to a specific value, you can set the INCREMENT to a negative value and get the next value.</p>

<p>That is, if your sequence is at 500, you can set it to 100 via</p>

<pre><code>ALTER SEQUENCE serial INCREMENT BY -400;
SELECT serial.NEXTVAL FROM foo;
ALTER SEQUENCE serial INCREMENT BY 1;
</code></pre>
