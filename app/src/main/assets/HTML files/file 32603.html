<p>Did you change the language of the Visual Studio GUI recently?</p>

<p>I switched the language of my installation from German to English which resulted in almost the same error message. (except I'm trying to build for Win32) Switching back to German resolved this issue.</p>

<p>It seems that most people experience this when building for x64. So if you didn't change your language <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/884d5b10-50dc-4cc1-9c17-f036b73bc637/error-the-configurationgeneral-rule-is-missing-from-the-project?forum=Vsexpressvc" rel="nofollow">give this a try</a>.</p>
