<p>When the language is SQL, it needs to be a regular query, so convert the logic to plain SQL by moving the <code>IF</code> condition inside the <code>WHERE</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT "ID", "PATHSET_ID", "UTILITY"
FROM "B"
WHERE "PATHSET_ID" = $1
AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM "A" WHERE "ID" = $1)
</code></pre>
