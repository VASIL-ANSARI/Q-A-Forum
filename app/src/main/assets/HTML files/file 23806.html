<p>html.replace() is a string, not a jquery object. I'm guessing (since you didn't post the code with the <code>find</code> and you stated that you added <code>.find</code> after replace) that you were doing this:</p>

<pre><code>html = $(html.replace(/&lt;img[^&gt;]*&gt;/g,"").find("#specialDiv"));
</code></pre>

<p>if that is the case, just move the find outside:</p>

<pre><code>html = $(html.replace(/&lt;img[^&gt;]*&gt;/g,"")).find("#specialDiv");
</code></pre>

<p>also, there really is no need to modify the dom as a string... nor do you need to worry about removing tags from content you don't care about... this would be better:</p>

<pre><code>html = $(html).find("#specialDiv");
html.find("img").remove();
</code></pre>
