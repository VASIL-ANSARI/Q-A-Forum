<p>A bit of a stab in the dark: Your <code>#content</code> <code>div</code> will, of course, be a lot shorter as the blog posts aren't there, basically consisting just of the <code>div</code>s with the titles. Perhaps that's the problem.</p>

<p>Does the image have a blank (or subtle) bit at the top or something, so that it's only apparent that it's there when there's more content in the <code>#content</code> <code>div</code> (e.g., when it's taller)? Or is there some other reason you can see that when <code>#content</code> is really short, you wouldn't see the background on the part of it that's there? (You can use the debugging tools in most modern browsers to see what the dimensions of the <code>#content</code> div are when the paragraphs are hidden; or slap a border on it temporarily, but tools these days are pretty good.)</p>

<p>Basically, since the jQuery doesn't, of course, actually hide the background, it must be a side-effect of the paragraphs being hidden&nbsp;&mdash; because of the effect that has on the dimensions of the <code>#content</code> <code>div</code>.</p>
