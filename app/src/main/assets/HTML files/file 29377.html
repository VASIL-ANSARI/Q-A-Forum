<p>So it seems that changing my Android Project Build Target to the Google APIs target instead of just the Android target has fixed the issue (or at least I no longer get the ClassNotFoundException any longer).</p>

<p>Try setting this yourself: Right click on your project. Build Path -> Configure Build Pathâ¦ Go to the Android settings in the left pane. Check the corresponding Google APIs target for your project.</p>

<p>EDIT: This fixed the <code>VpnProfile</code> issue I had, but not the <code>VpnSettings</code> that you're having (now I'm having that issue).</p>

<p>EDIT 2: VpnSettings class is located in the Settings app. You can download the source for the Settings app if you'd like: <code>https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings.git</code></p>
