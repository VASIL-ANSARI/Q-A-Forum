<p>I feel like I'm missing something here, but I have a few minutes... :)</p>

<p>What's wrong with the finished signal in 4.x?  It just adds a few parameters to what you have from what I can tell.</p>

<p>4.5:</p>

<pre>void QProcess::finished( int exitCode, QProcess::ExitStatus exitStatus )</pre>

<p>4.0:</p>

<pre>void QProcess::finished( int exitCode )</pre>

<p>Change your slot to have the correct arguments and just ignore them if you don't need them.</p>

<p>As for needing status updates, launch the new QProcess in a separate thread and let that thread do the waiting.</p>
