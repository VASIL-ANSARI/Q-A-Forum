<p>If you look at ClientBase`1 source, you'll notice that Endpoint is actually retrieved from the underlying ChannelFactory:</p>

<pre><code>public ServiceEndpoint Endpoint
{
    get
    {
        TryDisableSharing();
        return GetChannelFactory().Endpoint;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>by default, CacheSetting of ClientBase`1 uses CacheSetting.Default which means it tries to cache channel factories, so it seems like sometimes you happened to modify the cached factory's endpoint from 2 different clients</p>
