<p>If you're willing to use <a href="https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart#customizing-mock-behavior" rel="nofollow">strict mocks</a>, you can get this behavior for free.  Any call into a method on a strict mock that was not setup (via <code>Setup()</code>) will fail the test.  </p>

<p>Note that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/4996327/1698557">there are trade-offs between loose and strict mocks</a>.  Benefits of loose mocks is reduced test setup and less brittle tests.  Benefits of strict mocks include more precise testing of your system under test and its dependencies at the expense of more test setup.  </p>

<p>In your case, if you're willing to live the increased test setup then they can provide exactly the behavior you're looking for.</p>
