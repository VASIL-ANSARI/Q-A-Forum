  <p>Iterate over the relevant columns in the Cursor, retrieve the values, and compare each.</p>

<p>Although you may not know in advance the type of each column, you can find out with <code>Cursor.getType()</code>. You can also use <code>Cursor.getColumnNames()</code> to get the name of each column, and the number of columns.</p>

<p>This information will allow you to then use the correct accessor method to obtain each value and compare.</p>
