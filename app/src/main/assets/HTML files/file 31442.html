<p>I assume you have many labels, otherwise your controller should just keep a reference to your label (e.g. <code>cutField</code> of type <code>UILabel</code>) and use that. </p>

<pre><code>@interface Controller () {
  UILabel *cutField;
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>The solution to generalize this has two steps. First, change your method signature to one that includes the tap gesture. All you have to do in the init call is to add a <strong>colon (<code>:</code>)</strong> to the selector.</p>

<pre><code>UITapGestureRecognizer *tapGesture = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] 
    initWithTarget:self action:@selector(labelSelected:)];
</code></pre>

<p>The method can now use the gesture recognizer's <code>view</code> property to get to the label to which it is attached.</p>

<pre><code>-(void) labelSelected:(UITapGestureRecognizer*)recognizer {
    UILabel *label = (UILabel*) recognizer.view;
    NSString *labelText = label.text;
}
</code></pre>
