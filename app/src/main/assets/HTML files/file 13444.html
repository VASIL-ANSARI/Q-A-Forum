<p>I was running into the same issue, with an error message complaining that the provider name was already registered.  I thought the trick might be to use both a different authority as well as a different name--so, extending my base provider from the library project in both the free and pro versions, in my case.  This will fix your issue, if you're still having it (noticed this was an old post, but no answers so I decided to post the way I got around it anyway).</p>

<p>I was curious if anyone else was running into the same thing, and sure enough it seems to be a bug in the Android platform.  See the issue details <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7716" rel="nofollow">here</a> or a similar SO post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3306639/multiple-apps-use-same-content-provider">here</a>.</p>
