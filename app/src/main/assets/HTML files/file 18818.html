<p>In order for chaining to work, you need to return <code>$this</code> from each method you want to be chainable:</p>

<pre><code>class one{
    public $instance;

    function instance(){
        $this-&gt;instance = 'instance was created';
        return $this;
    }

    function execute(){
        $this-&gt;instance .= "and something happened";
        return $this;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it's a bad idea to give properties the same name as methods.  It may be unambiguous to the parser, but it's confusing to developers.</p>
