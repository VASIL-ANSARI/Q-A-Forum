<p>The problem is that the submenus are displayed on hover. As you have set the grand child menu to display 23px from the top, if you move the mouse to the right, it is no longer hovering the child, and thus the menu disappears.</p>

<p>To fix it, you need to make the grand child menu to vertically line up with the child menu, so that it doesn't lose hover before the grand child gains hover. You can do this by setting the top value to 0:</p>

<pre><code>#nav ul ul {
    left: 181px;
    top: 0;
}
</code></pre>
