<p>You could add a run script. </p>

<p>Select your target and then select "Build Phases". From the "Add Build Phase" button in he lower right choose "Add Run Script". </p>

<p>No write a shell script, perhaps invoking an AppleScript or Automator script that instructs Xcode to generate the files. I have looked at the Dictionary of Xcode (Choose Xcode with "Open Dictionary" from the AppleScript Editor), and there are hooks select the entities in your data model. I did not see a way via AppleScript to generate the files, but you could have it choose the corresponding menu item. </p>

<p>This is quite a little project. Please share your code once you got it to work.</p>
