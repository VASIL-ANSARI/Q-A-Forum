<p>The problem is that your javascript is not targeting the container it's in. </p>

<pre><code>    document.body.innerHTML = "";
    document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 4)));  
</code></pre>

<p>is going to target the body of the document since it's using <code>document.body</code>, and not care about where the code is defined (and therefore the class of the container is entirely discarded...actually erased by the <code>innerHTML = ""</code> statement.  What you'd be looking for is <code>document.write</code> which will output in the place of definition (and with no clearing statement).  </p>

<pre><code> document.write(document.createTextNode(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 4)));  
</code></pre>

<p>This in general should be replaced by explicitly tageted selection and unobtrusive JavaScript when you start to do anything more than one-off code. </p>
