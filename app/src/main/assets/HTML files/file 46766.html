<p>Highcharts is a good option for you. You can just call the PHP within the javascript function:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$query = "
      SELECT someValue 
      FROM table_name 
      ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
//loop database results
while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) {
$data[] = $row['price'];
}
?&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
...snip...
//add a join function to separate each result with a comma
data: [&lt;?php echo join($data, ', '); ?&gt;]
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this example the X-axis is under <code>Categories: '';</code> and the Y-axis is <code>data: '';</code>  Here's a fiddle, it doesn't include PHP since it's not supported, but should give you an idea how to use highcharts. </p>
