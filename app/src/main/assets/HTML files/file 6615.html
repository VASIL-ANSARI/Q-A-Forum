<p>It seems like there's more to this.  Why can't you save <code>pr</code> to the data store as is?  It seems like you may be using the ORM inefficiently, though there could be good reason for this that we just can't see from the scope of this code.</p>

<p>On a more general note, you may have luck with something like <a href="http://automapper.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">automapper</a> in cases like this.  Though, honestly, I think with a little re-working of how you're using the ORM it shouldn't be necessary here.</p>

<p>Based on comments to far, I'd also like to note that there's nothing inherently wrong with a long and boring mapping function like this.  Even if it's 20 properties or 200 properties.  If it's only written once, is easy to read and understand what it's doing, does what it's doing well, etc. then it's not a bad piece of code.  Code isn't always pretty, and it doesn't need to be.  It's easy to be tempted to do something more clever to make the code cooler or more interesting, but clever isn't always better when it comes to supporting that code later.</p>
