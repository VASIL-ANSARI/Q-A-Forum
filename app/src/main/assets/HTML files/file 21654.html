<p>What you're trying to do is called reverse geo-coding and you'll need to use a 3rd party service to be able to do this. Have a look at these links <a href="http://www.geonames.org/export/reverse-geocoding.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some of these services produce better results than others, but you can't rely on them. If you get a result back (or a partial one as you have) then great. But expect that you might not get anything back at all.</p>
