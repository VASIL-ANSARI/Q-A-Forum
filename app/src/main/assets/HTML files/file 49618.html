<p>I find your question very broad, and may be apt for close votes, however, to give some ideas:</p>

<p>The main question for me is, "how many rows are we talking about?" If the data comes in at high rates in real-time, with only occasional queries, then separate the receiving of the data (to flat file e.g.) and the processing of this data (reading the flat files).</p>

<p>Another solution, if the queries are all predetermined, is to process the data on-the-fly while coming in.</p>

<p>Hash tables and balanced trees can be an option if the queries are more dynamical.</p>
