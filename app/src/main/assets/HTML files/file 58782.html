<p>The error says Colomn not found, the column name you are trying to 'call' is called 'tabel_name'. Are you sure the column name isn't 'table_name'? (table in english and not dutch, atleast I think you are dutch)</p>

<p>So it should be:</p>

<pre><code>public function Attachments()
    {
       return $this-&gt;hasMany('App\Attachments','record_id','id')-&gt;where('table_name','`battery_assets`');
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If your column is called 'tabel_name' in your database. I would recommend using English naming, since 'name' is English.</p>
