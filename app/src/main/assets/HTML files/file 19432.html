<p>Having had a read of CS193p Assignment 3 (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/system/files/assignments/Assignment%203_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">for anyone interested, it is available here in PDF format</a>), it looks like you are being asked to create a protocol for your UIView subclass, and have the delegate of that protocol (the view's managing view controller) provide the data used for drawing.</p>

<p>If you have set up your protocol correctly, the view's <code>drawRect</code> method should be asking the view controller for data through the protocol's method, something like:</p>

<pre><code>DataObject *data = [self.delegate getData];
// It might be [self.dataSource getData]; in your case
</code></pre>

<p>That should call the <code>getData</code> delegate method that you should have written into the view controller (I have made up a method signature for this, adapt to the one used by your protocol. Also, this code doesn't consider relevant memory management, if required):</p>

<pre><code>- (DataObject *)getData
{
    // Get data from the model, and return
    DataObject *dataObjectToReturn = [Model getRelevantData];

    return dataObjectToReturn;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The view's <code>drawRect</code> should now have the relevant instance of <code>DataObject</code> and can go about using that data to draw what it needs to draw.</p>

<hr>

<p>Below is my original answer, which is not relevant to the specific problem above, but does show another method of view/view controller interaction. (This method isn't applicable to the above problem because the data needed for drawing shouldn't be owned by the view itself.)</p>

<p>To access the view's properties from that view's controller you would use <code>self.view</code>. Thus, to get the view's width, like in your example, you would use:</p>

<pre><code>CGFloat viewWidth = self.view.bounds.size.width;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also set the controller's view, though note that for your example you have to supply an entire CGRect for the frame, as manipulating the width directly is not allowed:</p>

<pre><code>// This gets a reference to the view's frame, then uses values from it to create a new
// CGRect that is 10.0 points wider, and sets the frame of the view to the new frame

CGRect viewFrame = self.view.frame;
self.view.frame = CGRectMake(viewFrame.origin.x, viewFrame.origin.y, viewFrame.size.width + 10.0f, viewFrame.size.height);
</code></pre>
