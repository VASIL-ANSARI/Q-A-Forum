<p>It would be really helpful if you provided links. I googled and found this <a href="http://www.trustcommerce.com/code-tools/api-sdk" rel="nofollow">TrustCommerce</a>, but I guess maybe it's a different company to the one you are talking about because they say there is sample Python code.</p>

<p>I didn't sign up for a trial account just to see if the Python API requires a C library. Afterall maybe it's not even the same TrustCommerce you have looked at.</p>

<p>This isn't really the right site to do your research, you should come back and ask for help if you have problems using the API when you have found/chosen one.</p>
