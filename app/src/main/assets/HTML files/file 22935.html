<p>I have learned that if you have any errors in Monodevelop, simply delete your project, throw your laptop out the window, and then you have a clear opening to jump out of it behind it. :P</p>

<p>Honestly, I had to delete the project, use a backup and do the exact steps I first took and it worked. So I'm sorry my only advice is to save many backups along the way. Basically if you have any errors in your output, but none when you build it. Just delete it and try again. Once the compiler is confused it would take an act of God to fix it. </p>
