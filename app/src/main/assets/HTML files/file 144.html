<p>(This doesn't really answer your specific questions but...)
I haven't personally used Qt, but it's not free for commercial Windows development.</p>

<p>Have you looked at <a href="http://wxwindows.org/" rel="nofollow">wxWindows</a> which is free? Nice article <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6778" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Just as an aside, if you wanted a single code base for all platforms, then you may have to migrate away from MFC - I am pretty sure (someone will correct if wrong) that MFC only targets Windows.</p>

<p>One other option would be to look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb983962.aspx" rel="nofollow">Feature Pack update</a> to MFC in SP1 of VS2008 - it includes access to new controls, including the Office style ribbon controls.</p>
