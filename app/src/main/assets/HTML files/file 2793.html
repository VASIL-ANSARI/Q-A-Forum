<p>Either of the second two possibilities will work. In case you care, there's also a third:</p>

<pre><code>using std::vector;

protected:
    vector&lt;registeredObject&gt; mRegistryList;
</code></pre>

<p>Of these, the <code>using namespace std;</code> is generally advised against -- it drags in a large number of names, some of which you basically can't even know about, so it's easy for it to collide with all sorts of things in your own code. Most people use the explicitly qualified name, like: <code>std::vector...</code> version most of the time.</p>
