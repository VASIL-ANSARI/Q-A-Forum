<p>If you want a generic solution to the problem you would have to extract getters and setters into an interface and then use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html" rel="nofollow">Proxy</a> to either intercept all methods starting with set or have them annotated(and process annotations in your Handler) and then either do nothing or preferrably throw an UnsupportedOperationException. </p>

<p>This would be overkill if you need it for only 1 or 2 classes tho and comes with a larger overhead in general.</p>
