<p>There's four overloads of the function but let's just assume the first one is used. If you look at the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/async_read_until/overload1.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, then you'll see that <code>bytes_transferred</code> is the amount of bytes to and including the delimiter specified.</p>

<p>And furthermore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a successful async_read_until operation, the streambuf may contain additional data beyond the delimiter. An application will typically leave that data in the streambuf for a subsequent async_read_until operation to examine.</p>
