<p>I use <a href="http://www.uptimerobot.com/" rel="nofollow">uptime robot</a> to ensure my application is always spun up. The beauty of this 
 system is it only asks for the headers of a page on your website and gets status codes like "200-ok", "404-not found", etc. every 5 minutes. This means that uptime robot does not add noise to Google Analytics as the page is never requested. </p>

<p>Seems to work like a dream for me and its <strong>FREE!</strong></p>
