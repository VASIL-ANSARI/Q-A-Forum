<p>As others have pointed out, the differences between the results obtained for the two statements is negligible. Even when <a href="http://jsperf.com/ghshshsrd-same" rel="nofollow">testing the same statement twice</a>, it is very unlikely you will yield two identical Ops/sec values.</p>

<p>Also noticed you said "a test", not "multiple tests". If the result seemed odd, just repeat the test - don't forget anomalous results could occur if your browser was starved of resource part way through a test run. </p>

<p>JSPerf has always been reliable for me - enough to be useful for demonstrating optimization techniques (<a href="http://jsperf.com/math-floor-vs-math-round-vs-parseint/5" rel="nofollow">this being a classic example</a>).</p>
