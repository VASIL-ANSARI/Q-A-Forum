<p>If you change the margin-bottom of #left-nav to 110px, then you will have that space. Your absolutely positioned element will not be pushed down by the left nav's margin because it its no longer positioned "relatively", if that makes any sense. The margin of your left nav is pushing up against the bottom of your #maincontent area when you bump it up to 110px. </p>
