<p>You can't change the upper-bound of an array like that in .NET. If you need a dynamically sized Array I'd suggest looking at <code>List</code> as it allows you to do all of this.</p>

<p>You'll want to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>Dim yourStrings AS List(Of List(Of String)) = New List(Of New List(Of String)
</code></pre>

<p>To convert this to a 2-D Array:</p>

<pre><code>Dim maxListLength As Integer = 0
For Each subList In yourStrings
    maxListLength = If(subList.Length &gt; maxListLength, subList.Length, maxListLength)
Next

Dim yourArray(yourString.Length - 1, maxListLength -1) As String

Dim x As Integer = 0
Dim y As Integer = 0

For Each subList In yourString
    For Each str In subList
        yourArray(x, y) = str
        y = y + 1
    Next
    x = x + 1
Next
</code></pre>

<p>From 2-D to List(Of List(Of String))</p>

<pre><code>Dim yourList As List(Of List(Of String)) = New List(Of List(Of String))

For i = 0 To ArrayXSize
    Dim thisXString = New List(Of String)
    For j = 0 To ArrayYSize
       thisXStrings.Add(yourArray(i,j))
    Next
    yourList.Add(thisXStrings)  
Next
</code></pre>
