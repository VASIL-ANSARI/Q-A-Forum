<p>If you pipe the output from one command into another, that output will be available on the receiving process's standard input (stdin).</p>

<p>You can access it using the usual <code>scanf</code> or <code>fread</code> functions. <code>scanf</code> and the like operate on stdin by default (in the same way that <code>printf</code> operates on stdout by default; in the absence of a pipe, stdin is attached to the terminal), and the C standard library provides a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stdout.3.html" rel="nofollow"><code>FILE *stdin</code></a> for functions like <code>fread</code> that read from a FILE stream.</p>

<p>POSIX also provides a <code>STDIN_FILENO</code> macro in <code>unistd.h</code>, for functions that operate one file descriptors instead. This will essentially always be 0, but it's bad form to rely on that being the case.</p>
