<p>Use mysql's custom group by:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM (
   SELECT * FROM highscores
   ORDER by Score DESC) x
GROUP BY name
ORDER by Score DESC
LIMIT 100
</code></pre>

<p>This works because when not all non-aggregate columns are listed in the group by, mysql returns the <em>first</em> row encountered for each unique combination of the columns listed in the group by.</p>
