<p>Based on the info I included in the above edit, I continued down the path of testing Jquery Mobile and was able to solve.</p>

<p>First, I updated to Jquery Mobile v1.0, which adds the linkBindingEnabled global config (http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/api/globalconfig.html):</p>

<p>Second, I set that config to False:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).bind("mobileinit", function(){
  $.mobile.linkBindingEnabled = false;
});
</code></pre>
