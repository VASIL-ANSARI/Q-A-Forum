<p>If you are only interested in the GSM signal from your operator then use getMnc() from <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellIdentityGsm.html" rel="nofollow">CellIdentityGsm</a> to establish if the signal you are measuring is valid.</p>

<p>If you want the GSM signal only when the device is in service (ie successfully connected to a network) then use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/ServiceState.html" rel="nofollow">ServiceState</a> checker to establish what state the device is in. </p>

<p>As per above comments, the symptoms indicate that you are measuring other operators' GSM signals.</p>
