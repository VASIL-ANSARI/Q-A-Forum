<p>The error you get is absolutely logical. Look at this line in your <code>getView()</code> method:</p>

<p><code>final View rowView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.program_list2, null);</code></p>

<p>What does it mean? It means that you're creating a new instance of the item each time Android requests you a <code>View</code> for it. That's pretty insane, because you just create and create more views while you scroll the <code>ListView</code> (so is pretty natural that you get an out of memory error. And I'm sure your <code>ListView</code> is scrolling laggy).</p>

<p>And I bet Android Studio is warning you this issue by remarking that line in yellow color.</p>

<p>Affortunately, you can fix it very easily. But let me say you some things. Look at the <code>View</code> that you're receiving in the <code>getView()</code> method as a parameter. Don't you see it? Is the variable that you called <code>convertView</code>. And note that you're not using it. What is this <code>View</code>? Is called a recycled view (Not to be confused with <code>RecyclerView</code> class). Is a view that was previously inflated and no longer used because is not visible for the user. And this, my friend, this is the key of your problem and also of your solution: Instead of inflate one new view each time, just recycle it. I promise you is very simple. Now your <code>getView</code> methos should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public View getView(final int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    if (convertView == null)
        convertView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.program_list2, null);

    //final Holder holder = new Holder();
    //holder.img = (ImageView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.imageView1);
    //holder.img.setImageResource(imageId[position]);


    ImageView img = (ImageView) convertView.findViewById(R.id.imageView1);
    //Note you don't need the Holder
    Bitmap imageBitmap = convertBitmap(imageId[position]);
    if (imageBitmap != null)
        img.setImageBitmap(imageBitmap);
    else
        img.setImageBitmap(null);

    return convertView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And please look at your usage of the ViewHolder pattern. You're using it wrong...</p>
