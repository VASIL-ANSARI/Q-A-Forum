<p>It is possible to overload the new operator, however I would advice against it.</p>

<p>I think you are going in the wrong direction. You don't want to hide things and make users unsure what is happening. In this case you should be explicit that you are allocating through a pool. </p>

<p>Here is what you could do.</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T, unsigned int N&gt;
class MemoryPool
{
    T* malloc()
    {
        return ... // your pool impl
    }

    void free(T* ptr)
    {
        ... // your pool impl
    }

    void destory(T* ptr)
    {
        ptr-&gt;T::~T(); // call destructor
        free(ptr);
    }
};

int main()
{
    MemoryPool&lt;my_class&gt; pool;
    my_class* instance = new (pool.malloc()) my_class(/*args*/); // in-place new
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should also take a look at how <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_45_0/libs/pool/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">boost pool</a> is implemented.</p>
