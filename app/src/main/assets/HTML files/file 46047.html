<p>One-line methods are not a problem, but what makes your solution #1 unsatisfying is the violation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" rel="nofollow">Law of Demeter</a> (statistics.pool.setXXXX). It might be better to have a statistics.setAvailableInPool() method (or to use your idea #2). I can' t offer more help with the specific implementation because It's not very clear what your Pool and Edge classes are supposed to do (or why they're so similar to each other but do not implement a common interface).</p>

<p>In answer to your general question about creating interfaces for composition, take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_%28object-oriented_design%29" rel="nofollow">SOLID principles</a>. Basically, you should think about what behaviors you need from your dependencies, name those behaviors clearly, and depend on the interface rather than the concrete class. That makes the code easier to understand and easier to change in one place without having to change it everywhere.   </p>
