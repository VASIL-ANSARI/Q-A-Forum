<p>The methods are attributes to be set in a FormBuilder. As such, you'll want to call user_name_equals = "Bob", not user_name_equals("Bob"). Also, they'll be on a search instance, not the model itself.</p>

<p>@search = User.search(:user_name_eq => "Bob")</p>

<p>If you're looking for something to use in day to day query construction, try MetaWhere instead. <a href="http://metautonomo.us/projects/metawhere" rel="nofollow">http://metautonomo.us/projects/metawhere</a></p>
