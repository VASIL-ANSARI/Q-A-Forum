<p>I have found a way to solve it. Interesting but works.</p>

<pre><code>Foo fooInstance = new Foo();

try {
   whenNew(Foo.class).withAnyArguments().then(new Answer&lt;Void&gt;() {
        @Override
        public Void answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) throws Throwable {
            Field reflected = invocation.getClass().getDeclaredField("field");
            reflected.setAccessible(true);
            reflected.set(fooInstance, (new HashSet&lt;String&gt;()));

            return null;
        }

});
} catch (Exception e) {
      ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>After asking this question, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25120820/mockito-mocked-object-is-assigned-a-null-value-from-method-calls-inside-a-method">one link</a> from right-hand side, as suggestion, has got my interest. I have found answer after look at that question, sort of inspiration.</p>
