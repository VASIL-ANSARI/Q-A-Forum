<p>There is no standard solution.  To start with, there are two types of
configuration files: those supplied by the user to configure your
program the way he likes (colors, etc.), and those that you use
internally to avoid having to recompile and redeliver a new binary
anytime some small external factor changes.  The first are traditionally
under <code>$HOME</code> under Unix, in a single file or a directory whose name 
starts with a <code>.</code>; under Windows, I think that they're usually under
<code>c:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\<i>username</i>\ApplicationData\<i>appliname</i></code>.
For the internal configuration data, under Unix, I is a general
convention that the user set an environment variable which specifies a
root; your executables are in a <code>bin</code> directory under this, and any
configuration data in an <code>etc</code> directory.  (There's no reliable way
under Unix of knowing from where you were loaded.)  Under Windows, the
configuration data goes in the same directory as the executable, and the
program uses <code>GetModuleFileName</code> to find this.</p>
