<p>Yes in the same thread, EF will properly consider transaction scope if it exists. EF will not create new transaction if it's already in one. </p>

<p>However, you must be careful because if you query your database without transaction then you will get dirty reads. Because EF will not read anything in transaction if it does not exist but it creates new transaction if it does not exist while saving changes. </p>

<p>In your code you are only saving changes in transaction but you should be careful while reading and you should encapsulate your queries also in scope in smaller units. </p>
