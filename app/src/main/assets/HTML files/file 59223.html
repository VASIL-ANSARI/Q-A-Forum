<p>Have you tried using the_field() instead of get_field()?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?= esc_url( the_field('video') ); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The oEmbed actually returns more than just a url so that could be the issue as well.  I haven't worked with esc_url() much in the past but it could be breaking because whatever is getting passed through is not only a url.  </p>

<p>As stated here, <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/oembed/" rel="nofollow">https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/oembed/</a>, "The oEmbed field will return a string containing the embed HTML".</p>
