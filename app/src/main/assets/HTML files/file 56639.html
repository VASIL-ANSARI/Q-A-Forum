<p>There is no such method to query against the arrays as of now . The second paramater of contains() requires a string so you cant pass int[] or int . Iterating over the result is the only option . </p>

<pre><code>RealmQuery q = users.where();
for (int id : ids) {
q = q.notEqualsTo("id", id);
}
RealmResults&lt;users&gt; users = q.findAll();
</code></pre>

<p>You can use between() if you need to query against a range of value .</p>
