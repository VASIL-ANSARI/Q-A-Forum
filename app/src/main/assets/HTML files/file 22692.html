<p>Use the following code the file names inside a .zip archive:


<pre><code>$zip = zip_open('test.zip');

while($entry = zip_read($zip)) {
    $file_name = zip_entry_name($entry);
    $ext = pathinfo($file_name, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
    if(strtoupper($ext) !== 'MP3') {
        notify_admin($file_name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that following code will only have look at the extension. Meaning that user can upload anything what has a MP3 extension. To really check if the file is an mp3 you'll have to unpack it. I would advice you to do that in a temporary directory.</p>

<p>After the file is unpacked you may analyze it using, for example ffmpeg or whatever. Having detailed data about bitrate, track lenght, etc will be interesting in any case.</p>

<p>If the analysis fails you can flag the file.</p>
