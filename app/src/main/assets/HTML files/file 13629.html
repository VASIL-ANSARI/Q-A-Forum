<p>It probably means that your compiler isn't parsing the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol as you expect, i.e it isn't supporting C++11 in this respect.</p>

<p>Try this</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;LPTSTR,std::allocator&lt;LPTSTR&gt; &gt;
                                         ^ note space
</code></pre>

<p>and also read up on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4353203/thou-shalt-not-inherit-from-stdvector">why it might not be a good idea to inherit from a standard library container</a>. </p>

<p>As for the question "why is >>> legal", well, it isn't legal at all, not on C++03, not on C++11. I can only conclude that it is a feature of your compiler.</p>
