<p>You can get the expected total file size in the following callback method of NSURLConnection's <code>NSURLConnectionDataDelegate</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveResponse:(NSURLResponse *)response
{
   self.expectedTotalSize = response.expectedContentLength;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then in following callback method you can calculate how much data has been received:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveData:(NSData *)data
{
   self.recievedData += data.length;
}
</code></pre>
