<blockquote>
  <p>model.Name is a string</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have assigned:</p>

<pre><code>var departments = model.Name;
</code></pre>

<p>here department is of type <code>string</code> and string implements <code>IEnumerable&lt;char&gt;</code>, that is why when you enumerate over it using <code>foreach</code>, the item in the <code>foreach</code> loop is of type <code>char</code>. </p>

<p>and you are using </p>

<pre><code>foreach (Department Children in departments)
    {
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here Children is of type <code>char</code> since department is a string, whereas you have specified it to be of type <code>Department</code> that is why you are getting this error. </p>
