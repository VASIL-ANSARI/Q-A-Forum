<p>If you have a table of months that you care about, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>select m.*,
       (select count(*)
        from table t
        where t.activate_date &lt;= m.month_end and
              t.deactivate_date &gt;= m.month_start
       ) as Actives
from months m;
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have such a table handy, you can create one on the fly:</p>

<pre><code>select m.*,
       (select count(*)
        from table t
        where t.activate_date &lt;= m.month_end and
              t.deactivate_date &gt;= m.month_start
       ) as Actives
from (select date('2015-01-01') as month_start, date('2015-01-31') as month_end union all
      select date('2015-02-01') as month_start, date('2015-02-28') as month_end union all
      select date('2015-03-01') as month_start, date('2015-03-31') as month_end union all
      select date('2015-04-01') as month_start, date('2015-04-30') as month_end
     ) m;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>A potentially faster way is to calculate a cumulative sum of activations and deactivations and then take the maximum per month:</p>

<pre><code>select year(date), month(date), max(cumes)
from (select d, (@s := @s + inc) as cumes
      from (select activate_date as d, 1 as inc from table t union all
            select deactivate_date, -1 as inc from table t
           ) t cross join
           (select @s := 0) param
      order by d
     ) s
group by year(date), month(date);
</code></pre>
