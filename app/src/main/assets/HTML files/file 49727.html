<p>If the content your are including is static and you don't have a lot of different pages, your approach with including jsps is ok. Otherewise, look at the templating frameworks like <a href="https://tiles.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Tiles</a> or <a href="http://www.thymeleaf.org/" rel="nofollow">Thymeleaf</a>. </p>
