<p>I think you should start by reading a bit more about AOP and AspectJ, I can recommend you the "Aspect Oriented Spring" chapter of the well-known "Spring in Action" book. It will answer all your question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to ensure that my proxy will be called by the Spring proxy (after
  it started the transaction) ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well you don't do it yourself, Spring ensures that your advices are called according to the way you configured them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to triggers the creation of my own proxies ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure I understood the question, but proxies needed by Spring to perform AOP will be created by Spring so that you do not have to trigger any proxy creation yourself.</p>
