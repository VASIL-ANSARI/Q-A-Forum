<p>Can't say anything specific about your code but take a look at Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/XMLPerformance/index.html" rel="nofollow">XMLPerformance</a> sample - it compares NSXMLParser and libxml performance - results are definitely in favour of the latter. In one of my projects switching from NSXMLParser to libxml gave a great performance boost, so I'd suggest using it.</p>
