<p>Ok, I literally started looking at the IcePick library 5 minutes ago so keep that in mind if this is a stupid answer :)</p>

<p>As of this commit <a href="https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick/commit/f60b4b9c0307be208178381661ee13b958eda531" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick/commit/f60b4b9c0307be208178381661ee13b958eda531</a>
it looks like @State should be used instead of @Icicle. Does this solve your issue?</p>
