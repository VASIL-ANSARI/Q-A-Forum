<p>What you are doing here, is resolving an ambiguity by importing the symbol into the classes <strong>private</strong> namespace. Hence it's method shadowing and changing it's visibility to private. You can't have two functions with the exact same prototype both private and public, hence the f is now private.</p>

<p>At least GCC believes that <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-prs/2001-07/msg00591.html" rel="nofollow">using should be able to change the visibility</a> of a function.</p>

<p>Vague references however found in <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6936" rel="nofollow">GCC bug database</a>, show that using in fact shouldn't be affected by scope. </p>

<p>Most importantly, a direct answer (C++ Standard '03 -- 7.3.3/15)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The alias created by the using-declaration has the usual accessibility for a member-declaration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence the answers would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>it's a bug in Comeau </li>
<li>no, the code is not well formed, at least C++03-wise (can't find anything related in C++0x N3000)</li>
<li>yes, you can change access scope</li>
</ul>
