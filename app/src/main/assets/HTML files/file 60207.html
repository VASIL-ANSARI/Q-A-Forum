<p>This should work.There was a extra timestamp column in select list.  </p>

<pre><code>SELECT  
    DATEPART(Year, TIMESTAMP) Year, 
    DATEPART(Month, TIMESTAMP) Month, 
    COUNT(*) [Total Rows]
FROM 
    stage.ACTIVITY_ACCUMULATOR_archive
WHERE 
    TIMESTAMP BETWEEN '01-Jan-2014' AND '30-June-2014'
GROUP BY 
    DATEPART(Year, TIMESTAMP), DATEPART(Month, TIMESTAMP)
ORDER BY 
    Year, Month
</code></pre>
