<p>Within your for loop use the array indexing notation. For example, <code>String current = decoder[0]</code> results in <code>current</code> having the value <code>Nexa2f5</code>. Once you have the String Object (in my example, I named it <code>current</code>) you can use the <code>charAt()</code> method shown in the String class <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> to get the 4th and 5th characters. If you need more help than that, read my comments then update your code and ask another question.</p>
