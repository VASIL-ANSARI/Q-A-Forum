<p>Yes you should be using databinding. You should bind the <code>Fill</code> colour to your model and use a <code>ValueConverter</code> to convert between the enum and a colour. Alternatively have a Colour property on your ViewModel and bind to that directly.</p>

<p>I think using a <code>Grid</code> is the wrong approach, you should model your board as a list Tokens (in  fact a list of lists, for the rows and columns) and then use an <code>ItemsControl</code> with a <code>ItemsTemplate</code> to create the board. This will mean far less repetitive XAML.</p>

<p>As you are trying to learn WPF and XAML, try googling the above and see how far you get.</p>
