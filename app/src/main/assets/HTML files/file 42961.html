<p>To do this, you'll have to get the <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy" rel="nofollow">Numpy source code</a> and create a <code>site.cfg</code> file in the main folder that tells Numpy where to look for the MKL libraries. Use the <code>site.cfg.example</code> file as a guide; there's a section in there on MKL that should tell you the exact lines you need.</p>

<p>Once you have a <code>site.cfg</code> file, run <code>python setup.py config</code>. This will spit out the configuration info (it looks like the output of <code>numpy.config.show()</code>). You should see the paths to your MKL libraries in there (if not, you'll have to play around with the <code>site.cfg</code> file until you do). </p>

<p>Then, you can build and install with <code>python setup.py build</code> and <code>python setup.py install</code>. You may want to uninstall your old Numpy first.</p>

<p>I have a blog post on <a href="https://hunseblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/15/installing-numpy-and-openblas/" rel="nofollow">installing Numpy with OpenBLAS</a>. While your situation is a little different, a lot of steps are similar I think.</p>
