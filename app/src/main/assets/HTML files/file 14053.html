  <p>Now I removed location from "Required background modes" (in Xcode)
  and the array is now empty. Can I simply delete that key entirely? I
  mean, that key is not required, is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that key is optional and you can delete it</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I also noticed something else. although it is not in the rejection.
  the info.plist has "Application supports iTunes file sharing" set to
  YES, what is that? Maybe I should remove that too, or set it to NO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This key set to YES enables users to add/delete files in the application's Documents folder using iTunes on their PC. If your application does not use this functionality then you should delete that key as well as that may also be a reason for rejection (actually it was exactly the reason for rejection of one of my apps few weeks ago so you can trust me here :) )</p>
