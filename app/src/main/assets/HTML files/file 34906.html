<p>With MFMessageComposerViewController it is not possible to send without user interaction. You have to take SMS gateway and implement your own way of sending SMS, than only it is possible. Like you have to create webservice and accept parameters from iPhone like phonenumber and message and than send SMS using SMS gateway.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
