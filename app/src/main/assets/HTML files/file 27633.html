<p>The problem is most likely that your code editor and your terminal emulator use different encodings, and Java's notion of the default encoding may in addition be different.</p>

<p>To see if your terminal and your editor agree, you could simply <code>cat</code> your java source file. Does the Ã© show up correctly? If so, you use the same encoding in your source code editor and your terminal, but it is not Java's default encoding. If, OTOH, you can't see the Ã©, you need to find out what encoding is used by your terminal and your editor and brind them in agreement.</p>
