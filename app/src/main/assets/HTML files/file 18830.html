<p>I'm having this same problem on two machines running Mac OS 10.6.8.</p>

<p>I was able to fix the yaml problem by manually cd-ing into the directory and running ./configure. eg:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd /home/christopher/.rvm/src/yaml-0.1.4
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/christopher/.rvm/usr
</code></pre>

<p>After running "rvm install 1.9.3" a couple more times, it picked up the configuration I'd done, and stopped bothering me about the yaml issue.</p>

<p>I was also able to cd into the ruby directory and configure and make it. eg:</p>

<pre><code>$ /home/christopher/.rvm/src/ruby-1.9.3-p194
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
</code></pre>

<p>...However, this didn't cause rvm to pick it up.  I'm guessing I was missing some necessary command line options and flags.</p>

<p>But considering I was able to get as far as I did, it seems to me like it's an rvm bug.</p>
