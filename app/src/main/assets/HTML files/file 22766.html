<p><strong>Possible reasons:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The event <code>mousedown</code> executes <strong>before</strong> <code>click</code>, so first come first serve.</li>
<li>The element might have already a <code>click</code> event, which prevents this from happening, say that function executes first and it has a <code>return false</code> statement in it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now since you are using <code>mousedown</code>, which is not assigned for this element, it doesn't have any conflicts. This <em>may be</em> a reason, because you didn't post the full code. Feel free to correct. :)</p>

<p>On a smaller note, you have <code>$(".anotherdiv").hide();</code> in the first code and <code>$(".another").hide();</code> in the second code, missing the <code>div</code> in the class. Is that a problem?</p>
