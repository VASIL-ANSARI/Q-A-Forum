<p>Confirm that the URL <a href="https://test.com/test/external/v001/Patients/Patient.svc?wsdl" rel="nofollow">https://test.com/test/external/v001/Patients/Patient.svc?wsdl</a> points to a valid WSDL. It may be that your local development station routes this request to a valid WSDL where your Staging server doesn't. For instance, your local hosts file or DNS entry may route test.com requests to a local server rigged for development purposes.</p>
