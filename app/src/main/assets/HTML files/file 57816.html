<p>Pretty unclear to me why this question has a bounty.  Yes, it is a bug as @Matt told you.  He knows, he works on .NET Native.  And he documented the temporary workaround, use an attribute to prevent the method from getting inlined by the optimizer.  A trick that often works to sail around optimizer bugs.</p>

<pre><code>using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
....
    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
    public Rectangle2D Inflate1(double value)
    {
        // etc...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>They'll get it fixed, next major release is the usual promise.</p>
