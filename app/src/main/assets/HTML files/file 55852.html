<p>From a quick glance it looks like</p>

<p><code>&lt;%= link_to "Delete", comment_path, method: :delete %&gt;</code></p>

<p>should be:</p>

<p><code>&lt;%= link_to "Delete", comment_path(comment), method: :delete %&gt;</code></p>

<p>I'm assuming that the problem is that the <code>params[:id]</code> being passed to your comments#destroy is the Subject's id rather than the Comment's id</p>

<p>Also, your destroy method should look something like:</p>

<pre><code>def destroy
    comment = Comment.find(params[:id])
    comment.destroy
    redirect_to somewhere
end
</code></pre>
