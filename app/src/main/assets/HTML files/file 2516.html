<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
based on some answers and comments, I'll go back to my original answer.</p>

<p>I've done it that way too except I would change the readonly to volatile.</p>

<pre><code>private static volatile object padlock = new object();
</code></pre>

<p>The volatile keyword lets the compiler know not to optimize the instruction, which will ensure that the most up to date value is present in the field.</p>
