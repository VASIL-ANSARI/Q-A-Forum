<p>Variables are not objects and mutating an object does not change <em>what</em> the object is. That is, mutating an object will never change which variables evaluate to that object.</p>

<p>The difference between the two methods is that <code>slice!</code> mutates the original string/object (ick!) and <code>slice</code> returns a new string/object <em>without</em> mutating the original (yay!).</p>

<p>In the following <code>X</code> denotes a particular (but arbitrary) string, and <code>Y</code> represents a <em>different</em> particular (but arbitrary) string. Do not confuse <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> with variables; they merely represent different objects to explain the behavior.</p>

<pre><code>a = X                # a = X
b = a                # b = a -&gt; b = X, so b = X
b.slice!(0)          # MUTATE object X

p a.object_id # (1)  # a = X
p b.object_id # (2)  # b = X

b = b                # b = b -&gt; b = X, so b = X (no effect)

p a.object_id # (3)  # a = X
p b.object_id # (4)  # b = X

b = b.slice(0)       # b = f(b), where NEW object (Y) is returned, so b = Y

p a.object_id # (5)  # a = X
p b.object_id # (6)  # b = Y
</code></pre>
