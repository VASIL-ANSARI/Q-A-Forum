  <p>Okay so i'm looking for a way to encrypt/decrypt larger files using RSA and AES. I don't quite understand what I need to do...</p>

<p>All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate random AES key</li>
<li>Encrypt large file under AES key</li>
<li>Encrypt AES key under RSA key</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, encryption alone is usually not enough. That means your choice of AES/CFB could be improved. That's because CFB (and other modes like CBC) provide confidentiality only. You cannot detect accidental and malicious tampering.</p>

<p>To improve upon the mode, you should select a mode that provides confidentiality and authenticity. AES/GCM would be a good choice. There's an example of it on the OpenSSL wiki at <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Authenticated_Encryption_and_Decryption" rel="nofollow">EVP Authenticated Encryption and Decryption</a>.</p>

<p>You can read more about Authenticated Encryption on the Crypto++ wiki at <a href="http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Authenticated_Encryption" rel="nofollow">Authenticated Encryption</a>. Its a different library and different wiki, but it provides the information on authenticated encryption.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, OpenSSL would provide an Integrated Encryption Scheme like Shoup's <a href="http://www.shoup.net/papers/iso-2_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme</a> (ECIES) or Abdalla, Bellare and Rogaway's <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/dhies.html" rel="nofollow">Diffie-Hellman Authenticated Encryption Scheme</a> (DHAES). An integrated encryption schemes does it all for you.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="http://www.cryptopp.com" rel="nofollow">Crypto++</a> is a C++ crypto library that provides both integrated encryption schemes. Maybe you should consider switching security libraries. Here's the documentation with sample code on <a href="http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Ecies" rel="nofollow">ECIES</a>.</p>
