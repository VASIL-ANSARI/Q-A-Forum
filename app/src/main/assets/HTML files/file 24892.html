<p>PHP is single threaded (well, not entirely, but thats out of scope).</p>

<p>If you want to spawn a seperate process, you will have to use PHP cli (executable php) by using ie. <code>exec()</code>(<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php</a>). Ofcourse this does mean you need to have exec enabled in the php configuration.</p>

<p>So instead of the include, use <code>exec('/usr/bin/php script.php  &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;');</code></p>

<p>Ofcourse the path of <code>/usr/bin/php</code> should point to the php executable on the filessystem.</p>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> makes the process go in the background, causing the main script to continue.</p>

<p>The <code>&gt; /dev/null</code> bit causes the output to go into nothingness.
The <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> it causes errors to also go into nothingness (so be sure to find another way to log)</p>

<p>Both are neccesary, since you have no way to catch output once you toss the script into the background.</p>

<p>Also read the "see also" bit of <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php</a> for other options like passthru, system etc. What you need to use depends on what you need exactly..</p>
