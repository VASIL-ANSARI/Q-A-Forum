<p>It's been a long time since I did anything in Pygame, but IIRC the basic idea is that your sprite should have a <code>rect</code> <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html">attribute</a> that describes its position on the screen.  When you receive a mouse click event, you <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html#pygame.mouse.get_pos">get the position</a> by calling <code>pygame.mouse.get_pos()</code>.  You can then <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.collide_rect">check for a collision</a> between a <code>rect</code> centered at the mouse position and your sprite's rect by calling <code>pygame.sprite.collide_rect()</code> on both <code>rect</code> objects.</p>

<p>A good example can be found <a href="http://rene.f0o.com/mywiki/LectureFour">here</a>.</p>
