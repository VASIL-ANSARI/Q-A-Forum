<p>Ok I found it..</p>

<pre><code>  {
   featureType: "administrative.locality",
               elementType: "labels.icon",

               stylers: [
                 { visibility: "on" }
    ]
     }
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing is that it shows a lot of big cities not just capitals. If anyone knows a closer approach it would help.</p>
