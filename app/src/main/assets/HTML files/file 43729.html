<p>If the native app is not installed, the only other way to share a bitmap is to get <code>publish_actions</code> permission from the user, and do a POST to me/photos (you can use the ShareApi class to do the actual post for you, but you still need to ask for the permission from the user). Unfortunately, the web-based dialogs do not support uploading binary data.</p>
