<p>There isn't any magic involved, and it won't work for you in general.</p>

<p>As you can see <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html#method-c-table">from the source</a>, <code>table</code> literally just calls <code>read</code> with <code>headers: true</code>. But it also converts the header to symbols (<code>header_converters: :symbol</code>) and this is the key to why it appears to work.</p>

<p>You get an error without headers because you have a blank column in your first row of data (something like <code>a,b,,d,e</code>). The blank gets read in as <code>nil</code>, and since <code>nil</code> can't be converted to a symbol, it blows up.</p>

<p>Try it with some data that doesn't have a blank in the first row - you'll see that <code>table</code> will treat that row of data as headers just like any of the other methods.</p>
