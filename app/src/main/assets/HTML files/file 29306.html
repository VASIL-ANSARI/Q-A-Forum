<p>I had similar issue with loading from database. It runs extremely slow on my EasyPHP local environment... however when I have uploaded it on remote hosting server problem was already gone. So if your EasyPHP run your application slow... dot't wary too much, it will run OK on real server.</p>

<p>If you really can not last this lag wile developing locally use XAMPP environment instead.
