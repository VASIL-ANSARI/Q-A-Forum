<p>Could you please provide table definition?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    DISTINCT BatchNo as BN, 
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT BatchNo SEPARATOR ', ') AS picklists, 
    web_company_name
FROM PickBatch
LEFT JOIN customer_master ON customer_master.VC_CUSTOMER_CODE = PickBatch.Customer
WHERE PickBatch.BN &lt;&gt;      (SELECT frombatch 
                            FROM invoice_web_order 
                            WHERE FIND_IN_SET(PickBatch.BN, frombatch)
                            LIMIT 1)
GROUP BY Customer
