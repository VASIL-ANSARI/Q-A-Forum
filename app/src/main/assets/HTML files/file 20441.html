<p>How about a modal iframe? You can use facebooks sharer. You can use any button you want to open up the dialog. The problem is that this uses a facebook page, so you have to merge it into you design with some iframe or you must use a popup</p>

<pre><code>https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=[the-link-you-want-to-share]
</code></pre>

<p>Also facebooks documentation is also very well done</p>
