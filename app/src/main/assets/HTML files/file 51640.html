<p>EWS is limited in what it can do with Accessing to the Directory there are 2 EWS operations ResolveName <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn645423%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn645423%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx</a> and ExpandGroup <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn629392(v=exchg.150).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn629392(v=exchg.150).aspx</a> that give limited address book function. On 2013 there is FindPeople <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj191039(v=exchg.150).aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj191039(v=exchg.150).aspx</a> which can do a lot more. I would suggest you start with these write some code yourself to see how they work.</p>

<p>All the directory information that Exchange accesses in the Global Address list is in Active Directory so I  you will most probably need to use LDAP directory to Access Active Directory if you application needs more complex directory access.</p>
