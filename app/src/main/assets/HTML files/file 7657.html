<p>Yes, a service with an empty response is not the same as a service with no response (a One-Way service). One way services themselves have no answer (and usually can't serve meaningful faults either), but that does not seem to be your case, so you'd still need a SendReply activity with the empty response, as the client expects it.</p>
