<p>Your clone method is wrong because it's not really cloning anything, it's just returning the same object.  The <code>clone</code> should always be a <strong>new</strong> object with the same values as the original.  </p>

<p>In this case it looks like you already have a copy constructor, so just use that to create the new <code>Calle</code> and return it.</p>

<pre><code>public Object clone(){
    return new Calle(this.nombre, this.addr);
}
</code></pre>
