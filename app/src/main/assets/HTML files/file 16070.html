<p>If you are sure the keys are correct I would advise you check the application settings within twitter to ensure that write mode is enabled.</p>

<p>Under the applications settings make sure the application type access is set to</p>

  <p>Read, Write and Access direct messages</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Or at least Read/Write)</em> </p>
