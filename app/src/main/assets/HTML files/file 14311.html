<p>In Joomla 1.5 I don't think you need the underscore(s) but I'm not sure whether that is the cause of the language lookup during installation - more likely the point I raise below.</p>

<p>The two most useful references for language files I can find are:
<a href="http://docs.joomla.org/Specification_of_language_files" rel="nofollow">http://docs.joomla.org/Specification_of_language_files</a>  (for all Joomla versions)
<a href="http://docs.joomla.org/Creating_a_language_definition_file" rel="nofollow">http://docs.joomla.org/Creating_a_language_definition_file</a> (for 1.5 only)</p>

<p>One potential problem is that during the installation process Joomla looks for a .sys.ini file for language translations, whereas in normal use it uses the .ini file. Modules though don't use .sys.ini files - or at least I don't see mention of them anywhere in the documentation for module building in J1.5</p>
