<p>The javac and jar commands will compile Java code and create jar files.  Your source code has to be in a directory structure that matches the structure of the packages.  This means that the directory java/awt would contain the java.awt package source files.  Many years ago, I used a set of UNIX script files to compile and package my Java code, but this was before I had worked with Eclipse.</p>
