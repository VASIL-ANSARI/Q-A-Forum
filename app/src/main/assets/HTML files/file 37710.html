<p>To directly answer your question, no, there is no known bug in the scrollbar code. This code has been in use for more than a decade without anyone reporting issues with the trough. That doesn't mean a bug isn't possible, but it is highly unlikely. There also doesn't appear to be any problems with how you defined the scrollbar or how you attached it to the text widget. .</p>

<p>Based on comments to the original question, it sounds like you have some bindings in your app that may be interfering with the default behavior of the scrollbar. </p>
