<p>You could check for spaces seperately before and after the seperating charactors.</p>

<pre><code>[(]?[2-9]{1}[0-9]{2}[ ]?[)-.,]?[ ]?[2-9]{1}[0-9]{2}[ ]?[-.,]?[ ]?[0-9]{4}
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind, this wont actually match the parens so something like <code>(234-567, 1234</code> would match. So if you want more strict matching, you will need a much more complicated regex or code the validation using something else.</p>
