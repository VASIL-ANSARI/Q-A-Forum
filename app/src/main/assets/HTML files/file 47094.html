<p>You can use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/53seyfee%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>FieldInfo fi = typeof(MainWindow).GetField("fieldname");</code></a> to get a <code>FieldInfo</code> object. Then call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.fieldinfo.getvalue%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>fi.GetValue(w);</code></a> to get the value. The same principle applies for all sorts of members and operations on them.</p>

<p>This is slow at runtime and makes it harder to catch errors at compile time, so make sure you have a very good reason to use reflection here!</p>
