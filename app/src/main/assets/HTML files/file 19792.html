<p>Based on your sample code I presume you're using <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/sqlite-net">sqlite-net</a>.</p>

<p>Sqlite-net is not a real ORM - it only has support for basic data types and can't handle your custom types as properties. You can check it your self in <code>SqlType()</code> static method of <code>Orm</code> class (<code>SQLite.cs</code>).</p>

<p>It's not self referencing that's causing problems, it's any references between the classes. Creating tables for the following two classes will fail as well with <code>NotSupportedException</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class CategoryItem
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
}

public class PostItem
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Label { get; set; }
    public List&lt;CategoryItem&gt; Categories { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll need to create your own "database" classes which will map to database tables one-to-one. To handle <code>UserInformationListItem</code> you'll just add it's key value as a property to <code>PostItem</code>. If <code>PostItem</code> and <code>CategoryItem</code> have a many to many relationship you'll need to add a cross-reference table as well.</p>
