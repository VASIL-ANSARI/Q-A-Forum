<p>Finally figured it out. The fragment's OnStart() method is always called when the Activity gets focus again. Therefore, all the views get initialized again. The second time, the onActivityResult adds a third view instead of replacing one of the others and the illegalstateexception is thrown. To fix it, I simply initialized my views in the onActivityCreated() method instead of onStart();</p>
