<p>I dont know much about CorePlot.  But I assume CorePlot provides a view that renders a graph to itself.  If CorePlot doesn't provide a mechanism to get a <code>UIImage</code> of the graph, then you can probably trick CorePlot into drawing into your own Bitmap Graphics Context, from which you can create an image object to save.</p>

<p>Here's the basic approach:</p>

<p>1) create a bitmap graphics context using <code>UIGraphicsBeginImageContext()</code>.  This will also make the context the "current" context.  You could also use <code>CGBitmapContextCreate()</code> but then you'd also have to use <code>UIGraphicsPushContext()</code> to make it current.</p>

<p>2) call the CorePlot view's <code>drawRect:</code> method. </p>

<p>3) get the image from the graphics context using <code>UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()</code></p>

<p>4) clean up with <code>UIGraphicsEndImageContext()</code></p>

<p>5) get your Jpeg bits into a <code>NSData</code> object using <code>UIImageJPEGRepresentation()</code>.</p>

<p>6) save/upload your jpeg using <code>NSData</code> methods (or other..)</p>
