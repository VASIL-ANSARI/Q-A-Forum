<p>This is UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p><code>b0</code> is encoded as <code>c2 b0</code>. <code>a7</code> becomes <code>c2 a7</code>. <code>da</code> becomes <code>c3 9a</code>. <code>7a</code> is not changed.</p>

<p>Thus your <code>b0 a7 da 7a</code> is represented in UTF-8 as <code>c2 b0 c2 a7 c3 9a 7a</code>.</p>

<p>It appears that Javascript is UTF-8-encoding your <code>body</code> variable. You could try using the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.utf8-decode.php" rel="nofollow">utf8_decode function</a> in PHP. </p>
