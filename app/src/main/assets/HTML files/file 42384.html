<p>I know this was asked ages ago - I missed it when it was posted and stumbled on it by chance. The following works for me:</p>

<pre><code>import logging
import subprocess
import sys

class TalkHandler(logging.Handler):
    def emit(self, record):
        msg = self.format(record)
        cmd = ['espeak', '-ven+f3', '-s150', msg]
        p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                             stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        p.communicate()

def configure_logging():
    h = TalkHandler()
    root = logging.getLogger()
    root.addHandler(h)
    root.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

def main():
    logging.info('Hello')
    logging.debug('Goodbye')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    configure_logging()
    sys.exit(main())
</code></pre>

<p>When I run it, I hear "Hello" and then "Goodbye" spoken.</p>
