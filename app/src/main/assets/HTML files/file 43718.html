<p>Answering this mainly for posterity.  Turns out that my problem wasn't HTTP.sys but instead it was ASP.NET.  It opens up a shared lock when it tries to compile files.  This shared lock is identified by <code>System.Web.HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppId</code>.  I believe that since all of my apps are built dynamically from a common <code>applicationHost.config</code> file, they all have the same AppDomainAppId (<code>/LM/W3SVC/1/ROOT</code>).  This means they all share a lock and effectively all page compilation happens sequentially for all of the apps.  However, due to the nature of coming/going from the lock all of the pages tend to finish at the same time because it is unlikely that any of them will get to the end of the process in a timely fashion, causing them all to finish around the same time.  Once one of them makes it through, others are likely close behind and finish just after.</p>
