<p>When you're using the = operator, it sets the right hand side into the left hand side, and the result is the right hand side (which also sets the left hand side).</p>

<p>When you're using the == operator, it checks whether the right hand side equals the left hand side, and the result is a bool (true/false).</p>

<pre><code>int i = 10;
int j = 40;

Console.WriteLine(i == j); // false
Console.WriteLine(i); // 10
Console.WriteLine(j); // 40
Console.WriteLine(i = j); // 40
Console.WriteLine(i); // 40
Console.WriteLine(i == j); // true
</code></pre>

<p>So in the beginning, you are setting the SelectedIndex to 0, which you probably don't want to do, because you want to know which index is selected by the user.</p>

<p>So if you're changing the SelectedIndex, you won't be able to know what the user selected.</p>

<p>The condition you need is this:</p>

<pre><code>if (comboBox1.SelectedIndex == 0)
{
    // Selected item is item 0
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you're doing this:</p>

<pre><code>if (comboBox1.SelectedIndex = 0)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>What actually happens is that SelectedIndex is set to 0, and then the compiler tries to cast 0 to a boolean (because it is inside an if condition), which will result with a compilation error.</p>
