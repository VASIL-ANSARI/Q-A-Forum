<p>Your code is legal, even though GCC claims otherwise.  It takes offense at this funny-looking declaration:</p>

<pre><code>D() noexcept(noexcept(D{42}));
</code></pre>

<p>The outermost <code>noexcept</code> is a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec">noexcept specifier</a>, stating that <code>D::D()</code> is noexcept if and only if its constant-expression argument evaluates to true.  The inner <code>noexcept</code> is a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept">noexcept operator</a> that checks at compile time whether its argument expression, which is not actually evaluated, throws no exceptions.  Because <code>D::D(int)</code> is noexcept (inherited from B), this should be true.</p>

<p>cppreference.com explicitly notes that using the operator inside the specifier is allowed (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The noexcept operator performs a compile-time check that returns true if an expression is declared to not throw any exceptions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>It can be used within a function template's noexcept specifier to declare that the function will throw exceptions for some types but not others.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the class should be considered <em>complete</em> within the noexcept specifier due to Â§9.2.2 of the Standard (bold emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A class is considered a completely-defined object type (3.9) (or complete type) at the closing <code>}</code> of the <em>class-specifier</em>. <strong>Within the class <em>member-specification</em>, the class is regarded as complete within</strong> function bodies, default arguments, <em>using-declaration</em>s introducing inheriting constructors (12.9), <strong><em>exception-specification</em>s</strong>, and <em>brace-or-equal-initializer</em>s for non-static data members (including such things in nested classes). Otherwise it is regarded as incomplete within its own class <em>member-specification</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Â§15.4.1 defines an <em>exception-specification</em> as the following grammar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>exception-specification</em>:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p><em>dynamic-exception-specification</em></p></li>
  <li><p><em>noexcept-specification</em></p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So GCC should not reject your code.</p>
