<p>As a standard practice I follow your 2nd example only using 'readonly' when the object is public or <em>vulnerable</em> to inadvertent tampering. I am using the 'agreed immutability' model in a current project building a plugin framework. Obviously, with agreed immutability, the <code>readonly</code> protection is removed.</p>

<p>Only in rare circumstances do I expose a field - public, internal, or otherwise. It just doesn't feel right unless writing a property {get;} takes more time than I'm willing to give.</p>
