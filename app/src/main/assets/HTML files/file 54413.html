<p>Considering that there is no instance method with that name in the <code>System.String</code> class (the most similar by name is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.isnullorwhitespace(v=vs.110).aspx"><code>String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace</code></a> that is <code>static</code>, while you are using your method on a <code>txtRule.Text</code> that is a <code>System.String</code>), then probably that is an extension method written by someone where you work. Try doing a Go To Definition and check.</p>
