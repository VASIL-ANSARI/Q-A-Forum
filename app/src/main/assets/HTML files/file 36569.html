<p>Maybe <em>ObservableCollection</em> is what you are looking for ? You can bind it to a view with CollectionChanged Events and so on.</p>

<p>And i dont know the Caliburn.Micro BindableCollection but mainly you should use an IObserable inheriting collection in ViewModel and an IList or ICollection in model.</p>

<p>When your ViewModel is loading data, you cann easily create an ObservableCollection with an IList or ICollection by constructor.</p>

<p>I Hope this helps.</p>

<pre class="lang-cs prettyprint-override"><code>var myObservableList = new ObservableCollection&lt;MyModelType&gt;(myModel.NiceList);
</code></pre>
