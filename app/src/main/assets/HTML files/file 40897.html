<p>The macro <code>IS_WIDESCREEN</code> is written correctly because it asks the system if it can responds to the message <code>-nativeBounds</code>.<br>
For <code>IS_IPHONE_6</code> and 5 you should write something like the widescreen macro, <code>-nativeBounds</code> was only implemented in iOS8 that's why it crashes if you launch your app on iOS7.<br>
Probably using images asset in Xcode you can achieve what you want by simply creating an images asset that load different image for different screen size.</p>
