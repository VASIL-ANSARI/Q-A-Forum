<p>Well the safest way to check if script is loaded is you can add a simple callback at end of script . Which if exist can be called with some data also to be passed.</p>

<pre><code>if(window.loaded){
  window.loaded(params);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once the script loads it will execute this method which you can declare in your parent script which will be called.</p>

<p>Also you can trigger an event on body and listen on that event in other parent code.</p>
