<p>If you want it across each row, why not make it the table background instead and repeat it in the y-axis?</p>

<pre><code>table {
    width: 300px;
    background-image: url('mypic.jpg');
    background-repeat: repeat-y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>BTW I tested your code with IE9, FF12 - those are showing the image once per row. But Chrome 15 &amp; Safari 5 is repeating it for each td.</p>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>Since you only wanted it in the first-row, you should use background-position to make sure the image stays at the top of the table (that's usually where the first row is, right? :P)</p>

<pre><code>table {
    width: 300px;
    background-image: url('mypic.png');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center top;
}
</code></pre>
