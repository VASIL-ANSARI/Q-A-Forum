<p>use the <code>association_ids</code> approach.  Instead of looking for a list cuisines and then assigning them to the user, just get a list of their ids and assign it to <code>user.cuisine_ids</code>.  Saving the record will generate the association records for you.  Since you're using checkboxes, be wary of the scenario where a user unchecks everything and then saves.  What usually happens is no change is saved keeping the old selected cuisines selected.  This can be easily fixed by adding a <code>nil</code> hidden value with the same name as the checkboxes.</p>
