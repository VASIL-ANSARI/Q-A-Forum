<p>The idea that any Magento updates SHOULD NOT include SQL is based on the idea that </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Magento Objects provide abstractions on top of you database/datastore layer</p></li>
<li><p>You should use the abstractions to update Magento, which ensures if the Magento team changes how the objects interact with the datastore, your updates will still work (assuming the core team maintains the original "contracts" implied by the Object methods)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, the problem is an <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement <strong>directly changes</strong> the datastore.  If you subscribe exclusively to the above two ideas, you should never be changing the data store. (which, in the case of adding a column or an index means using EAV models exclusively, using the Setup Resources to manage changes, and accepting Magento's indexing).</p>

<p>A good general rule of thumb is, if you're changing or adding onto some core Magento functionality (Products, Reviews, etc.), stay away from directly changing the database structure unless you're willing to carefully manage it during upgrades.  </p>

<p>If you're building new objects and functionality use whatever SQL you want to create and change your tables via Setup Resources.  If you look at the installer/upgrade files you can see that the core Magento team does this themselves.</p>
