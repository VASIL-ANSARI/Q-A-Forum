<p>Jython should be part of your runtime server in Anypoint Studio. Check for it in the Package Explorer and the Mule Server 3.7.0 library icon (books). The enterprise runtime should have it but if you're using the community edition it's not there.</p>

<p>E.g. version 3.7.2 EE contains jython-standalone-2.7.0 but it may not be as easy as adding this JAR to the library. </p>

<p>First Answer: Community edition doesn't support your need.</p>

<p>Second Answer: Try adding jython-standalone-2.7.0 to your server library (runtime ESB) not the project dependencies.</p>
