<p>You're trying to import a C-style function from your .NET dll - this doesn't really have anything to do with COM interop. COM interop allows you to activate your .NET objects as COM objects, it doesn't expose them as C/C++ exported functions/types.</p>

<p>If your function doesn't need to return any data, why not make a simple .exe that calls your function and just run that from your setup?</p>

<p>Also: See the <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/newsgroups.php" rel="nofollow">innosetup support newsgroups</a> where you might get better support.</p>
