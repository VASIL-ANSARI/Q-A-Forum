<p>Short answer: Unless you're coding for Win98, use <code>wchar_t</code> instead of <code>TCHAR</code> and <code>wcout</code> instead of <code>cout</code></p>

<p>Long version: </p>

<p>The <code>TCHAR</code> type exists to allow for code to be compiled in multiple string modes.  For example supporting ASCII and Unicode.  The <code>TCHAR</code> type will conditionally compile to the appropriate character type based no the setting.  </p>

<p>All new Win systems are Unicode based.  When ASCII strings are passed to OS functions, they are converted to unicode and the call the real function.  So it's best to just use Unicode throughout your application. </p>
