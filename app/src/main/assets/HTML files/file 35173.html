<p>Assuming the session has indeed stored the data of the logged-in user, you need to change "welcome.php" so it reads the correct user with a <code>WHERE</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

// Retrieve the ID of the user (and untaint it too)
$id = (int) $_SESSION['id']; 

//  Connect to the database (I've removed the unnecessary quotes)
$db = mysql_connect($Sname, $Uname, $Pname) or die("Could not connect to the Database."); 
$select = mysql_select_db($Dname) or die("Could not select the Database."); 

// Here is the query from the users table, we're selecting one user here
$sql="SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `id` = $id;"; 
$result = mysql_query($sql);
$rows = mysql_fetch_array($result);

?&gt;

&lt;!-- Let's see what is in rows now, should be just one record --&gt;
&lt;?php print_r($rows) ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I would advise that you try to understand each part of the code above, and indeed the same for the code you have - don't just copy-and-paste without knowing what each bit does. If you get stuck on something, don't be afraid to look it up in the manual!</p>

<p>I've used <code>print_r</code> to just dump the row result - you can use the contents of that to determine what columns and other data you wish to extract out of it. After you have done that, the <code>print_r</code> can be removed.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that your login is not testing for password correctness - it only checks that someone has entered a particular username in login.php. If you want users to log on with a username and password, that needs to be designed and implemented as well. There are many questions on this site with best-practice techniques on how to do that, if that's of interest to you.</p>

<p>It has, incidentally, been rather difficult to understand what you are doing. I don't think this is a problem with your English, which seems fine to me. Rather, it's worth remembering to write in short sentences (no more than 20 words, say) and short paragraphs (no more than 4 or 5 sentences). And keep your descriptions as short as you can - it makes the difference between people helping you and their deciding they don't understand what you are trying to do. I expect this advice would be just as relevant in your native language as well!</p>

<p>Also, remember to add as much useful information to a question as you can, and if people ask for clarification, make sure you answer all their questions. Remember that people here are volunteers, and you need to make their job as easy as possible.</p>
