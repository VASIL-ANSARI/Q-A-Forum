<p>Edit: Thought JS closed over values, not variables.</p>

<p>JSLint is complaining because it doesn't see the variable hoisting going on. Just define functions that are used by other functions before functions that use them. It helps make your code more readable, and shuts JSLint up.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var MyNamespace = new function () {
    var bar = function () {
        alert("bar");
    };

    var foo = function () {
        bar();
    };

    this.init = function () {
        foo();
    };
};
</code></pre>
