<p>Friend it's very simple..
we need to get the particular text box it..</p>

<p>for example,</p>

<p>your cost row text box id is 101, in this case 01 is constant, and 1 is applied to change then</p>

<p>write on on change function some thing like this</p>

<pre><code>function getid(obj){
   var i = obj.id.split("01")[0];
   var val = obj.value;
   //now comes to calculation part
   var total += val;
}
</code></pre>
