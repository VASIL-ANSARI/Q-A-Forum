<p>If you want to rotate around the center of something you could find the center point by by using <a href="http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Math/Box3" rel="nofollow">a bounding box object (<code>THREE.Box3</code>)</a>.</p>

<p>For example to find the middle of some mesh:</p>

<pre><code>var boundingBox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject( mesh );
var center = boundingBox.center();
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use this center point for rotating.
Hope this will help you a bit to build a nice solution for your Rubik's cube</p>
