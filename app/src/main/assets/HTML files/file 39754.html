<p>I would do this by serializing the json into a c# complex object, where you can have null checking. The  reason why you are getting the error is because you are assigning a value that doesn't exist to the variable.</p>

<p>This is Microsoft's example of serialization if it is from a service: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb412179%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb412179%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>or if you just want to serialize a json string that you already have, use javascriptserializer:
