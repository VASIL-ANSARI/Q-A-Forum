<p>Well you've got 3 timeouts on your hands there.</p>

<ol>
<li>CURLOPT_TIMEOUT - how long the
entire operation is taking</li>
<li>CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT - how long
cURL waits for the host to respond
to its request</li>
<li>DNS Lookup Timeout -
what you are experiencing, the DNS
query fails and takes a certain time
to do this</li>
</ol>

<p>cURL in PHP does not have a default method for setting this timeout, I would suggest resolving the hostname using another method with a timeout, and then passing the IP to cURL.</p>
