<p>Profiling tests is a bit tricky affair due to number of factors involved like effects of parallel test execution or sequence of test execution . You can get an overall picture for memory or cpu by having the visualvm (or even jconsole ) monitoring on your tests . For getting  statistics for individual tests i believe you need to have a professional profiler (i am not aware about any open source tools to do that ) . I don't prefer intrusive profilers for performance tests , hence you can also get an overall picture of the CPU samples during the tests using Hprof as well . </p>

<p>Having said that  nowadays most ides have pretty good profilers (or at least profiler  plug-in) and if you are required to give a rough estimate of the cpu and memory numbers you can use them as well .</p>
