<p>I think first you need to transfer the script to the remote hosts and then run it:</p>

<pre><code>---
 - hosts: droplets
   remote_user: root

   tasks:
   - name: copy the script to the remote host
     copy:
       src: userfind.py
       dest: /tmp/userfind.py
       mode: 0777

   - name: Run python script
     command: python /tmp/userfind.py
</code></pre>

<p>Fix the path as per your requirement</p>
