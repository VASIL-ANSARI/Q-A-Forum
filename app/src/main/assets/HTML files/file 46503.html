<p>Actually both approach are used in production. HTML is just your markup, it can be static or dynamically created with JS but data is, most of the times, dynamic.</p>

<p>Now, </p>

<ol>
<li>when you are loading your table for the 1st time, say at page load, you can either send static html table from server and then loop through each table rows to fill in the data or you can do the same thing from JS. </li>
</ol>

<p><em>(And yes, it is perfectly normal to put your html in your scripts if you know what you are doing and why you are doing so.)</em></p>

<ol start="2">
<li>when you are just updating values in your table say via ajax calls, you will only loop through the table (which is already there from point 1) rows and populate them.</li>
</ol>

<p>See this <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/0fuv6xq6/" rel="nofollow">js fiddle</a> for dynamically creating html table using js</p>

<p>HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id="myTable"&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JS</p>

<pre><code>function buildTable () {
    var htm = '';
    //the row counter loop
    for (var i=1; i&lt;=10; i++) {
        htm += '&lt;tr&gt;';

        //the columns in each row
        for(var j=1; j&lt;=10; j++) {
        htm += '&lt;td&gt; Row=' + i + ' Column=' + j + ' &lt;/td&gt;'; 
        }
        htm += '&lt;/tr&gt;';
    }

    //add the rows inside the table
    document.getElementById('myTable').innerHTML = htm;
}

document.onready = buildTable();
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>*************** <strong>EDIT / EXPLANATION</strong> ********************</p>

<p>My <strong>buildTable</strong> function is same as your <strong>init</strong> function.</p>

<p>Now, your code will not give desired result because in your code you are using 2 for loops separately. You first need to understand the basics of coding and logic and how to use for loops.</p>

<p>My approach is very simple,
take a string variable, <code>var htm = '';</code></p>

<p>Now start adding HTML to it.</p>

<p>The 1st for loop will make the rows<code>(&lt;tr&gt;)</code> in table and the 2nd <em>nested for loop</em> will create columns <code>(&lt;td&gt;)</code> in each row. And it will keep appending to the string variable <code>htm</code> </p>

<p>And when all the for loops are done, we will have our <code>htm</code> variable with all the HTML that needs to go inside  and </p>

<p>so we put the htm content in the innerHTML of our table, by doing,</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('myTable').innerHTML = htm;
</code></pre>

<p>Now tell me which part actually you didn't understand?</p>

<p>You seem to be just starting out with coding and logic. You 1st need to practice some basics of HTML and JavaScripts and then these will all come to you very easily.</p>
