<p>For something built-in, you have <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html" rel="nofollow">difflib</a>.</p>

<p>It can (as said in the docs): Return a list of the best âgood enoughâ matches. word is a sequence for which close matches are desired (typically a string), and possibilities is a list of sequences against which to match word (typically a list of strings).</p>

<p>The example in the docs is:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from difflib import get_close_matches
&gt;&gt;&gt; get_close_matches('appel', ['ape', 'apple', 'peach', 'puppy'])
['apple', 'ape']
</code></pre>
