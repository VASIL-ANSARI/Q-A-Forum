<p>If you have to, maybe try browser-end resizing of some sort via Javascript or CSS (e.g. <a href="http://atomgiant.com/2006/05/30/resize-images-with-javascript/" rel="nofollow">http://atomgiant.com/2006/05/30/resize-images-with-javascript/</a>). But sending images that large over the wire will probably result in a pretty s l o w user experience -- if you have any control over the web server involved, or if you're using a service that provides images in scaled sizes as well, try sending a smaller version in the first place.</p>
