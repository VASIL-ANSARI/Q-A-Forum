<p>Are you trying to detect exact-identicals, or detect near-identicals/ approximate matches (which is what real OCR is about)?</p>

<p>You may as well start by finding a weighted center of the image/glyph, perhaps scaling size for comparability (if you have to match at different sizes), and then comparing pixel-to-pixel similarity (as % similarity) between the two images.</p>

<p>Of course if the images are all cropped &amp; sized for you then you just have to scan the images comparing all pixels, to achieve a brute-force "similarity" measure.</p>

<p>See BufferedImage.getRGB():  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/image/BufferedImage.html#getRGB(int,%20int)" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/image/BufferedImage.html#getRGB(int,%20int)</a></p>

<p>You can write a function to take two RGB pixel values (as ints up to 0xffffff), separate the components, &amp; sum the component differences.</p>
