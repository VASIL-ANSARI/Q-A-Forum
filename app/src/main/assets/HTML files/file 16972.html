<p>First of all, check if wordpress is already including jquery. It should, since you're mentioning that there are other plugins trying to use it.</p>

<p>Then, remove the jquery.min.js call from the header and the footer if present, and replace $() instructions with jQuery(). For example, now you have </p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
                $('a.normalTip').aToolTip();
</code></pre>

<p>It should be</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function(){
                jQuery('a.normalTip').aToolTip();
</code></pre>

<p>This is because jquery is always included in conflict mode "on", to avoid conflicts with any other javascript library.</p>
