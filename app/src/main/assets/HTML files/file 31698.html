<p>This here is <strike>a recipe for <em>undefined behaviour</em> (UB)</strike> some illegal code which should not compile on a standards compliant implementation. You cannot take the address of a temporary:</p>

<pre><code>SomeStruct *structure = &amp;SomeStruct();
</code></pre>

<p>GCC produces the following output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>error: taking address of temporary [-fpermissive]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your compiler accepts this, it may leave you with a dangling pointer. De-referencing that would be undefined behaviour. </p>

<p>Note that none of this is related to multi-threading.</p>
