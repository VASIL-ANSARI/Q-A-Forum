<p>When running PHP scripts from the CLI you will need to specify the PHP binary you want to use since by default <code>php</code> will be the default PHP included with OS X, not the one installed with MAMP.</p>

<p>So instead of:</p>

<p><code>user$ php script.php</code></p>

<p>try:</p>

<p><code>user$ /Applications/MAMP/bin/php script.php</code></p>

<p>Obviously you will need to adjust the above with the path to where the MAMP PHP binary is located.</p>
