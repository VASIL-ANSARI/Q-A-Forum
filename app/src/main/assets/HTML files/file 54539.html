<p>You have some alternatives:</p>

<p>1) Use a local database (I suggest greendao for the great performance). <a href="http://greenrobot.org" rel="nofollow">Here's the oficial page</a></p>

<p>That way like in a conventional database you store (in the OnPause method) the data and query it the next time the user opens the app.</p>

<p>2) Use serialization (its convenient for small amount of data), as the previous one in the onPause method you serialize the object and deserialize it when the users open the app. <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_serialization.htm" rel="nofollow">Here's a tutorial about it</a></p>
