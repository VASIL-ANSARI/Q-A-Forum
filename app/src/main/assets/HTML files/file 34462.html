<p>This is the case purely because Python defines it to be the case. A negative index is treated as counting from the end of the list (or string, or tuple) instead of the start. To quote <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>, referring to <code>my_list[i]</code>, and extended forms <code>my_list[i:j]</code> and <code>my_list[i:j:k]</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If <code>i</code> or <code>j</code> is negative, the index is relative to the end of the string:
  <code>len(s) + i</code> or <code>len(s) + j</code> is substituted. But note that -0 is still 0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most third-party types implementing the sequence protocol behave the same way, but note that they are not <em>obliged</em> to - it is only guaranteed behavior for the built-in sequences.</p>
