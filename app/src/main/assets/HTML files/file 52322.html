<p>The easiest way to just hide the previous button I can think of is this, create a class extend MediaController and override the setAnchorView method but call the super method before doing anything in this method, then just hide the previous button.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void setAnchorView(View view) {
    super.setAnchorView(view);
    findViewById(com.android.internal.R.id.prev).setVisibility(GONE);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't got the time to test this, but you can give this a try</p>
