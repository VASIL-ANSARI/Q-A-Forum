<p>The easiest way to solve your issue is to write the avatar image out to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionScenarios.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH21-SW6" rel="nofollow">App Group</a> directory instead of the Documents directory in the iOS app. Then you can load the avatar image from the App Group file system directly from the Watch Extension. In order to do this, you'll need to make the following changes.</p>

<h3>Step by Step</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add an App Group to your iOS app and Watch Extension</li>
<li>Write the avatar image to the App Group instead of the Documents directory</li>
<li>Read the avatar image out of the App Group in the Watch Extension</li>
<li>Push the avatar image into the <code>WKInterfaceDevice</code> shared image cache</li>
<li>Apply the image to either a <code>WKInterfaceImage</code> or <code>WKInterfaceGroup</code> to be displayed</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully that helps make things a bit more clear.</p>
