  <p>First question, is it bad to make so many method calls to server to update a portion at a time? Should I just put a save button (ew!) and do a single mass update?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to avoid massive clicks from a single user, use <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/ddp-rate-limiter" rel="nofollow">ddp-rate-limiter package</a> and create a rule for your method. With this package you can limit the calls on the server by a time period.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second question, if I were to keep the same method code as is but add a this.unblock or Meteor.defer, how do I do that to a validated method? I tried putting it after run, before run, before the whole block...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ValidatedMethod <code>run</code> function works the same way as a method function. So your just need to add <code>this.unblock</code> inside the <code>run</code> function.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
