<p>I found out that you do not actually "get" the pending intent...you have to recreate it exactly as it was when you first created it(Intent as well) and then pass it to the AlarmManager's cancel function.  So the above code I posted really is not incorrect as long as thats how I first created it.  Hopefully someone will find this helpful.</p>
