<p>How do you get the localized <code>names</code> from the CoreData entity? It's not that <code>localizedCompare:</code> magically retrieves the localized version of strings and compare them. Instead, it uses the localized sort orders to the same strings. 
The sorted version of an array containing <code>@"England"</code>, <code>@"France"</code>, <code>@"Germany"</code> would be the same in any country... they don't contain any accented characters or whatever. The result of <code>localizedCompare:</code> can only change when two languages use different sort order among letters.</p>

<p>If you want to retrieve something from <code>Localizable.strings</code> based on the property of the CoreData entities, you need to do that manually. Sqlite backend of CoreData won't handle that at the level of fetch requests. So you need to first fetch the entries in an <code>NSArray</code>, and then need to sort them using <code>sortedArrayUsing...:</code> by passing a method which retrieves the localized names by <code>NSLocalizedString</code> and compares them.</p>
