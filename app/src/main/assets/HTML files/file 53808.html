<p>I figured out what was wrong, it was when I was setting my position at the end.  The code below needed to be called before the IF statement to check for my mouse click input.</p>

<pre><code>_transform.position = Ball.transform.position + _offset;
</code></pre>

<p>The correct way is in the code below.</p>

<pre><code>void LateUpdate()
{
    _transform.position = Ball.transform.position + _offset;
    if (Input.GetMouseButton(1))
    {
        _transform.RotateAround(Ball.transform.position, Vector3.up, 20 * Time.deltaTime);
        _offset = _transform.position - Ball.transform.position;
    }
}
</code></pre>
