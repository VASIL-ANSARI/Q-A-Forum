<p>I shouldn't ask questions when I'm this tired. The reason that this doesn't work (<a href="http://camel.apache.org/file2.html" rel="nofollow">as clearly stated in the component description</a>) is that the default <code>readLock</code> strategy is <code>markerFile</code> (which needs to write the marker file in the directory). By changing this to <code>readLock=fileLock</code> I no longer need write permissions on the directory to read the file as the file system lock is placed on the file being read.</p>

<p>The working URI is:</p>

<pre><code>file:///tst?delay=10000&amp;idempotent=false&amp;include=fileMatch&amp;noop=true&amp;readLock=fileLock
</code></pre>
