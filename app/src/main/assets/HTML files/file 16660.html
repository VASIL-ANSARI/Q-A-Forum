<p>You have several issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>phantomjs is started in the foreground, which means your php script stops/sleeps until phantomjs stops. Either start the phantomjs service, or run it in the background. See " <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/45953/php-execute-a-background-process">php execute a background process</a> " for an HowTo.</li>
<li>The web server may probably not access the "graphical part" of your operating system, which means it cannot interact with your desktop. This is why the icon does not appear, but phantomjs should still start.</li>
</ol>
