<p>Perhaps <code>arraycopy</code> would have fitted better on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html" rel="nofollow"><code>java.util.Arrays</code></a>, but that class wasn't added until Java 1.2, whereas <code>arraycopy</code> was there at the very beginning of Java. <code>System</code> seems like the next best place to have put it.</p>

<p>Note too that this method is implemented in native code to make it faster, so it is a bit special.</p>
