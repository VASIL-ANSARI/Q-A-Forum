<p>Assuming  <code>i</code> is an <code>int</code>, thanks to truncating integer division, <code>i/13*13 + 1</code> will be 1 for <code>i</code> = 0, 1, 3, .., 12, then skips to 14 for i = 13, 14, 15, ..., 25, then skips to 27, ...</p>

<p>If you want something that's 1 for 1,2,3,..13 and then skips to 14 on 14, use <code>(i-1)/13*13 + 1</code>.</p>
