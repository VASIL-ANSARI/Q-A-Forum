<p>It's not strange - it's called a pivot table </p>

<p>this is one way to go</p>

<pre><code>select  trunc(DateTime) as date , to_char(datetimem,'MON') as month , to_number(to_char(datetime,'yyyy')) as year , PhoneNo, network , 
    sum(case when to_char(DateTime,'hh24') = 0 then 1 else 0 end) as h00, 
    sum(case when to_char(DateTime,'hh24') = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as h01, 
    .. 
    sum(case when to_char(DateTime,'hh24') = 23 then 1 else 0 end) as h23
from    calls_tables
group by trunc(DateTime) , to_char(datetimem,'MON'), to_number(to_char(datetime,'yyyy')) , PhoneNo, network
</code></pre>

<p>11g has a pivot function as well. </p>

<p>You should run a search for it.</p>
