<p>THanks for editing the question with sample code. Here is a solution that sets a trigger when encountering 'BIRT' in a line, and only if set, outputs a line with 'DATE' in it. Note, if you would also only want lines with 'DATE' in it <strong>directly</strong> following the 'BIRT' line, you have to modify the code a bit ;-)</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python
from __future__ import print_function

d = """
0 @I4@ INDI
1 NAME Milo /Vettle/
2 GIVN Milo
2 SURN Vettle
2 _MARNM Vettle
1 SEX M
1 BIRT
2 DATE 23 OCT 1930
1 FAMS @F3@
0 @I5@ INDI
1 NAME Rosy /Huleknberg/
2 GIVN Rosy
2 SURN Huleknberg
2 _MARNM Vettle
1 SEX F
1 BIRT
2 DATE 15 SEP 1928
1 DEAT Y
2 DATE 10 MAR 2010
"""

trigger_found = False
token_trigger = 'BIRT'
token_grep = 'DATE'

for line in d.split('\n'):
    if token_trigger in line:
        trigger_found = True
        continue
    if trigger_found and token_grep in line:
        print(line)
        trigger_found = False
</code></pre>

<p>Test run with Python v2.7.11:</p>

<pre><code>2 DATE 23 OCT 1930
2 DATE 15 SEP 1928
</code></pre>

<p>Same with python v3.</p>

<p>Note: It might also be more robust (given your input as olny sample), to trigger on a token like <code>BIRT</code> (padded with spaces, as the text given in the sample looks like there could be textfields that might have been "entered" containing the "code") as say:</p>

<pre><code>2 GIVN BIRTE
</code></pre>

<p>which is a valid given name. That would not change the output in this sample case, but it would set the "trigger" unintendedly.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> (answering a question in comment):</p>

<p>This line in above snippet:</p>

<pre><code>for line in d.split('\n'):
</code></pre>

<p>creates a list out of the textblock stoerd in <code>d</code>by splitting on newlines.</p>

<p>If you already have a list of lines in a list <code>foo</code>, say because of reading from a file or otherwise, you can instead write:</p>

<pre><code>for line in foo:
</code></pre>

<p>When reading from a file you often have the newline chacter included in the "line" thus you often see <code>s_line = line.strip()</code> short after the for ... loop header to get rid of that one and any white space surrounding the "wanted stuff from that line". HTH</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Good catch from OP. There was a typo in the answer, it was written:</p>

<pre><code>if token_trigger and token_grep in line:
</code></pre>

<p>instead of the correct:</p>

<pre><code>if trigger_found and token_grep in line:
</code></pre>

<p>That way, resetting the trigger to <code>False</code> after successful print of the wanted BIRTH DATE was useless.</p>
