<p>A complete code example would be nice (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>), but let me guess: You are first seeing the two random numbers (from printing them or some other way). Then you call your method. The method draws two <em>new</em> random numbers from <code>thenumber()</code> and <code>thenumber2()</code>. Thatâs the point in (pseudo-)random numbers, you donât the same number each time. So if you drew the numbers 7 and 4 the first time, maybe next time you get 3 and 8, so the product is 24.</p>

<p>There are a couple of possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>When calling <code>thenumber()</code> and <code>thenumber2()</code>, assign the results to two variables. Now you can see which numbers you got. Pass those two numbers into your <code>thefusion</code> method, and it should calculate the expected product.</li>
<li>Rather than <code>Math.random()</code> use the <code>Random</code> class and instantiate it with a known seed. Draw the two numbers from it and inspect them. Make a new <code>Random</code> instance from the same seed and have <code>thefusion()</code> use it. Now it will draw the same two numbers, and you will get the product you expected.</li>
</ol>
