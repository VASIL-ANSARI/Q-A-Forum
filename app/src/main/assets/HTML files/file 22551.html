<p>Am assuming IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 might defer to the ISO C standard...</p>

<p>In case the fopen fails i.e. fd &lt; 0 then the system sets some error codes...
you can check those error codes. In case of file non-existent, the returned error would be</p>

<p>ENOENT
A component of filename does not name an existing file or filename is an empty string.</p>

<p>For point 2: I have been doing logging of certain data in my system by more than 100 processes writing to single file simultaneously but have never seen a merger of records(file is always opened in append mode). i.e. its always like AAAABBBB</p>
