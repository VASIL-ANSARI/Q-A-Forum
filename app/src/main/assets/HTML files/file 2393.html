<p>new does not call the constructor - the compiler does, and the constructor must be accessible to it. Take this simpler code:</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    A() {}
public:
    void * operator new( size_t x ) { return 0; }
};

int main() {
    A* a = new A;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, new is not calling the constructor, but you will still get a "private constructor" error message if you compile it..</p>
