<p>You could use the mysql database as quick lookup for some metadata like date sent, email address, subject or similar as well as a unique id and store everything else related to the mail (like content/attachments) in a nosql database like redis, since you can access those really fast with the unique key.</p>

<p>we are using this approach to store > 8.000.000 emails and the lookup by email-address and/or date is blazing fast due to indexing.</p>

<p>(if you really need to search the mail content (like fulltext search) I would expect other engines like elasticsearch to be more search speed friendly than mysql fulltext searches)</p>
