<p>If I've understood you correctly you want to check if user exist in database?</p>

<p>If so, why didn't you set user field in PermForm (forms.py) as ForeignKey(User)?</p>

<p>And okay, get User you can by this way:</p>

<pre><code>user = User.objects.get(username=form.cleaned_data['user'])
</code></pre>

<p>user's primary key will be <code>user.id</code></p>
