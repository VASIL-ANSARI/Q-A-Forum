<p>You can set up a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerClassReference/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008067-CH1-SW13" rel="nofollow">delegate</a> for the avaudioplayer instance. Then the delegate will be notified whenever the sound has successfully finished playing. Then you can probably restart the player to play again and restart your animation. Just off the top of my head. Look <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerDelegateProtocolReference/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008068-CH1-SW5" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more information.</p>
