<p>If you start the process from with in your Java application (ex. by calling <code>Runtime.exec()</code> or <code>ProcessBuilder.start()</code>) then you have a valid <code>Process</code> reference to it, and you can invoke the <code>destroy()</code> method in <code>Process</code> class to kill that particular process. </p>

<p>But be aware that if the process that you invoke creates new sub-processes, those may not be terminated (see <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4770092">http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4770092</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you want to kill external processes (which you did not spawn from your Java app), then one thing you can do is to call O/S utilities which allow you to do that. For example, you can try a <code>Runtime.exec()</code> on <code>kill</code> command under Unix / Linux and check for return values to ensure that the application was killed or not (0 means success, -1 means error). But that of course will make your application platform dependent.</p>
