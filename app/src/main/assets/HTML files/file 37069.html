<p>Separate your task into 2 steps: </p>

<p>a. getting the list of items in the memory - removing duplicates.</p>

<p>b. putting them into excel.</p>

<hr>

<p>a: Use a sorted linked tree to gather all items, that's how you will find the duplicate fast.</p>

<p>b: Once done with the list - I would write everything to a simple file and import it to excel, rather than try to do it with c++ against excel API.</p>

<p>After your comment- if a memory problem rise, you might want to create a tree per first letter and - use files to store "each list", so you will not get memory overflow...</p>

<p>it is less efficient, but with today's computing power you won't feel it. </p>

<p>Main idea here is to find fast if you have this word on not and if not - add it to the "list". Searching a sorted tree should do the trick. if you want to avoid worst case scenario there is AVL tree if I recall correctly, this tree will remain even no matter the order of the inserts, yet it is harder to code. </p>
