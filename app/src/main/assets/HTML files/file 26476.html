<p>I am not aware of a way of doing this for non touch screen phones.</p>

<p>This is possible to do on touch screen phones  by overriding touchEvent() for the Field.  Look at detecting touchEvent.Click and TouchEvent.Unclick and/or TouchGesture.Hover - in fact Hover is what I think you will hit.  </p>

<p>Assuming it is Hover, then you can get an estimate by obtaining the Hover count, or alternatively, use Click to get a start time and subtract when you get the Hover to see if in fact it has been over two seconds.  </p>

<p>However I have two concerns:</p>

<p>a) This is not very BlackBerry like - pressing and holding is not something that BlackBerry users do very often.  So is this really a good User Experience?</p>

<p>b) If the field already has some touch capability, then you will probably impact on that processing, so you may have to be very careful about what you process (returning true) and what you pass on to super.touchEvent().  </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Note the other answer which suggests using navigationClick/Unclick for non touch phones.  I had not thought of that, and haven't tested it, but it seems like a good option.  Might even work on touch screen phones too rather than using touchEvent - but watch out for Hover being driven.  </p>
