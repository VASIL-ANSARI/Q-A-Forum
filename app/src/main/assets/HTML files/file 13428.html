<p>You can try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>from pydoc import *
import io

d = HTMLDoc()
content = d.docmodule(sys.modules["mymodule"])

f = io.open('./out.html', 'w')
f.write(unicode(content))
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>You now have an HTML file containing the pydoc info. The next trick is to get it into Confluence so that it looks nice. I have so far tried importing it into Microsoft Word as an .rtf, then cut-and-paste into Confluence.</p>
