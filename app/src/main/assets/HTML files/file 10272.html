<p>It's really important that you change the data type of the database field to <code>VARBINARY(MAX)</code>, that way you avoid issues with character encodings and byte combinations that cannot be interpreted as legal characters.</p>

<p>Also, I think the problem is that you are not closing the streams before calling <code>ToArray()</code> method on the <code>MemoryStream</code> in both encrypt and decrypt routines. It's very important to call <code>Close()</code> in the <code>CryptoStream</code> so that <code>FlushFinalBlock()</code> is called and the encryption process writes the final block to the stream.</p>

<p>Try moving the call to <code>MemoryStream.ToArray()</code> to the outer <code>using</code> block, that is, outside the <code>using</code> block of <code>CryptoStream</code>, so that <code>Dispose()</code> is called on the <code>CryptoStream</code> and call <code>MemoryStream.Close()</code> before that.</p>

<p>Another problem with your code is that you are wrapping the <code>CryptoStream</code> with a <code>StreamWriter</code>, which writes the <em>text</em> representation of the object you pass into the <code>Write</code> method.  You should instead write directly to the <code>CryptoStream</code> to avoid any byte to string conversions.</p>
