<p>your responsive works fine (bootstrap I guess). The problem is you have a fixed width in your <code>.slide1, .slide2, .slide3</code> that is messing the 33.3333% width of your <code>col-sm-4</code> . Basically you need to use mediaqueries to adapt your animation.</p>

<p>adding <code>overflow:hidden</code> to <code>col-sm-4</code> will show you better what is happening, and adding to your slides <code>max-width:100%</code>  may be the first steps to fix your web. Later your problem will be the image size</p>
