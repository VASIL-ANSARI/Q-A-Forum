<p>In the case of a directive I usually go through the dom to click the element. in your case here:</p>

<pre><code>it("performs some action when clicked", function() {
    element.find("button").click();

    assert(something);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Calling the handler directly will get you a passing test even if you forget to add the <code>ng-click</code> directive, which is not what I usually want. It also gives you the freedom to rename the handler method without having to adjust the test, thus making it a little less brittle.</p>

<p>If the template is getting very complex and you are tempted to add ids just for testings sake, you might want to consider breaking the directive into multiple ones.</p>
