<p>In order to orchestrate the async behavior of your application (what can be done in parallel, should there be throttling, ..) you should use an existing library like :</p>

<ul>
<li>async - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/async" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/package/async</a> - if you prefer node.js callback style</li>
<li>bluebird - <a href="http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html" rel="nofollow">http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html</a> - if you prefer promises</li>
<li>highland - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/highland" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/package/highland</a> - somewhat hybrid + stream like</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many other libraries that can help you build complex async call graphs.</p>
