<p>If you are not using a GUI-Toolkit like "Swing" then in Java the Listener Pattern is quite common for this kind of task.</p>

<p>That is you have a listener that registers itself at the host, which in turn holds a list of listeners. If the event corresponding to the listener happens, the listeners then get notified.</p>

<p>It is pretty similar to the <a href="http://www.oodesign.com/observer-pattern.html" rel="nofollow">Observer Pattern</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4763225/java-listener-design-pattern-for-subscribing">SO question</a> is helpful.</p>
