<p>They are not equivalent, so you cannot compare them. The second example doesn't work beyond a certain file size and buffer size, because 'totalBytesRead' will overflow the buffer. It also wastes massive amounts of space. Unless you need the file contents in the buffer it is a pointless alternative</p>
