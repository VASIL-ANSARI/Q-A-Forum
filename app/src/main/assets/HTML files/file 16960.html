<p>Qt is mainly used for GUI's, but you can connect some Qt Classes to act like stdin and stdout.</p>

<p>I would read up on at least these three, and if you really don't want to use std::cin and std::cout, I would use QTextStream objects in the same way.</p>

<p><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextstream.html#details" rel="nofollow">QTextStream</a></p>

<p>Here is a chunk of code from the details documentation:</p>

<pre><code>QTextStream stream(stdin);
QString line;
do {
    line = stream.readLine();
} while (!line.isNull());
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qfile.html" rel="nofollow">QFile</a> also has some good information in its documentation.</p>

<p>The only real advantage I would see with using QTextStream instead of the std library functions is to later connect it to your own built in console in your GUI (later) instead of the OS console.</p>

<p>Another way that I get settings and setup information from the user is using <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qsettings.html" rel="nofollow">QSettings</a> and setting the default format to INI and opening the INI file using <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qdesktopservices.html#openUrl" rel="nofollow">QDesktopServices::openUrl()</a>.</p>
