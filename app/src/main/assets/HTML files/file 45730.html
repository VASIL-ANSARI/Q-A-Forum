<p>When you deploy to Azure (Cloud Service, Virtual Machine) there is always the Azure Load Balancer, which sits between your VMs and the Internet. </p>

<p>In order to keep resources equally available to all the cloud users, Azure Load Balancer will kill idle connections. What idle for Azure LB is - default is 4 minutes of no communication sent over established channel. So if you call a web service and there is absolutely no response on the pip for 4 minutes - your connection will get terminated.</p>

<p>You can configure this timeout, but I would really argue the need for keeping connection open that long. Yes, you can do nothing about it, besides looking for a service which has better design  (i.e. either returns responses faster, or implements asynchronous calls where the first call to the service will just give you a task id, using which you can poll periodically to get a result)</p>
