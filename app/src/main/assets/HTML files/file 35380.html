<p>Try to use in php </p>

<pre><code>json_decode(newComposeemail,true);
</code></pre>

<p>Adding true you will get proper Array else it will return Object in php</p>

<p>If there are multiple entries in json , then you will have to loop through the json array, in order to insert multiple entries in DB</p>
