<p>You can have a superclass called <code>Version</code>.<br>
<code>Version1</code> and <code>Version2</code> <strong>extend</strong> this superclass.</p>

<p>Then you can do as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Version version = null; // superclass reference
if (input == 1){
    version = new Version1(); // instance of subclass Version1
}
else{
    version = new Version2(); // instance of subclass Version2
}
// Now you can use the object version.
</code></pre>

<p>This is called <strong>Runtime Polymorphism</strong> in Java - using superclass reference to point to the sub classes. (Because of this, you don't need to know ahead of time which object will be used, as you mentioned in your question :)).</p>

<p>Alternatively, You can also use an <code>Interface</code> called Version instead of the superclass  Version. 
In this case <code>Version1</code> and <code>Version2</code> <strong>implement</strong> <code>Version</code> instead of <strong>extend</strong> it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/>
I suggest you read about <em>Inheritance</em> and <em>Polymorphism</em> in Java.<br>
Also try to clearly understand what are <em>Interfaces</em>, <em>Superclasses</em>, etc.<br>
