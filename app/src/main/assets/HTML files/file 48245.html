<p>You'll need to look for something in the page that you can use to always identify the link. For example, the download link is in a div element with class "download-link". You can parse the HTML for that div, then grab the link from it's child  element. There are other possibilities too. For example, you could look for something unique and constant in the URL of interest and use a regular expression to select for it after grabbing all links from the page.</p>

<p>I'd highly recommend looking into the BeautifulSoup library, which will allow you to easily parse HTML.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Okay, I didn't notice this because I initially looked at the page in my browser, but apparently mediafire only populates the download div with javascript after the page has loaded, which makes scraping the link a lot harder. Thankfully, they still have to include the download link and using an ugly, hideous little hack we can grab it:</p>

<p>First, you'll need this regex for URLs: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls" rel="nofollow">http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/improved_regex_for_matching_urls</a></p>

<p>Then grab the page contents and parse with beautifulsoup as such:</p>

<pre><code>soup = BeautifulSoup(page)
div_tag = soup.find_all(class_="download_link")[0]
script_tag = div_tag("script")[0]
link = re.findall(regex, script_tag.contents[0])[0]
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my whole working code:</p>

<pre><code>import requests
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

pre_regex = r"""(?xi)
\b

  (?:
    [a-z][\w-]+:                # URL protocol and colon
    (?:
      /{1,3}                        # 1-3 slashes
      |                             #   or
      [a-z0-9%]                     # Single letter or digit or '%'
