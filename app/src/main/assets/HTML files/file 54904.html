<p>I see that you do no t have an answer yet. I cannot quite understand your problem yet because I only see "///////" in your results. But, if you are having the same problem as I have which is that RecyclerView's recycling feature is copying my selections into recycled views. An easy way to fix this if your app does not rely much on that feature is setting your RecyclerView views cache to your list size:</p>

<pre><code>yourRecyclerView..setItemViewCacheSize(yourItemList.size());
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure that you update this if the list is changing dynamically...</p>
