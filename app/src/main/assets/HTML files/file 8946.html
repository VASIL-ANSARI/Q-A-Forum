<p>Could be that you are trying to talk with utf16 but the database only sopports utf8 or some other.</p>

<p>Try adding this to your connection string:</p>

<pre><code>Character Set=utf8
</code></pre>

<p>My connection string looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"server=" + settings.DatabaseHost + 
";User Id=" + settings.DatabaseUsername +
";password="+ settings.DatabasePassword +
";database="+ settings.DatabaseName+
";Persist Security Info=True" +
";Connect Timeout=5;Default Command Timeout=10" +
";Character Set=utf8";
</code></pre>

<p>If that does't work, try ASCII or latin1</p>
