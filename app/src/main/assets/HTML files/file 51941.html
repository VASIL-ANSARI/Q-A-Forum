<p>You cannot use both "remi" and "IUS" repositories</p>

<p>So: remove libmemcached10 (from IUS) and retry.</p>

<p>Notice PHP 5.4 is now EOL. IUS have remove it from its repository, while it is still available in "remi", with security fix backported from 5.5. In all case, an upgrade to a maintained version is strongly recommended.</p>
