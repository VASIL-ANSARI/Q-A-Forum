<p>The primary difference will be the computed width, as suggested by bfavaretto.  Another difference will be the location of the border, if you were to choose to add one.  Take a look at <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/bt49e/3/" rel="nofollow">this update to your fiddle</a> to see what I mean.</p>

<p>You might also notice a difference in the default placement of any background image/gradient that you apply, since <code>margin</code> is added to the outside and <code>padding</code> is added to the inside of the box.</p>
