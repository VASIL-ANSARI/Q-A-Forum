<p>These mobile browsers simply do not fire the onscroll event until scrolling has completely stopped. This includes not only the touch based scrolling itself, but additionally any momentum that the user gives on the scroll. The event will not fire until it stops. This is a problem if you want to apply a visual change to the screen as the user scrolls.</p>
