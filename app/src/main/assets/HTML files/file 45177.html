<p>You need to look at SOUNDEX().</p>

<p>Try something like</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE soundex(name) = soundex(''%$search_query%');
</code></pre>

<p>SOUNDEX takes the letters/syllables in a word and encodes them in such a way that words sounding similar will have similar encoded values. You'll need to play around with it to see what it does for you with likely search terms, but that is probably the easiest way to go.</p>
