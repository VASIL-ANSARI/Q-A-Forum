<p>The token you receive as part of your web sign on is not suitable for calling a web API, for two reasons: A) the audience of the token is the webform app, while the web API should only accept tokens where the audience correspond to the web API - doing otherwise will open you up to man in the middle attacks and B) the token you get form ADFS is a SAML token, which can be pretty big hence unsuitable to be included an in HTTP header (the canonical way of including a bearer token for calling a web API).
If you decide to ignore the above and use that token anyway - in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32083079/acquiring-an-access-token-by-using-jwt-used-for-azurebearerauthentication/32083529#32083529">Acquiring an Access token by using JWT used for AzureBearerAuthentication</a> you can find the code necessary to extract the bits of the incoming token. It works with both openid connect and oauth middleware.</p>
