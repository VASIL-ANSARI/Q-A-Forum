<p>No you misunderstand, add the paths to your include path just means the files in those paths are visible to your code so you can <code>#include</code> them it doesn't mean that all files in those folders will be <code>#include</code>d by this act. You still need to explicitly need <code>#include "jpegLib.h"</code> in your code somewhere. </p>

<p>Also are you separating the paths with a <code>;</code> semi colon and are they relative to where VC++ resides?</p>
