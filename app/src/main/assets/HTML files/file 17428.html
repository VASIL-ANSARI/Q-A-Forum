<p>Have you considered either:</p>

<p>a) encrypting it with javascript or a java app - which is how my bank used to do it..</p>

<p>b) post the variables back to itself, encrypt them, assuming it encrypts, then bounce the page on to the new page with the encryted variables..</p>

<p>The only problem with encryption is you need to be able to unencrypt it to give it to the 3rd party app unless they accept specific encoding, in which case if you can unencrypt it, someone else will work out how.</p>
