  <p>The Site object provides methods to list, create and delete site
  instances (these are standard methods that are present on almost all
  objects), as well as stop and start sites. Each site instance in turn
  will contain properties, such as site name and site id, that can be
  inspected, searched for, or set. The output of each command is always
  a list of object instances.</p>
