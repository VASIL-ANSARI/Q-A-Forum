<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to compile program on one platform and link with other ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, no. Object files are compiler specific. Some compilers spit out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COFF" rel="nofollow">COFF</a>, others spit out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" rel="nofollow">ELF</a>, etc. On top of that, you have to worry calling conventions, system calls, etc. This is platform dependent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does object file contain ? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Symbol tables, code, relocation, linking and debugging information.</p>

<p>If what you're after is portability, then write portable C/C++ and let a platform-specific compliant compiler do the work. </p>
