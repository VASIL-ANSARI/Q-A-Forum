<p>In principle you can use <code>YourModel.new.from_json(json_string)</code> but how that behaves depends on the boolean <code>ActiveModel::Base.include_root_in_json</code>. Set that to false first if your json is a straightforward hash/object or leave it as true (the default) if your json is the kind of nested hash produced by <code>to_json</code> (again, by default).</p>

<p>All that method does is decode the json to a hash and calls <code>self.attributes = hash</code>, so you could just as easily do that yourself.</p>

<p>With respect to downsides, there really aren't any specific to this process. You're essentially doing the same thing you'd do in a standard <code>create</code> controller method, replete with validations, attr_accessible restrictions and so on.</p>
