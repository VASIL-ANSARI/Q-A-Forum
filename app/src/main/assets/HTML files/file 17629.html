<p>What I do in my app in similar circumstances is add some properties to the Category (note you can save the image data directly in core data if the image is "small", or save it on disk and a filePath to the image if its "large"):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>bool fetchingImage</p></li>
<li><p>NSInteger categoryID</p></li>
<li><p>url (to fetch from)</p></li>
<li><p>imageData or filePath</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When the category is created and the url assigned, you can fetch the image (in the background) and set the fetchinImage flag to yes. Or you can wait til the first object requests the image, in which case you return nil but initiate the fetch.</p>

<p>When the image finally arrives, and you set it in this entity, you send a notification on the main thread that says categorID now has an image. Anyone listening for that can then request the image and make it viewable.</p>
