<p>Well after doing my last testing i found the answer and was very easy.</p>

<p>I was using LINUX UBUNTU 64 bit and it uses OPEN OFFICE (libre calc) and this program is only showing 5000 rows.</p>

<p>The solution is:</p>

<pre><code>                 *** Open the file using Microsoft Excel on Windows. ***
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you guys for helping.</p>
