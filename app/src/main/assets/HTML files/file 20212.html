<p>Just put the text you want in the HTML between the anchor tag</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href"#"&gt;TEXT HERE&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note:  Generally, unless a very good specific reason is given to why your image has the text on it, you should be putting the text in the code.  So what you are doing is converting to a better practice than before, which is good.</p>
