<p>If you can require the user to be online, then I would ignore the device time and do all of the verification with your server.</p>

<p>If you support offline access to the content, you'll need to live with the possibility that the user continuously sets their clock back and never uses your app while online. This seems like it would cripple their device's general functionality, so I wouldn't be overly concerned with it personally.</p>

<p>So either way, defer to your server time if you can possibly get it, otherwise just go with the device clock.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>More detail on the offline case:</p>

<ol>
<li>The only clock you have access to is the device clock.</li>
<li>The user has control of their clock when they are not in your app.</li>
<li>The user cannot selectively be offline for just your app, so by choosing to be offline they cannot use any of their device's online features.</li>
<li>Likewise changing the clock is also a system-wide setting that would impact their reminders and their ability to tell time.</li>
</ol>

<p>For all these reasons it makes sense to assume that a user would not reduce the functionality of their device just to get content for one app, and in my opinion it is not worth concerning yourself with. If it is critical to restrict content based on time, you should make connectivity a requirement.</p>
