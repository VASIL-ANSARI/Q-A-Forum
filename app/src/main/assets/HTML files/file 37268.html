<p>you keep wining because you never actually "Play"</p>

<p>When you make your GUI you first put a value in moneyEarned and then you go to your switch
but at construction of your GUI both your checkboxes are not selected.</p>

<p>So both hot.isSelected and cold.isSelected are false.
This means your moneyEarned is not set to 0 and you always win.</p>
