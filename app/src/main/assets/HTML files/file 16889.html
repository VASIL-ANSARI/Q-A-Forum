<p>You can denote beginning of line/string with <code>^</code> and end of line/string with <code>$</code>, so the pattern would be</p>

<pre><code>^\d+$
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>{1}</code> won't work because it excludes anything with more than one digit, such as 10. Using <code>\d+</code> indicates one or more digits. Using <code>\d</code> may also allow decimals and negative values (not sure about Java), so if you only want digits, replace <code>\d</code> with <code>[0-9]</code>.</p>

<p>Specifying <code>{1}</code> is always redundant, by the way, because by default an atom is matched once.</p>
