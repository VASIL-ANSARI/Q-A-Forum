<p>It sounds like this might be a design issue. Are <code>Accounts</code> and <code>RetirementAccounts</code> significantly different? Will they share much of the same logic, but not all? If so, I think I would avoid using conditional logic in the controller and solve it using inheritance.</p>

<p>The idea here is that <code>retirement_accounts</code> would be considered a new resource in your routes file:</p>

<pre><code>resources :retirement_accounts
</code></pre>

<p>Then you manually create a new controller for it (skip the <code>rails generate...</code> command). Save this file as <code>app/controllers/retirement_accounts_controller.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class RetirementAccountsController &lt; AccountsController
end
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how it inherits from <code>AccountsController</code> instead of <code>ApplicationController</code>. Even in this empty state, <code>RetirementAccountsController</code> shares all of the logic of <code>AccountsController</code>, including the <code>new</code> and <code>create</code> methods, plus all of the view files to which they refer. To make the necessary modifications for the retirement accounts, you simply need to override the appropriate actions and views.</p>

<p>You can delete your <code>retirement_accounts_new</code> action, since it is identical to the <code>new</code> action. Move the view for <code>retirement_accounts_new</code> to <code>app/views/retirement_accounts/new.html.erb</code>, so that template will be rendered when <code>new</code> is called on the <code>RetirementAccountsController</code>.</p>

<p>As for the conditional create method, you can make a private method on both controllers that will determine where the post-create redirect should point:</p>

<pre><code>class AccountsController &lt; ApplicationController
  # ...

  def create
    @account = current_user.accounts.build(account_params)
    if @account.save
      redirect_to post_create_redirect_path, notice: 'Account was successfully created.'
    else
      render action: 'new'
    end
  end

  private

  def post_create_redirect_path
    accounts_path
  end
end

class RetirementAccountsController &lt; AccountsController

  private

  def post_create_redirect_path
     retirement_accounts_path
  end
end
</code></pre>
