<p>Marionette automates a lot of housekeeping work with respect to views that I believe Backbone should've included in the first place. Marionette is actively maintained and found it to be extremely useful and flexible for my project.</p>

<p>backbone-boilerplate, from what I see, is more of a way to organize your code into modules but doesn't touch Backbone views. </p>

<p>You should be able to use boilerplate for code organization, and Marionette for more-easily-manageable views. I believe they address complementing issues.</p>

<p>Marionette recently added an AMD version so it is now compatible with RequireJS out of the box.</p>
