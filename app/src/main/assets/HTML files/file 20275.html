<p>as a start try taking away the self.view.hidden = TRUE 
IF I get your code correctly, animation should disappear and reappear after .4 seconds? </p>

<p>Hiding and Showing on the same function doesn't work that way. </p>

<p>You could call another function that specifically does self.view.hidden = FALSE </p>
