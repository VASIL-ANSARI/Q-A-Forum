<p>PYTHONPATH is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable" rel="nofollow">environment variable</a> (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x">here</a>). I don't have a Mac, but from the threads I have linked to you would type something like</p>

<pre><code>launchctl setenv PYTHONPATH=/Me/Documents/mydir:$PYTHONPATH
</code></pre>

<p>on the command line to allow you to run Python scripts from <code>/Me/Documents/mydir</code>. Alternatively, put this line in a file called <code>.bashrc</code> in your home directory (<code>~</code>) and this path will be set each time each time you open a terminal. See <a href="http://ss64.com/osx/syntax-bashrc.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a short introduction to <code>.bashrc</code> and other <code>.bash*</code> files. Hope that helps.</p>
