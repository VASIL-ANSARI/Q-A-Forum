<p>Make sure you change the complier settings for the extensions as well. If it still says "Unsupported compiler", you probably forgot to change it in one of the three20 sub projects.</p>

<p>Also, check that you have both armv6 and armv7 under the Architectures     </p>

<p>Can you send a screenshot of the build settings you have?</p>
