<p>When adding images to your application you should place them in "res/drawable". That folder is for images that are not specific to any dpi level. For best results you should have three sizes of each image and place them in their respective dpi folders like "res/drawable-hdpi" for hi res images. <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html" rel="nofollow">This</a> is a good section of the docs to read for resources and device compatibility.</p>
