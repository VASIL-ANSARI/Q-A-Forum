<p>You are trying to get an element from ListBoxItem's template and not from ListBox. So you need to get the exact ListBoxItem, before you using accessing its template. In below code snippet, I shown you how to get item from 0th element and taking the Grid from its template.</p>

<pre><code>var container = listBoxGallery.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromIndex(0) as ListBoxItem;
var iremgrid = container.Template.FindName("itemGrid") as Grid;
</code></pre>
