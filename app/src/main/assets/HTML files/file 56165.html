<p>Without addressing the SQL injection issue,</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT * FROM runner WHERE raceid=$raceid AND `name`='$name'";
</code></pre>

<p>should take care of it if it is a quoting issue, which I think it probably is. MySQL will (usually, depending on the mode) interpret the double quotes in your statement to mean that <code>$name</code> is an identifier rather than a value, and <code>name</code> should be backticked as it is a MySQL keyword.</p>

<p>But addressing the SQL injection issue would be better and is not difficult with a prepared statement:</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM runner WHERE raceid = ? AND `name` = ?");
$stmt-&gt;execute(array($raceid, $name));
</code></pre>
