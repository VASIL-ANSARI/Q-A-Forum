<p>this is a very specific problem, but without any code that is causing problems, so this might not be the best place to ask. That said...</p>

<p>As a real world simulation, this isn't nearly enough information to come up with a code description. So, assuming this is a purely fictional exercise, as a simple simulation the hole you're drilling is always going to have the drill's penetrated volume, with the drill's speed of penetration determined by the substrate's density (ignoring a million real world material properties). The RPM value determines how much substrate gets scraped per time unit, so density slows your penetration down, RPM speeds your penetration up, and if we assume the drill is indestructible, that's pretty much all we need to know.</p>

<p>The volume excavated is equal to the drill's volume, ignoring its groove. Keep things simple and assume a cylindrical drill, and the volume is simply <strong>ÏrÂ²h</strong>, where <strong>h</strong> is the penetrated depth, and <strong>r</strong> is (obviously) the drill radius.</p>

<p>Start with an aggregate function:</p>

<pre><code>depth(t) = (a * RPM - b * density) * t
</code></pre>

<p>we don't know <em>a</em> or <em>b</em>, but we do know what they represent: <em>a</em> is the pressure behind our drill, and <em>b</em> is an unknown constant that balances our function. The first step is to normalise this function with respects to the various units (RPM is per minute, <em>t</em> is most likely in seconds, for instance), after which we can start figuring out what <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> should concretely be (also note that we can normalise this function by fixing either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> to 1, and setting the remaining free variable to whatever is necessary to balance the equation with respect to the reality we're simulating)</p>

<p>Once we have our depth-over-time function, we're pretty much done, as the volume excavated is simply</p>

<pre><code>volume(t) = Ï * rÂ² * depth(t)
</code></pre>

<p>or, if you're a student of physics and prefer the common quadratic expression:</p>

<pre><code>volume(t) = Ï/2 * rÂ² * depth(t)
</code></pre>
