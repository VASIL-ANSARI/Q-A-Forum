<p>If the sole purpose of your superclass is to define common mappings for the sub classes, but is not persistent itself, you would be better off using the <code>@MappedSuperclass</code> annotation or the <code>&lt;mapped-superclass&gt;</code> for xml mappings. There is an example <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/persistence/MappedSuperclass.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
