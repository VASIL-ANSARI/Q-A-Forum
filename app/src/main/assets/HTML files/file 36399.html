<p>Instead of setting <code>var i = 0</code> at the beginning of your for loop, simply set it to your starting index, then instead of setting the stopping condition to <code>i &lt; array.length</code>, set it to <code>i &lt; ending_index</code>.</p>

<p>This works because you then iterate <code>i</code> through all indexes between the <code>start</code> and <code>end_index</code>, just like in a "normal" for loop you iterate from <code>0</code> to the end of the array.</p>
