<p>Well, you can use rel='canonical' to say Boot that the page has an original source. You can read more about this in <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=139394" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>For hiding purposes, you can load the content in iFrames. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can place the copied description on the very bottom of the page and place it to the right place using CSS. In this way, the content cannot survive from bots, but value will be too low. But this is not recommended as it is a black hat trick. But still just an answer to your question.</p>
