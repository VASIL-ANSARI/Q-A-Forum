<li>If you have file I/O, make sure to use semaphores/something similar to make sure the I/O operations happen the way you want them to.</li>
<li>If you are using any SSO (single sign-on) products, make sure they work properly after clustering.</li>
<li>SSL certificates must be installed/maintained on all servers.</li>
<li>If you are using JBoss, either mod_cluster or mod_proxy can be used, depending on your environment/requirements.</li>
<li>If you are using WebSphere, you can install the deployment manager on one of the physical machines where one node is present. </li>
<li>Test your images and other static resources thoroughly to make sure they all work properly.</li>
<li>Keep the logs separate for each server. </li>
<li>I am not sure if you are using any load balancers - just make sure that the load is distributed somewhat evenly between the servers.</li>
<li> All the standard stuff: session management, authentication, etc. </li>
</ul>
