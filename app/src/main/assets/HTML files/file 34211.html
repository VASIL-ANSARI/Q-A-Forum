<p>This is not a direct answer to your question. I'm actually a bit confused by what you want the desktop client to do with the OData request. But I'll throw this out as something that might give you further ideas. If you already have a full, thick desktop application that includes a client-side install of a database, then consider this. If the desktop app were a Lightswitch app talking to a local database, all on the client, then behind the scenes Lightswitch wires up an OData service that serves as the pipeline between the client presentation layer and the database. And this OData service is directly accessible (if 'EnableClientAccess' is set to true).
In other words, the client desktop app talks to an OData service which talks to the database using EF if you so choose, and gives the user the full visual experience, translating user actions into OData requests. The same OData endpoint, as a standalone service,  would talk to the same database and expose the same data functionality as the client, and so, by default, the OData requests are also translated into the same EF actions.</p>
