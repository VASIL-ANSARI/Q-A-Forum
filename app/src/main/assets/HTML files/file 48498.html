<p>The answer is, "Deep Insert" doesn't support 0..n assoziations with the Offline Kapsel Plugin at the moment.</p>

<p>see <a href="http://help.sap.com/saphelp_smp308sdk/helpdata/en/d3/0ded03756247f1a136c84be7901879/content.htm" rel="nofollow">http://help.sap.com/saphelp_smp308sdk/helpdata/en/d3/0ded03756247f1a136c84be7901879/content.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Limitations of Deep Inserts A deep insert is an OData POST request to
  create an entity that also contains the inlined definitions of related
  entities.</p>
  
  <p>When a deep insert is processed, the top-level entity and all of its
  related entities are created and linked together as a single
  operation. In SDK SP07, the Offline Store supports deep inserts
  through the OData API on Android, iOS and WinPhone 8 platforms with
  one important restriction:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The navigation property used for the deep insert must refer to at most one entity. Any inlined related entities must be added using a
  navigation property whose ToRole refers to an association end with
  cardinality 0..1 or 1. They cannot be added using a navigation
  property whose ToRole refers to an association end with cardinality *.
  Navigation properties that refer to a set of entities cannot be used
  for deep inserts.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So "Deep Insert" will only work if the request is executed online against the gateway at the moment.</p>
