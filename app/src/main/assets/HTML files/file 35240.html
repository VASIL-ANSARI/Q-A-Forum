<p>How about something like this?</p>

<pre><code>public bool validate(string text)
{
     return (text == num.ToString());
}
</code></pre>

<p>And calling it in your code like this. You should try to make code as reusable as possible. Which means that references to specific instances of controls on a Form is not always the best design. </p>

<pre><code>if (at.validate(textBox1.Text))
{
     ListBox.Items.Add("Valid");
}
</code></pre>
