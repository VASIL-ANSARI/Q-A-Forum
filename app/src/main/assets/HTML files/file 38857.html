<p>Try reprovisioning or recreating the instances when ever really unexplainable things happen with cloud instances when ever possible.</p>

<p>I have had cloud instances just degrade randomly after 4 or 5 years of running, and one of the things that happens is daemon processes just stop without warning or any errors, which included passenger. </p>

<p>Wasted hours banging my head against the wall trying to trace down what was happening. Resized the instance down for unrelated reasons, and everything started working again. Turns out there was something wrong with the cloud server instance, and resizing forced the creation of a new one.</p>

<p>I assume this same type of behavior could happen on a bad deploy of a cloud instance also, though my experience was on rackspace.</p>
