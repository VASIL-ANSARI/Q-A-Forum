<p>angularjs will always execute controllers when ever page is get redirected from one page to another page if you written controller as page specific.</p>

<p>If your application is SPA then you can rewrite by specifying a controller before declaring ng-view (its not a good practice).as</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div ng-controller="controller as cont"&gt;
       &lt;div ng-view&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>now it will hold all your data until the application get closed.but, you should aware of cache.</p>
