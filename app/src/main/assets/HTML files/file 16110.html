<p>As explained in the javadoc and in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/CachesExplained">user guide</a>, There is no thread that makes sure entries are removed from the cache as soon as the delay has elapsed. Instead, entries are removed during write operations, and occasionally during read operations if writes are rare. This is to allow for a high throughput and a low latency. And of course, every write operation doesn't cause a cleanup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caches built with CacheBuilder do not perform cleanup and evict values
  "automatically," or instantly after a value expires, or anything of
  the sort. Instead, it performs small amounts of maintenance during
  write operations, or during occasional read operations if writes are
  rare.</p>
  
  <p>The reason for this is as follows: if we wanted to perform Cache
  maintenance continuously, we would need to create a thread, and its
  operations would be competing with user operations for shared locks.
  Additionally, some environments restrict the creation of threads,
  which would make CacheBuilder unusable in that environment.</p>
