<p>You are trying to access the lazy collections outside of a transaction. You can either annotate the relevant method with <code>@Transactional</code> or use fetch joins: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT e FROM Event AS e LEFT JOIN FETCH e.attendingUsers ...
</code></pre>

<p>Working inside a transaction is generally preferable, since you fetch the related entities only if you need to.</p>

<p>EDIT: the <code>Exception</code> probably originates from the <code>if</code> clause in the 'unattend' method, where you access the lists: <code>e.getAttendingUsers()</code>. I would move it from the controller into a transactional service, like the <code>EventService</code>.</p>
