<p>You can create your anonymous type by not giving a specific type in your <code>new</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>opportunityInfo.Add(new {
    col1="value1",
    col2="value2",
    col3= "value3"});
</code></pre>

<p>This will work, but you won't be able to use properties like <code>opportunityInfo[0].col1</code> because you've declared that list explicitly as <code>List&lt;object&gt;</code>.  If you instead declare it as <code>List&lt;dynamic&gt;</code> you'll be able to access the members of the anonymous class.</p>

<p>(Note: I'm not sure offhand how the data binding will work with the anonymous type, or whether the type of the <code>List</code> will make any behavioural difference.)</p>
