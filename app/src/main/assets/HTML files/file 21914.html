<p>You have 6 images , each is png , with the size of 398x538 .</p>

<p>This means , that by default , all of them use 6*4*398*538= 5,138,976 bytes , which is about 5 MB .</p>

<p>This doesn't look like the real cause of your OOM . </p>

<p>Could you please tell us more about the app and other things that could be the cause of this?</p>

<p>Is it possible you've put the files in drawable-ldpi or drawable-mdpi ?</p>

<p>In such cases , the images would take more , depending on the density of the device you're running. </p>

<p>For example , if you put them all in the drawable-mdpi , yet the device is running on xdpi screen , this would take 4 times more memory (because we double both width and height) . it's still not close to the 50MB you've got though . </p>
