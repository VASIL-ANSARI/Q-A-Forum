<p>It seems like there's somewhat of a mismatch between the ideal output at the beginning of your question, and what the code actually does, in that the code doesn't create the keys <code>sentence</code>, <code>parsedSentence</code> and <code>location-value-pairs</code>.</p>

<p>This may just mean I've misunderstood the question, but if not, you could try something like:</p>

<pre><code>output = {"sentences": []}

for sentence in parsedSentences:

    sentenceDict = {"parsedSentence": sentence}

    wordsInSentence = []
    for token in sentence["tokens"]:
         wordsInSentence.append(token["word"])
    sentence = " ".join(wordsInSentence)

    sentenceDict["sentence"] = sentence

    sentenceDict["location-value-pairs"] = []

    for locationTokenIDs, location in tokenIDs2location.items():
        for numberTokenIDs, number in tokenIDs2number.items():
            sentenceDict["location-value-pairs"].append({location: number})

    output["sentences"].append(sentenceDict)
</code></pre>
