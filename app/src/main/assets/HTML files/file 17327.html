<p>What you propose sounds reasonable.</p>

<p>Don't use the app engine generated key for Tracking.  Because the combination of story/user should be unique, create your own key as a combination of the story/user.  Something like</p>

<pre><code>tracking = Tracking.get_or_insert(str(story.id) + "-" + str(user.id), **params)
</code></pre>

<p>If you know the story/user, then you can always fetch the tracking by key name.</p>
