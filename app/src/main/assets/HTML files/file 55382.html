<p>Not specific to C# but more SQL based, you can select the records for the Account Number - sorted by TransactionId Desc and Limit the results to 1.</p>

<p>This would look like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, Address, AccountNumber, Date, CustomerName, Debit, Credit, Balance from fianlTable WHERE (AccountNumber='"+textBox4.Text+"') ORDER BY Id DESC LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>BTW Lucas is correct you are risking someone hijacking your code by using the value from the textbox directly in the query :)  </p>
