<p>I prefer <code>RETURNING</code>, because the same approach works with multi-valued results.</p>

<p>You can only use <code>currval</code> when you only have a single result row.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'm not convinced that the evaluation order between <code>nextval</code> and <code>currval</code> is guaranteed when they appear in the same <code>VALUES</code> clause. So it's going to be safer to fetch the value in <code>RETURNING</code> and feed it as a parameter to the next query.</p>
