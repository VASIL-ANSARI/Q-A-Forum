<p>The last one will call 3. As the first argument is Object, it can only pick one of the methods with Object as the first argument -- so that leaves either 1 or 3 as options. The third argument <code>int</code> fits into the <code>long</code> so that is legal in both cases. The second argument can be exactly fitted into 3, whereas it has to be widened to fit into 1. The compiler gives preference to exact matching over widening. </p>

<p>Your previous answers are correct as well. </p>
