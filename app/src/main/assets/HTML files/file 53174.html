<p><em>Similar</em> to the second option, you might simply add a read-only field to your view model:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyViewModel {
    public string MyMaskedProperty { get; set;}

    public string MyUnmaskedProperty
    {
        get
        {
            // return an "unmasked" version of MyMaskedProperty
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even if you were to modify the value with JavaScript, you can't really implicitly trust that and would want to validate server-side anyway.  And doing it in the controller isn't ideal because that's just procedural code that would need to be repeated all over the place.  Following the advice to "keep your controllers light and your models heavy", this logic really belongs on the model.</p>

<p>The model itself can be constructed from any version of the data, really.  As long as the information used to construct the model can effectively construct it, then the model can expose all sorts of operations and properties for manipulating and viewing that information.</p>
