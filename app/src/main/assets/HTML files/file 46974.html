<p>The reason that you can't just change the code to  <code>$result = header('Location: ...')</code> is actually quite simple. With this javascript call as an example:</p>

<pre><code>$.post('/myscript.php', { et_lastname: 'Doe', email: 'j.doe@example.com' }, function(data) {
    // do something
});
</code></pre>

<p>What happens:</p>

<ol>
<li>An HTTP-POST call is made via AJAX to <code>/myscript.php</code></li>
<li>Your code is executed, subscribing the given email address.</li>
<li>The PHP code returns a 301</li>
<li>The AJAX call will follow the redirect, but your browser will stay on the same page.</li>
</ol>

<p>What you actually want is that when the AJAX call was successful, the browser redirects to another page. To achieve that, you'll need to update both your PHP and Javascript.</p>

<p>In your PHP, you'll have to return the location you want the browser to redirect to, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    $result = json_encode(array('location' =&gt; 'https://example.com/path/to/page'));
</code></pre>

<p>Right now, the PHP script just returns an json-response with a location key. The browser, nor the javascript doesn't do anything with that information unless we tell it to do so:</p>

<pre><code>$.post('/myscript.php', { et_lastname: 'Doe', email: 'j.doe@example.com' }, null, 'json').done(function(data) {
    // do something ...
    // redirect browser to page we provided in the ajax response
    window.location = data.location;
}).fail(function(data) {
    // handle the error
});
</code></pre>
