<p>One possible source of the problem is that <code>str</code> is not really an <code>int</code> variable. You need to do some casting (both when creating the thread and when getting the argument).</p>

<p>To create a the thread and to properly pass the integer to ity ou first need to cast the value to an <code>intptr_t</code>, which is a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/integer" rel="nofollow">standard integer type</a> big enough to fit both an integer or a pointer. Then you should cast it to a generic pointer (i.e. <code>void *</code>):</p>

<pre><code>pthread_create(&amp;pthreadsArray[i], NULL, CarProcess, (void *) (intptr_t) i);
</code></pre>

<p>Then to get the integer value inside the thread function you need to do the opposite casting:</p>

<pre><code>static void* CarProcess(void *str)
{
    int i = (int) (intptr_t) str;
    printf("Thread ID: %i\n", i);
}
</code></pre>
