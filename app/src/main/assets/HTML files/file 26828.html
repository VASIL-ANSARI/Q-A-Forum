<p>There is no need to <code>init</code> UI-objects in main thread. But all operations with UI must be performed in main thread.
So if you want to create some subview or your want to fetch some data, you can make it in background. But when you want to add it on your controller's view or you want to reload view, you have to do it in main thread.</p>

<p>And Yes, <code>dispatch_get_main_queue()</code> is allowed inside blocks.</p>
