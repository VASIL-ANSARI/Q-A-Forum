<p>The error you're getting looks a lot like a linker error caused by the function <code>classname::structname::membername</code> not being defined anywhere.  From the code you've posted, it looks like you've just <em>declared</em> the function without providing a definition anywhere, meaning that the code will compile but not link.  You should be able to fix this by providing an implementation for the function somewhere in your program.  It doesn't have anything to do with whether the parameter is taken by reference; in both cases you still need to provide an implementation.</p>
