<p>Just a quick tip: what if you don't hide the list item and add the context menu to the list, but instead add the context menu to the list item?</p>

<p>For example, wrap the current layout of the list item into a FrameLayout. Then when long-clicked, just add the context menu to this FrameLayout instead? (and if needed hide the first child of the FrameLayout). This wouldd also guarantee that the context menu will have the same size as the list item.</p>
