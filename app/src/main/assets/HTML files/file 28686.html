<p>Which version of <code>Print()</code> should <code>d.Print()</code> call? There are two choices. You can choose, though:</p>

<pre><code>d.A::Print(); // this one isn't part of the overload set search without qualification
d.B::Print();
d.C::Print();
</code></pre>

<p>Note that making <code>A::Print()</code> a <code>virtual</code> function won't help as there is no unique final overriding function. You'd need to explicitly override <code>Print()</code> in <code>D</code>.</p>
