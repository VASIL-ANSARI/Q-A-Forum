<p>That's not going to work inside a css.erb file, firstly because it is missing erb tags, but mostly because wicked_pdf_image_tag will expand that out to this:</p>

<pre><code>.logo {
  background: &lt;img src="file://foo/bar/public/images/logo.jpg"&gt;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is not valid css.
Best bet would be to construct it by hand and something like this:</p>

<pre><code>.logo {
  background: url(&lt;%= Rails.root.join('assets','images','logo.jpg').to_s %&gt;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason to have the direct file access path is so wkhtmltopdf doesn't have to make a web request to get the assets, hence load more quickly.</p>
