<p>Change the background colour of the UIWindow in MainWindow.nib. Either "black" or "clear" should both work (I think...)</p>

<p>It's one of the first things I do to any app, otherwise you get bits of white showing on a view rotation (in the very old days of 2.x there were huge patches of white; they've since masked off the screen edges during a rotation, but a few pixels still show through) and when you show/hide the status bar (e.g. for UIImagePicker) and stuff. Black looks a <em>lot</em> better than white for the window background.</p>
