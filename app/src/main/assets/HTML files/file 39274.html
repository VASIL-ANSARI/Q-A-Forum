<p>Specifying the Geographic Coverage File Contents</p>

<p>The geographic coverage file must contain a single MultiPolygon shape that defines the boundaries of the supported geographic regions. A single multi polygon may contain multiple child polygons, each of which defines the boundaries around a single geographic region. Each child polygon contains four or more coordinate values that define the boundaries of the polygon. Per the GeoJSON specification, every child polygon must represent a closed regionâthat is, the first and last coordinate values must always be identical. Therefore, you must specify at least four points to define a triangular region, which is the simplest possible shape. Of course, you use more points to define more complex polygons.</p>

<p>Listing 7-2 shows an example of a geographic coverage file that specifies two separate regions: one around San Francisco and one around Chicago. Note that the coordinates for each region are surrounded by what seem to be an extra set of brackets. In each case, the first open bracket marks the beginning of the overall polygon shape, the second open bracket defines the beginning of the exterior bounding polygon, and the third open bracket marks the beginning of the first coordinate.</p>

<pre><code>{ "type": "MultiPolygon",
  "coordinates": [
    [[[-122.7, 37.3], [-121.9, 37.3], [-121.9, 37.9], [-122.7, 37.9], [-122.7, 37.3]]],
    [[[-87.9, 41.5], [-87.3, 41.5], [-87.3, 42.1], [-87.9, 42.1], [-87.9, 41.5]]]
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore I think you don't close the region.</p>
