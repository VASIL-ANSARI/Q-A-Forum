<p>No, that's not possible. <code>sessionStorage</code> lives on the client. If you want to access it on the server you will have to write javascript that reads the value, puts it in a hidden field so that it is sent to the server. Or javascript that will read the value from the storage and redirect to the server passing it as query string parameter. There's absolutely no way for the server accessing directly this storage. That's one of the drawbacks of sessionStorage vs cookies.</p>
