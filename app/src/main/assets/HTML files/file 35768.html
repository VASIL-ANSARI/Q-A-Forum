<p>not sure what you have in mind exactly, but you should make sure the slider that works as the navigation shows more than one slide, so the user can click on them to change the slides of the second slide. </p>

<p>So etiher add an "itemWidth":</p>

<pre><code>itemWidth: 100
</code></pre>

<p>or do not disable the directionNav.</p>
