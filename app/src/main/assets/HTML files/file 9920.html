<p>If your content is already around anchor tags you can try changing your CSS to attach the hover property to the anchors instead of the li's. It will likely still be problematic however. </p>

<p>If this doesn't work try adding display: inline-block to the anchor tags. Otherwise you'll have to hack it with javascript.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

ul.nav-main li a:hover &gt; ul {
    visibility: visible;

}


ul.nav-main li a.hover,
ul.nav-main li a:hover {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 599;
    cursor: pointer;
    background: url(../images/dropdown-bg-hover.gif) repeat-x left top;

}
</code></pre>
