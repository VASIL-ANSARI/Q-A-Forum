<p>Well, to solve this standoff I realized the following:</p>

<p>1 - When you're creating a C + + project wizard now create an EXE with the name its first class (usually the name given to the project);</p>

<p>2 - Right click on the project RunAs-> Run Configurations;</p>

<p>3 - C / C + + Application New, Right Button;</p>

<p>4 - In C / C + + Application Click Browse, navigate to the folder of your project and select your EXE file and click Apply and Close;</p>

<p>5 - You can now click the Run.</p>

<p>Hope this helps, bye.</p>
