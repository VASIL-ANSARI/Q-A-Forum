<p>That's weird that it's only happening with jQuery 1.7.1 and Backbone combined.</p>

<p>I don't know what the root cause is, but I was able to figure out a workaround by updating your call to resizable in the initialize method</p>

<pre><code>this.$(".withhelper")
    .resizable({
        helper: "ui-resizable-helper",
          stop: this.resizestop
      });
</code></pre>
