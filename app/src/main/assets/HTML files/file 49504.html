<p>There are many options, but one of them is to implement  the <code>UITabBarControllerDelegate</code> protocol and then set the class that implements it as the delegate of your <code>UITabBarController</code>. The delegate receives a message <code>- tabBarController:didSelectViewController:</code></p>

<p>In that method you can implement the behavior you desire by looking at the last view controller and the next one.  To get access to those view controllers from your delegate, you may need to add them as <code>weak</code> properties to your delegate class. You can also access all of your <code>UITabBarController</code>'s sub view controllers through its <code>viewControllers</code> property which is an array of view controllers.</p>
