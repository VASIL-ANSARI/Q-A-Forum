<blockquote>
  <p>AsyncTask enables proper and easy use of the UI thread. This class allows you to perform background operations and publish results on the UI thread without having to manipulate threads and/or handlers.</p>

<p>AsyncTask provides a convenient way to do tasks in background and interact with the main UI thread. If you did not use AsyncTasks you have to implement your own methods to synchronize with the main thread to update the UI. If you are calling any back end services or doing long running operations, it is always good to go with async tasks.</p>

<p>It is a bad practice to have your same REST end point to return different objects based on an enum. Have two separate endpoints. One GET call to search users and one POST call to login users. In the client side also have separate implementations on consuming above endpoints. Use them appropriately when needed. </p>
