<p>While adding a charset indicator for the browser, like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All text based files (html, js, and oh what the heck css) should be converted to utf-8 as well.</p>

<p>Keep in mind to convert the files to <code>UTF-8 without BOM</code> to avoid those annoying empty lines that will appear on some browsers.</p>
