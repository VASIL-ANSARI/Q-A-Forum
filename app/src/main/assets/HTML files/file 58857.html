<p><code>string</code> in your code is a pointer rather than an array.  There is no memory allocated for <code>fscanf</code> to copy the characters into.  Changing it to a character array will work as would <code>string = malloc(X);</code> where X is the number of bytes you want to allocate.  Remember that you'll need an extra byte for the '\0' termination of the string.  Also remember that you have no idea how big the line of test could be and <code>fscanf</code> will just copy bytes without caring about length, which brings up another issue -- how is <code>fscanf</code> supposed to know to copy an entire line rather than just a word or a character?  You should look into that!</p>
