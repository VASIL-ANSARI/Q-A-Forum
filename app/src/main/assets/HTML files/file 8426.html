<p>I would say its the PreRenderComplete event, since the page is rendered immediately afterwards</p>

<p>Although looking at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN page lifecyle</a>, the SaveStateComplete event happens even after that.  Though if you were to use that you wouldn't be able to save the control's new properties to the ViewState.</p>

<p>In practice personally I would use the PreRender event to do 'final' control changes.</p>
