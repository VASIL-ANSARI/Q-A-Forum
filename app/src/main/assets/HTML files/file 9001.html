<p>Not all browsers have a "click()" function associated with buttons and anchors and etc.  IE does (I think), but (for example) Firefox doesn't.</p>

<p><em>edit</em> &mdash; wow according to MDC, Firefox 5 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.click" rel="nofollow">will support this</a>.</p>

<p>If you were using a framework such as jQuery, then that code might allow you to do what you want. (With jQuery you definitely can.)</p>

<p>(Also, strictly speaking, we're not talking about an <em>event</em> here.  We're talking about the ability to trigger the event handling mechanism programatically.)</p>
