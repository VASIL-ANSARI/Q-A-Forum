<p>I'm a little surprised you were able to get it working with the Console applications, I expected you to get a Circular Dependency there too.</p>

<p>I think you should restructure your solution so <strong>A &amp; B don't reference each other</strong>.  You are using WCF for communication so they don't need to be referenced in any way.</p>

<p>Also, the WCF library should not do any UI type behaviour such as console write lines or message box stuff, just return a string or object and have you UI application such as your console app or Forms App handle the user interaction/display</p>
