<p>In my opinion, Vladimir is right and it has nothing to do with the Array.Sort, but assumed it has, then you can replace it easily with some simple if-constructs. This should be a simple task, since you only need to find the pivot of three values(start, middle and end).</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>There is also a small mistake in your pivot choosing:</p>

<pre><code>array[(start + (end - start)) / 2]
</code></pre>

<p>I think, you meant that:</p>

<pre><code>array[(start + (end - start) / 2)]
</code></pre>

<p>Edit2: A less favorable pivot could be responsible for more recursively calls ;)</p>
