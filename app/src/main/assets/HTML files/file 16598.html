<p>Authenticated requests are precisely what CSRF is about.</p>

<p>What CSRF means is that the attacker convinces the user's browser to make a request. For example you visit a page hosted by an attacker that has a form that looks like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="http://www.yourapp.com/some_action"&gt;
  #for parameters here
&lt;/action&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And some javascript on the page that auto submits the form. If the user is already logged in to your app, then this request will pass any cookie based authentication checks. However the attacker doesn't know the csrf token.</p>

<p>For an unauthenticated request, csrf serves no purpose - the attacker can just go ahead and make the request anyway - they don't need to hijack the victim's credentials.</p>

<p>So, short version: disabling csrf protection will leave you vulnerable to csrf style attacks.</p>

<p>What CSRF is really about is making sure the form contains a parameter that an attacker can't fake. The session is an easy place to store such a value but I imagine you could come up with alternatives. For example if the user can't control any of the parameters in the form, you could add another parameter which would be a signature of all the other parameters in the form (possibly with some sort of timestamp or nonce to prevent replay attacks). Upon receiving the request you can tell whether the request is from a form you generated by verifying the signature.</p>

<p>Be very careful about this sort of stuff as it is easy to get wrong (and even the big boys get it wrong <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2008-12.html">sometimes</a>.</p>
