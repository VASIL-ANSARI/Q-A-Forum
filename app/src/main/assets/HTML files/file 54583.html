<p>QSharedPointer is essentially <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, QScopedPointer is essentially <code>std::unique_ptr</code>, which were added in C++11.</p>

<p>All of these "smart pointers" behave differently and should be used in different contexts, but they're all for <code>delete</code>ing dynamically allocated memory on the heap when it shouldn't be used anymore, how this is accomplished depends on the type of smart pointer used.</p>

<p>If the pointer should be for reference only (ie the object doesn't "own" the memory (doesn't have the responsibility to <code>delete</code> it)), just use <code>int*</code>. If it's dynamically allocated, look into these smart pointers, whether it be <code>QSharedPointer</code> and <code>QScopedPointer</code> or <code>std::shared_ptr</code> and <code>std::unique_ptr</code>.</p>

<p>TL;DR, look into how <code>std::unique_ptr</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code> are used, they're very similar.</p>
