<p>Provided that I understood what are you trying to achieve, this showed be fairly straight forward. Keep NSMutableArray as property on your VC. Each time button it pressed add corresponding Label to array. Before you add element to array check array count a wether this element already exists in array(this existence check is not in demo). One array has three elements set their coordinates and display them. I should point out that these are not kind of question you should be posting at stackoverflow nevertheless I wrote a quick demo <a href="http://www.stringcode.co.uk/random/ButtonsLabelsDemo.zip" rel="nofollow">http://www.stringcode.co.uk/random/ButtonsLabelsDemo.zip</a>. Hope it will help you.</p>
