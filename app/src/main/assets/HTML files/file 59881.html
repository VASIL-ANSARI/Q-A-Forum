<p>This is a custom launcher / icon pack's doing. Most likely the manufacturer's doing(LEAGOO). You may notice that "Known" apps will have a custom icon, but if you created a custom app it might look much different with a random background and perhaps an icon transformation of some sort. </p>

<p>It might be worth getting a stock Android device to ensure your Icon looks great on stock Android as you'll never know what different launchers(bloatware) will do to your app's icon.</p>

<p>If the OEM has a way to interop with it, then by all means that would be the easiest way to customize this behavior. However most launchers are included in the OEM's package/bloatware.</p>
