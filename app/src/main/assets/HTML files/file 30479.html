<p>Since you're in the SelectedIndexChanged event, you can use the GridView.SelectedIndex property to get the write data key out of the GridView.DataKeys collection.</p>

<p>Might I also suggest cleaning that up, so that it's not all one long line of code?</p>

<pre><code>Sub CustomersGridView_SelectedIndexChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    Dim room As String = GridView1.SelectedRow.Cells(1).Text
    Dim name As String = GridView1.SelectedRow.Cells(2).Text
    ' This is the one I've changed, to grab the DataKey of the selected row
    Dim number As String = GridView1.DataKeys(GridView1.SelectedIndex).Value.ToString()
    Dim member As String = DDMember.SelectedValue.ToString()
    Dim unit As String = DDUnit.SelectedValue.ToString()

    Response.Redirect("RoundingEntry.aspx?Room=" &amp; room &amp; _
                                        "&amp;Name=" &amp; name &amp; _
                                        "&amp;Number=" &amp; number &amp; _
                                        "&amp;Member=" &amp; member &amp; _
                                        "&amp;Unit=" &amp; unit)
End Sub
</code></pre>
