<p>If you are talking about the <code>x</code> &amp; <code>y</code> variables specifically, then it came from an <code>&lt;input type="image"&gt;</code>. You could try <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_input_src" rel="nofollow">playing with input type image</a> and see how it behaves.</p>

<p>But for other cases (where you want to add any other variable) then I think the best way is to append input elements on the fly.</p>
