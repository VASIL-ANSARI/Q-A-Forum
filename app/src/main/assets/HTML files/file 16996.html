<p>Some good reading from another post. Although closed, it poses some decent arguments in favor of iframes.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1081315/why-developers-hate-iframes">Why developers hate iframes?</a></p>

<p>A few points that resonate well:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gmail, live.com, Facebook any MANY other major websites on the
internet take advantage iframes and in situations where they are
used properly...well that is what they were made for.</li>
<li>In situations especially like mine its considered a better practice
to prevent any possible compatibility issues with a remote website I
have no control over. Would I rather use an iframe, or destroy a
persons website? Sure I can take all possible precautions, and the
likelyhood of actually causing problems on another persons site is
slim, but with an iframe its impossible. Hence why they were created
in the first place.</li>
<li>SEO in my situation does not matter. I am simply extending a
javascript application onto remote users websites, not providing
searchable content.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the above reasons, I think that taking the easier approach is actually the more professional option. Iframes in general have a bit of a misconception, I think because of their overuse in ugly ways in the past, but then again tables also have that same misconception yet believe it or not, when data is best displayed in a tabular fashion, it makes sense to use...wait for it...tables. Though we do this behind css values such as display: table-cell.</p>

<p>For now iframes get my vote. I'll update this answer if a little further down the development road on this project, I change my mind.</p>
