<p>For the heading, you're on the right track. But you need:</p>

<pre><code>bar = ['Name', 'Score']
foo.writerow(bar)
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, you're going to have problems with:</p>

<pre><code>with open ('classa.csv', 'a', newline='')  and
with open ('classa.csv', 'b', newline='')  and
with open ('classa.csv', 'c', newline='')
</code></pre>

<p>The arguments 'a', 'b', and 'c' are interpreted as the mode in which the file is opened. You either want 'a' for  appending or 'w' for writing, depending on your use case. </p>
