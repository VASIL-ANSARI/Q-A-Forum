<p>If you preload the image in your js before your click handler, that should resolve your Chrome issue:</p>

<pre><code>  var loadImg = new Image();
  loadImg.src = "/images/loader.gif";
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you're really not too attached to your loader GIF, I would recommend ditching the GIF approach all together and utilizing Spin.js <a href="http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/" rel="nofollow">http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/</a></p>

<p>There are plenty of known issues with blockUI and images on submit actions, and Spin.js works nicely in all browsers with blockUI.</p>
