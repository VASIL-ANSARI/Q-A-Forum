<p>Each class controls its own printable representation with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__" rel="nofollow"><code>__repr__()</code></a>  special method.</p>

<p>The number you're looking at, <code>id:</code> could potentially be anywhere in the Entity, in any field, or somewhere in an internal datastructure, or nowhere and calculated at display time. It might easily be an <code>id</code> property as @PM2Ring's comment suggests - but it might not be. </p>

<p>So it's either a very specific question - you need to examine the Entity for an appropriate field or method to get the ID. And you haven't said what it is, so that could be anything.</p>

<p>Or it's a general question about processing the <code>repr()</code> value - which is probably not what you want to do ever, really.</p>

<p>But if you did want to, it would be:</p>

<pre><code>for count, item in enumerate(edge1):
    id = repr(item).split(':')[-1].rstrip('&gt;')
    print "Node" + str(count), id
</code></pre>
