<p>Your E-Mail code looks fine; the culprit is <code>$body</code>, which seems to contain ISO-8859-1 characters (or characters from some other encoding). You need to check your application to see where that happens. </p>

<p>If <code>$body</code> comes from a database, it could be the classical <a href="http://www.phpwact.org/php/i18n/utf-8/mysql" rel="nofollow">"mySQL default connection charset is ISO-8859-1</a>" problem (search for <code>defaults to a latin1 connection</code> in the link). </p>
