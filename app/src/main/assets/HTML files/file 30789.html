<p>Looking at sdoc's <a href="https://github.com/voloko/sdoc/blob/master/sdoc.gemspec" rel="nofollow">gemspec</a>, you'll see that it has <code>rdoc ~&gt; 4.0, &lt; 5.0</code> specified as a dependency. That means that installing <code>sdoc</code> will include a version of <code>rdoc</code> that is between versions 4 and 5. </p>

<p>That is why your current version of <code>rdoc</code> is conflicting with <code>sdoc</code> installation. If you really want sdoc and your current version of <code>rdoc</code> is not the latest stable one, just go ahead and overwrite it. :)</p>
