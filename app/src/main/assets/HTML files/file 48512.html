<p>The key is in the documentation: "UOWs can be shared between ViewModels if different parts of the UI work with the same data, but each UOW remains a unique sandbox." </p>

<p>In angularjs, factories-services are singletons so when you create a UOW service you have an entityManager created for it too.  </p>

<p>Inside that UOW you put all the data-repositories you want to work with and use it for your business code. </p>

<p>Every time you want to work with those data you just inject the "unitofwork" service you created and no extra entityManager will be created. "UnitOfWork" service-factory has a "get" method. </p>

<p>But in the case you want to use a new clean instance of the UnitOfWork service with an empty entityManager cache then you just call unitOfWork.create() that will make a new enityManager. </p>

<p>An example of a business scenario like this is explained here :<a href="http://breeze.github.io/doc-cool-breezes/multiple-entitymanagers.html" rel="nofollow">http://breeze.github.io/doc-cool-breezes/multiple-entitymanagers.html</a> </p>
