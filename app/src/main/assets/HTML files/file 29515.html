<p>You create another table: <code>submission_rating</code>. Three columns would suffice: <code>rating</code>, <code>submission_id</code> and <code>user_id</code>. </p>

<p>Someone presses like, you do an an <code>INSERT</code>. But, before you do the insert, you check whether or not this particular user has already liked this submission. If the user has, you remove the like. If it does not, you insert the rating.</p>

<p>edit: As two gentleman below suggested, rather than relying on another check, go for the <code>UNIQUE</code> index. Make sure you catch the error and properly show it when trying to insert. Boldly said, <code>if(!$insert) {}</code>.</p>
