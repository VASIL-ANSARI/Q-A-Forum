<p>On the PHP manual page they noted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're opening a URI with special characters, such as spaces, you
  need to encode the URI with urlencode().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe this will help you, so it's going to be:</p>

<pre><code>$data = file_get_contents(urlencode('c:/localweb/img/ìë.png'));
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this will help you</p>
