<p><code>iiiiiii..</code> is a local variable, i.e. it cannot be accessed from other classes. Therefore, its name does not matter; the compiler does not need to store it. Additionally, the compiler may look at your code and determine that <code>{int i = 10;}</code> is not actually doing anything and can be replaced by <code>{}</code> since both versions produce the same program output (none).</p>
