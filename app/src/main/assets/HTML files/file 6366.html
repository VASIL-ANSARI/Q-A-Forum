<p>I'm pretty sure if you zoom in/out with Safari on the Desktop version you will see the same problem. Sometimes you're zoomed fractions of pixels and webkit doesn't really know what to do with the subpixels.</p>

<p>Try adding to your head: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That way the default view will be good. You could also disable zooming, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a website designed specifically for the iPad.</p>
