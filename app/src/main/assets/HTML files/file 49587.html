<p>Based on the shared hosting, and the desire to get backups on-demand, you may need to actually run a SQL query that essentially iterates all the metadata and raw data and generates a bunch of SQL INSERT statements.</p>

<p>The good news is, this is a well-solved problem. See this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/982568/what-is-the-best-way-to-auto-generate-insert-statements-for-a-sql-server-table">What is the best way to auto-generate INSERT statements for a SQL Server table?</a> or just Google "SQL script generator". If you look at some of the open source projects out there, that might be the easiest code to integrate.</p>

<p>With the <em>caveat</em>, it might be worth giving your hosting company a call and just explaining your needs, especially if they are a smaller company. I used to be Dir of Engineering for a small web hosting company and we'd setup ad hoc solutions for folks all the time.</p>
