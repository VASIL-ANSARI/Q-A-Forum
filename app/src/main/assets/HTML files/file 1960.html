<p>You need to use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.cookiecontainer%28VS.95%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">CookieContainer</a>. You can set this on a HttpWebRequest it will collect any cookies received in the response. Then if you set the same CookieContainer instance on subsequent requests, it will post those cookies back to the server.</p>

<p>You can also use WebClient which is much simpler than HttpWebRequest but in order to set a CookieContainer you'll need to derive from WebClient and override the protected <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webclient.getwebrequest%28VS.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">GetWebRequest</a> method.</p>

<p>As for posting data such as form fields, I suggest doing it in a browser while running <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/" rel="nofollow">Fiddler</a> and seeing what the browser is posting. Then you'll know what to include in your POST data.</p>
