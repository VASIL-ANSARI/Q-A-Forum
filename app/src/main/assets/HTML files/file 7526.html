<blockquote>
  <p>Impossible WHERE noticed after reading const tables  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What does this mean:</strong><br>
<code>Const tables</code> means MySQL has noticed that only one row can match on the join. Instead if reading this inside the query it stores this row in a <code>const table</code> </p>

<p>According to the MySQL manual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The table has at most one matching row, which is read at the start of the query. Because there is only one row, values from the column in this row can be regarded as constants by the rest of the optimizer. const tables are very fast because they are read only once. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The problem</strong><br>
The problem that <strong>you</strong> are having here is that MySQL has noticed that there are no matching rows in your join. For that reason MySQL cannot read a row into the const table and cannot start the query.  </p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong><br>
Fix the query do it does not return an empty resultset and run explain again.</p>
