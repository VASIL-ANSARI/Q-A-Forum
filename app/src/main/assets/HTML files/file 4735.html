<p>SQL Compact is going to use a file as a backing store.  Will that reduce RAM usage? That greatly depends on how you're doing things now and how you use the SQL Compact database.  </p>

<p>If you put the SDF file in a persistent store, then it will take up less RAM for storage.  If you put everything in one table and then use something like a DataTable to hold the results from "SELECT * FROM MyTable" then the entire thing would get replicated into RAM, removing any benefit.  If, however, you use SQL statements to filter the returned data, then memory usage will decrease.  Using ResultSets and DataReaders instead of giant DataSets makes a large difference as well.</p>

<p>So can it reduce your memory usage?  Probably, provided you use the database engine to look at small parts of the data at a time.  Again, it all depends on what you're doing now, though, for a comparison.</p>
