<blockquote>
  <p>But why CSDEF0 is bit 0 ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of:</p>

<pre><code>#define CSDEF0 (0x00000001) //bit 0
</code></pre>

<p>What they mean is not a "bit with value 0" but "the bit at position 0".</p>

<p>And concerning the:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>#define CSHOLD (0x10000000) //bit 28</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a look at converting hex-notation to binary-notation and it will become clear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does |= work in this situation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 1-bits <strong>AT</strong> those positions (0 and 28) are <em>or'ed</em> into the value that was previously in that variable.</p>
