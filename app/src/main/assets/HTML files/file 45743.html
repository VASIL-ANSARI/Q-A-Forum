<p>Could you be more specific, Is the photo taken directly from camera or selected from gallery?
Most probably the size of the imageView itself is small. A photo no matter how small can be enlarged to fit a large imageView but it will pixelate.</p>

<p>If you have its URI you could try this code to convert data from intent to uri which then gets converted to bitmap and then assigned to your imageView</p>

<pre><code>Uri imageUri = intent.getData();
Bitmap bitmap =     MediaStore.Images.Media.getBitmap(this.getContentResolver(),imageUri);
Imageview imgview1 = (Imageview ) findViewById (R.id.imgview1);
imgeview1.setImageBitmap(bitmap);
</code></pre>

<p>You could use the above code to convert URI recieved from camera to a bitmap and assign it to the imageView.
If the image still looks small then check the size of the imageView.</p>
