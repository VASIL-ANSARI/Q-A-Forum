<p>The relevant object is contained in an array, so no, it is not possible to find it without iteration. The data could be massaged to use the appid as the key for an object that contains the games as the value, but that requires additional preprocessing.</p>

<p>However, it could be possible to craft a parser such that the appropriate data can be extracted immediately upon parsing. This would piggyback the iteration within the parser itself instead of being explicit code after the fact. See the <code>object_hook</code> argument of the parser.</p>
