<p>You're right that it's because of the </p>

<pre><code>theball.y+BH == thebat.y

<p>At an angle, the ball is less likely to be at exactly the right height.
Try to instead add some uncertainty. For example:</p>

<pre><code>UNCERTAINTY = 10
if theball.y+BH - UNCERTAINTY &lt;= thebat.y &lt;= theball.y+BH + UNCERTAINTY and ...
</code></pre>
