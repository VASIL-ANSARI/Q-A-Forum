<p>Even though it's not advised you still can add multiple values to a cookie and do the processing yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>(This will reduce the amount of cookies kept in the browser but since
  modern browsers are designed to
  process huge loads of cookies it
  wouldn't do anything to the speed of
  loading)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can add your value using a loop and separate them using a special character like '<strong>%</strong>' and you can process your string on any encryption method you prefer and save all as one single cookie.</p>

<pre><code>var setofcookies = username + "%" + password + "%" + email;
$.cookie("MyTestCookie", setofcookies, { expires: 10 });
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Later you can use the <strong>SPLIT</strong> function to get the code into proper array value:</p>

<pre><code>var cookie = $.cookie('MyTestCookie')
var mycookies = cookie.split("%");
document.write(mycookies[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>This is the most appropriate method you can use to process cookies, other methods will slightly slow down the page.</p>
