<p>The "tagName" attribute of a DOM element will tell you what sort of DOM element it is. I don't know of any good way to check to see if a reference is to a "window" instance other than by duck-typing.</p>

<p>Rather than check to see what a reference <em>is</em>, perhaps you should be checking to see what the object can <em>do</em>, or appears to be able to do.  What exactly are you trying to accomplish by determining the nature of an object?</p>

<p>Because Javascript objects are so malleable, even if you determine an object is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> DOM instance doesn't necessarily tell you everything about it, because code may have altered the properties of the object beyond recognition.</p>
