<p>Using something like GreaseMonkey can lead to unexpected results since GM runs outside of the Browsers Sandbox and GM scripts always run <strong>after</strong> everything else has loaded.</p>

<p>My solution for this would probably be:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Setup a local WebServer</li>
<li>Use "Save page..." to get the page contents, then put them on your localhost</li>
<li>Now add your script to the page etc. and make it work</li>
</ol>

<p>That gives you A) A flexible development environment and B) more "realworld" results, hell you can even edit you hosts file to use the same URL that your client's page has (of course you need to re-edit the file if you want to visit the original page) and C) you can test in IE etc. too.</p>
