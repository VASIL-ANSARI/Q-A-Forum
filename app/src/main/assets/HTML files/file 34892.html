<p>Hey I did something similar but ...</p>

<p>I have places stored in my Database and I do not have longitudes/latitudes. So i calculate them at run-time from the google api's</p>

<p>I have used this KML file for this and the following mentioned library.</p>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/geoxml3/wiki/Usage" rel="nofollow">https://code.google.com/p/geoxml3/wiki/Usage</a></p>

<p>You have to use your database to build a KML file then place that KML file from some accessible location and use the Geoxml KML processor of the above link
Hope it helps</p>
