<p>Yes, Swing was designed to use <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/keybinding.html">Key Bindings</a>. So instead of adding an ActionListener to the button you add an Action. Then that Action can be shared by the button or a menu item. You can also assign any number of KeyStrokes to invoke the Action by using the KeyBindings. The tutorial also has a section on Actions which explains why using an Action is beneficial.</p>

<p>JComponent has a registerKeyboardAction(...) method which basically does the InputMap/ActionMap bindings for you, but it also has to wrap the ActionListener in a wrapper Action so its preferrable for you to do you own bindings.</p>
