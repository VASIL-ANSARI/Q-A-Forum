<p>Yes, it is a bug.  The Swift compiler has a problem determining the type of <code>popularTableData</code> in this case.  Give it some help by explicitly declaring the type:</p>

<pre><code>let popularTableData: [[String: AnyObject]] = [
</code></pre>

<p>I placed your code in a Playground, and it eventually worked (after over a minute).  The compile time seems to increase exponentially with each extra dictionary element added to the array.  When you tell the compiler the type, it compiles quickly.</p>
