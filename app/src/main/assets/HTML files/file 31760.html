<p>Preloading atlases every time you create a new sprite is generally a bad idea.</p>

<p>Your actual problem seems to be that you preload the atlases but you don't keep them around. Unless the atlas variables are global.</p>

<p>As soon as the method that does the preloading returns, the atlas objects are now longer referenced and will be removed from memory automatically. Sprite Kit internally implements a caching system so you won't notice it right away but eventually one or more of the atlases will be gone.</p>

<p>Keep a strong reference to each atlas in your scene so that the atlases remain in memory, and stop preloading at runtime. Whether this helps with fps I don't know.</p>
