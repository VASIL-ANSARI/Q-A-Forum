<p>You are reloading the page every time you go onto a new page, so you need to pass the search term into the page again. The easiest way to do this is to update your link for pagination to the following:</p>

<pre><code>echo " &lt;a href='{$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']}?searchkeywords=" . $_REQUEST["searchkeywords"] . "&amp;pagenum=$counter'&gt;$counter&lt;/a&gt; ";
</code></pre>

<p>$_REQUEST will handle both $_POST and $_GET variables, but you may want to do this in your own way. Simply put you just need to pass the searchkeywords back into your url</p>
