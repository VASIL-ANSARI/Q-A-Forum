<p>I'll assume that you're trying to select by value and not by index since <code>catObj.ParentId</code> is likely to contain a CategoryId. In case my assuption is correct, you'll need to do this</p>

<pre><code>dropCat.SelectedValue = catObj.ParentId.ToString();
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.dropdownlist.selectedindex%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>DropDownList.SelectedIndex</code></a> property refers to a position inside Items collection and not about the value of the item.</p>
