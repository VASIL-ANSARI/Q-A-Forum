<p>You can only access fields in another class. A better approach is to pass the data you want to use, which is what you actually did.</p>

<pre><code>void printNamaMatkul(String[] words){
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The name of the parameter doesn't have to match the argument you passed to it. i.e. you can write</p>

<pre><code>printNamaMatkul(namaMk);
</code></pre>

<p>but it would make more sense to make the name of the method generic</p>

<pre><code>void printArray(String[] words){
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words));
}

printArray(namaMk);
</code></pre>
