<p>Create a class that loads all the scripts into an array. This class does not necessarily have to be a MonoBehaviour, but for this example it will be. </p>

<p>You have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drag and drop the scripts into the array via the <em>Editor</em>.</li>
<li><p>Or put all the scripts in the <code>Resources/Scripts/</code> folder so that they can be loaded at run time.</p>

<pre><code>public class ScriptManager : MonoBehaviour 
{
   public Object [] list;

   void Awake()
   {
       // Comment this line if you used step 1 above.
       list = Resources.LoadAll("Scripts"); 

       gameObject.AddComponent(list[0].name);
   }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can use your own logic to determine which <code>GameObject</code> gets which <code>Script</code>, but that should be trivially easy for you. </p>
