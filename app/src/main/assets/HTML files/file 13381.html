<p>Apparently I was looking at some badly out of date documentation.</p>

<p>in <code>AmazonS3Client</code> see:</p>

<pre><code>- (S3MultipartUpload * AmazonS3Client)initiateMultipartUploadWithKey:(NSString *)theKey withBucket:(NSString *)theBucket    
</code></pre>

<p>Which will give you a <code>S3MultipartUpload</code> which will contain an <strong>uploadId</strong>.</p>

<p>You can then put together an S3UploadPartRequest using <code>initWithMultipartUpload:        (S3MultipartUpload *)   multipartUpload</code> and send that as you usually would.</p>

<p>S3UploadPartRequest contains an int property partNumber where you can specify the part # you're uploading.</p>
