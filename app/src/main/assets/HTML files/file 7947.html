<p>If you want to end up with a single file named animals.las containing the contents of *.las, then you can change the scanFiles function to open animals.las at the start of the loop, write the translated output of each *.las file to animals.las, and then close animals.las:</p>

<pre><code>def scanFiles(dir): 
    fout = open("animals.las", "w")
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(dir):
        for file in files:
            if '.las' in file:
            # read the file
                fin = open(file, "r")
                str2 = fin.read()
                fin.close()
            # call the function and get the changed text
                str3 = replace_words(str2, word_dic)
            # write changed text back out
                fout.write(str3)
                #time.sleep(1)
    fout.close()
</code></pre>
