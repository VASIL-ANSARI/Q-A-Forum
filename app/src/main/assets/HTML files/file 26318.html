<p>You don't need to escape the <code>=</code> sign. And you should also include a whitespace inside your character class.</p>

<p>Apart from that, you also need a quantifier on your character class to match multiple occurrences. Try with this regex:</p>

<pre><code>Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("=+[A-Za-z ]+=+");
</code></pre>

<p>You can also increase the flexibility to accept any characters in between two <code>==</code>'s, by using <code>.+?</code> (You need reluctant quantifier with <code>.</code> to stop it from matching everything till the last <code>==</code>) or <code>[^=]+</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("=+[^=]+=+");
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>If the number of <code>=</code>'s are same on both sides, then you need to modify your regex to use capture group, and backreference:</p>

<pre><code>"(=+)[^=]+\\1"
</code></pre>
