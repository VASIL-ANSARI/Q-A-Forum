<p>You cannot share objects between Isolates. From <a href="http://v8.paulfryzel.com/docs/master/classv8_1_1_isolate.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Isolate represents an isolated instance of the V8 engine. V8 isolates have completely separate states. Objects from one isolate must not be used in other isolates. The embedder can create multiple isolates and use them in parallel in multiple threads. An isolate can be entered by at most one thread at any given time. The Locker/Unlocker API must be used to synchronize.</p>
