<p>It seems the issue is related to missing files during VS 2015 setup due to the choices I did during setup.</p>

<p>All I did was creating a new Project and choose Windows 8 template. Then the VS 2015 setup is launch and the missing packages are properly installed.</p>

<p>After doing that, I could open my VS 2013 Project in VS 2015 like a charm.</p>
