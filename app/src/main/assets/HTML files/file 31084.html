<p>You don't need to ensure you're reading full lines. </p>

<p>Read the file by chunks into a buffer.</p>

<p>Process each line from your buffer character by character, until you reach a newline character. If you're on a line and reach the end of the buffer, keep that portion around, read the next chunk, and concatenate everything from the new read up to a newline with the left overs from the previous read.</p>

<p>If the very last byte of the buffer is a new-line, you have a whole line and can simply move on the the next chunk. If not, read the next chunk - either the first byte will be a new-line, or you'll have other characters before it. Either way, concat everything up to the newline (even if that means 0 characters) and start on the next.</p>

<p>If you hit the end of file after a newline, you're done. If you hit the end of file while processing non-newline characters, it's up to you whether you want to keep them as a valid line or discard them.</p>

<p>This is very similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer" rel="nofollow">circular buffer</a>.</p>

<p>Another solution might be to use a <code>BufferedStream</code> and specify the buffer size. Then just read byte by byte to each newline or EOF.</p>
