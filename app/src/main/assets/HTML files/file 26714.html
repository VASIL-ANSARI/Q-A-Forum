<p>This is a <a href="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14863" rel="nofollow">bug</a> because reflection is used to call an internal <code>Expression&lt;TDelegate&gt;</code> constructor. </p>

<p>The linker cannot analyze reflection usage (it's beyond static analysis) so it must be aware of those <em>special</em> cases.</p>

  <p>This is obviously untenable, though, because the binary becomes enormous.</p>

<p>Keep using the default <strong>Link SDK</strong> option but add the <code>--linkskip=System.Core</code> to your <strong>Additional mtouch arguments</strong>, inside your <strong>Project Options</strong>, <strong>iOS Build</strong>.</p>

<p>That way only System.Core (from the SDK) will not be linked and the increase in size will be much smaller. Of course this is only a workaround until a new version fix the issue properly.</p>
