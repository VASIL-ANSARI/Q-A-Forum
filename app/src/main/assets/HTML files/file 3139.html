<p>A <code>DateTime</code> doesn't know about a time zone. Even <code>DateTimeOffset</code> doesn't really know about a time zone - it knows about a UTC instant and an offset from that.</p>

<p>You can write your own struct which <em>does</em> have a <code>TimeZoneInfo</code> and a <code>DateTime</code>, but I'm not sure you need it in this case. Are you <em>just</em> trying to schedule 5pm in Eastern time, or is this actually more general? What are you doing with the <code>DateTime</code> (or whatever) afterwards? Using <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and <code>TimeZoneInfo</code> you can definitely get the UTC instant of the time you're interested in; if you just need to know the time between "now" and then, that's fairly easy.</p>

<p>I feel duty-bound to point out that when <a href="http://code.google.com/p/noda-time" rel="nofollow">Noda Time</a> is production-ready, it would almost certainly be the right answer :)</p>
