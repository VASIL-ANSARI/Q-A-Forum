<p>In terms of urls</p>

<p>Option 2 feels natural, since it is account-specific information that you are fetching. Option 3 is decent, but clumsy. And definitely not Option 1.</p>

<p>I understand your concerns around having a single controller in Option 2. Infact you can still have a QuestionController and AnswerController, and use routing rules (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9905343/create-sub-folders-in-the-controller-without-areas" title="see this">1</a>) to retain the nice urls that option 2 gives.</p>
