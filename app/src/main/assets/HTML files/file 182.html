<p><a href="http://www.systemnetmail.com/">http://www.systemnetmail.com/</a> is probably the most absurdly complete site dedicated to a <em>single</em> .NET namespace...but it has EVERYTHING you could ever want to know about sending mail via .NET, be it ASP.NET or Desktop.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.systemwebmail.com/">http://www.systemwebmail.com/</a> was the original URL in the post, but should not be used for .NET 2.0 and above.</em></p>
