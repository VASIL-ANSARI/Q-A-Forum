<p>I do not know of a custom provider that handles it any better, but one way i handled this in the past was to set session sliding expiration much higher than authentication timeout in web.config. That way I only ever had one scenario to deal with: losing auth token but valid session. Much easier to handle it with 
if(!User.IsAuthenticated)
{...do whatever and go to sign in page...}</p>
