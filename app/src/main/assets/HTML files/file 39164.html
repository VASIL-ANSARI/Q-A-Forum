<p>I don't think you want more than one web view. I think when you tap on a cell you would bring up the same web view, but it would point to a different url. You would just change the url it points to before you display the web view again:</p>

<pre><code>[webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://google.com"]]];
</code></pre>
