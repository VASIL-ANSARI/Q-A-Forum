<p>You are missing the <code>s</code> on the target line (i.e. you have <code>pthread:</code>). So your rule isn't being run. The default (built-in) make rule is (and that rule doesn't have the <code>-lpthread</code> bit).</p>

<p>You can either fix your typo or put <code>-lpthread</code> in <code>LDLIBS</code> and let the built-in rule do the compilation and linking for you.</p>
