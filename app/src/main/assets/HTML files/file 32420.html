<p>Something like this, using SUM but with an IF inside the SUM:-</p>

<pre><code>SELECT user_name, 
        SUM(IF(sim_id = 1, request_amount, 0)) AS sim_id1,
        SUM(IF(sim_id = 2, request_amount, 0)) AS sim_id2,
        SUM(IF(sim_id = 3, request_amount, 0)) AS sim_id3,
        SUM(sim_id) AS total
FROM user_request
GROUP BY user_name
</code></pre>
