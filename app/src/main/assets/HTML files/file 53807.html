<p>Since what you are trying to achieve is to filter a list of results, I suggest you use angularJs filters</p>

<p>I prepared a jsfiddle for you with a simple example:
<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/fb0r7z0q/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/fb0r7z0q/</a></p>

<p>This is the key line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li ng-repeat="entry in phonebook | filter:qname"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>qname being your $scope.lastName</p>
