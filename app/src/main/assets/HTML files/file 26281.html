<p>I believe you need to <code>JOIN</code> on the <code>companies</code> field</p>

<pre><code>String queryString = "FROM Country AS model JOIN model.companies AS company WHERE company.id= ?";
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on what you want to return, you can use a <code>SELECT</code></p>

<pre><code>String queryString = "SELECT model FROM Country AS model JOIN model.companies AS company WHERE company.id= ?";
</code></pre>
