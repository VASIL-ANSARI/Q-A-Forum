<p>It is not quite clear to me why you are talking about binding Enum values via the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraEditorsButtonEdittopic" rel="nofollow">RepositoryItemButtonEdit</a> exactly, because this editor is not intended to work with Enum values.  </p>

<p>So, to bind Enum values, I suggest you use the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraEditorsImageComboBoxEdittopic" rel="nofollow">RepositoryItemImageComboBox</a> editor. This editor is specially designed to work with Enums - just try to use it's <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraEditorsControlsImageComboBoxItemCollection_AddEnumtopic(7lgsNg)" rel="nofollow">AddEnum(Type)</a> method as follows:</p>

<pre><code>imageComboBoxEdit1.Properties.Items.AddEnum(typeof(YourEnumType));
</code></pre>
