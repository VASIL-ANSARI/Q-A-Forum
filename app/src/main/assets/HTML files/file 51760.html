<p><a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/" rel="nofollow">Marathon</a> can do <strong>2)</strong> with any app deployed in a <a href="https://www.docker.com/" rel="nofollow">docker</a> container. Marathon does not currently do auto-scaling based on traffic.</p>

<p>Marathon requires a <a href="https://mesos.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Mesos</a> cluster and a <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Zookeeper</a> cluster.</p>

<p>Marathon will run multiple instances of your docker image on your Mesos cluster and restart any that fail. Your docker images need to provide Marathon with a health-check endpoint. If the health-check fails, Marathon will kill the docker instance and start a new one.</p>
