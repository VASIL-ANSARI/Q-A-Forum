<p>I'm not sure if this classifies as a memory leak exactly. You are essentially using recursion without a terminating case. Before the crawl_page() method finishes it calls _processAnchors(), which in turn may call crawl_page() again if it finds any links (very likely). Every recursive call eats up more memory because the originating crawl_page() call (and most thereafter) can't be removed from the call stack until all of its recursive calls terminate.</p>
