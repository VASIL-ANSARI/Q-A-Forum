<p>This is how:</p>

<pre><code>var items = await graphClient.Me.Drive.Root
                  .ItemWithPath("/this/is/the/path").Children.Request().GetAsync();
</code></pre>

<p>Use just the plain path. Don't include the ":", and don't include the "/drive/root:/".</p>

<p>it was obvious, now that I see it...</p>
