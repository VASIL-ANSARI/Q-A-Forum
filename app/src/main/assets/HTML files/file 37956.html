<p>To wit, Ã© <em>is</em> the regular alphabet in several languages =) While you're suggesting you would like to know how to covert the text to ASCII (which English speakers may consider 'regular') what you really should be doing is working with the modern web's most permissive encoding, which is UTF8.</p>

<p>That way, you will be able to accept input in any language, save it, process it, and serve it back up, without needing to normalise or ill-convert to another codepage.</p>

<p>Serve your pages with <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> in the source code, and an http content header to indicate UTF8 encoding, and things should go a lot smoother. (note that for the now defunct HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1/1.1 you will need to use the older meta tag syntax. Using those flavours for new projects is, however, very much not recommended)</p>
