<p>You should really be using <code>NSURLComponents</code> to create URLs rather than trying to format them into a string. </p>

<pre><code>  NSDictionary* jsonDict = @{@"clean": @"2", @"raw": @"2", @"status": @"0"};
  NSData* jsonData = [NSJSONSerialization dataWithJSONObject:jsonDict options:0 error:NULL];
  NSString* jsonString = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:jsonData encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
  NSURLComponents* components = [[NSURLComponents alloc] init];
  components.scheme = @"ms-test-app";
  components.queryItems = @[
                        [[NSURLQueryItem alloc] initWithName:@"eventSourceId" value:eventSourceId],
                        [[NSURLQueryItem alloc] initWithName:@"eventID" value:@(_eventId).stringValue],
                        [[NSURLQueryItem alloc] initWithName:@"json" value:jsonString]
                        ];
  NSURL* url = components.URL;
</code></pre>

<p>Once you build the URL that way, it becomes apparent that your string doesn't have a host portion (or more accurately, one of your parameters is being used as the host portion).</p>

<p>The other comments about not being able to send JSON as an URL parameter are incorrect. As long as the system on the other side that is parsing the query string can handle it, you can send anything you want as an URL parameter.</p>
