<p>One approach would be to create a Map in which each of your strings corresponds to its index: <code>{"January" : 0, "February : 1, ...}</code>. Then you write a Comparator that takes two strings, looks them both up in the map, and then compares the resulting ints. What you do with Strings that don't appear in the map is a question -- you should probably either throw an exception if you know it shouldn't ever happen, or put all of those miscellaneous strings at the beginning or end of the sorted list (and probably in some deterministic order, like alphabetical).</p>
