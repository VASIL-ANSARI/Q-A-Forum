<p>Inside a jQuery <code>.each()</code> callback, <code>this</code> is always set by jQuery so it won't be what <code>this</code> was in a higher level scope.  If you need to access the value of <code>this</code> from the higher level scope, then the usual work-around is to save it to a local variable at that higher level scope and you can then access that local variable from within the <code>.each()</code> callback function.</p>

<p>From the code snippet you included in your answer, it is not clear what <code>this</code> value you want to access.  You may also need to know that call a regular function such as calling <code>getInvitations()</code> will change the <code>this</code> pointer to point to either the global object or in strict mode to <code>undefined</code>.  <code>this</code> is set by the javascript interpreter on every function call based on how the function call is made.</p>
