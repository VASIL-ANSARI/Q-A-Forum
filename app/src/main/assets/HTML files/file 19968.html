<p>I recently came up with a solution. It's maybe more complex than what you are looking for but here are the basics:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are two projects: a library and game that uses the library</li>
<li>The idea is many games can use the same library (where I keep the common Java/XML code)</li>
<li>On a single screen I can display both preferences from the common library code and game-specific code</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote a detailed blog <a href="http://pilcrowpipe.blogspot.jp/2012/12/modular-approach-to-implementing.html" rel="nofollow">article</a>, along with sample code and 2 Eclipse projects.</p>
