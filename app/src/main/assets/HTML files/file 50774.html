<p>It happens because you create a new Good object without id. So Hibernate will generate a new id and persist the new object. If you don't want to create a new object, but only assign an already existing one, you either have to fetch the existing one from the database and assign it to the ShoppingCart oder add the ID if you create the new Good object.</p>
