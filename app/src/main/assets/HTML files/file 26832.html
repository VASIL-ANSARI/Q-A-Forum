<p>The easiest workaround I've found is to wrap the view controller you want to present inside a navigation controller, and then present that navigation controller.</p>

<pre><code>MyViewController *vc = [MyViewController new];
UINavigationController *nav = [[UINavigationController alloc] 
    initWithRootViewController:vc];
[self presentViewController:nav animated:YES completion:NULL];
</code></pre>

<h3>Advantages:</h3>

<ul>
<li>No mucking with frames needed.</li>
<li>Same code works on iOS 6 an iOS 7.</li>
<li>Less ugly than the other workarounds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>

<ul>
<li>You'll probably want to leave your XIB empty of navigation bars or toolbars, and programatically add UIBarButtonItems to the navigation bar.  Fortunately this is pretty easy.</li>
</ul>
