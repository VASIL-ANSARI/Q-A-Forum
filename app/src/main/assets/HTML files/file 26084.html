<p>You need to use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644990%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">SetWindowsHookEx</a> function and specify the hook type as *WH_MOUSE_LL* (14). Have the following declaration.</p>

<pre><code>Public Structure Point
    Public X As Integer
    Public Y As Integer
End Structure

Public Structure Msllhookstruct
    Public Location As Point
    Public MouseData As Integer
    Public Flags As Integer
    Public Time As Integer
    Public ExtraInfo As Integer
End Structure

Private Delegate Function HookProc(nCode As Integer, wParam As Integer, ByRef lParam As Msllhookstruct) As Integer

&lt;DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError:=True)&gt; _
Private Function SetWindowsHookEx(ByVal hookType As Integer, ByVal lpfn As HookProc, ByVal hMod As IntPtr, ByVal dwThreadId As UInteger) As IntPtr
End Function

&lt;DllImport("user32.dll")&gt; _
Private Function CallNextHookEx(ByVal hhk As IntPtr, ByVal nCode As Integer, ByVal wParam As IntPtr, ByRef lParam As Msllhookstruct) As IntPtr
End Function

Private Hook As IntPtr
</code></pre>

<p>In your initialising routine, use it as follow</p>

<pre><code>Hook = SetWindowsHookEx(14, AddressOf Proc, Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.BaseAddress.ToInt32(), 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>Proc</code> is a function callback like so:</p>

<pre><code>Private Function Proc(nCode As Integer, wParam As Integer, ByRef lParam As Msllhookstruct) As IntPtr
    If wParam = 522 Then
        Dim Delta = CShort(lParam.MouseData &gt;&gt; 16)

        If Delta &gt; 0 Then
            ' Up
        ElseIf Delta &lt; 0 Then
            ' Down
        End If
    End If

    Return CallNextHookEx(Hook, nCode, wParam, lParam)
End Function
</code></pre>
