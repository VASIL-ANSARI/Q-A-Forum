<p>In case there is never more than one matching row in table attributes, the queries do the same. It's just two ways to query the same data. Both querys are fine and straight-forward.</p>

<p>In case there can be more than one match, query one (which is using a correlated subquery) would fail. It would be inappropriate for the given task then.</p>

<p>The query with the outer join is easier to extend, when you want a second column from the attributes table.</p>

<p>The first query makes it crystal-clear that you expect zero or one matches in table attributes for each item. In case of data inconsistency or if you have an error in your query such as a forgotten criteria, it will fail, which is good.</p>

<p>The second query would simply retrieve more rows in case of such error, which may not be desired.</p>

<p>So it's a matter of personal preference and of your choice how the query is to deal with inconsistencies which query to choose.</p>
