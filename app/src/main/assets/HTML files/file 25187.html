<p>There was no way to make the <code>html()</code> method replace the html correctly in IE10, although I never did find out exactly why. I ended up writing both elements into the table cell, set <code>style="display:none"</code> for one of them and use <code>show()</code> / <code>hide()</code> and that's good enough for me (and apparently for IE10 as well).</p>

<p>For anyone encountering the same issue: this is a <strong>workaround</strong>, not a solution in the strictest sense.</p>
