<p>I'll bet at least a nickel <code>eval('self', abinding)</code> will work:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/ruby1.8

class Foo

  def foo
    binding
  end

end

p eval('self', Foo.new.foo)    # =&gt; #&lt;Foo:0xb7bfe5ac&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works because if you pass a binding to eval, it evaluates the string in the context of that binding.  <code>self</code> in the context of the binding is whatever <code>self</code> was when the binding was created.</p>
