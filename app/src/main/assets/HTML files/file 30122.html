<p>Unfortunately you can only have one active route at the time. I had the same problem. There's an experimental version that let's you use a sub-router with an independent route, but it's not worth the trouble. </p>

<p>What you're currently doing works fine. However, you need to define the action inside an actions object. </p>

<pre><code>VpcYeoman.WorkflowEditorController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({
  actions: {
    renderisAppCompleteTemplate: function() {
      */ nothing yet */
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
