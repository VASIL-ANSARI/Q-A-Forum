<p>I think you have three options, none being bullet proof:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Share somehow the common entities. For example it is pretty clear that the Customer entity is used in every package. Of course the best way is to package all entities in an entity jar and provide it when selling other packages. After all you sell the business logic, not the entity mapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Make some ugly abstractions, getting rid of the FKs. In this way you will have to change the code. E.g instead of relating entities from other modules, you could use an embedded (relatedEntityClass, relatedEntityId). With this solution you will have problems when you'll need to join/ eager load the other entity, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Sell the entire code and use some passwords/online activation for enabling modules.</p></li>
</ol>
