<p>try this </p>

<pre><code>         class AutoDialer&lt;T&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Generic type should be defined for the whole class first</p>

<p>you have the same problem in Node class</p>

<p>and in your test methods you need to specify the type as these methods are static and you cant pass type to them even if you define it for their class</p>
