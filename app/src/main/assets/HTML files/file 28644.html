<p>I would comment with this, but I don't have enough reputation. So - I'm not sure why you can't log into your server, but are you sure that you don't have delimiters? Because if you're using <code>\x01</code> as a delimiter in FIX, the tag-values pairs will usually just be displayed as "all mashed together," but the hex dump of it reveals otherwise (coming from personal experience).

Also, you might be getting downvoted because you haven't provided much context. If you provided the relevant bit of code or what your FIX output looks like, that might help.</p>
