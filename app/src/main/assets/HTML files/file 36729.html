<p>I found <a href="http://www.doubleencore.com/2013/06/tutorial-finding-calls-to-uniqueidentifier-in-your-ios-app/" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a> which explains, among other things, how to create a shell script in your project's root to find the offending selector. </p>

<p>Here's the script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
for match in $(grep -lR uniqueIdentifier *); do
    printf "File: %s\n****************************************\n\n" "$match"
    strings $match | grep --context=15 uniqueIdentifier
    printf "\n\n\n"
done
</code></pre>

<p>Just replace <code>uniqueIdentifier</code> with whatever selector you need to find.</p>

<p>Turns out all three of those selectors were from a beta analytics library I included months ago and wasn't even using. This was an old project I resurrected.</p>
