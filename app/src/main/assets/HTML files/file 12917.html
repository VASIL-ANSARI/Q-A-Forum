<p>I don't know if it is possible to assign events to a polyline node, but you can add a marker object at the same location of the node and assign an event to that.</p>

<p>I altered Google's <code>polyline-complex.html</code> example to also remove nodes as well as add them.</p>

<p>In this example Google adds markers to a map when the user left-clicks on the map and then connects the markers with a polyline.  I added a right-click listener to the marker that removes the node from the polyline.</p>

<p>Here is the code: (Here is a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/MwVLG/" rel="nofollow">fiddle example</a> to see the full code working)</p>

<pre><code>//after the marker is created in the addLatLng function
google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'rightclick', removeLatLng);
</code></pre>

<p>...</p>

<pre><code>//function to remove node.
function removeLatLng(event) {
    //remove the marker from the map
    this.setMap(null);
    //get the polyline array
    var path = poly.getPath();
    //iterate over the array and remove the point that matches the marker coords.
    path.forEach(function(element, idx) {
        if (event.latLng == element) {
            path.removeAt(idx);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The trick is you need to have the array index of the node you want removed.  Without having the marker the right-click event may not return the exact coords of the node and make it difficult to find the index. </p>

<p>If you don't like the marker graphic for use as a node you can customize the icon property with a custom *.png file to represent the node.</p>
