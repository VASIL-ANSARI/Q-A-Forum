  <p>This happens when the user clicks but its a bit irritating to happen every time so I want to make it only on a double click</p>

<p>You use a <code>MouseListener</code>, not a ListSelectionListener. You would check the Mouse event for a click count of 2.</p>

<p>Read the section from the Swing tutorial on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/mouselistener.html" rel="nofollow">How to Write a MouseLister</a> for more information and working examples.</p>

<p>Also, a double click will start the editor by default so you want to make sure the cell is not editable. So you may need to override the <code>isCellEditable(...)</code> method of the table.</p>
