<p>The <code>glReadPixels()</code> function reads the contents of a framebuffer from the current context.  Once <code>eglSwapBuffers()</code> is called, the contents are gone.</p>

<p>Put another way, apps can't read anything out of a SurfaceView.  So you have to read the pixels out just before you submit the buffer to the compositor.</p>

<p>(I'm not actually sure what happens if you call <code>glReadPixels()</code> right after swapping buffers... it's possible you'll read a previously-sent frame from a recycled buffer, but you can't always rely on that.)</p>

<p>You appear to be calling <code>glReadPixels()</code> from the main UI thread.  If the SurfaceView rendering is occurring on a different thread, you would need to access the framebuffer from that same thread, because that's where the EGL context is current.  A given context can't be current in more than one thread at a time.</p>
