<p>changing anything in /etc/ld.so.conf <em>without</em> running ldconfig will cause problems.  In this case I don't know how things got out of sync but you can not assume that the current state of ld.so.conf reflects what is happening at run time.</p>

<p>Pointing me at strace was useful (thanks!) I started hacking ld.conf and nothing I did made any difference.  Then a colleague pointed me to ldconfig.</p>
