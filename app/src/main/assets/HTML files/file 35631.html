<p>I can't find anything like that in the code snippet, so I'm going to suggest the following:</p>

<p>Create a variable, maybe something like</p>

<pre><code>show_text = False

#more code
#while loop
    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        if event.key == pygame.K_e:
            if show_text == True:
                show_text = False
                #code to disable the text display
            else:
                show_text = True
                #code to enable text display
</code></pre>

<p>Where is</p>

<pre><code>Funk.text_to_screen()
</code></pre>

<p>coming from? Haven't ever seen that. I would have used the font or freetype module to create the text surface and then blit it or not depending on whether the variable has been toggled or not.</p>
