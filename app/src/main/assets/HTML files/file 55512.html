<p>Start out by assuming that the first student is the one that's closest.</p>

<p>Then, go through all students other than the first one. If that student is closer than your current best, switch your current best to that student.</p>

<p>When you're finished, the student you think is the best will be the actual best one.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>1) Create two variables, one which tracks which student we think is the best, called "current_best" and one that track hows close that student is to the average, called "current_diff".</p>

<p>2) Set current_best to the first student and current_diff to the first student's difference from the average.</p>

<p>3) Loop over all the students but the first. For each student, check if that student is closer to the average than current_diff. If so, set current_best to that student and current_diff to that student's difference from the average.</p>

<p>4) The current_best indicates the student whose score is closest to the average.</p>

<p>Note that ties are not handled.</p>
