<p>According to <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/SocketTimeoutException.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>  - "This exception is thrown when a timeout expired on a socket read or accept operation." You can catch both SocketTimeOutException and ConnectionTimeOutException separately.</p>
