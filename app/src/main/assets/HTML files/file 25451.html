<p>According to documentation, <code>setCaptureRate(double fps)</code> is used to set time lapse recording, with audio ignored. It is most useful if you want less fps than the system can actually provide. You ask more fps than the system can provide, here is a quote from <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder.html#setCaptureRate%28double%29" rel="nofollow">developer.android.com/reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the recorder cannot guarantee that frames will be captured
  at the given rate due to camera/encoder limitations. However it tries
  to be as close as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What your code does not call, is <code>setVideoFrameRate(int rate)</code>. I believe that using this function, your recording will be fixed.</p>
