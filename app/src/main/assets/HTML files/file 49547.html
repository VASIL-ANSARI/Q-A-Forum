<p>Since all of your numbers will be (ultimately) reduced to a single digit, you <em>must</em> be having repetition after certain number of terms, and, that is maximum of 9. (because 10 digits, but 0 not possible to repeat).</p>

<p>So, lets start with an example. Say, <code>a=14, d=7, l=2, r=50</code>. I've changed the value of <code>r</code> from your example.</p>

<p>So, trying to find repetition:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our repetition array is <code>q</code> (say). Then, 1st term of <code>q</code> is <code>5</code> (since 14 = 5).</li>
<li>Now, next term is 21 (= 3). Since 3 is not equal to 5, we continue.</li>
<li><p>We find all terms till we get 5 again. So, <code>q</code> will be like this in this example:</p>

<pre><code>q[] = {5,3,1,8,6,4,2,9,7}   ...  and then we have 5 again, so stop.
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>So, our repetitive pattern has 9 members. Now, find a cumulative sum array with this, which will be like:</p>

<pre><code>sum[] = {5,8,9,17,23,27,29,38,45}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, since <code>r=50</code>, find sum of <code>r</code> terms, which will be:</p>

<pre><code>(floor)(50/9) * 45 + sum[50%9]
= 5 * 45 + 23
= 248
</code></pre>

<p>Now, similarly, find sum of <code>l-1</code> terms, (since you have to find sum in range <code>l..r</code> inclusive.</p>

<p>Sum of 1st (2-1) = 1 terms will be:</p>

<pre><code>(floor)(1/9) * 45 + sum[1 % 9]
= 0 + 5
= 5
</code></pre>

<p>So, the answer is, 248 - 5 = 243.</p>
