<p>There are two reasons for this problem to happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Errors on the Joomla website (perhaps caused by a non-core plugin). Try disabling non-core plugins (from phpMyAdmin) one by one and see if the problem is resolved.</li>
<li>ACL issues caused by a wrong modification to your ACL</li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing I would check is the ACL (in the database) and make sure that everything's correct.</p>
