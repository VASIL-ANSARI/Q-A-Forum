<p>I think i found solution. The case was: parrent of component had match_parent wich is full screen ( and nothing more ). ImageView was cliped to parent size. I solved it by adding ScrollView as parent, and disabling scroll function by adding onTouchListener:</p>

<pre><code>    sView.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {

        @Override
        public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub
            return true;
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>This is for sure not nice method to solve it - but it worked.</p>
