<p>As some people said in the linked post, it's not true that MD5hash(part1 + part2) = MD5hash(part1) + MD5hash(part2).
Maybe try this solution: <a href="http://www.joel.lopes-da-silva.com/2010/09/07/compute-md5-or-sha-hash-of-large-file-efficiently-on-ios-and-mac-os-x/" rel="nofollow">http://www.joel.lopes-da-silva.com/2010/09/07/compute-md5-or-sha-hash-of-large-file-efficiently-on-ios-and-mac-os-x/</a> . I haven't tested it, but the code should work for you. You're feeding subsequent parts of your file into CC_MD5_Update(...) and to get the final hash, just call CC_MD5_Final(...). It's probably the only way you can process large files, if that's your aim.</p>

<p>Sorry if I'm missing something.</p>
