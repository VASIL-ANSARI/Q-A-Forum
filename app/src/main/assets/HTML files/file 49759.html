<p>You are getting a memory error probably because your matrix is too big, or you don't have enough available RAM memory in your computer. </p>

<p>You can try to iterate across all your text files, so you just need to create a matrix like:</p>

<pre><code>matrix = np.zeros(shape=(15985))
</code></pre>

<p>and then save the result to a file for every of your texts.</p>
