<p>First of all, any kind of sleep function wont help you: it freezes an entire thread, not an object. If you don't know what a thread is and how you use them, then your program is single-threaded and the entire program will freeze when you call sleep function.</p>

<p>Then, when you erase something from a deque, <code>deque::erase()</code> returns an iterator to a next object in the queue. This is useful when you iterate over a queue in a loop and you want to delete something.</p>

<p>If you want to copy an object somewhere, you need to do it first. After you delete it, there is no way to make a copy.</p>

<p>Finally, about wrapper classes: I have no idea why would you need to use them here. You can manually add an object to a different queue before you delete if from the first one.</p>
