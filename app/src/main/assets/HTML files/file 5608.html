<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.file-put-contents.php" rel="nofollow"><code>file_put_contents</code></a> will do that.</p>

<pre><code>file_put_contents('text.txt', null);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can also wipe out the contents of the file by redirecting output to it and writing anything from bash as well. </p>
