<p>64 bit apps are only applicable to the A7 chip (which is 64 bit native) in the iPhone 5s.</p>

<p>I think Apple are thinking of doing fat binaries down the road, but for now, you can build 32 and 64 bit in Xcode 5, depending on your target platform.</p>

<p>To answer your question yes you can support as early a version of iOS as you wish on Xcode5</p>
