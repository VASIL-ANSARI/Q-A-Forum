<p>You have to put <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> as the replacement for the variadic arguments:</p>

<pre><code>#define LOGWRITE_L1(file, ...) LogWrite(file, 1, __FILE__, __FUNCTION__, __VA_ARGS__)
</code></pre>

<p>This is only part of C99, C11 and C++11 standards. Some compilers offer extensions pertaining to the handling of variadic macros; check your manual.</p>
