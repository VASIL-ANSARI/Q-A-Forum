<p>@Chris Lavender is right. You can try it out for yourself. Go to the public interface of a UIViewController subclass and add the property:</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, readwrite) UIViewController* parentViewController;
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get the same warning. And if you check the <code>UIViewController</code> docs, sure enough, that property is already declared as <code>readonly</code>.</p>
