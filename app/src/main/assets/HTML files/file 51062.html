<p>By design, an error causes the signal to finish. The <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/Documentation/DesignGuidelines.md#failures-behave-like-exceptions-and-propagate-immediately" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>failures should only be used to represent âabnormalâ termination. If
  it is important to let operators (or consumers) finish their work, a
  Next event describing the result might be more appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to turn errors into <code>Next</code> events, you can use <code>flatMapError</code> operator as described <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa/blob/master/Documentation/BasicOperators.md#handling-failures" rel="nofollow">here</a> or use <code>retry</code> if you want to allow only several occurances of the error.</p>
