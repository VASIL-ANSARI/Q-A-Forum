<p>The problem was with the way dataTables references the .swf file. It isn't referenced at the top of the page, but within the script for dataTables, and the problem I was having was due to the file structure I am using. I had to move the .swf file to the root folder, reference it there within the dataTables script, and it worked no problem! </p>
