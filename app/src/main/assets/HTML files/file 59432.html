<p>I am not sure what you are trying to achieve but you could reset index and set it as you would like:</p>

<pre><code>In[11]: df
Out[11]: 
   Column1   Column2   Column3
0        1         4         6
1        2         2         6
2        3         3         8
3        4         1         1
4        5         4         2
</code></pre>

<p>so if you want to plot col 2 as X axis and 3 as Y axis you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>df.set_index('Column2')['Column3'].plot()
</code></pre>
