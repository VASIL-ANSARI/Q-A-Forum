<p>This is a poor abstraction - no wonder you're having trouble merging it in.  I'd recommend a BinaryTree class somewhere, preferrably one that uses generics: </p>

<pre><code>public class BinaryTree&lt;T&gt; {
    // What methods do all BinaryTrees need?
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll have an easier time integrating this data structure than what you have.</p>
