<p>I already have this kind of problem with a cyclic dependency, so maybe you can check that.</p>

<p>I also found this, which is similar to your problem : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20061652/android-gradle-library-dependency-with-library-dependency-using-nexus">Android Gradle library dependency with library dependency using Nexus</a></p>

<p>It seems that was an early release bug, so maybe you can try a more recent version of graddle.</p>
