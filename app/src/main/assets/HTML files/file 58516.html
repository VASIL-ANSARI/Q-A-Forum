<p>In your code, you were just testing if the string was longer then 7, and of course when that was checked for more than one time it would break the line. On my code, i'm testing if the position on the string is divisble by 7, with that every time the seventh character is written it will break a line. I'm also using replace because '\n' is character and can't be counted when i'm doing this.</p>
