<p>You have a wrong replication configuration. You have a replication factor of 6 on your datacenter Analytics but this datacenter doesn't exist. Change it to Ana and add your solr cluster. Or you can change it in your snitch configuration. And don't use a replication factor of 6. Use 3 or maybe 4 instead. You have only 5 nodes in your Ana Cluster. A too high replication factor can slow down your cluster extremely. Generally this error will come if something is inconsistent with your snitch or replication configuration.</p>
