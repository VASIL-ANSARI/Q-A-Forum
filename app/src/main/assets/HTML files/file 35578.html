<p>Change your route to simply include the sponsor, don't create individual routes for every sponsor, this is where routing becomes so powerful</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(
    name: null, //routes names must be unique, but you can have multiple named null (go figure)
    url: "{sponsor}/{controller}/{action}/{id}",
    defaults: new
    {
        sponsor = "defaultSponsor", //or whatever you want the default to be
        controller = "Home",
        action = "Index",
        id = UrlParameter.Optional
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>Then, decorate each of your action methods with the sponsor argument</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Index(string sponsor, int id) { }
</code></pre>

<p><em>Rereading your question tho, this doesn't help in the instance of not having a sponsor, unless your "defaultSponsor" is not really a sponsor, but your generic information that is presented. So when no sponsor is passed in the address bar to the routing, you see 'defaultSponsor' or and empty string and could then handle appropriately</em> </p>

<p>Another reason to handle it this way, is RegisterRoutes is only called upon application start up, so if they were dynamically added while the app is running, they would be invalid routes until the application is restarted. By making it an argument, they would work dynamically as well.</p>
