<p>From your stacktrace, I would say LatText is null because you are not using the correct id.</p>

<p>try using <code>LatText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.lat);</code> as defined in your xml layout</p>

<p><strong>OLD ANSWER</strong></p>

<p>I think you are doing things backward here:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>LocationManager.requestLocationUpdates()</code> can take a long time, <strike>it should be done in a background thread.</strike></li>
<li>Starting/finishing an activity or modifying the UI from a background thread is unsafe. You should use the UI thread for that</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use a background thread to request for location, and use <code>runOnUiThread</code> to update your TextViews or start a new activity.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Make sure to stop the thread in the onPause method of your activity!</p>
