<p>No this is not the case. Only one of the switch cases will run in your example. As soon as <code>break</code> is encountered the switch processing ends. Only one branch will match. In PHP I think (but you might want to double check) the first matching case will run.</p>

<p>With multiple possible matches you will need to use a set of <code>if</code> statements (note do not use if...elseif)</p>

<p>I would convert to</p>

<pre><code>if($test &amp; 1) {
    // do stuff
}

if(test &amp; 2) {
    // do stuff
}
</code></pre>
