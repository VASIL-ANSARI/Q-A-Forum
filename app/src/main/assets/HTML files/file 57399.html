<p>From what it seems you are typing it in the constructor. Try typing it out of the constructor? And I dont really know what you are trying to do. To me it looks like there is a function, and in the next picture the function is gone suddenly but there is an autocomplete for it. </p>

<p>So are you sure your parent class has the getParams function? And is it public or protected? My knowledge on inheritance isnt that great anymore, but I remember having problems with private functions.</p>

<p>As you can see this is your code</p>

<pre><code>public RegisterRequest(String name, String username, int age, String password, Response.Listener&lt;String&gt; listener) throws AuthFailureError {
    ....

   getparams 
</code></pre>

<p>But the bracket never closes! So try this:</p>

<pre><code>    public RegisterRequest(String name, String username, int age, String password, Response.Listener&lt;String&gt; listener) throws AuthFailureError {
        super(Method.POST, REGISTER_REQUEST_URL, listener, null);
        params = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        params.put("name", name);
        params.put("username", username);
        params.put("password", password);
        params.put("age", age+ "");
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then type getparams. I dont know if it works, but atleast you have a closed constructor. </p>
