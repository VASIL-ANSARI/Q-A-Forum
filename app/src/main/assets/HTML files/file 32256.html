<p>Thats exactly how one would go about it. It's the way I've done it. thats the great thing about php, you can insert html code in loops to create a dynamic html page based on the content coming in from your database.</p>

<p>This is why php and html go well together, you can form great dynamic pages.</p>

<p>You're on the right track mate. Someone may suggest a more elegant solution that does not mean your solution is false or inefficient. It's even there in the w3Schools tutorial website in the php and mysql section. So you're fine.</p>

<p>Goodluck!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong></p>

<p>One improvement you could do is doing some if checking and return something else if there is no data to show from the database otherwise your webpage will just show a blank page since the while loop wouldnt be executed when there is not data coming from your database.</p>
