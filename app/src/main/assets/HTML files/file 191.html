<p>Active Directory is pretty efficient at storing information and the retrieval shouldn't be that much of a performance hit.  If you are really intent on storing the names, you'll probably want to store them in some sort of a tree stucture, so you can see the relationships of all the people.  Depending on how the number of people, you might as well pull all the information you need daily and then query all the requests against your cached copy.  </p>
