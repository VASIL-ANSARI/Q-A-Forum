<p>You should use a header, or a separate view outside the table view. You can use the same gestures (generally, though not the delete) and data source.</p>

<p>If you want it all, you could use 2 table views- the first with one section and one row, the second with all the other data. It would be easiest if your data source was broken down in a similar way in the view controller.</p>

<p>In either case you can achieve what you want, but not by flicking a switch, you will need to add some logic and different views to make it happen.</p>
