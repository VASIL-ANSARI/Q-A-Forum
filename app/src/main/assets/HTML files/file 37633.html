<p>The easiest would be to sanitize the description to make sure only safe tags and attributes are accepted.</p>

<pre><code>sanitize(row['Description'])
</code></pre>

<p>And if you want to specify the tags yourself you can do it as well.</p>

<pre><code>sanitize(row['Description'], tags: %w(p h1), attributes: %w(id class))
</code></pre>

<p>Check out <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize" rel="nofollow">the rails sanitize helper</a> documentation for more options.</p>

<p>Or if you're outside a rails app or don't have access to the view helpers, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer" rel="nofollow">rails-html-sanitizer</a> gem. The documentation is quite straightforward. </p>
