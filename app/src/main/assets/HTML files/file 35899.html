<p>I've faced the similar error "Insuffient permission for updating a CloudEntity" when using cloudBackendAsync.update(cloudEntity). I resolved it by making sure the cloudEntity has it's createdAt field set. createdAt is autogenerated and I think I am not supposed to touch it. But it worked for me. In my case I am first obtaining list of cloud entities. This is when I get createdAt field of cloud entities. Then when I am updating I setting the createdAt field from previously obtained entities. 
Edit: Had to do similar thing for owner field also.</p>
