<p>Generally, errors of the "<code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> not  in scope" means the compiler hasn't seen <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> yet. So move the declaration of <code>gamestates</code> to before <code>void switchstate(...)</code>, either via an earlier <code>#include</code> or just moving it up in the file.</p>

<p>C and C++ compile from top to bottom, so symbols must be declared before they are used.</p>
