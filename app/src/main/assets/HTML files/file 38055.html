<p>One way to do this is to use the '$stateChangeStart' event provided by <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki" rel="nofollow">ui-router</a>
This event is fired when the transition begins.
You could inject the service handling your user and redirect it if he is not logged. This would looks like this :</p>

<p>app.run(['$state', 'Session' function($state, Session){</p>

<pre><code>$rootScope.$on('$stateChangeStart', function(event, toState, toParams, from, fromParams){
    if (toState.name !== "login" &amp;&amp; !Session.is_connected()) {
        $state.go("login");
        event.preventDefault();
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>}]);</p>

<p>Additionally, you could also save the last state he was trying to access and redirect him to it once he is logged in.</p>
