<p>I think even if a high-level abstraction could be created that would seamlessly save and retrieve the attributes for the needed aggregations, it would eventually become unwieldy enough to outweigh whatever (minimal) optimization benefits might come out of it.</p>

<p>Stupid me, this is bringing in the Entity-Attribute-Value (name-value pairs) pattern, which has a boat-load of problems at the SQL level. As the SQL Antipatterns book says: "This appears to be an improved design. However, the simple database struc- ture doesnât make up for the difficulty of using it."</p>
