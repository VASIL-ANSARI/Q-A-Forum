<p>Here's what I'm using to read an entire file as string:</p>

<pre><code>        using (var fs = await file.OpenAsync(FileAccessMode.Read))
        {
            using (var inStream = fs.GetInputStreamAt(0))
            {
                using (var reader = new DataReader(inStream))
                {
                    await reader.LoadAsync((uint)fs.Size);
                    string data = reader.ReadString((uint)fs.Size);
                    reader.DetachStream();
                    return data;
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>One obvious option to seek to some position would be to pass another value into GetInputStreamAt(). To read bytes - you would just call reader.ReadBytes(). If something does not work in this scenario - it is likely caused by bugs/incomplete implementation in WinRT. I would speculate that reading files should become much simpler than using 4 different proxy classes, so this could change.</p>
