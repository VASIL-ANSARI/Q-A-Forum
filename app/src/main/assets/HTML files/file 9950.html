<p>The reason is that STL algorithms do not modify the size of the sequence. <code>remove</code>, instead of actually erasing items, moves them and returns an iterator to the "new" end. That iterator can then be passed to the <code>erase</code> member function of your container to actually perform the removal:</p>

<pre><code>v.erase(std::remove(v.begin(), v.end(), 10), v.end());
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, this is known as the "erase-remove idiom".</p>

<p>EDIT: I was incorrect. See comments, and Nawaz's answer.</p>
