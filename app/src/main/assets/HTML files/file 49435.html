<p>The problem is that you have name collisions -- two things called <code>prd_id</code> for example.  You need to use aliases to rename the columns:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT prd.*, img.col1 as img_col1, img.col2 as img_col2
FROM products_prd prd LEFT OUTER JOIN 
     prd_images_img img 
    ON prd.prd_id = img.prd_id
ORDER BY prd.prd_datetime;
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to select <code>prd_id</code> twice.</p>

<p>Or, you can use <code>USING</code> instead of <code>ON</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM products_prd prd LEFT OUTER JOIN 
     prd_images_img img 
     USING (prd_id)
ORDER BY prd.prd_datetime;
</code></pre>

<p>This returns the columns in the <code>USING</code> clause only once (although you could have problems with other columns if they have the same names in the two tables).</p>
