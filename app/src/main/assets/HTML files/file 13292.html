<p>Most probably you ran a buildout that finished very badly during an extraction of some egg. Then you re-ran the buildout and the egg seemed to be already present but it was just a half of the real egg. Indeed, if you check the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance/4.1.7" rel="nofollow">product</a> on pypi, the missing dir do exists in the archive and I'm confident that would be the same for any missing file. I would suggest to completely purge the eggs directory and restart the process from the beginning.</p>

<p>I don't think that in this particular case you are facing a problem with SELinux (as you said you are using a Fedora), but just in case, I would also try to temporarly disable it.</p>
