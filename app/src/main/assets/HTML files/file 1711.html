<p>The NSUserDefaults object stores its data in memory, and is a global object (to your application, anyway). Thus, anything you store in there should be immediately available to anything that tries to access it afterwards. You don't need to call synchronize here. If you're not getting your data, you should check the order of your calls to make sure they're being called when you think they are.</p>
