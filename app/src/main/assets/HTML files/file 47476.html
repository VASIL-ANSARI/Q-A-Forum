<p>Due to the way Google handles client IDs, we actually recommend that customers use our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/devguide/identity/external-providers/openid-connect/" rel="nofollow">generic OpenId Connect support</a> when configuring their identity pool for Google login.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to AWS IAM Console's <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#providers" rel="nofollow">identity provider section</a>.</li>
<li>Create an OpenId Connect Identity Provider with provider URL as <a href="https://accounts.google.com" rel="nofollow">https://accounts.google.com</a> and Audience as one of the client Ids.</li>
<li>Follow the steps to create identity provider and later you will have an option to add additional client ids.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home" rel="nofollow">Amazon Cognito Console</a>.</li>
<li>Create or edit an identity pool and add the OpenID connect identity provider to the pool (it should appear in the OpenId Connect providers).</li>
</ol>

<p>If at a later date you add iOS or web support, create your new client IDs in the Google console and add them to your OpenId Connect provider in the IAM console.</p>
