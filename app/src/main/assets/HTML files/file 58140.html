<p>They are <em>not</em> both strings! <code>line</code> is a string, but <code>line[i]</code> is a <code>char</code>.</p>

<p>And <code>"/"</code> is a character array (string literal).</p>

<p>Use <code>'/'</code> instead to get a character literal, which'll compare against a <code>char</code> very nicely.</p>
