<p>That is a strange syntax and probably doesn't do what you want. If you disassemble the generated code you will most likely see something like <code>add eax, [ebp+8]</code>. The random value added should be the value of <code>first</code>, which is a pointer. You have effectively done <code>eax += first</code>. To get at the elements you need a level of indirection, that is <code>eax += *first</code>. For example this could work:</p>

<pre><code>mov edx, [first]
add eax, [edx]
</code></pre>
