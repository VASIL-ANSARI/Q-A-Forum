<p>The mouse event object contains the target you were clicking on. So you can access that, pass it to jQuery and do whatever you want with it, eg. accessing the ID of the input.</p>

<pre><code>$(e.target).find('input').attr('id');
</code></pre>

<p>And as the other commentators, I'm hoping that your IDs are different ;)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I re-read your question, you just want the value. So you don't need the ID <code>theid</code> in your markup overall (for this usecase). Getting the value from the clicked element:</p>

<pre><code>$(e.target).find('input').val();
</code></pre>

<p>And working, see the <code>alert()</code>: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jma023yc/1/" rel="nofollow">See this jsfiddle</a></p>
