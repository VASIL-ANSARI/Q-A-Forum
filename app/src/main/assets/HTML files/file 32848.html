<p>LINQ... Language INtegrated (and here's the key bit) <strong>Query</strong>.</p>

<p>What you are doing is not a query. Leave it with the <code>foreach</code> loops; it is fine, it is clear, it is obvious.</p>

<p>In particular, the <code>.Items.Add</code> methods on the various collections is not really something you can trivially reproduce in LINQ. You can probably do it, but it will be ugly and hard to maintain. What you have is fine. If you want to change it for change's sake, maybe:</p>

<pre><code>RadTreeViewItem parent1 = new RadTreeViewItem {
    Header = NodeHeader(item.Path, item.Name, SelectedPath, ProjectData),
    Tag = item
};
foreach (var child in item.Children)
{
    parent1.Items.Add(new RadTreeViewItem {
        Header = NodeHeader(child.Path, child.Name, SelectedPath, ProjectData),
        Tag = child
    });
}
Parent.Items.Add(parent1);
</code></pre>

<p>Not exactly an improvement, IMO.</p>
