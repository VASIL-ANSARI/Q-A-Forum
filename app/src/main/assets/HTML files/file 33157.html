<ul>
<li>adjacent_difference requires an <strong>output iterator</strong> as its third parameter.</li>
<li>it <strong>returns an iterator</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So you'll be wanting to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>auto dif_iter = adjacent_difference(prices.begin(),prices.end(),back_inserter(dif));
</code></pre>

<p>And then dif will be filled with the difference, and iter will be an iterator to where the differences begin.</p>

<p>By the sounds of it you'll want to iterate over all the differences to show the price change each day. So you'll be wanting to put that in a loop:</p>

<pre><code>for( auto iter = dif_iter; iter != dif.end(); ++iter )
{
  cout &lt;&lt; ... some information with *iter ...
}
</code></pre>
