<p>In C++, this is undefined behaviour, so <strong>any</strong> answer would be correct. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4176328/undefined-behavior-and-sequence-points">Undefined Behavior and Sequence Points</a> for further details.</p>

<p>Not sure about other languages, but I would expect this code to be incorrect there, too.</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
See Eric Lippert's answer about C#. He disproves my assumption about C#'s behaviour.</p>
