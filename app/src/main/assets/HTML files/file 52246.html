<p>Your problem here is that you are limiting the calculation of the total pages. </p>

<p>You don't need <code>LIMIT $start, 10</code> on the last query. It should be:</p>

<pre><code> $result = mysql_query("SELECT count(foodid) 
                         FROM foodItems 
                        WHERE userid = '".$_SESSION['userid']."'");
</code></pre>
