<p>When you export the project try selecting the option :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Copy required libraries into a sub-folder next to the generated jar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will create a lib folder containing the required dependency libraries ..</p>

<p><em>You have also to select a valid launch configuration for the program, to make sure that the MANIFEST file will be created with the MAin class attribute populated correctly .</em></p>

<p>When you run the generated jar you should run it with this command line (READ the MANIFEST.MF) : </p>

<pre><code>java -jar yourjar.jar
</code></pre>

<p>or with Main class specified in the command line : </p>

<pre><code>java yourjar.jar MainClass
</code></pre>
