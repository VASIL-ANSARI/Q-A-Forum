<p>I don't know what data you save in your session but it sounds a bit like that you save a lot of big data in your session like whole objects for example. The session is written and read from your hdd. When you have a lot of data in it, it takes a lot of time to load them. </p>

<p>To check if your session has to much data you can make a <code>var_dump($_SESSION);</code> to check what data is in your SESSION. </p>

<p>The next thing is that you should place your data on a fast device like an SSD for example not on a NFS filesystem or anything else.</p>

<p>Normally the session system is fast enough. </p>
