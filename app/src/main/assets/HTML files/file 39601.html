<p>The <em>touch coordinate</em> refer to a point that belongs to your Android's screen resolution (Samsung Galaxy S3 is 720x1280). <strong>On the other hand</strong>, the OpenCV image could be larger or smaller than that, meaning that a <em>touch coordinate</em> can't be mapped directly into an <em>image coordinate</em>.</p>

<p>What needs to be done to convert from one resolution to the other, is the normalization of the <em>touch coordinate</em> from 720x1280 to the 640x480 range. Therefore, to find the <strong>real</strong> coordinates on the image you would do:</p>

<pre><code>real_x = (touch_x * 640) / 720;
real_y = (touch_y * 480) / 1280;
</code></pre>
