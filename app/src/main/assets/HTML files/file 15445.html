<p>If you want to make it fixed, i suppose you should use "position:fixed" property.. no?
And maybe z-index will be useful for you too (to place div on the highest layer, then other content).</p>

<p>As i understand, you would like to provide some HTML to some users that will add it to their own websites (or to add it by yourself, like ADS). If i am right, you should also think about other css properties, that are not defined in your div, but that can be defined on different websites (i mean margins, paddings, etc) in css, and will be automatically applied to your div.</p>
