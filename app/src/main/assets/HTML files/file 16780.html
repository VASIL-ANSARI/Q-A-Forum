<p>The reason this happens is because chrome doesn't allow setting cookies on local files by default. See this answer for more information: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/347997/1324019">http://stackoverflow.com/a/347997/1324019</a> (text from answer)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chrome doesn't support cookies for local files (or, like Peter Lyons mentioned, localhost*) unless you start it with the --enable-file-cookies flag. You can read a discussion about it at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=535">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=535</a>.</p>
  
  <p>*Chrome <em>does</em> support cookies if you use the local IP address (127.0.0.1) directly. so in the localhost case, that could be an easier workaround.</p>
