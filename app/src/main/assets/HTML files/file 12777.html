<p>Usually this is done using so-called "AJAX" technique. The idea is simple: you use javascript to send some data to your service, get some data back and update the page accordingly.</p>

<p>Modern Javascript libraries have <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/" rel="nofollow">helper methods</a> for this.</p>

<p>You should have a script on the server that accepts username, checks its availability and emits some JSON (or javascript, or whatever you are able to consume).</p>

<p>You can also bind such check to onblur event. jQuery has <a href="http://api.jquery.com/blur/" rel="nofollow">helper</a> for this as well.</p>

<p>So, in pseudocode it looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
  jQuery(function() {
    $('#username_field').blur(function() {
      $.get('/check_availability.php', {username : this.val()}, function(data) {
        // update web page according to received data
      });
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
