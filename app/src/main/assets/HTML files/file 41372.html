<p>Here is a simpler approach.  Have a dummy contract for each project that is used for incidents that have no formal contract.  This contract would always be used for resolving the project.</p>

<p>This simplifies the database design, but it does introduce other problems.  For instance, to find incidents with no contract, you wouldn't look for <code>NULL</code> in the contract column.  You would look for "not really a contract" in the contract table.  Depending on the circumstances, this could be a more elegant solution.  This also solves the problem with <code>Debtor</code>.</p>

<p>This does bring up another issue, which is incidents that might be on multiple contracts.  In fact, you might end up heading in a direction where you need to support yet-another-table that is an n-m mapping between incidents and projects.</p>
