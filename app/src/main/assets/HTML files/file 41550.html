<p><code>float fx = 4;</code></p>

<p>In your case <code>fx</code> is local variable. It will die once you come out of function. If you are returning <code>float</code> then you are making copy of value, so even <code>fx</code> die, no problem. But if you are returning <code>float&amp;</code>, you are returning reference to died variable. Which is undefined behaviour.</p>

<p>Copying is costly operation. When you return reference, you are not making actual copy, but you are returning address of varaiable. You should return reference if your variable will alive after returning from function. But in your case, <code>fx</code> will die once you come out of function. </p>
