<p>What you are trying won't work for a number of reasons.  You are attempting to set a message <strong>PROPERTY</strong> on an incoming message which will indeed be read-only.  The message you receive is a copy of the actual message and not the one that would be resent if inside a TX and was eligible for redelivery.</p>

<p>To do any sort of update to a delivered message that encounters an error during its processing you need to create a new instance and decorate it with the appropriate information and then place it back on the Destination using a MessageProducer. </p>
