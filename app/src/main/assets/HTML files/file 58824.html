<p>I found a cheap and easy solution.  My problem was: my Leading and Trailing constraints were to the Margin, and not to the superview directly.  The margin is what differs across size classes.   So I modified my 2 constraints:  Leading and Trailing, disabling the "Relative to Margin" option on each.  Instructions here:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28383287/uiviewcontroller-nested-view-to-screen-edge">UIViewController Nested View To Screen Edge</a> </p>

<p>Now i get a consistent behaviour on every screen size (no margins around collection view). </p>
