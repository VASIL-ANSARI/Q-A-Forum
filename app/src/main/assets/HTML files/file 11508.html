<p>Just putting it out there: more code does not mean "dirty", just as often as less code does not mean "clean."</p>

<p>Requiring your files manually will give you less headache in the long runâit solves load order issues and prevents you from requiring files you don't actually want. Plus, anyone looking at your code later on has a nice, clean manifest of what's being loaded in your app.</p>

<p>My suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drop the <code>src</code> folder, it's redundantâyour Ruby app is <em>all</em> source.</li>
<li>Map your namespaces to folders</li>
<li>Use explicit requires (this becomes easier when you use #2:</li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>game/
  bin/
    gamerunner
  Gemfile
  lib/
    game.rb
    game/
      game_object.rb
  models/
    character.rb
  spec/
    spec_helper.rb
    models/
      character_spec.rb
</code></pre>

<p>You are writing specs / tests, aren't you?</p>

<p>Then, in <code>lib/game.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>require 'game/game_object.rb'
# require the rest of your library as you build it

module Game
end
</code></pre>

<p>And in your init:</p>

<pre><code>require 'game'
require 'models/character.rb'
</code></pre>

<p>Much cleaner, much easier to extract from later on and should solve your problem.</p>
