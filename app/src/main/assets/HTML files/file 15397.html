<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bhkz42b3.aspx" rel="nofollow">List.Contains</a> method is what you need I guess but</p>

<p>List.Contains is O(n) and I would recommend a Hashset instead which has a O(1) lookup..</p>

<p>if your list contains all the entry then you can also use the Distinct() function in Linq which will return you an enumerable with Distinct elements only..</p>

<pre><code>webSites.Distinct()
