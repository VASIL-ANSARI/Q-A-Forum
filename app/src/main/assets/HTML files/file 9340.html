<p>I see in the stacktrace, there is a reference to <code>adjustForBOM</code> (BOM = <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow">Byte Order Mark</a>).</p>

<p>This could mean that your file <code>MyPlugin.py</code> is stored in a different encoding to other files that are working for you.</p>

<p>Can you try re-saving the file with a different encoding, say UTF-8?</p>
