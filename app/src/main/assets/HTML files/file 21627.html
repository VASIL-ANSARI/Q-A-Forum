  <p>I tried putting the gridband control on the chart and it works fine on
  the back wall of the chart. I would like to have the gridband kind of
  effect (that is one strip white and other strip blue) on the left and
  the bottom wall of the chart. Is this possible with Teechart?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am afraid it isn't possible at the moment. I have added it as a future request with number[TF02016509] to will be consider its inclusion to upcoming versions of TeeChartFor.Net. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I generate a bubble chart and set the pointer style to "Polished
  Sphere", the tooltip is not generated for very small bubbles on the
  chart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have reproduced the problem and I have added it in bug list report with number[TF02016510]. We will try to fix it to upcoming maintenance releases of TeeChartFor.Net. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I generate a bubble chart and set the pointer style to "Polished
  Sphere", there are certain values which are displayed in the legend,
  but the corresponding colors for them are not displayed in the legend.
  In my case, I have 4 bubbles getting plotted on the chart, when I use
  "Polished Sphere", colors for 2 bubbles are not displayed in the
  legend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can not reproduce it using last version of TeeChartFor.net build number 4.1.2012.01310. Could you please, tell us which version of teechart are you using? If you don't use latest version I recommend you download the evaluation version that you can find in next link:

<blockquote>
  <p>The spacing of the legend symbol and text is not very accurate. It
  automatically sets less spacing for some text and more for some.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can not reproduce the problem in last version of TeeChartFor.Net using next code: </p>

<pre><code>Steema.TeeChart.Styles.Bubble bubble1;       
private void InitializeChart()
{
    bubble1 = new Bubble(tChart1.Chart);
    double y = 0;
    Random rnd = new Random();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
    {
        y = rnd.Next(100);
        if (i &gt; 0)
        {
            bubble1.Add(i, y, y / i);
        }
        else
        {
            bubble1.Add(i, y, y/y);
        }
    }

    bubble1.Pointer.Style = PointerStyles.PolishedSphere;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code have genarate the next image: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rEk9u.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Could you tell us if your problem appears in the image? </p>

<p>Thanks, </p>
