<p>It sounds like you have 2 DB projects associated with the same database.  Each DB project will be saying 'make the database look like this project' and therefore deleting the existing objects.</p>

<p>If you're using VS 2010 the following might help you...</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the Deploy tab of your project properties</li>
<li>Click to edit your 'deployment configuration file'</li>
<li>Uncheck 'Always re-create database'</li>
<li>Uncheck Generate DROP statements for objects that are in the target database but that are not in the database project.</li>
</ol>
