<p>While reading the file, keep a sorted list of the 5 largest numbers seen (and their owners).
Whenever you read a value higher than the lowest of the 5, remove the lowest and insert the new number in your sorted list.</p>

<p>List list can be stored in an array or in any other data structure that has an order and where you can implement a sort and insert. (Or where this is already implemented)</p>

<p>Instead of sorting the list you can also simply go through the 5 entries every time you read a new one (should not be too bad, because 5 entries is a very small number)</p>
