<p>This is probably too late to help the OP, but I experienced these same errors (on some pages/URLs, but not others) after moving my Drupal/CiviCRM site to a new server at the same host. I had some symlinks that were created to work around a <a href="http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php?topic=14372.0" rel="nofollow">CiviCRM problem</a>, and they were broken after moving the site. Correcting those symlinks resolved this for me.</p>

<p>I had further issues, but I don't know if they were related. If this doesn't completely resolve your problem, let me know.</p>
