<p>According to the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, page actions are supposed to be used only for single pages. If you want something to show up on all pages, you should use a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction" rel="nofollow">browserAction</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can try and set <code>"&lt;all_urls&gt;"</code> in the permissions, but I haven't tested if it actually works.</p>
