<p>I was able to pull together a few similar answers to create a solution; I dropped the idea of placing all my QGraphicItem's in a Group, and placed them directly on a scene. With the scene grabbing all mouse events, I have the mouseMoveEvent check to see if the current position is on top of a QGraphicsItem - if so, perform something.</p>

<p>I still need to try and get itemAt() to work for my own classes that implement QGraphicsItem, as itemAt returns only QGraphicsItem's, but I'm sure some cast should get it working.</p>

<pre><code>void ChartScene::mouseMoveEvent(QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent *event)
{
    QPointF mousePosition = event-&gt;scenePos();
    QGraphicsItem* pItem = this-&gt;itemAt(mousePosition.x(), mousePosition.y());
}
</code></pre>
