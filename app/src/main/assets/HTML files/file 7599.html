<p><code>EF BB BF</code> is the UTF-8 encoding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow">Byte Order Mark</a> (BOM). I suspect there is some configuration option to turn off the BOM.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> File editors should allow you to turn off the BOM when saving an file in relevant character encodings (e.g. UTF-8).</p>
