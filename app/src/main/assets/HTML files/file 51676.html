<p>There is no built in support for this, you <em>can</em> however create the functionality yourself using the Chart.PostPaint event. From PostPaint you can access the chart graphics to draw white boxes and rotated text, this is by no means an easy task to do properly (Not sure about finding the center of bars). I suggest you start by looking up PostPaint to see if it's worth the effort or not.</p>
