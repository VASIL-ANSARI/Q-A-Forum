<p>Right now you're setting the higher version code to an armeabi build. If you do that, it's the armeabi APK that will get distributed even to x86 devices, because x86 devices also support running armeabi/armeabi-v7a APKs. You should give the highest version code to your x86 APK.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can run arm libs on x86 devices but you can't mix them. That means that if you cannot get x86 versions of all your libs, you should unfortunately abandon it and publish only the ARM one.</p>

<p>You can also tell to your library vendor that they should publish an x86 version of their lib since not doing so prevents you to correctly build x86 versions of your APKs.</p>
