<p>I'm afraid that only Chrome Extensions have access to these variables. There is a sample extension that makes use of <code>$0</code>, it's called 'Chrome Query' and is available on <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples.html" rel="nofollow">samples page</a>. I took it's code, modified a little and ended up with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pefnhibkhcfooofgmgoipfpcojnhhljm" rel="nofollow">this extension</a>. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/kdzwinel/CSS-Diff" rel="nofollow">github</a>. I'm not sure if it's extra useful in current form, but there is a lot of space for improvement. Table instead of a tree should be more readable, I'll try to make it happen next week.</p>
