<p>The code should work. There is likely something else in your code that causes this behaviour.</p>

<p>In my specific case, it turned out there was a line</p>

<pre><code>PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this).edit().clear().commit();
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>onCreate()</code> method of the main <code>Activity</code>, causing the SharedPreferences to <em>clear</em> on every launch of the app. </p>
