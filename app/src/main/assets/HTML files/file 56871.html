<p>oopcode's answer in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27149849/python-importerror-undefined-symbol-g-utf8-skip">Python, ImportError: undefined symbol: g_utf8_skip</a> works.
The situation improved with the following.</p>

<p>importing the c extension into python has no error. 
Calling the c extension from python give the following error:
Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_mc.so or libmkl_def.so.</p>

<p>I remember when I manually compiled numpy with mkl, the site.cfg file asked for library path and include path for the intel's mkl. Guess I need to add the library path to the extra_link_args as well... But that didn't work.</p>

<p>Someone with anaconda has that error too as in <a href="https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/pyBAR/issues/54" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
Similar case at intel's forum <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-math-kernel-library/topic/296094" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>This stackoverflow question says extra_compile_args is also needed: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1676384/how-to-pass-flag-to-gcc-in-python-setup-py-script">How to pass flag to gcc in Python setup.py script</a></p>

<p>setup.py</p>

<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup, Extension
import numpy as np

extra_link_args=["-I", "(intel's dir)/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210/linux/mkl/include", "-L", "(intel's dir)/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_mc.so", "-mkl"] 
ext_modules = [ Extension('mkl_helper', sources = ['mkl_helper.c'], extra_link_args=extra_link_args) ]


setup(
        name = 'mkl_helper',
        version = '1.0',
        include_dirs = [np.get_include()], #Add Include path of numpy
        ext_modules = ext_modules
)
</code></pre>

<p>Update:
I finally got it working as in <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-math-kernel-library/topic/640387" rel="nofollow">here</a>
But mkl stillll just use only one of the 12 cpu.</p>
