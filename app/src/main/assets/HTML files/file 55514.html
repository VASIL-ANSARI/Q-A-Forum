<p>just user the mysql query in php as follows:</p>

<pre><code>mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tbl_category WHERE cid='".$cat_id."' ORDER BY cid DESC");
</code></pre>

<p>if you have stored the time of upload the data then this is perfect way to get the latest uploaded images as follows:</p>

<pre><code>mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tbl_category WHERE cid='".$cat_id."' ORDER BY uploaded_time DESC");
</code></pre>
