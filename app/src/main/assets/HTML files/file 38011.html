<p><code>StringBuilder</code> uses less memory upon concatenation (because it doesn't copy both strings), which means that if you plan to make <em>many</em> concatenations (in a loop!) you'd better use <code>StringBuilder</code>.</p>

<p>Usually the comparison of performance is not done between <code>StringBuilder</code> and <code>String</code> but between <code>StringBuilder</code> and <code>StringBuffer</code>. The latter is synchronized which is "safer" but also much slower, hence again, the preference usually tends towards <code>StringBuilder</code> when you're not concerned about concurrency issues and you want optimal performance.  </p>
