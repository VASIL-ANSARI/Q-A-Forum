<p>If the lifetime of the object is the lifetime of the execution of the program then there is no need to free the memory with code. The memory will be free automatically.</p>

<p>Many Linux command line tools do not free their memory in code for performance reasons. (Faster to automatically free pages of memory, than to free each object one by one.)</p>

<p>Another strategy is to keep a separate list of unique AllocatedClass instances, then free them from that list later on (switching ownership of the objects). Like <code>std::list&lt;AllocatedClass*&gt; to_be_freed</code>.</p>
