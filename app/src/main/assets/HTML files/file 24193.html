<p>Simple answer to this one. Your query returned a result array with four objects in it. Casting doesn't change a fundamental object's type, it just tricks the compiler into thinking its dealing with a particular object's class. It doesn't actually change that class. </p>

<p>In this particular instance, its simple. There's already an array at index 0 in the current response:</p>

<p>NSArray *allGroups = group[0];</p>

<p>That should have all four strings in a single array which can be enumerated to do whatever you feel like doing.</p>
