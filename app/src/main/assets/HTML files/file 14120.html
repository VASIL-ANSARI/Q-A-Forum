<p>I found the answer to my problem. I have several strings files, one for my app translation, and one for each target called <code>InfoPlist.strings</code> which contains just <code>CFBundleDisplayName</code> and <code>CFBundleName</code> for localized app name. These cannot be included into the <code>Localizable.strings</code> since these are different for each target.</p>

<p>I removed the <code>InfoPlist.strings</code> files from my project and now the app is localized again.</p>
