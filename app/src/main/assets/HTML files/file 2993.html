<p>It's not really a question of whether Ruby 1.9 is ready for Rails, but rather if Rails is ready for Ruby 1.9. From what I've read, it seems like Rails itself (ActiveRecord, etc) runs well on it. You may have issues with any ruby gems you may use which are not 1.9 ready. Check out <a href="http://isitruby19.com/" rel="nofollow">http://isitruby19.com/</a> to see if anyone has commented on the specific gems you are using.</p>
