<p>Assuming I've understood your question correctly, (I think you want to return <em>from</em> <code>thingsLoaded</code> in the callback, rather than actually returning <code>thingsLoaded</code> itself) then no. </p>

<p>The <code>thingsLoaded</code> function will return <code>undefined</code> before the callback is executed. If you have code that is dependent on the animation being finished, it has to go inside the callback. This is because <code>fadeOut</code> is asynchronous.</p>
