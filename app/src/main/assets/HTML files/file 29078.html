<p>A favicon is exactly that. A little image (I suppose it comes from 'favorite icon') that is shown on a browser window for the user to visually identify your website among other tabs.</p>

<p>Most browsers and most servers cache the content to avoid downloading the image twice.</p>

<p>Suppose this:</p>

<p>Browser A downloads your resource (favicon image) and creates a cache of it.</p>

<p>Next time the browser sees the link to the image, it will guess its the same image and won't download it again, until that cache is cleared.</p>
