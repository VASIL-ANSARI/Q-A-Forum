<p>From the HTTP RFC (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.13" rel="nofollow">RFC2626, 14.3</a>) </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words you should count the number of bytes (<code>octets</code>), therefor <code>\r\n</code> should be considered to be 2 octets/bytes.</p>
