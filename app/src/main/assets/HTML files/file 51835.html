<p>I have the same issue with <code>ReloadFromBundle(IMvxBundle state)</code>, it is never called. Only the "SaveState" pattern seems to work.</p>

<p>I can answer to your second question though:</p>

<p>You shouldn't use <code>Init</code> to load your data. You should only use it to pass ids of data to be retrieved. The "loading" phase should happen in the <code>Start</code> method.</p>
