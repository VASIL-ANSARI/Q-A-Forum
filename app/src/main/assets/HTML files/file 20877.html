<p>If the database must use a delimited long-string field for "keywords" rather than putting them in rows, then you will want to use the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like" rel="nofollow">LIKE Operator</a></p>

<p>Assuming your <code>[keywords]</code> column is formatted like this:</p>

<p>'chocolate,ganache,strawberry'</p>

<p>You can search for "similar" cakes like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    columns
FROM
    table t
WHERE
    t.[keywords] LIKE '%chocolate%'
    OR t.[keywords] LIKE '%cheesecake%'
</code></pre>

<p>Though, if you can change the schema, I would do so. Searching normalized keyword <strong>rows</strong> will be much more efficient and fast than having the DB parse through text using <code>LIKE</code></p>

<p>If you could make a <code>keywords</code> <strong>table</strong>, which references the parent table by ID, you could do an equality search using a <code>JOIN</code> which would be superior, in my opinion.</p>

<p>It might have three columns: Id, ParentId, Keyword</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> So based on your update, you have a <code>cakewords</code> table which can be searched.</p>

<p>This is untested, and there is likely a more efficient way using no <code>IN</code> clause. But the idea is that you know all the keyword id's for your specific cake. Then you are looking for other cakes having keywords in that collection.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    columns
FROM
    cake AS cs
JOIN
    cakewords AS csw
        ON csw.[cakeid] = cs.[id]
WHERE
    csw.[wordid] IN
        (SELECT
            cw.[wordid]
        FROM
            cakewords AS cw
        JOIN
            cakes AS c
                ON c.[id] = cw.[cakeid]
        WHERE
            c.[id] = @pMyCurrenctCakeId
        (
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> Here is a good related question:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/615098/whats-the-optimal-solution-for-tag-keyword-matching">What&#39;s the optimal solution for tag/keyword matching?</a></p>

<p>Based on an answer within, you might try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT
    c.[id]
FROM
    cakewords AS cw1
INNER JOIN cakewords cw2 
    ON cw2.[wordid] = cw1.[wordid]
INNER JOIN cake AS c 
    ON c.[id] = cw.[cakeid]
WHERE
    cw1.[cakeid] = @current_cake_id
</code></pre>
