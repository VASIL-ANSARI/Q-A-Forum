<p>You can redirect a browser by using the <code>header</code> function to set a <code>Location</code> header.</p>

<p>There is no way for the server to tell the browser to send any HTTP header it would not normally send when it makes the subsequent HTTP request.</p>

<p>The closest you could come would be to act as a proxy server (i.e. to make the request to the second URL yourself, e.g. with cURL, and then relay the response back to the browser instead of redirecting)</p>
