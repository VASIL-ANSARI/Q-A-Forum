<p>It is not possible to send an app request without the dialog, using just POST method.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://github.com/toto/facebook-ios-sdk" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>:</p>

<p>This SDK provides a method for popping up a Facebook dialog. The currently supported dialogs are the login and permissions dialogs used in the authorization flow, and a dialog for publishing posts to a user's feed.</p>

<p>So you can't post an app request via standard dialogs either. It works only for web applications.</p>
