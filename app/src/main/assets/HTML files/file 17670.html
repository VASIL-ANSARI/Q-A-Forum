<p>It seems that the device assumes portrait unless you specify landscape only in settings. Your only option would be in your portrait view in the loadview method to detect the orientation and to swap views during launch.</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
        {
           if(interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait || interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown ) {
        //Load vertical interface
           }
    else
    {
    //load landscape
    }
        }
</code></pre>
