<p>If the UIButton goes over the edge of its parent view, or covers part of a different descendant view then it may be the case that hit testing isn't working for the button. (i.e. the button is over the top of the bar at the bottom).</p>

<p>You can resolve these issues by ensuring that button is hit test. You may be able to do this by overriding the the <code>hitTest:withEvent:</code> method on the view that contains the button. This may look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>-(UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
{
  UIView *result = [redButton hitTest:[redButton convertPoint:point fromView:self] withEvent:event];
  if (result)
    return result;

  return [super hitTest:point withEvent:event];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will only work if the view that you're adding this change to is hit test before another view that contains the given point.</p>
