<p>It looks like it's working correctly to me.</p>

<p>Your PHP is rendering empty elements. That's what confusing you.</p>

<p>If the empty elements are desired, maybe you should give them a different class.  Or use a second class on the non-empty elements just for this CSS treatment.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>My suggestion above won't work.  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child" rel="nofollow">Read this</a>. The <code>nth-child</code> only cares about how many siblings the matched element has. It doesn't filter them.</p>

<p>You'll need to use your PHP to add <code>.odd</code> classes to the elements you want to style, or else change your markup in some drastic way to give the CSS a handle to the odd elements.</p>
