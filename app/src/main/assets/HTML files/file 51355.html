<p>This error comes to show that you don't have an <code>user_id</code> column in the <code>invites</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the foreign key on the other model is the name of this model with the suffix _id added. The :foreign_key option lets you set the name of the foreign key directly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you may add: </p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :invites, :foreign_key =&gt; :attending_guest_id
end
</code></pre>
