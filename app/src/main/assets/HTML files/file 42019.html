<p>Its not clear, at what stage of the view creation you are loading the data. Its worth you try calling the notifyDataSetChanged after loading the data. Its basically notifies the attached list that the underlying data has been changed and any View reflecting the data set should refresh itself.</p>

<pre><code> cursorAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
