<p>I have done something like this for an ecommerce search function, I split the words up and then used a loop to add the words to a query.</p>

<pre><code>WHERE address LIKE '%$search[0]%' OR address LIKE '%$search[1]%' OR contents LIKE '%$search[0]%'
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this is useful, I would play about with some queries to see what works before jumping into the code. When you do start code I would recommend splitting the search query into an array of words then using foreach loops to add them to the query.</p>

<p>Have fun and let me know how you get on!</p>
