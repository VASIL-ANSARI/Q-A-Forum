<p>You can read the digits into an array, then convert that to an <code>int</code> with <code>atoi</code> or (preferably) <code>strtol</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could read the letters, then stop when get to the space, and read the number with something like <code>[f]scanf</code> (or you could just read it all with <code>[f]fscanf</code>, of course).</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Given a choice, I'd probably do something like:</p>

<pre><code>char name[16];
int number;

fscanf(input_file, "%15s %d", name, &amp;number);
</code></pre>
