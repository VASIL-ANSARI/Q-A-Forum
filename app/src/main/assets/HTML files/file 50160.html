<p>No, Voice over doesnt work like that. You cannot change the order of the accessibility elements. YOu can only skip some elements which are in the stack.</p>

<p>Let's say you have views 1 to 9 in a vertical layout</p>

<p>and you do this:</p>

<pre><code>     self.accessibilityElements = @[self.view5, self.view1, self.view9]
</code></pre>

<p>IT doesnt mean that accessibility will read view 5 first, and then view 1 and then view 9.</p>

<p>YOu should give the order like:</p>

<pre><code>      self.accessibilityElements = @[self.view1, self.view5, self.view9]
</code></pre>

<p>So that the voice over only reads them in the order 1,5,9, and it skips the remianing!!!!</p>

<p>Again the voice over reads in the order left to right and from top to bottom!!!</p>

<p>Think it like this: USe  <code>self.accessibilityElements</code> only if you want to add/skip the accessibility for the elements in your view, but not for the accessibility order!!!</p>
