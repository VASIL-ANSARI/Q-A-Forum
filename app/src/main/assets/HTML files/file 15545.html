<p>You need the LINQ query to return less data like sql paging like <code>top</code> function in sql or do manual querying using stored procedures. In either cases, you need to rewrite your querying mechanism. This is one of the reasons why I didn't use EF, because you don't have a lot of control over the code it seems. </p>
