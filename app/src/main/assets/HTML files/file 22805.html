<p>The setVisibleItemProperties method is used to define visible fields in a Form, not to define captions for fields. </p>

<p>The following is one example of setting caption for a field in a Form:</p>

<pre><code>form.getField("firstName").setCaption("First Name");
</code></pre>

<p>Another way is to create your own FieldFactory that sets captions for your fields (based on annotations for example).</p>
