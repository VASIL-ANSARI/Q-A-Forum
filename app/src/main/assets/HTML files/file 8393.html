<p>You can delete the contents of your gems folder. Where this is will depend on how you installed Ruby and RubyGems, as well as the Ruby version. For instance, if you used the one-click installer for 1.9.2p180, and installed rubygems with ruby setup.rb, the gems folder would be c:\Ruby192\lib\ruby\gems\ - delete everything under that folder and poof! your gems are gone.</p>
