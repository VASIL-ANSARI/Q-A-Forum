<li><code>onPostExecute</code> is being called on the main ("UI") thread so there is really no need to run its code through <code>runOnUiThread(Runnable)</code>.</li>
<li>If you want to display two types of views in the same <code>ListView</code> you will need to modify your <code>Adapter</code> to supply it (see <code>Adapter.getViewTypeCount()</code>), then you will need to sort your data set (<code>List</code> in your example) so it will reflect your requested sort + sections, and finally you will need to handle it in your Adapter (return the appropriate type/view by the given position).
Also see <code>Adapter.getItemViewType()</code> and <code>Adapter.getView()</code>.</li>
