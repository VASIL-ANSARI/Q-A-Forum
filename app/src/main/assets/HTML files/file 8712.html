<p>Ok I figured out what the issue was.  Apparently I was formatting the data I was sending to the remote modem incorrectly and rather than the remote site telling me that it was simply ignoring my message altogether.</p>

<p>So the code above will work for sending and receiving data asynchronously over a modem line in C#.</p>
