<p>Ok I figured out why the redirect didn't work. I was doing this in my Java Spring controller:</p>

<p>response.sendRedirect("redirect:mypage.html?pdfError=true");</p>

<p>The "redirect:" prefix is something you can use when returning the view name from a controller. In the sendDirect() call it only adds confusion. Removing "redirect:" fixed it.</p>
