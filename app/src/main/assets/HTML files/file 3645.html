<p>In your testing framework, before you cause docutils to be imported, you can perform this setup task:</p>

<pre><code>import __builtin__
self.savimport = __builtin__.__import__
def myimport(name, *a):
  if name=='pwd': raise ImportError
  return self.savimport(name, *a)
__builtin__.__import__ = myimport
</code></pre>

<p>and of course in teardown put things back to normal:</p>

<pre><code>__builtin__.__import__ = self.savimport
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation: all import operations go through <code>__builtin__.__import__</code>, and you can reassign that name to have such operations use your own code (alternatives such as import hooks are better for such purposes as performing import from non-filesystem sources, but for purposes such as yours, overriding <code>__builtin__.__import__</code>, as you see above, affords truly simple code).</p>
