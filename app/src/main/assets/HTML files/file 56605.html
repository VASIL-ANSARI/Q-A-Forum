<p>How to distinguish the different clients depends on what socket type your using as your 'server', the explanations below will hopefully answer the 2nd question too.</p>

<p><code>REQ</code> - Will reply to the client that sent the request, a <code>recv</code> call on a <code>REQ</code> socket must be followed by a <code>send</code> so you can't service the next request until you have processed the first. However multiple requests from different clients will be queued.</p>

<p><code>ROUTER</code> - Will append a frame onto the message you <code>recv</code> that contains the client id of the sender. When sending a message the first frame will be removed and used to identify which connected client to reply to. You should store all frames up to and including the empty delimiter frame and prepend them to your reply message when you send the reply. Unlike <code>REQ</code> there is no need to <code>send</code> any messaged before another call to <code>recv</code>. The client id will be generated by ZeroMQ if not specified, but if you want 'persistence' you can set the id via <code>setsockopt</code> with the <code>zmq.IDENTITY</code> flag.</p>
