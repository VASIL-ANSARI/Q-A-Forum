<p>You could use individual  subqueries for each count:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT id,proj_id, proj_title,proj_status,
   -- any other columns from project ...
   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM story s 
    WHERE s.story_type='TY_FEATURES'  
    AND s.proj_id=p.proj_id) FEATURES,
   (SELECT ... other story counts ) colname
 FROM project p
</code></pre>

<p>That way no <code>JOIN</code> to story is necessary and you don't need <code>group by</code> either. But of course you need to link each subquery properly to the main record by two <code>where</code> conditions. </p>
