<p>The <code>$pdf-&gt;output()</code> call will already send the PDF to the client. The file will not be saved to your local folder (Didn't you checked at least this?) because you have to pass "F" as the snd parameter.</p>

<p>After that you try to read from an URL (!!!!) that does not exists and which maybe return a nicely styled 404 html response. Two issues here: </p>

<ol>
<li>Why are you using http when you have the local path used some lines above? Use the local path only!</li>
<li>The content returned by the URL is append to the already send PDF which ends in a document mixed of PDF and HTML (the 404 response) -> corrupted PDF</li>
</ol>

<p>Conclusion: Use "F" as the 2nd parameter and use the same path for both writing and reading and not a mix of local path and URL.</p>
