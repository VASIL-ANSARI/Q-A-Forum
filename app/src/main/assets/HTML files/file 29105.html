<p>I think it depends and you may need to provide more clarification. Here is a simple example that works just fine for me:</p>

<p>A.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    for($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; ++$i) {
        include('B.php');
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>B.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo "The value of \$i is {$i}\n";
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you include a file, the code is included as if it were inline where 'include' is called.</p>
