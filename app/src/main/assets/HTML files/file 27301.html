<p>The speech API serializes speech from multiple sources so they don't play at the same time.  One will play first, then the next, and so on until there is no more pending speech to be played.  You can disable this via the registry as described here:

<p>Particularly the <code>NoSerializeAccess</code> value in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\Speech\AudioOutput\&lt;AudioOutput1&gt;\Attributes</code> where <code>&lt;AudioOutput1&gt;</code> is the name of your audio output device.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to prevent multiple TTS voices or engines from speaking simultaneously, the Speech Platform serializes output to objects which implement the ISpAudio interface. To disable serialization of outputs to an ISpAudio object, place an attribute called "NoSerializeAccess" in the Attributes folder of its object token.</p>
