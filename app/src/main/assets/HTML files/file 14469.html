<p>You have incorrectly broken that method selector up</p>

<p>It is declared as</p>

<pre><code>- (UIImage *)stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:(NSInteger)leftCapWidth topCapHeight:(NSInteger)topCapHeight
</code></pre>

<p>it should be called like this</p>

<pre><code>greenImage.stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth(8.0, topCapHeight:0.0)
</code></pre>

<p>You'll most likely want to assign that to something so it might look like this</p>

<pre><code>greenImage = UIImage.imageNamed("greenButton.png")
greenImage = greenImage.stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth(8.0, topCapHeight:0.0)
@timerButton.setBackgroundImage(greenImage, forState: UIControlStateNormal)
</code></pre>

<h2>Side note</h2>

<p>You are correct the method is marked as newly deprecated in iOS 5, but it's also important to note that the replacement method was also introduced in iOS 5 so if you plan to support older iOS's then you will need to continue using this.</p>
