<p>DexieJS' <code>AND</code> operator is implemented either as a filter function or a compound index. The simple way to implement your query is to use the filter method, something like;</p>

<pre><code>var collection = db[table];
collection = collection
    .where('Field').equals("1")
      .and(function(item) { return item.Field2 &gt; value });
return collection.count();
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the first filter will run against IndexedDB, and the additional condition will be run against each found item by DexieJS, which may or may not be good enough for what you need.</p>

<p>As to how to use the compound index, it's a bit harder to apply to your exact situation without more details on the collections and exact queries you want, but there is <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/744986/How-to-do-some-magic-with-indexedDB" rel="nofollow">much more information available here</a>.</p>
