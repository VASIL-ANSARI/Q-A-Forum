<p>Ok looking through your code I can see the connection of reader and database is closed in loop itself which should not be done.</p>

<pre><code>SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();    
if (reader.HasRows)
{
     while (reader.Read())
     {
                //populate fields from reader
     }
}
else
{
     lbl.Text = "No records found.";
}
reader.Close();
Connection.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>Next thing which I noticed that dropdown selected text/value should be either <code>ddNames.SelectedItem.Text</code> or in case of value passing <code>ddNames.SelectedValue</code>.</p>

<p>Next thing make sure that each reader name should exactly match with table column name.</p>

<p>Last but not least always do a proper null check before applying <code>ToString()</code>.if any column has null value <code>ToString()</code> would fail to convert.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
