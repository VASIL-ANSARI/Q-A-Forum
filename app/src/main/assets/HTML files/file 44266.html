<p>I found the solution. The problem was in the LeggiExcel class in which I did this:</p>

<pre><code>public String LeggiCella(Sheet foglio, int col, int riga) {

        Cell a = foglio.getCell(col, riga);
        String contenuto = a.getContents();

        if (a.getType() == CellType.NUMBER){ 
            contenuto = Double.toString(LeggiCellaNumerica(a));
            } 

        return contenuto;
    }

    public double LeggiCellaNumerica(Cell a){
        double num = 0;

        NumberCell nc = (NumberCell) a; 
        num = nc.getValue();

        return num;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>So it would check if the <code>CellType</code> was a <code>NumberCell</code> and then get the value, returning it as a double. I would then cast it to string in the <code>LeggiCella</code> method and return it as a String. It looks like setting the Cell Format in the Excel file as 7 decimals would make it go mad in the approximation of the number, so it would set 8 or 9 zeros at the end. I now have deleted the NumberCell check and just got the value of the cell returning it as a String, and it works correctly. Thanks everyone who's helped me finding the solution.</p>
