<p>Don't use global lists; just write each entry to the file <em>as you find it</em>. Using the <code>csv</code> module would make this all a bit easier still:</p>

<pre><code>import csv

sourceCode = urllib2.urlopen('http://coinmarketcap.com').read() 
mcapUSD = sourceCode.split('&lt;strong&gt;Total Market Cap: &lt;span id="total-marketcap" data-usd="')[1].split('"')[0]
mcap = float(mcapUSD.replace(',','')

# read previous value from the CSV first
with open('mcapdata.csv', 'rb') as infh:
    last = None
    for row in csv.reader(infh):
        last = row[1]  # second column

# Now calculate the log value based on the last value
logRe = log(mcap/float(last))

# write new values
with open(mcapdata.csv', 'ab') as outfh:
    date = strftime('%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S', gmtime())
    csv.writer(outfh).writerow([date, mcap, logRe])
</code></pre>

<p>This code will read the <code>mcapdata.csv</code> file, picking out just the last value written to it. You could instead also keep all of the rows in memory and just picking out the last entry in a list of lists.</p>
