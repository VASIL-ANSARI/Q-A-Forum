<p>I had the same problem and the following code seems to work for me.</p>

<p>Assume that the passwords controller is set for a singleton route.  Also, assume that the authenticated model is an Account.  With that, you have the following:</p>

<pre><code>def update
  if current_account.update_with_password(params[:account])
    sign_in(current_account, :bypass =&gt; true)
    flash[:notice] = 'Password updated.'
    redirect_to account_path
  else
    render :action =&gt; :show
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The key ingredient is the sign_in method call which seeks to re-sign-in the account, but bypasses the warden callbacks and stores the account into the session.</p>
