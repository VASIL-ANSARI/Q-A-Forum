<p>You need to group by the <code>title</code>. And you have to tell the DB which rule to apply when selecting the <code>id</code> for duplicate entries. For instance the smallest <code>id</code> for every unique <code>title</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Title, min(Id) as minid
FROM Package 
WHERE Type='Group'
GROUP BY Title
ORDER BY min(Id) ASC
</code></pre>
