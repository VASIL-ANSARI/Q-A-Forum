<p>When I run the code I get a <code>NullReferenceException</code> on line 33 in MainPage.xaml.cs<br>
This is because you referenced the DataContext of <code>this.LayoutRoot</code> but had never set this. You had in fact set the DataContext of <code>ContentPanel</code>.<br>
Line 32 should therefore be:</p>

<pre><code>ViewDiskModel model = this.ContentPanel.DataContext as ViewDiskModel;
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally:<br>
The view model was unaware of which items had been checked as you were using the default <code>OneWay</code> binding of properties. You need to change this to <code>TwoWay</code> so that changes in the UI are reflected back to the view model.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;CheckBox IsChecked="{Binding IsChecked, Mode=TwoWay}" Content="{Binding FileName}" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With these two changes the selected files are deleted.</p>

<p>Other issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There appears to be some issue around the creation of multiple files one after the other such that only one gets created at a time, but I didn't look into this.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not calling <code>Dispose()</code> (or using <code>using</code> directives) when working with <code>IsolatedStorageFile</code> which implements <code>IDisposable</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The code says it has deleted the files even if there aren't any selected or to delete.</p></li>
<li><p>The app tries to display the IsolatedStorage quota but this concept doesn't exist on the phone. There is no quota whihc is why it shows the maximum value for a 64bit integer regardless of the size of the disk in the phone.</p></li>
<li><p>And possibly more...?</p></li>
</ul>
