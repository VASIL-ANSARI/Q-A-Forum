<p>This has nothing to do with ATTACHing.</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE â¦ AS â¦ does not keep the table definition; it creates a table with the bare minimum of type information to be able to store the values.</p>

<p>If you want to have any different table definition, you have to create the table manually, and then insert the data with <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang_insert.html" rel="nofollow">INSERT INTO â¦ SELECT â¦</a>.</p>
