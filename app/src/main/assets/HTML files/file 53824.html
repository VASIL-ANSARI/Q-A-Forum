<pre><code>SELECT 
 Pk_blog_id,
 Blog_title,
 Blog_content,
 Created_at 
 FROM dbo.tb_IEAG_Blogs 
 WHERE Is_archived = 0 
 AND cast(Created_at as date) &gt;= '2016-02-01'
 AND cast(Created_at as date) &lt;'2016-02-28'
 ORDER BY tb_IEAG_Blogs.Pk_blog_id DESC 
</code></pre>

<p>Try this. Because you are comparing the datetime, 2016-02-01 datetime is not equal to your datetime in table.</p>

<p>If you want select the month, here a better SQL for you.</p>

<pre><code>   SELECT 
     Pk_blog_id,
     Blog_title,
     Blog_content,
     Created_at 
     FROM dbo.tb_IEAG_Blogs 
     WHERE Is_archived = 0 
     AND DATEPART(MONTH, CAST(GETDATE() AS DATETIME)) = 2
     ORDER BY tb_IEAG_Blogs.Pk_blog_id DESC 
</code></pre>
