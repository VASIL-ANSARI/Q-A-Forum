<p>It's a bit tricky mixing a process meant to work with AuthSub with OAuth. I did some digging. So far I can get it to download all my contacts like this...</p>

<pre><code>$client = $token-&gt;getHttpClient($config);
$client-&gt;setMethod(Zend_Http_Client::GET);
$client-&gt;setUri('http://www.google.com/m8/feeds/contacts/default/full/');
$client-&gt;setParameterGet('max-results', '10000');
$client-&gt;setParameterGet('v','3');
$bfeed = $client-&gt;request();
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like the primary difference between us is I specify the Feed URL in the <code>$client-&gt;setUri('http://www.google.com/m8/feeds/contacts/default/full/');</code> and set my version differently. But I can get the <code>body()</code> property of <code>$bfeed</code> and it gives me 245k of XML to dissect.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I'm pulling down a single contact's feed via this method, I was getting an error. </p>

<p>I, like you, am trying to figure this out, so please reply with anything that works for you.</p>
