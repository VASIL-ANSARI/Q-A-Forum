<p>Loads of ways to do this!</p>

<p>I'd recommend you look at the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5267170/how-to-display-the-time-in-users-timezone">question Stepan recommended</a> first </p>

<p><strong>Server Side</strong></p>

<p>If you're wanting to keep your times consistent, you may wish to use the Rails in-built timezone option:</p>

<pre><code>#config/application.rb
config.time_zone = 'Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada)'
</code></pre>

<p>You can see more about <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/TimeZone.html" rel="nofollow">ActiveSupport::Timezone</a> here </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Client-Side</strong></p>

<p>Client-side, you'd have to think about what you want to achieve. If you have set timezones, you may benefit from creating a TimeZone repository (either <code>ENV</code> variables or datatable), and allow user to select from them, like this:</p>

<pre><code>#app/views/form.html.erb
&lt;%= form_tag %&gt;
    &lt;%= select_tag :date, options_from_collection_for_select(@timezones, "id", "name") %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could pass the timezone through javascript: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1091372/getting-the-clients-timezone-in-javascript">Getting the client&#39;s timezone in JavaScript</a></p>

<p><strong>UX</strong></p>

<p>The bottom line is you need to think about what you're trying to achieve. If your users need localized times, you should use a country-select system, where they will give you their country, and you can dedicate a timezone</p>

<p>Speaking from experience, it's much better to store all times equally (using <code>UTC</code>), and then process them using user's specifications</p>
