<p>The .IsBusy only indicates that the backgroundworker is actually performing an operation. It will be busy until "something" is completed. It seems that "something" doesn't finish, keeping your backgroundworkers busy.</p>

<p>So it would help if you could explain what "something" is, and possibly how long it takes to perform "something" on the main thread.</p>
