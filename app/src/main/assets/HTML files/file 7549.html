<p>If they are truly static pages, you can just throw them in the public directory and be done. If you want them to utilize layouts etc, just go ahead and make a couple of controllers.</p>

<p>You can make a simple <code>PagesController</code> to deal with most of the static pages, and perhaps a separate controller to deal with the contact page submissions. In these controllers, just specify the other layout file that you want to use for the marketing pages.</p>

<p>For the css/js, if there are multiple files and you want to keep them separate from the rest of the app, then adding subdirs under each is not a bad way to go. If there is only one css and javascript file, I'd just name them different.</p>
