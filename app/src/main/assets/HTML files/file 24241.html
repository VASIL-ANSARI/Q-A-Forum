<p>The solution using the canvas <em>is</em> the commonly accepted way to solve this problem. It's really not all that hacky, and the end result can be indistinguishable from having a native scrolling container widget.  </p>

<p>If you're making a single column, another option is to use a text widget, and use the widget's ability to embed other widgets. Insert a widget, then insert a newline, insert another widget, etc. You then get the scrolling ability for free. The only thing you need to worry about is configuring the width of the embedded windows, which isn't too hard to do.</p>
