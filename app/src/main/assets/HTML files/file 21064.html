<p>What's unclear? PHP tell you that you call a function on a wrong object. That means exactly what it says: <code>__setSoapHeaders()</code> should be called on SoapClient object and in your script it is not. In other words <code>$this-&gt;sforce</code> is not SoapClient object. See/show your other code on why.</p>
