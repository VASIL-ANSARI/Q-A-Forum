<p>Yes! Don't do this: </p>

<pre><code>obj = params[:klass].classify.constantize.find(params[:id])
</code></pre>

<p>That would allow any user to send a url param and have <code>.find(id)</code> executed on the class with that name! This means they can take data from any model!</p>

<p>The other two errors may be false positives. See this github issue for more info on those: <a href="https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/311" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/311</a></p>
