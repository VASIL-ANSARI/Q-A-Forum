<p>I think hvd has the right idea. You need to do multiplication by repetitive adding. You need to start i at 0 instead of 1 so the first assert won't fail. And you need to add to sum each time through the loop. I'll let you fill in the specific details of how to add. You should not be re-reading the values of x and y inside the loop. Also, you need to have a loop before (like hvd mentioned) that validates the values of x and y (so you won't trigger the first assert).</p>
