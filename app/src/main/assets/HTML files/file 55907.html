<p>Your current code opens the file as part of the <code>WaveReader</code> constructor call :</p>

<pre><code>WaveReader mWaveReader = WaveReader("D:\\Google Drive\\Samples\\Grv Kick Acoustic 01.wav");
</code></pre>

<p>This constructor calls <code>Open</code>, but doesn't handle the case where this call fails.</p>

<p>Instead, call the default constructor, followed by an explicit call to <code>Open</code>, and handle the error case yourself :</p>

<pre><code>WaveReader mWaveReader = WaveReader();
if (!mWaveReader.Open("D:\\Google Drive\\Samples\\Grv Kick Acoustic 01.wav")) {
    // something went wrong - handle this appropriately, and don't use the mWaveReader object
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will at least handle the case where the file wasn't opened properly.</p>
