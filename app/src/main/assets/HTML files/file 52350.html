<p>A hash holds key-value pairs. Each key references one value only and each key is uniq in a hash. The values of your keys <code>weekday</code> and <code>number</code> will be overwritten with each iteration. That's the reason why you get the result of the last iteration only.</p>

<p>You could convert it to an array of hashes as an alternative.</p>

<pre><code>weekdays.map{|day, number| {weekday:day, number: number}}
# =&gt; [{:weekday=&gt;"Monday", :number=&gt;2}, {:weekday=&gt;"Tuesday", :number=&gt;4}, {:weekday=&gt;"Thursday", :number=&gt;5}]
</code></pre>

<p>If your weekdays or numbers are unique in your main array you could use one kind of them as key and the other as value in a hash.</p>

<pre><code>weekdays.to_h
# =&gt; {"Monday"=&gt;2, "Tuesday"=&gt;4, "Thursday"=&gt;5}
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>weekdays.to_h.invert
# =&gt; {2=&gt;"Monday", 4=&gt;"Tuesday", 5=&gt;"Thursday"}
</code></pre>
