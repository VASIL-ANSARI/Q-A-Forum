<p>Well, solved...</p>

<p>Apparently <strong>just putting the .jar in my project and in its buildpath wasn't enough*</strong>.</p>

<p>After step 3 in my question, I would add:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the same eclipse workspace, "import project from existing source" and select <code>C:\Users\Administrator\android-sdks\extras\android\support\v7\appcompat</code></p></li>
<li><p>Right click in it, Properties > Android > "Is Library" must be checked (it already was after the previous step)</p></li>
<li><p>In my project, which is living in the same workspace, right click, Properties > Android > Under the "Library" section, click on "Add.." and add the <code>android-support-v7-appcompat</code> project </p></li>
</ul>

<p>(*) Although now is working, I'm not really sure if the step 2 and 3 in my question are necessary, because the project already "uses" the other project, which should create the same jar. If someone can clarify this last paragraph, would be great.</p>
