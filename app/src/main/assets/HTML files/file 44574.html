<p>I have found solution.</p>

<p>Heroku site in this <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby#introduction" rel="nofollow">link</a> gives OpenSSL <strong>ONLY FOR x86</strong>. If you have x64 you need to download it from <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyinstaller/0rcD9Jlerh4/discussion" rel="nofollow">there</a>.</p>

<p>I hope in future Heroku will provide x64 ssl links in their tutorials.</p>
