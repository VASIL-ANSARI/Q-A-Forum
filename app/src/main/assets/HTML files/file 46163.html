<p>Actually this problem is simply caused by a misunderstanding of statement 3 and 4. "Objects are passed by reference" means that if an object is used as argument for a method, a reference to the object will be passed to the method - think of this reference as an <code>int</code> with a specific meaning. "Object references are passed by value" means that the reference itself will be passed by value. These two don't exclude each other.</p>
