<p>There is no alternate replacement, as conio.h is a non-standard header.</p>

<p>This means you will probably have to either create one yourself and add in it whatever symbols you are using from conio.h, or replace any APIs you are using from conio.h with other alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conio.h" rel="nofollow">this link</a> describes the typical things one might expect to find in conio.h.</p>
