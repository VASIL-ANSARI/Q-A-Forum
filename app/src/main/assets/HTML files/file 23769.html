<p>Assuming you have enough space allocated in 'instrptr' to put the whole binary:</p>

<p>Remember that what you receive in 'fileptr' is not the actual content of the file, but a pointer to structure that describes to C where to find the file. So, you shouldn't make access of the style 'fileptr[i]', but use the defined library calls to get the information. So actually your while loop whould look like:</p>

<pre><code>counter = 0;
int num_word = bytesmb / 4;
while(0 &lt; num_word)
{
   int read = fread((void *)(instcache.instrptr + counter), 4, num_word, fileptr);
   num_word -= read;
   counter += read * 4;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can access the read information through the 'instrptr' array using the []-notation. But make sure not to access beyond 'bytesmb / 4', or you'll start reading stuff that didn't come from the file.</p>
