<p>Image sources and link hrefs are evaluated by the client (browser). This means they are relative to:</p>

<ul>
<li>The web root (if the URL starts with a <code>/</code>). For the purposes of this answer, this can more easily be described as: your domain. If you are on <a href="http://www.yourpage.com/folder1/folder2/file.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpage.com/folder1/folder2/file.php</a> and you reference <code>/img/arrow.png</code>, then it is assumed that you mean <a href="http://yourpage.com/img/arrow.png" rel="nofollow">http://yourpage.com/img/arrow.png</a></li>
<li>The current directory (if the URL doesn't start with a <code>/</code>, or starts with <code>./</code>). If you are on <a href="http://www.yourpage.com/folder1/folder2/file.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpage.com/folder1/folder2/file.php</a> and you reference <code>img/arrow.png</code>, then it is assumed that you mean <a href="http://yourpage.com/folder1/folder2/img/arrow.png" rel="nofollow">http://yourpage.com/folder1/folder2/img/arrow.png</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Includes, on the other hand, are evaluated by the server. This means that they are relative to:</p>

<ul>
<li>The root of the filesystem (if the path starts with a <code>/</code>)</li>
<li>The current working directory of the script (if the path doesn't start with <code>/</code>, or starts with <code>./</code>)</li>
</ul>
