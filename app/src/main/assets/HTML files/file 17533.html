<p>If you want the color of the dropdown to change immediately as soon as the user changes the selection (without reloading the page), you'll have to use JavaScript. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/Javascript"&gt;
    function changeColor(element)
    {
        if (element.selectedIndex != 0)
            element.style.backgroundColor = "green";
        else
            element.style.backgroundColor = "red";
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;select onchange="changeColor(this)"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So that's how you would change the color as soon as the user changes the selection.</p>

<p>To change it on page reload, you would have to use some server-side scripting language (which I'm assuming you're using already). So when creating the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element, you would check to see if its value has been set. If you were using PHP, it might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name="mySelect" style="background-color:&lt;?php echo ($_POST["mySelect"] == "select xyz" ? "red" : "green"); ?&gt;;"&gt;
</code></pre>
