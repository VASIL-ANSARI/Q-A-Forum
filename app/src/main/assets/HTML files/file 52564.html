<p>A easy way to "Install" Netbeans if you are having issues with the installer is to use the zip.</p>

<p>It can easily be found here:
<a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/zip.html" rel="nofollow">https://netbeans.org/downloads/zip.html</a></p>

<p>Depending on what you want to do you will select the package you want. Im guessing since you're taking an online course in java, then you are not a professional programmer, so you wont need JavaEE. I think your best bet is to download "netbeans-8.1-201510222201-javaee.zip" and extract it to a place you can find it, maybe your desktop, or Program Files if you are an admin. Your executable will be in the BIN folder after you extract netbeans. You will see netbeans.exe, netbeans (this is a linux sh file, you don't need it), and netbeans64.exe. </p>

<p>Depending on what system you have, run the appropriate application.</p>

<ul>
<li>netbeans.exe for x86 windows</li>
<li>netbeans for linux</li>
<li>netbeans64.exe for x64 windows.</li>
</ul>
