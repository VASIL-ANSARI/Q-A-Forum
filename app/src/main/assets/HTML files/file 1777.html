<p>I'm not really sure if this is going to fit your needs and it is not direct answer to your question, but version 1.0 of xVal has support for client side validation summaries. Maybe this way you don't have to bother if result is JSON...</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div id="validationSummary"&gt;
    &lt;%= Html.ValidationSummary("Please fix the following problems:") %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and..</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Html.ClientSideValidation("booking", typeof(Booking))
    .UseValidationSummary("validationSummary") %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this was helpfull, regards.</p>
