<p>I'm not sure how much luck you will have with this without a lot of messing around.</p>

<p>No matter how DRY and OO and easy your framework makes things ( which is in this case - alot =) you've still got  to remember it's running in front of a bog-standard relational database, which has atomic commits as one of it's <em>defining</em> <em>features</em>. It's designed from the ground up to make sure either all of your changes are commited, or none.</p>

<p>You're effectively going to be over riding this standard functionality with something that goes 100% against the grain of how rails +  was designed to work. This is likely to lead (as said already) to inconsistent data. </p>

<p>Having said that . . . it's always possible. I would look along the lines of doing manual validation of the attributes you care about, and then using the built-in method <code>object.update_attribute_with_validation_skipping.</code></p>

<p>Good luck! </p>
