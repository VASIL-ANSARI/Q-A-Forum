<p>Without code I can't help you much, but this Exception should point you in the right direction:</p>

<pre><code>04-21 06:45:26.639: E/AndroidRuntime(13862): android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException
</code></pre>

<p>Basically in newer OS versions (I think 4.0+) Google turned on StrictMode which does not allow any access to the network on the main UI thread.  They did this specifically to help developers since the Network can take an indeterminate amount of time and that will stop the UI from being responsive or updating while the network call is ongoing.</p>

<p>So, you need to find the code that is importing the data from the socket and put that into an AsyncTask, and IntentService or some other off Main UI thread.</p>
