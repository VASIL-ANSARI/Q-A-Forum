<p>Just off the top of my head, I guess you could achieve it by using a UIWebView to display the content (which you have linkified, as per the "2: Finding The Interesting Parts" part of the blog post). </p>

<p>If you then prefix the hashtag links with a custom url scheme, like <code>myappopenshashtags://</code>, and register that url scheme for your app, you should be able to open your hashtags in whatever way you please. </p>
