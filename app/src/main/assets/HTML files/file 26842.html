<p>I'm not familiar with <code>android-library</code> plugin yet. But as you said you have dependency to support library added twice.</p>

<p>Normally I would run <code>gradle dependencies</code> to see all tree and after I would exclude transitive dependency to support library (<a href="http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/how_to_exclude_transitive_dependency" rel="nofollow">ref</a>):</p>

<pre><code>dependencies {
   compile('com.actionbarsherlock:actionbarsherlock:4.3.1') {
     //excluding a particular transitive dependency:
     exclude group: 'com.google.android', module: 'support-v4'
   }
 }
</code></pre>
