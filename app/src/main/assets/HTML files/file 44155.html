<p>You can't use that method to test you can use <code>isin</code>:</p>

<pre><code>hd['Date'].isin([next_day])In [5]:

df['Date'].isin([next_day])
Out[5]:
0     True
1    False
2    False
3    False
4    False
Name: Date, dtype: bool
</code></pre>

<p>the problem here is that you are trying to compare a single value with an array so you'll get unexpected results:</p>

<pre><code>In [8]:

next_day in df['Date']
Out[8]:
False
In [7]:

next_day not in df['Date']
Out[7]:
True
</code></pre>

<p>also I can't reproduce your other assertion:</p>

<pre><code>In [17]:

41.106 in df['NAV']
Out[17]:
False
</code></pre>

<p>So the correct method to use is <code>isin</code> and pass a series or list to check if the values in the passed in list exist in your Series as shown above, whatever result you are seeing is bogus and incorrect with respect to <code>41.106 not in hd['NAV']</code>.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>any</code> along with the <code>==</code> operator to check for membership:</p>

<pre><code>In [18]:

next_day == df['Date']
Out[18]:
0     True
1    False
2    False
3    False
4    False
Name: Date, dtype: bool
In [19]:

(next_day == df['Date']).any()
Out[19]:
True
</code></pre>
