<p>I will consider skipping the "flag" step.   Process the CSV file using script or MySql table A using MySQL statement, select a record from old-A table base on whatever criteria, such as field1, or/and field2... of table A, if found, lock and update old-A record, delete processed record from CSV or table A.  If not found, create record in old-A with data. </p>
