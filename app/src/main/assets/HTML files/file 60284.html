<p>You can try that with <a href="https://github.com/nervgh/angular-file-upload" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nervgh/angular-file-upload</a>, it supports input type file with multiple parameter and you don't need jquery.</p>

<p>You just instate new uploader object: <code>$scope.uploader = new FileUploader({var options;});</code> and put directive into upload form <code>&lt;input type="file" nv-file-select uploader="uploader"/&gt;</code> inside your html.</p>
