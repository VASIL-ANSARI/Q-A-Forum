<p>I guess you are using RollingFileAppender.<br>
In this case you would need to use your own appender inheriting from RollingFileAppender and overwrite RollOverRenameFiles to do your logic plus the original implementation.<br>
RollOverTime would be the time. As these are protected, you need to create your own implementation using inheritance.<br>
See <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/sdk/log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppenderMembers.html" rel="nofollow">RollingFileAppender</a> documentation for the details.</p>
