<p>Increasing the replication factor will not increase your read performance. Replication factor provides the concept of <strong><code>Data Availability</code></strong>. Which means, if the corresponding node get downs then the data is retrieved from the replication node. So the query time will be same what ever your replication factor is. </p>

<p>you can get idea of about how the cassandra read works. If you want to increase your read performance then your data modelling should be in good manner. Which means your column family schema and your query should give support of good read performance. Without your column family schema and your query it is hard to explain further(I agree with @kdgregory comment). For data modelling refer <strong><a href="http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.0/cql/ddl/ddl_anatomy_table_c.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.0/cql/ddl/ddl_anatomy_table_c.html</a></strong>.</p>
