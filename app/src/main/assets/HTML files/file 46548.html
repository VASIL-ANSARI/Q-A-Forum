<p>May I suggest to check for FutureTask::isDone?</p>

<p>Would be something like this then:</p>

<pre><code>while(true) {
    if (normal.isDone()) {
        return normal.get();
    }
    if (medium.isDone()) {
        return medium.get();
    }
    if (huge.isDone()) {
        return huge.get();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:
You could <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/FutureTask.html#cancel%28boolean%29" rel="nofollow">cancel</a> the other tasks as soon as you have one result at hand.</p>

<p>Using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html#get()" rel="nofollow">FutureTask::get</a> is not what you look for as it would most likely always return the result of normal.get() because the documentation already states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then retrieves
  its result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To clarify the above:
If you use FutureTask::get the first FutureTask you call get on will most likely block and wait until a result is available to return.</p>

<p>EDIT2:</p>

<p>Wrap that loop into a new Runnable, executed by the ExecutorService, passing the first result available to another method or implement a Callback and there's no more busy waiting.</p>
