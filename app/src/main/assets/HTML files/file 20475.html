<p>The file you are downloading has no HTML in it. It is a comma-separated fle and you should use  the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv module</a> to parse it. </p>

<p>This code will print the first item in each row (the item that contains the date and time):</p>

<pre><code>import csv

with open('unload.cmd', 'r') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        print row[0]
</code></pre>

<p>This works assuming that you are using the file downloaded with the default name.</p>

<p>In order to first download the file programmatically, import it into a string, and then use it as a source file for the <code>csv.reader()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>import urllib
import csv
import StringIO

url = 'http://137.205.144.34/services/unload.cmd?format=csvx&amp;sched=&amp;start=-240:00:00&amp;id=75631&amp;step=864'
f = urllib.urlopen(url)
data = f.read()

reader = csv.reader(StringIO.StringIO(data))
for row in reader:
    if row: print row[0]
</code></pre>
