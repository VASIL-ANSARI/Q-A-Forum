<p>In example #2, you are setting (as a jQuery event handler) a function reference. This reference refers to <code>myFunctionA</code> (and another to its friend <code>myFunctionB</code>).</p>

<p>The function reference is passed a parameter &mdash; see the jQuery documentation for that.</p>

<p>In example #1, you are also setting (as a jQuery event handler) a function reference. This reference refers to an anonymous function, whose body looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>method.myFunctionA(this);
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly it does the same thing, except for the function parameter; you're discarding whatever parameter jQuery wanted to give you, and instead sending <code>this</code> to the ultimate destination of <code>myFunctionA</code>. To add further insule, <code>myFunctionA</code> doesn't even <em>take</em> a parameter, so it's complete wasted effort anyway.</p>
