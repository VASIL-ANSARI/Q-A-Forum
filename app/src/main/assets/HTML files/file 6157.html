<p>The alert view puts a new window on top of the entire screen which intercepts touches. It's expressly designed to prevent you from doing what you're trying to do. Why are you trying to abuse alerts in this manner anyway? It's generally a bad idea to take existing UI and use them in non-standard ways, as well as a possible reason to get rejected.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to just draw the "alert view" yourself, either in code or as a pre-baked image. Unfortunately this means you cannot leverage the built-in code that draws UIAlertView, but it's probably best that you don't try to appear identical to a UIAlertView anyway.</p>
