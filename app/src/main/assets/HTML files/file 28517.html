<p>Since <code>malloc</code> returns a pointer to <code>void</code>, there is no reason to use a C++ - style cast on the pointer: you get a chunk of raw memory, with no structure behind it, so the only thing your can tell the compiler by adding a cast is that you plan to use this memory for data of a particular kind. Compiler must agree with you on that, because it has no additional information to double-check your decision. Neither <code>static_cast&lt;T&gt;</code> nor the <code>reinterpret_cast&lt;T&gt;</code> offer a particular advantage over the C-style cast, and the C-style cast is shorter.</p>

<p>From the personal perspective, I looked at a lot of C++ code, but I've never seen a C++ - style cast used with <code>malloc</code>, only the C-style.</p>
