<p><strong>Don't abuse</strong> <em>regular</em> expressions for parsing <em>non-regular</em> languages.</p>

<p>You are using the wrong tool for this task.</p>

<p>Instead, use a parser for LALR(1) languages, like the Java syntax is.</p>

<p>Wikipedia on LALR parsers:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser</a></p>

<p>Java parser generator "CUP" for LALR languages:</p>

<p><a href="http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/" rel="nofollow">http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/</a></p>

<p>(And it's much smarter to use a tool such as CUP to write a parser for you, than writing the parser yourself with inappropriate tools such as regexps)</p>

<p>And guess what CUP includes as example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: CUP grammar for the Java programming language 1.0 to 1.5</p>
