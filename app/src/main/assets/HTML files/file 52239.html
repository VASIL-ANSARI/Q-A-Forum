<p>The answer to the question posed in the title is "yes". But this is not specific to dicts and lists - it is exactly the same for any object.</p>

<p>Neither is it true that assignment differs from strings. The only difference is that dicts and lists allow you to mutate them; you can see that your code does different things in each case - append for a list and key assignment for a dict, but += for a string. These are different operations, so it shouldn't surprise you that they have different behaviours.</p>
