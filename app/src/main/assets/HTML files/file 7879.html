<p>That's tricky.
Your text in the fancy dropdown is split in three spans, which have classes defining their width.
I don't see that working in the text at the top, it's just an input field.</p>

<p>If you edit the css for input.selectbox however, you could add a defintion for word-spacing, something like word-spacing: 24px; and that will space things out a bit. It won't match, but it won't be as jarring.</p>

<p>If possible, remove the space between the price and the letters "ea" so that the price doesn't get messed up.</p>
