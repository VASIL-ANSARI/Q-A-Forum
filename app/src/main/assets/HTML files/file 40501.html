<p>Your SQL should look more like this, the other answer is also right (about moving your submit button inside the same form with your inputs)</p>

<pre><code>$nickval =  mysqli_real_escape_string ( $conn , $_POST['nick']);
$messageval = mysqli_real_escape_string ( $conn , $_POST['message']);
$sql = "INSERT INTO Messages (nick, message)
VALUES ( '$nickval', '$messageval')";
</code></pre>

<p>As the commenter wrote, don't use $_REQUEST and $_GET, only $_POST is used here.<br>
And if you don't escape your inputs, (as i've done here with mysqli_real_escape_string) you are asking for a world of hurt.</p>
