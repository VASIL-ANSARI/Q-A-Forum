<p>You can go straight to the ActiveRecord::Base.connection to execute SQL <a href="http://www.deploymentzone.com/2012/04/09/postgres-table-value-functions-and-rails-3/" rel="nofollow">which is what I did</a> for some prototype code...</p>

<pre><code>result = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("SELECT * FROM stock_hourly_performance(#{stock_id})")
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if its the best solution to the problem but it got me up and running.</p>
