<p>A thread with similar question and my answer/opinion: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16728709/ibm-worklight-upload-application-to-worklight-server-app-store">IBM Worklight: Upload application to Worklight Server / App Store</a></p>

<p>If you're upping the application version and submit the application to the App Store, the update process is similar to that of any other app on the App Store (remember, a Worklight Hybrid application is still contained inside a "native shell").</p>

<p>The end result is that users of v1.0, will receive an update notice for v2.0 of the same app and the app will simply be updated.</p>
