<p>For the unavailable voices, I use the following:</p>

<pre><code>    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; unavailable = data
            .getStringArrayListExtra("unavailableVoices");
</code></pre>

<p>The results are always in the format 'eng-GBR' or just 'eng'.</p>

<p>If I've misunderstood you're question and you're wondering why you don't get an 'unavailable' output specifically for your search of 'eng-USA-female' (rather than at all), then I can only suggest the format isn't suitable to be past to the search. I would suggest searching 'zzz-ZZZ' to see where the actual problem lies...</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
