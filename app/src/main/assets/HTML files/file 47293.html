<p>You can't really optimize what you are doing.  Basically, you can run a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>where find_in_set(79, comma_separated) &gt; 0 or
      find_in_set(62, comma_separated) &gt; 0 or
      find_in_set(70, comma_separated) &gt; 0 or
      find_in_set(107, comma_separated) &gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>This requires a full-table scan.  And, although the performance might be slightly better than a regular expression, it still will not be efficient.</p>

<p>The proper way to store this data is as a junction table.  This multiplies the number of rows, so the first row in your data becomes three rows in the junction table (one for each value).</p>

<p>There are numerous reasons why you do not want to store lists of things as a comma-separated list.  Your values look like ids in another table, making things even worse:</p>

<ul>
<li>Values should be stored in their native format.  So, storing integers as strings is a bad idea.</li>
<li>The native structure for lists in SQL is a table, not a list.</li>
<li>Functions on tables are more powerful and string functions.</li>
<li>SQL cannot use indexes (with the exception of full text indexes) for string operations.</li>
<li>When you have an id referring to another table, you should have a foreign key constraint.  You cannot do that with lists stored in a string.</li>
</ul>
