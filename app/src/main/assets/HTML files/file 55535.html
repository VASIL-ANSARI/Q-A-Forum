<p>Generate a random number and then access quote by that id. May work better..</p>

<pre><code>    $query = "SELECT COUNT(*) as noQuotes FROM quotes ";
    $result = $connection-&gt;query($query);
    $row = $result-&gt;fetch_assoc();

    $noQuotes = $row["noQuotes"];

    srand(time());
    //echo(rand(1,$noQuotes));
    $randNo = rand(1,$noQuotes);


    $query = "SELECT id, quote, author FROM quotes WHERE id = $randNo ";
    $getQuote = $connection-&gt;query($query);
</code></pre>
