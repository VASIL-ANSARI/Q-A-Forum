<p>gcc is passed libraries by using </p>

<pre><code>gcc -Lfull/path/to/library 
</code></pre>

<p>Or if the library name starts with 'lib' and is on a library search path then you can use -l with lib and .a removed. For example with library called libtest.a . </p>

<pre><code>gcc -ltest
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple of special cases for well used libraries like maths -lm and zlib I think. </p>
