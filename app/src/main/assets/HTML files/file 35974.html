<p>This problem has currently an open issue in TimelineJS project: <a href="https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS/issues/496" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS/issues/496</a></p>

<p>Quoting @gregorleban: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>had the same issue. you have to make sure the tab is visible before
  you call createStoryJS. best is to have something like:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function () {
    createStorylineJS();
    // make sure we create a storyline after the ui has actually updated and the sizes of the controls will be right
}, 100);
</code></pre>

<p>This workaround worked for me. You may need to increase the timer.</p>
