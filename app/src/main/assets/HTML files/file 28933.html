<p>I would suggest to crate a light-weight page which contains an empty DIV and the popup to show to customer. In addition this page should contain some javascript code which loads the entire heavy-weight page asynchroniously. Then the content of the page should be added inside DIV.
This javascript code should be invoked as soon as the popup is shown.</p>
