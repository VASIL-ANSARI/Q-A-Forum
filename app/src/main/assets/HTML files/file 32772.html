<p>The below script seems to satisfy what your looking for. Each field just needs a bit of logic to see if values have been entered. Input and select work like you originally selected them but the check box needs 1 more piece of logic. </p>

<pre><code>var field_div = "";
for(var fc=0; fc&lt;2; fc++)
{
  field_div = "#all_field_"+fc;

  //Check to see if input has value
  if($(field_div + " :input,select").val()) {
    //Field has something
    $(field_div + " :input,select").serializeObject(); //Serialize and store somewhere
  } else {
    //Field doesn't have something
  }

  //Check for selected checkbox
  if($(field_div + " :checkbox:checked").length &gt; 0) {
     //Checkbox is checked
     $(field_div + " :checkbox:").serializeObject(); //Serialize and store somewhere
  } else {
     //Checkbox is not checked
  }

}
</code></pre>
