<p>An <code>integer</code> (Int32) is limited in the values it can store since it "only" uses 32 bits. It can store a value between 2,147,483,647 and -2,147,483,648. (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.int32.aspx" rel="nofollow">More information on MSDN</a>)</p>

<p>The value represented by the <code>txmobileno.Text</code>, is too large or too small.</p>

<p>Looking at the name <code>txmobileno</code> is probably a mobile phone number. This kind of numbers have too much digits to store in an <code>int32</code>. Also a phone number tends to start with a 0 or 00 or + (international). There's no way of storing this kind of information in an integer (or another number type). Just store them in a <code>string</code>.</p>
