<p>I know this is a bit tangential, but have you tried seeing if there are more indexes you can add?</p>

<p>I don't have a lot of DB background, but I am working with databases a lot recently, and I've been finding that a lot of the queries can be improved just by adding indexes.</p>

<p>We are using DB2, and there is a command called db2expln and db2advis, the first will indicate whether table scans vs index scans are being used, and the second will recommend indexes you can add to improve performance.  I'm sure MySQL has similar tools...</p>

<p>Anyways, if this is something you haven't considered yet, it has been helping a lot with me... but if you've already gone this route, then I guess it's not what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Another possibility is a "materialized view" (or as they call it in DB2), which lets you specify a table that is essentially built of parts from multiple tables.  Thus, rather than normalizing the actual columns, you could provide this view to access the data... but I don't know if this has severe performance impacts on inserts/updates/deletes (but if it is "materialized", then it should help with selects since the values are physically stored separately).</p>
