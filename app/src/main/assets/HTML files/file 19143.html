<p>If the sender is using <code>sendStickyBroadcast()</code> or <code>sendStickyOrderedBroadcast()</code>, then the broadcast is sticky.</p>

<p>I will be somewhat surprised if hardware button presses are sticky broadcasts, simply because a button press is truly a point-in-time event. Sticky broadcasts are typically used in cases where the last-broadcast-value is of relevance. So, for example, the current battery level is relevant, so <code>ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED</code> is sticky. But if, say, <code>ACTION_CAMERA_BUTTON</code> were sticky, then all we would find out is whether or not the CAMERA button had been pressed at any time since the phone was last rebooted, which is not usually relevant.</p>
