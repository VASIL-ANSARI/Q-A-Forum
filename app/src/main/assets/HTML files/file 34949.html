<p>I am not 100% sure about this, but based on other apps i have seen and the reason why other apps have been taken down i can think the following.</p>

<p>If your app uses the apple app purchase, then its fine. </p>

<p>If your app uses credits that came from another place, its also fine.</p>

<p>However, these credits SHOULD ONLY be purchasable using the in app purchase when the user access your service through the app. This means, you shouldn't offer any other "way of purchasing" credits while the user is using your app.</p>

<p>As an example i remember a very famous app, which i don't remember which was it, had to be taken down because it showed a link that would let users access the desktop purchase system, directly from the app. </p>

<p>There is also other examples. There are a ton of dating applications that use this system, if you go to their websites you can purchase credit, or you can directly purchase them within the app using the in app store method, the credits are the same for the service, just the way of buying them changes.</p>

<p>Another example is the game hearthstone, you can buy decks in game, but you can also buy them from their website, its not the same as credits, but the main point is the same. </p>

<p>Basically, what i think it means is, money related operations should go through apple if the service is being accessed by your app regardless of anything else.</p>

<p>You might want to wait for someone who has had more experience in this, I am just telling you what i have noticed.</p>
