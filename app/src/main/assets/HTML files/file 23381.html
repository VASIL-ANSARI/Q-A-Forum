<p>As per <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html</a>'s "Rule: Topic branches", the recommendation seems to be</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>If you find you need new features from the branch other to continue working on your topic, merge other to topic. (However, do not do this "just habitually", see below.)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>where "below" reads</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Rule: Merge to downstream only at well-defined points</h1>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not merge to downstream except with a good reason: upstream API
    changes affect your branch; your branch no longer merges to upstream
    cleanly; etc.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Otherwise, the topic that was merged to suddenly contains more than a
  single (well-separated) change. The many resulting small merges will
  greatly clutter up history. Anyone who later investigates the history
  of a file will have to find out whether that merge affected the topic
  in development. An upstream might even inadvertently be merged into a
  "more stable" branch. And so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary, that would mean "merge <code>base</code> into <code>stuff</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if" rel="nofollow" title="if and only if">iff</a> necessary, but never merge <code>develop</code> into <code>stuff</code> (since it probably contains other features irrelevant to <code>stuff</code>)"</p>
