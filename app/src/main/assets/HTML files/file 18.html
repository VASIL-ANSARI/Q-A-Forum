<p>Just to check, if you use <strong>just</strong> this part you get an error?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
include("../includes/connect.php");

$query = "SELECT * from story";
$result = mysql_query($query) or die(mysql_error());
</code></pre>

<p>If so, do you still get an error if you copy and paste one of those Inserts into this page, I am trying to see if it's local to the page or that actual line.</p>

<p>Also, can you post a copy of the connection calls (minus passwords), unless the inserts use exactly the same syntax as this example.</p>
