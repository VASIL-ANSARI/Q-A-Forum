<p>I would use a combination of Composite to represent your Tree structure and a Visitor to visit that tree to build a UI TreeView.
Here are a couple of good real world examples to get you started:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of the Visitor Pattern is to encapsulate an operation that you want to perform on the elements of a data structure. In this way, you can change the operation being performed on a structure without the need of changing the classes of the elements that you are operating on. Using a Visitor pattern allows you to decouple the classes for the data structure and the algorithms used upon them</p>
