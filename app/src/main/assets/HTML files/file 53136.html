<p>AsyncTasks continue to run after the activity has been destroyed. What happens here is that your async task completes after the activity is destroyed and tries to access the now dead activity, throwing the exception - you can't add a fragment to an activity that has finished. You have to check in onPostExecute if the activity is still alive.</p>

<p>AsyncTasks are tricky because they hold a reference to the activity and can cause this kind of issue (where the activity is dead when the task completes). You could consider a fragment with setRetainInstance(true) to run your async tasks, or maybe an IntentService.</p>
