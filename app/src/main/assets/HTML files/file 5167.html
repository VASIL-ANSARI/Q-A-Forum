<p>Would it work to get the window's client rect, rather than its full rect? I believe that will return the client area of the window, which is the window's rect minus the border and title bar.</p>

<p>If you go this route, you will need to convert the rect into screen coordinates before calling <code>ClipCursor()</code>, though.</p>
