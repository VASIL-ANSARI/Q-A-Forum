<p>This means when you encounter error at one point, the error appears again while redoing it.This may help you : delete everything that were downloaded during gradle build, it might be inside user .gradle folder or hidden folder app. After that again create new project with everything you need for future too which might download all required components. Make sure your internet connection does not get disconnected during download. You may use LibGDX 1.6.2 jar file </p>
