<p>If I explicitly cast the offending columns as times prior to reading the file into the data table, this fixes my problem and the imported columns in the SQL table are time data types. </p>

<pre><code> using (ExcelRange col = ws.Cells["G:G"])
 {
     col.Style.Numberformat.Format = "HH:mm";
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Still do not understand the underlying reason they're coming in as INT when they appear formatted as [h]:mm:ss in the .xlsx however...</p>
