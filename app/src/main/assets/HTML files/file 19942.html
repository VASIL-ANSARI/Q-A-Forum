<p>Because the text selection is happens in android on a separate class WebTextView so if we tryies to get the selected word using javascript method -</p>

<pre><code>var range = window.getSelection ();  
</code></pre>

<p>but this functions returns nothing if you want the selected word you can use reflection for that in case if you want that i will add that code later.</p>
