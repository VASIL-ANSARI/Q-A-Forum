<p>Since <strong>everything</strong> in the Windows Azure Platform is managed through a REST Services, you just need a reliable REST library for C++ to perform what you need.</p>

<p>You can have a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1961238/can-anyone-recommend-a-good-c-c-restful-framework">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4222879/restful-client-api-in-c">that</a> questions for C++ REST library.</p>

<p>Then you can revice the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd179355.aspx">Azure Storage Services REST API Reference</a> for more details on what you want to achieve.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Just looked the the <a href="http://pocoproject.org/index.html">POCO libraries</a>, noted they have <a href="http://pocoproject.org/docs/Poco.Net.HTTPRequest.html">HTTPRequest</a> and <a href="http://pocoproject.org/docs/Poco.Net.HTTPResponse.html">HTTPResponse</a> classes. They, along with <a href="http://pocoproject.org/docs/Poco.Net.X509Certificate.html">X509Certificate</a> should be enough to make a valid REST call to Azure management service.</p>
