<p>Ok, here's a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why are you using <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements?  are you able to just use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s?</li>
<li>There's a few approaches for this.  But just using CSS floats may not work for you.  Even though your math is perfectly correct, as I stated above, the browser can not do a fraction of a pixel.  If you were to float these perfectly and you still got the margins to work, every once in a while, your far right image would push down as if it were floating around the other two.  </li>
</ol>

<p>You could float the third element to the right and not have a margin after the second one.  If you do your math right, you can get this to look proper, but you may still have unequal margins if you do this.
