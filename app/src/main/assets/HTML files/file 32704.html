<p>As per my comment you are trying to add the class to "img" which is undefined. Either switch that out so you have</p>

<pre><code>image.addClass('classname')
</code></pre>

<p>Or since it's a short selector just insert that</p>

<pre><code>$('img').addClass('classname')
</code></pre>

<p>Also make sure that the jQuery call is being made within a <code>$(document).ready(...)</code> call</p>
