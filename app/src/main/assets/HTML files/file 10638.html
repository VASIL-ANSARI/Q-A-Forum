<p>After you load the properties file, iterate over the keys.</p>

<p>For each key, you'll have a question number, and a property of that question. For each question's response properties you'll have a response number, and the response value.</p>

<p>Create either a map, or a collection, of <code>Question</code> objects. Each <code>Question</code> object has a <code>description</code> property, and a collection of response strings.</p>

<p>The <code>description</code> property of each <code>Question</code> is set when you iterate over that question's <code>description</code> property. For each response value property, add the property value to the collection of responses.</p>

<p>To get it back to XML, you can either expose the question list to the JSP and iterate over each question (and inside that loop, iterate over the question's responses). Or you could marshall the object directly to XML via any of the normal Java libraries for doing so.</p>

<p>You don't really need the number of questions property since they're enumerated in the property names themselves.</p>
