<li><p>You could have a look at <a href="https://github.com/tumblr/Bookends" rel="nofollow">Bookends</a></p></li>
<li><p>Or another(the way i usually do it) way would be to use a GridLayouManager with a <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup.html" rel="nofollow">SpanSizeLookUp</a>. And use multiple ViewTypes i.e. one for Header,Footer and Items.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Go for 1 if you have only a single header and what a <em>ListView-ish</em> interface in your code.</p>

<p>Go for 2 if you are not sure about how many Custom ViewTypes you would be adding.It assures you have maximum scalability in the future.</p>

<p>If you are considering massive scalability,I suggest you read <a href="http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/adapter-delegates/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> by Hannes Dorfman .</p>
