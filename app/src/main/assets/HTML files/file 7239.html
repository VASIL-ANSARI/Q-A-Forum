<p>Here is the source for that <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/locking/pessimistic.rb" rel="nofollow">locking call</a>. It calls reload and its source looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>          # File lib/active_record/base.rb, line 2333
2333:       def reload(options = nil)
2334:         clear_aggregation_cache
2335:         clear_association_cache
2336:         @attributes.update(self.class.find(self.id, options).instance_variable_get('@attributes'))
2337:         @attributes_cache = {}
2338:         self
2339:       end
</code></pre>

<p>so when you call reload(:lock => lock) as the call to lock does it it really updating the attributes of that record.</p>

<p>There are a lot of different situations here. You could try to lock a record that dosnt exist, or lock one that has been locked elsewhere. What error are you interested in catching?</p>
