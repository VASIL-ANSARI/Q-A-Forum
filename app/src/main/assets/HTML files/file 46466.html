<p>In the first case, <code>i</code> is accessible outside the <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>In the second case, the scope of <code>i</code> is restricted to the <code>for</code> loop body.</p>

<p>Arguably the second case gives you better program stability since the use of <code>i</code> outside the <code>for</code> loop is often unintentional.</p>
