<p>Most PHP sites should have a file (I call it a header) that you include on every single page of the site. If you put that first line of code in the header file, then include it like this on every page:</p>

<pre><code> include 'header.php';
</code></pre>

<p>you won't have to use the global keyword or anything, the second line of code you wrote should work.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh sorry, that won't work inside functions... now I see your problem.</p>

<p>Edit #2: Ok, take my original advice with the header, but use a <a href="http://php.net/define" rel="nofollow" title="Dr. Explain">define()</a> rather than a variable. Those work inside functions after being included.</p>
