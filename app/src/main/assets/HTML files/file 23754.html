<p>The backup and restore process will take an exact snapshot of your data and restore it identically. If you want to "merge" two databases then you will need to script both the added columns, tables and data to the production database. There are tools in SQL management studio for this. </p>

<p>Dropping an index of key will not affect the underlying data. It may block you accessing it while the key is being created (the clustered index is the order the data is stored in the data file). If you want to transfer data between dev and prduction it may be quicker to resore a copy of dev as a spare database on the prod seerver and script an insert between the two databases. Note SQL takes restore seriously and uses all resources to do it as quickly as possible (to the detriment of all other SQL processes) so truncate every table you dont need to transfer data from before backup</p>

<p>The primary key is the index which determins the idenity of each unique row. The custered index determins the order the data is stored and accessed in the file. If you have two rows with the same primary key (which may not be unique) then SQL will add a uniquifying column in the background. SQL will lock the table whist a new clustered index is being implimneted. the underlying data istself will not be changed.</p>
