<p><em>backspace</em> is a special character that is interpreted by editors and various text input boxes as a request to remove the character before the cursor. The <em>backspace</em> character itself has no magical powers, it cannot make disappear something that was already displayed.</p>

<p>If you need to remove some characters from a string in PHP you can use <strong>substring()</strong>, <strong>str_replace()</strong>, <strong>preg_replace()</strong> or other string handling function.</p>

<p>For example, you can ignore the last 3 characters from a string like this:</p>

<pre><code>echo(substr('blah-blah', 0, -3));
</code></pre>
