<p>The problem here is your base case doesn't make sense. If there are 0 steps left, there is only one way to climb. Your base case says if there are 0 ways there are 0 ways to climb.</p>

<p>Also, you don't need an else statement in this case to call the recursive case. The method should get there if the return statements haven't been called at the top.</p>

<pre><code>int climb(int a){       
   if(a &lt;= 2)          
       return a;       
   return climb(a-1)+climb(a-2);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code for 2 steps at a time. You figure out the 3 steps at a time code...</p>
