<p>So you want to let other websites embed an iframe showing <strong>some</strong> content from your website but not the <strong>entire</strong> website. What you could do (though probably not the only solution) is to take the content you want to share, say a blog post, and make that into a standalone HTML page. </p>

<p>So create a page with URL <code>foobar.com/blog/post1</code> but it only contains the post, not your entire website layout, navbar, footer etc. (This will be the case if you are using a MVC or making a SPA website). Make sure to include necessary styles and scripts with it too.</p>

<p>This can then be included in an iframe: <code>&lt;iframe src="http://foobar.com/blog/post1"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></p>

<p>Another alternative is to write an API where the other websites can request your blog post (or pictures, content or whatever) as .JSON objects, possibly containing the HTML as a string.</p>

<p>Really there are quite a few options depending on it being static or dynamic content. For dynamic I would suggest to use an iframe containing the mini app, which gets updated data through an API, or maybe even websockets if it has to be live.</p>

<p>And don't forget to deal with CORS on your server.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>So you want to offer a JS file for other's to include in their code similarly to requesting a JS library from a CDN:</p>

<pre><code>https://code.jquery.com/jquery-git2.js
</code></pre>

<p>In this case you can load a JS file from somebody's server. Similarly you offer a JS file for the other websites to include. This JS will load content from your server via a HTTP request. There are many libraries which facilitate this, try learning about JQuery Ajax<a href="http://viralpatel.net/blogs/jquery-ajax-tutorial-example-ajax-jquery-development/" rel="nofollow">(tutoriallink)</a>.</p>

<p>Then as @halfer suggested, you ask the website owner to have a <code>div</code> with a unique id, say <code>'your_website_name'</code> which your JS script searches for and populates with data received from your server.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="your_website_name"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>Your question was very vague so don't hate on the SO community trying to help. In the comments they added ideas to spur on other users' answers, otherwise they would have posted an answer. </p>

<p>I think what you are actually searching for is how to populate HTML via JS, and pull data via the network as you seem to know the rest. Read up on these terms, maybe look at some JS libraries such as <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">JQUERY</a>, <a href="http://mootools.net/" rel="nofollow">Mootools</a> or even <a href="http://todomvc.com/" rel="nofollow">MVC</a> frameworks if your "applet" is quite complex.</p>

<p>If you want more help, post a new and <strong>more specific</strong> question about your use-case, any code you have written so far helps too.</p>
