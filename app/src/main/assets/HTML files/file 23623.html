<p>When you are trying this structure, the query is executed over and over again.
Please first try to set the query in a variable and use that in you're while loop:</p>

<pre><code>$query = mysql_query("YOUR QUERY!");

while($topic = mysql_fetch_array($query)) {
    print_r($topic);
}
</code></pre>
