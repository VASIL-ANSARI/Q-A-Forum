<p>I'm not sure how celery is coming into play here, since you're just doing the RabbitMQ "Hello, world" tutorial, which has nothing to do with celery. But I believe those warnings are actually just caused by a bug in pika. It's not anything you're doing wrong with your example. See the bug report here: <a href="https://github.com/pika/pika/pull/346" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pika/pika/pull/346</a></p>

<p>Note that they're just warnings; they're being printed when connection.close() is called, and won't affect the behavior of the program at all.</p>
