<p>If you want ClassB to have ClassA functionality, you should enhance ClassB either through inheritance or through composition. For example:</p>

<p>Inheritance:</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassB extends ClassA {
  // now can use or override ClassA methods.
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Composition:</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassB {
  private ClassA classA = new ClassA();

  // now we can use classA instance throughout this class
}
</code></pre>

<p>As a general rule, I try to favor composition over inheritance. An example of composition is giving your class a Scanner or ArrayList object, and using the Scanner or ArrayList in the methods of the class. As you can see, it would make no sense to try to have your class extend either of these two entities except in very peculiar circumstances. </p>

<p>Otherwise your question is still quite unclear and if you're still having problems and need our help, you would do well to give concrete examples of what you're trying to achieve.</p>
