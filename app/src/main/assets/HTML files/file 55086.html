<p>fgets stops reading when a newline character is read. In your example, stdin already has a '\n' in it so fgets takes it and is done. This is because scanf doesn't read the newline character you get when you enter the number, leaving it in stdin. </p>

<p>Two solutions:</p>

<p>Instead of fgets, use <code>scanf("%s", name);</code>. This works because <code>%s</code> will ignore white space and newlines before the string it takes.</p>

<p>User getchar() to read the newline. </p>
