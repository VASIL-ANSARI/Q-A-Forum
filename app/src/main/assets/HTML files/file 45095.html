<p>You can have a login rest call that returns a key with the session on App2 server. That key must be sent in the next calls for validating the sender.</p>

<p>Another thought, all calls go throught App1 so controlling the session on App1 is enough. If session is expired on App1 no calls are made to App2.</p>

<p>If what you need is sharing the session data, you'll need another mechanism to sync them in both servers.</p>
