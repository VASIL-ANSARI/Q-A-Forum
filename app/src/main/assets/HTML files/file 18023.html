<p>Add something after the tag declaration. Perhaps:</p>

<pre><code>struct manager
{
    short int age;
    float shares;
    short int level;
} manager;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Side note: you're not using the union right. The key, i.e. the field that tells you whether you are dealing with a manager or with a mere worker should be in an enclosing object, <strong>outside the union</strong>. Perhaps:</p>

<pre><code>struct employee {
    char key;

    union {
        struct manager ...;
        struct worker ...;
    } u;
};
</code></pre>

<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/335858/dasblinkenlight">dasblinkenlight</a> notes, you could declare your manager / worker tags outside the union.</p>
