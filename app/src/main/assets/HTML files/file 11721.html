<p>Your onWindowFocusChanged calls <code>Thread.start()</code> several times for the same thread which is incorrect. You may want to use a  variable  like <code>isStarted</code> to guarantee that <code>Thread.start()</code> is called only once. Or start a new thread each time. That depends on your program's logic.</p>
