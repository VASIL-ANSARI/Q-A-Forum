<p>Had to try to do this in as few lines as possible, interesting problem, i would not convert your method to LINQ though, if it already works (what works works)</p>

<pre><code>lDimensionValues = pMemberCollection.Where(a =&gt; {
           decimal lDimensionValued;
           return decimal.TryParse(a.Name, out lDimensionValued);
       }).Select(a=&gt; decimal.Parse(a.Name)).Sort();
</code></pre>
