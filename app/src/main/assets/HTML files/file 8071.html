<p>Even something as simple as <code>\d{1,2}(:[0-5]\d)?</code> should suffice.</p>

<pre><code>\d                 A digit
\d{1,2}            One or two digits
\d{1,2}:           One or two digits followed by :
\d{1,2}:[0-5]      One or two digits followed by : followed by a digit 0 to 5
\d{1,2}:[0-5]\d    ...followed by a digit (0 to 5) and another digit
\d{1,2}(:[0-5]\d)? ...making the :XX part optional due to the ?
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second update:</strong> Fixed to account for the optional :XX part.</p>
