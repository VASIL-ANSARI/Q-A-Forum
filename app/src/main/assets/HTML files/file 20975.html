<p>In the case you describe <code>a</code> is allocated by the C++ program and passed to <code>memcpy()</code>. That means that the behavior is still undefined.</p>

<p>However, this does not mean that the behavior will be random or change between runs. Undefined means that the behavior is not defined. That means that you cannot rely on any particular behavior, including the program breaking. Some of the hardest problems to debug in C or C++ is when the compiler translates an undefined construct into something which works as expected. Then suddenly things stop working when you change a compiler flag.</p>
