<p>Does <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/jsdoc/symbols/jasmine.Matchers.html#toHaveBeenCalledWith" rel="nofollow">toHaveBeenCalledWith()</a> not work for you? In most cases you either know the values ahead of time, or can calculate them.</p>

<p>If you really need to use a function to evaluate the args for the call, you could use separate expectations and <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/jsdoc/symbols/jasmine.Spy.html#argsForCall" rel="nofollow">argsForCall</a> to test each arg individually.</p>

<p>If worst comes to worst, you can always write your own matcher. But that sounds a lot harder than the first two :)</p>
