<p>Perhaps you shouldn't start with an Empty Web Application, because it just gives you the references to the assemblies, but doesn't give you any sample code.</p>

<p><strong>ASP.NET Web App</strong>, is a NOT empty web app (meaning it has a basic setup of files), meant to be used with ASP.NET WebForms. For tutorials: <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-forms">http://www.asp.net/web-forms</a> </p>

<p><strong>ASP.NET MVC 2 Empty Web Application</strong> is an empty project, meant to be used with ASP.NET MVC version 2 (the current version). For tutorials:  <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">http://www.asp.net/mvc</a></p>

<p><strong>ASP.NET MVC 3 Empty Web Application</strong> is an empty project, meant to be used with ASP.NET MVC version 3 (now a release candidate). For info: <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3">http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3</a></p>

<p>Before creating your framework, dig into the tutorials, play around, and only then start building your framework. </p>

<p>And about WebForms vs MVC, that's a whole other discussion. I personally switched for my new project to MVC, and perhaps it's better suitable for your Framework app.</p>
