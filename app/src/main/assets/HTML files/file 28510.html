<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>clean = re.sub('[\0\200-\377]', '', dirty)
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is to match each NUL or "high ASCII" character (i.e. \0 and those that do not fit in 7 bits) and remove them.  You could add more characters as you find them, such as ASCII ESC or BEL.</p>

<p>Or this:</p>

<pre><code>clean = re.sub('[^\040-\176]', '', dirty)
</code></pre>

<p>The idea being to only permit the limited range of "printable ASCII," but note that this also removes newlines.  If you want to keep newlines or tabs or the like, just add them into the brackets.</p>
