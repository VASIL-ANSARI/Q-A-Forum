<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two objects refer to the same hash key when their hash value is identical and the two objects are <code>eql?</code> to each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, what does <code>Array#eql?</code> do?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns true if self and other are the same object, or are both arrays with the same content (according to Object#eql?)</p>
</blockquote>
