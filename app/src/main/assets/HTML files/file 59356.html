<p>You can check for the existence in index and columns:</p>

<pre><code>('kiwi' in df.index) and ('apple' in df.columns)
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use a try/except block:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    df.ix['kiwi', 'apple'] += some_value
except KeyError:
    df.ix['kiwi', 'apple'] = some_value
</code></pre>

<p>Note that DataFrames' shapes are not meant to be dynamic. This may slow down your operations heavily. So it might be better to do these things with dictionaries and finally turn them into DataFrames.</p>
