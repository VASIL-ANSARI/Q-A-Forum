<p>You should add the <strong>CocoaPods</strong> on under <strong>Source Control</strong>. That means that you should add everything from your project under <strong>Source Control</strong> and ignore the files you don't want under .gitignore file. </p>

<h2>Creating a .gitignore file</h2>

<pre><code>cd yourProjectDirectory
touch .gitignore
open -e .gitignore
</code></pre>

<p>On <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a> you a list of things that are recommended to be put on .gitignore, depending on your programming language that you are using.</p>

<h2>Adding everything under Source Control</h2>

<pre><code>cd yourProjectDirectory
git add . //This line will add every recognized file under Repo
</code></pre>

<h2>Now you are free on your customizations</h2>

<p>You can make your own customizations and push the changes on repo. And if someone will add a new pod under podfile, then installing it, will not affect the current version of your file, CocoaPods automatically on the first run generates a podfile.lock, which keeps track of your Pods</p>
