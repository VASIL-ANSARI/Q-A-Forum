<p>Short answer is yes, all your network requests should be asynchronous.</p>

<p>Maybe it helps to imagine it like a row of dominoes with each request a domino, and the completion handler is what you use to push the next domino in the row.</p>

<p>Your <code>-DoAPI_A_WithData...</code> method hides the completion handler, that's why you are not seeing how it should work.</p>

<p>You could rework it like</p>

<pre><code>- (int) doAPI_A_WithData: (NSData *)data onCompletion: (ResponseBlock)resultHandler
</code></pre>

<p>where you call the <code>resultHandler</code>, that does whatever you need with the response, from the task's <code>completionHandler</code>.</p>
