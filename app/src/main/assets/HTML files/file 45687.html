<p>From Chrome's JS console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 405 (Method Not Allowed)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you are adding an Authorization header, you have made the request <em>complex</em>. This requires the browser to make a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests" rel="nofollow">preflight OPTIONS request</a> to ask for permission to send the complex request.</p>

<p>The server you are making the request to is responding saying that OPTIONS requests are not allowed to that URL.</p>

<p>You will need to modify the server so that it responds appropriately to the preflight CORS request.</p>

<hr>

<p>Postman doesn't need to make a preflight request because your browser trusts Postman's code. It doesn't know if it can trust the code it received from JSFiddle (AKA <em>potential evil hacker site</em>) with the data api05.iq.questrade.com (AKA <em>potential online banking or company Intranet site</em>) is willing to share with it.</p>
