<p>Looking at the sample file, stupidly, it doesnt include any of the standard android framework files (gradle, manifest etc), so Android Studio will not be able to automatically import it.</p>

<p>To get round this you should create a new blank project, leave the mainactivity that is generated.</p>

<p>Then go in to the file structure of the new project and copy in the files from the sample in to the corresponding files. Make sure you overwrite the files in the new project.</p>

<p>Then go in to the code base in Android Studio and delete any imports that cant be found due to incorrect package names. Re import these (alt + enter on mac) with the correct package names and then build and you should be good to go.</p>
