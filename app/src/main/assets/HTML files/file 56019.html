<p>I would solve it by basic trigonometry.</p>

<p>For simplicity and convenience lets assume:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>coordinates <strong>[0,0]</strong> are in the middle of the geometry (where all the lines there intersect) and in the middle of the texture (and they map to each other - <strong>[0,0]</strong> in geometry is <strong>[0,0]</strong> in the texture). </p></li>
<li><p>the texture coordinates span from <strong>-1</strong> to <strong>1</strong> (and also assume the geometry coordinates do too in the case of <strong>90</strong> degrees - in other cases it may get wider and shorter) </p></li>
<li><p>possitive values for <strong>x</strong> span right and <strong>y</strong> up. And assume that <strong>x</strong> geometry axis is aligned with the <strong>u</strong> texture axis no matter the <strong>angle</strong> (which is 89.90 in your figures).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Something like this:

<p>Then to transform from texture <strong>[u,v]</strong> to geometry <strong>[x,y]</strong> coordinates:</p>

<pre><code>x = u + v*cos(angle)
y = v*sin(angle)
</code></pre>

<p>To illustrate, it is basically a shear transformation and scale transformation to preserve length of <strong>y</strong> (or alternatively - similar to rotation transform, but rotating only one axis - <strong>y</strong> - not both). If I reverse that transformation (to get the texture coordinates we want):</p>

<pre><code>u = x - y*cotg(angle)
v = y/sin(angle)
</code></pre>

<p>With those equations I should be able to transform any geometry coordinates (a point) in the described situation into texture coordinates. For any <strong>angle</strong> in a <strong>(0, 180)</strong> range anyway</p>

<p>(Hopefully I didn't make too many embarrassing errors in there)</p>
