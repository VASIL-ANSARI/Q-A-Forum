<p>Suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Never draw directly within a JApplet or other top-level window. </li>
<li>Instead draw in the paintComponent of a JPanel that is displayed within the applet. The Swing tutorials will show you how.</li>
<li>Be sure to call the <code>super.paintComponent(g)</code> method within your override, and again read the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html" rel="nofollow">Swing tutorials</a> to see why. For more tutorials see: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/swing/info">Swing Info</a></li>
<li>This is Swing -- use a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html" rel="nofollow">Swing Timer</a> to drive your animation, not threads.</li>
<li>If you ever do use Threads, <strong>never</strong> call <code>Thread#stop()</code> or use any other deprecated methods. Please read <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/concurrency/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html" rel="nofollow">Why is Thread.stop deprecated?</a>.</li>
<li>Please look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9986368/522444">this answer</a> for an example of Swing animation using a Swing Timer.</li>
<li>Unless this is for a class assignment, don't create JApplets as this is a dead technology, something even Oracle will tell you.</li>
<li>To display text in the background use the java.awt.Graphics method for writing text: <code>drawString(...)</code>. Either that or place a JLabel over your background image.</li>
</ol>
