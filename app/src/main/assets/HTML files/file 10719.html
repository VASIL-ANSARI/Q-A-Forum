<p>I would do this by setting up before_save filters on each of the corresponding models. Load the saved state of that current object, and compare the relative attributes. If none of the attributes changed, return false:</p>

<pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  before_save :check_for_changes

private
  def check_for_changes
    saved = Post.find(self.id)
    should_save = false
    if saved.body != self.body || saved.title != self.title
      should_save = true
    end
    should_save
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>That said, i think the in place editing gem is a good idea. There may be another gem out there that does this as well. I'm just personally not aware of it.</p>
