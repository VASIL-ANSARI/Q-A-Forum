<p>It may be tough to do this without some custom code, especially in the cart. The number of ways that you can add to an order's cost in the shopping cart is relatively low.</p>

<p>My suggestion -- depending on how you are handling the actual fulfillment -- would be to add a shipping method (or try to repurpose the existing shipping methods) that depends on the cost of the order. The existing methods typically give you tiers to use (<code>$25-50 == X cost</code>, <code>$51-75 == y cost</code>, etc), but you could add a custom shipping module that operates on straight percentages. Either way, this would add to the cost of the order quickly and cleanly. The complication is obviously that you need to retain the actual cost of shipping, but that depends on your own internal policies.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Thanks,
