<p>Found the answer for my exact case on <strong>17.5.3 Redirecting to views</strong> from <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html" rel="nofollow">Spring's Docs</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is sometimes desirable to issue an HTTP redirect back to the
  client, before the view is rendered. This is desirable, for example,
  when one controller has been called with POST data, and the response
  is actually a delegation to another controller (for example on a
  successful form submission). In this case, a normal internal forward
  will mean that the other controller will also see the same POST data,
  which is potentially problematic if it can confuse it with other
  expected data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be done with the following:</p>

<pre><code>return "redirect:/form";
</code></pre>

<p>A nice benefit to the <code>redirect</code> is that it prevents the user from accidentally re-<code>POST</code>ing the same data by performing a refresh. The refresh forces a <code>GET</code> of the result page, not a resend of the initial POST data.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> </p>

<p>The default <code>redirect:/view</code> will append your model attributes to your URL as query params. This may be undesirable in some cases as it could expose sensitive information to the user. Utilize <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/support/RedirectAttributes.html" rel="nofollow"><code>RedirectAttributes addFlashAttribute(String attributeName, Object attributeValue)</code></a> method to in order to store Flash Attributes that will be used to store attributes when redirected from one URL to another (Success/Failure messages, etc.)</p>
