<p>That is doing exactly what you are coding. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>1st</p>

<p>you need to learn about aspect mode,  you are doing a 3:4 scene but trying to render it in a 9:16 device,  You have 4 choices:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>.AspectFill:</strong>  This is default in XCodes template and will scale the
  scene up to the farthest borders while maintaining aspect ratio.  This
  will result in cropping on the closer borders of the device in lieu of
  black borders on the farthest borders</p>
  
  <p><strong>.AspectFit:</strong>  This will scale the scene up to the closest borders while
  maintaining aspect ratio.  This will result in black borders on the
  farthest borders of the device in lieu of cropping on the closer
  borders</p>
  
  <p><strong>.Fill:</strong>  This will scale the scene on both sides, but will not retain
  aspect ratio, giving you no cropping or black borders, but will yield
  in distortion of images via a fatty or slimming effect</p>
  
  <p><strong>.ResizeFill:</strong>  This will resize the scene coordinates to that of the
  view it is in.  This means there is no scaling, and on larger devices
  the sprites will appear smaller, with more visibility to the entire
  scenes contents.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>2nd:</p>

<p>You need to understand that the default origin for the scene is the bottom left corner, while all children inside the scene have it in the center.  When plotting your points, you need to take this into effect.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now from what I am seeing here, you have <code>.ResizeFill</code> going on, and you are assuming origin of the scene is bottom left.  So what is happening is your scene is getting resized to that of the IPhone 5,  and due to this resize,  your tiles are now off location because the center of the scene changed from the point (512,384) to point (160,284) meaning you need to ass/subtract less than you would on the phone as you would the iPad.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to use <code>.AspectFill</code> for a <code>ScaleMode</code>, and to set the scenes <code>AnchorPoint</code> to (0.5,0.5)</p>
