<p>One view doesn't product <em>two</em> result sets.  But you can identify where they come from:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW TEAM_SUMMARY AS
   SELECT 'Team1' as which,
          c.country_name AS CountryName_T1, count(Team1) AS NoOfGames,
          SUM(Team1_score) AS TotalGoalsFor,
          SUM(Team2_score) AS TotalGoalsAgainst
    FROM COUNTRY c JOIN
         MATCH_RESULTS mr
         ON c.country_name = mr.Team1
    GROUP BY country_name
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Team2' as which,
           c.country_name AS CountryNameT_2,
           count(Team2) AS NoOfGames,
           SUM(Team2_score) AS TotalGoalsFor,
           SUM(Team1_score) AS TotalGoalsAgainst
    FROM COUNTRY c JOIN
         MATCH_RESULTS mr
         ON c.country_name = mr.Team2
    GROUP BY country_name;
</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> with <code>GROUP BY</code> is almost always unnecessary (as in this case.</li>
<li>Use <code>UNION ALL</code> by default.  Only use <code>UNION</code> when you specifically want to incur the overhead for removing duplicates.</li>
<li>Table aliases make the query easier to write and to read.</li>
<li>The above adds a column <code>which</code> to specify where each row comes from.</li>
</ul>
