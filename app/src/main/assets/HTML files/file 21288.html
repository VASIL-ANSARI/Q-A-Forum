<p>A code block has access to any variables that are within the scope that the block was declared in. However, any variable/object declared outside of the block's scope is immutable within the block. You can read it, but not change it. Setting the __block flag in the object's declaration allows it to be changed within the block's scope. </p>

<p>EDIT: Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *myString = @"hello";
dispatch_sync(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
    myString = @"hello world";
});
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work, and you'll get an error message.</p>

<pre><code>__block NSString *myString = @"hello";
dispatch_sync(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
    myString = @"hello world";
});
</code></pre>

<p>Problem solved!</p>
