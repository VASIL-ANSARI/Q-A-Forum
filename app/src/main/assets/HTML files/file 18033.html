<p>The problem is likely that your server-client code is in fact <strong><em>not</em></strong> working in the background but instead working on the Swing event thread. You can test this you know with a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingUtilities.html" rel="nofollow">SwingUtilities</a> method: <code>SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread()</code></p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you using a SwingWorker to do the background work?</li>
<li>Are you doing any <code>join()</code> calls with a background thread?</li>
<li>Are you waiting on a SwingWorkers <code>get()</code> method?</li>
</ul>

<p>The details of your code will likely help us give you more specific advice. To learn what you're supposed to do, please read, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html" rel="nofollow">Lesson: Concurrency in Swing</a></p>
