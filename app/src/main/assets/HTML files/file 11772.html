<p>I'm not sure if XSD.exe even supports mixed="true" types (mixins ?). You should try to see what got generated from a type that has CONSIDERATION in it's type hierarchy definition. Maybe you'll find your fields there.
This is a case of type system impedance mismatch as the concept the schema is trying to define does not properly match .NET type system (single inheritance). Just try to wrap you head around <code>&lt;xs:restriction base="xs:anyType"&gt;</code> and what it should mean from .NET point of view :).</p>
