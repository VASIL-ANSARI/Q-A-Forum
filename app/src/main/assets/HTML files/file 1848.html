<p>As the manual page doesn't say anything about changing the default charset, I don't think there is a way to do that ; and I don't remember having ever seen anything about that.</p>

<p>I wouldn't use anything like apd either -- instead, I would probably :</p>

<ul>
<li>create my own function, that calls htmlentities with the right parameters</li>
<li>and replace every call to htmlentities by a call to my new function <em>(this can probably be done automatically, using a few lines of scripts)</em></li>
</ul>
