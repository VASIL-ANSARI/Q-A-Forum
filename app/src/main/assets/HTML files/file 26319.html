<p>Something simple like this would get you the data you need, to some extent:</p>

<pre><code>    var reader = XDocument.Load("path to XML file");
    var data = reader.Element("UPLOADINFO")
                     .Element("UPLOADDATA")
                     .Attribute("RCTICKET")
    var values = data.Split(',');
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to work with that RCTICKET string to extract the value you need. It would be a bit safer to work with commas, colons, and whatnot in the context of a single attribute instead of the whole file. Caveat: When I generated an incident file, I ended up with multiple IP addresses in the RCTICKET field. I have multiple VPNs and ethernet adapters in my machine. You will have to pick the right one.</p>

<p>You will also want to handle failures if the XML isn't in the format we expect, or if the file is otherwise inaccessible. You can do this with a try/catch and/or checking for nulls.</p>
