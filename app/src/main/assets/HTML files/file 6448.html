<p>You don't want to use the working directory at all; you want to use a directory relative to where the web application is located (which can be retrieved from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httprequest.applicationpath.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>HttpRequest.ApplicationPath</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>HttpRequest request = HttpContext.Current.Request;
// get the physical path to the web application
string pathToApp = request.MapPath(request.ApplicationPath);
string usersPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(pathToApp, "Users");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br>
As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/417057/vinayc">VincayC</a> points out; asp.net development is not my strongest skill ;) The above code is essentially equivalent of this (much simpler) code:</p>

<pre><code>string usersPath = HttpRequest.Current.Request.MapPath("~/Users");
</code></pre>

<p>If this code appears in the code-behind of a page, you can probably cut <code>HttpContext.Current</code> as well, since the page has a <code>Request</code> property.</p>
