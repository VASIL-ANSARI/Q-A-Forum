<li><p>is the lua code converted into c++ objects when compiled?</p>

<p>No, it is converted into instructions that the interpreter then executes.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the lua code compile as the c++ code requests it?</p>

<p>Yes</p></li>
<li><p>Is the lua code dependent on the c++ code, as in it using functions from the c++ code?</p>

<p>It can but it doesn't have to. You decide what c/c++ variables and functions to make available from Lua.</p></li>
