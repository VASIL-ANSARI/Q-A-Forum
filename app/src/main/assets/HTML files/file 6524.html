<p>You could code against an Employee Interface to get what you want I think.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IEmployee
{}

public abstract class BaseApplication&lt;T&gt; where T:IEmployee{ 
    public T IEmployee{ get; set; } 
} 

public class ExistingEmployee : IEmployee {}
public class NewEmployee : IEmployee {}

public class Application : BaseApplication&lt;ExistingEmployee&gt; {} 

public class NewApplication : BaseApplication&lt;NewEmployee&gt; {} 
</code></pre>
