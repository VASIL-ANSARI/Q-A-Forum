<p>The <code>$row</code> variable doesn't exist outside your loop, so it's pointless trying to use it in the <code>if</code> statement. You need to move it inside the loop, like so:</p>

<pre><code>while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql))
{
    if ( ($employed =='1') &amp;&amp; ($row['companyname'] == $user_data['businessname']) ) 
    {
        // code ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want it not to show the records when the companyname == the businessname!Move the statement inside your loop:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not actually sure if you're trying to display when <code>companyname == the businessname</code> or <code>companyname != the businessname</code>. Either way, change your <code>if</code> condition accordingly and it should work.</p>
