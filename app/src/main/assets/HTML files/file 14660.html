<p>It's not a problem, and it's not a redefinition. It's how C++ works. Think about it â you put class <em>definitions</em> in headers (exposing just declaration is far less common). Headers are pretty much copy-pasted into every translation unit that uses them. It <em>cannot</em> be an error to have multiple definitions of the same class in multiple TUs. So, it's not something to solve.</p>

<p>Compiler/linker should complain if there are different classes defined under the same name, though.</p>
