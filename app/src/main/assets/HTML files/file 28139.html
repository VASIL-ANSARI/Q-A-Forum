<p>I'd say you have the long and short of it. That's the basic pattern, though you may want to make it execute at least once first. ;-)</p>

<pre><code>(function(){
  var foo = function(){
    setTimeout(foo, 1e3);
  }();
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Though I doubt it will execute every 1ms (and whatever you're doing can't need to be <em>that</em> often, can it?). If this is testing something form a server, look at using long polling. If you're checking for a change in the browser, look at binding to specific events and not constantly checking for a delta.</p>
