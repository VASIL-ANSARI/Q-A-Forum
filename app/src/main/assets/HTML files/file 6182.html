<p>ajaxStart/Complete is a global event, so you can't tell which form it is for.</p>

<p>Is jQuery UI dialog doing the AJAX automatically or are you calling it somewhere else? If it is doing it automatically, have a look at the API... it probably fires a custom event on the form, say "formSubmitted", so bind to that instead:</p>

<pre><code>$("form", this).bind("formSubmitted", function() {
    // Re-enable button
    $("input[type=submit]", this).removeAttr("disabled");
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you're calling the AJAX yourself, then just trigger "formSubmitted" on the form in the AJAX success handler.</p>
