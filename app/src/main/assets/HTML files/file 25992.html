<p>Looks like
<code><code>pip install evernote</code></code> don't do what it is suppose to do:</p>

<pre>
cat /etc/SuSE-release
openSUSE 12.2 (x86_64)
VERSION = 12.2
CODENAME = Mantis

pip install evernote
Downloading/unpacking evernote
  Downloading evernote-1.24.0.macosx-10.8-x86_64.tar.gz (326kB): 326kB downloaded
  Running setup.py egg_info for package evernote
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "", line 16, in 
    IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/pip-build-root/evernote/setup.py'
    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "", line 16, in 

IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/pip-build-root/evernote/setup.py'

----------------------------------------
Command python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-root/evernote
Storing complete log in /root/.pip/pip.log
</pre>

<p>You can fix that with:</p>

<pre>

    pip -v install evernote==1.23.2

</pre>

<p>and everything works just fine!</p>
