<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<p>Are you using shaders? glVertexAttribPointer only works with shaders</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If Yes</strong>:
  Are you certain that your inputs are 0, 1, and 2? If you don't set these before shader linking with glBindAttribLocation, they aren't guaranteed to be any particular values.</li>
<li><strong>If No</strong>: You should be using glVertexPointer, glTexCoordPointer, etc instead of 
AttribPointer</li>
</ul>

<p>Also if you're using shaders, then enabling/disable GL_TEXTURE_2D is redundant, it doesn't do anything.</p>
