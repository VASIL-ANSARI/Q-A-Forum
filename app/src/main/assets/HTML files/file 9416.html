<p>Have you declared the <code>setResult(int resultCode, Intent data)</code> in your Login activity.
Android Documentation says
"Note that this method should only be used with Intent protocols that are defined to return a result." If it is not or some other conditions matches as in the documentation of <code>Activity.startActivityForResult()</code>, it will not run in your task and thus you will immediately receive a cancel result."</p>
