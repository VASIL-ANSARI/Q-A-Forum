<p>UIPickerView api allow you to select row in any component in code: </p>

<pre><code>func selectRow(_ row: Int,
   inComponent component: Int,
      animated animated: Bool)
</code></pre>

<p>So if you stored selected indices for your picker's components just call this method for each component before you show picker again.</p>
