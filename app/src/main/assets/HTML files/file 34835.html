<p>Since its a private inner type, I assume that you have a private/protected <code>std::unordered_map</code> member on the enclosing class. If thats the case, just write a private inner hash functor and pass it as the third argumment of the <code>std::unordered_map</code>. Its the easiest solution to your problem, I think.</p>
