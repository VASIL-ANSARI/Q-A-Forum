<p>You're making your promises overly complicated. You can bind directly to your http call to interact with the promise $http returns.</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>$http.get("http://myapi.com/api/v3/projects?private_token=abcde123456").then(function (results) {
   // projects will be your array of projects
   var projects = results.data;

   // Use native Array for each to get reference to every object in array
   projects.forEach(function (project) {
     $http.get("http://myapi.com/api/v3/projects/' + project.id + "/owner").then(function (results) {
       var data = results.data;
       console.log(data); // This will log your owner
     });
   })
});
</code></pre>

<p>You should probably just nest your owner with the returned project json to limit these extraneous http requests, but that's a matter of server side architecture. </p>
