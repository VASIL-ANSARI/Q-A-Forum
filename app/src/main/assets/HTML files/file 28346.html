<p>A possible crude solutions I came up wit h was to have all branches link back to the wrapper and access the data directly:</p>

<p><em>Note I replaced</em><code>TreeWrapper</code> <em>with</em> <code>Tree</code> <em>and</em> <code>Tree</code> <em>with</em> <code>branch</code>, <em>because it makes more sense to me.</em></p>

<pre><code>class tree
{
public:
    struct branch
    {
        branch* leftChild;
        branch* rightChild;
        tree* parent;
        void veryImportantMethod() {
            // change and use parent-&gt;aboutTree
            // change and use parent-&gt;veryImportantInfo
        }
    };
    tree() { root.parent = this; }
    tree root;
    string aboutTree;
    vector&lt;int&gt; veryImportantInfo;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you create a new <code>branch</code> you will need to have <code>leftChild-&gt;parent = parent;</code>.  And you would also want to define member functions of <code>branch</code> to do that for you as you would in a doubly linked list.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to use a actual doubly linked list format. So <code>tree* parent</code> would be <code>branch* parent</code>.  Accessing the important info from a branch would not be as fast as above but it would be mean it would be more navigable. You could travel up around the tree more easily.  (Actually having both <code>tree* root</code> and <code>branch* parent</code> might not be a bad idea. But the finer details are up to you.)</p>
