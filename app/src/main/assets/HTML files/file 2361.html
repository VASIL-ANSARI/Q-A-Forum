<p>You should provide table and column names to make it easy for us to answer your question.</p>

<p>You can write SQL as</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM Table
WHERE DateTimeColumnName &lt;= '2010/01/29 10:27:29'
AND  DateTimeColumnName &gt;= '2010/01/29 10:22:29'
</code></pre>

<p>or you can use <code>BETWEEN</code></p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM Table
WHERE DateTimeColumnName BETWEEN '2010/01/29 10:22:29' AND '2010/01/29 10:27:29'
</code></pre>

<p>Now see if there are datetime functions in MySQL to do a Date Math so just pass a single date stamp, and do the math to subtract 5 min from it and use it as the second parameter in the between clause.</p>
