<p>The MonitorHeld refers to how many monitors are held by that specific SyncBlk.</p>

<p>Each time you have contention on a lock, you'll have 1 owner held syncblk.  Each waiter on a lock holds 2.</p>

<p>Your 99 means that you have one object "owning" the lock, and 49 objects waiting on the lock.</p>

<p>The best discussion and detailed explanation of <code>!syncblk</code> I've found is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tess/archive/2006/01/09/a-hang-scenario-locks-and-critical-sections.aspx">this one by Tess Ferrandez</a>.</p>
