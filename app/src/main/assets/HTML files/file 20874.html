<p>In your last regexp, <code>/^[-](.*?)\s/</code> you should add <code>$</code> in the end of the regexp to match only the whole line starting with <strong>-</strong>. </p>

<p><code>/^[-](.*?)\s/</code> matches string " -" and replaces it, leaving the rest of the string unmodified.</p>

<p>FYI, you can simplify your solution, turning it into a more generic one. Declare a hash with pairs of type <code>Regexp =&gt; tag</code>, then iterate over it. You will like the code! Feel free to ask for further help.</p>

<p>P.S. I guess, you are trying to convert Markdown into HTML. Allthough it's a very good excercise to write it yourself, you can use a ready solution, like <a href="http://maruku.rubyforge.org/" rel="nofollow">Maruku</a>.</p>
