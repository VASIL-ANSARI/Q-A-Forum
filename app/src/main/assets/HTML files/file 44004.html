<p>So as it turns out, it was a pretty simple and stupid mistake.</p>

<p>Look at this line of code. Can you see the error? It took me hours of searching and tons and tons of println statements at just about every inch of code (my version of debugging) and I finally saw it. After correcting the issue, everything works as expected (with some minor additions and code cleanup, as well as a catch if no path exists...but this was never the problem).</p>

<pre><code>if (testNode.getX() == findingX) {
    if (testNode.getY() == findingX) {
</code></pre>

<p>Once I finally saw this I thought "how stupid!!!". Do you see it now?</p>
