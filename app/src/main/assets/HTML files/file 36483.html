<p>Have you checked the value of these various variables? I don't see you adding quotes around <code>stringURL</code> so you are probably winding up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#imgThumbnail3').attr('src',http://www.something.com); $('#imgThumbnail3').show();
</code></pre>

<p>where the <code>http://www.something.com</code> part is obviously bad JavaScript because there are no quotes around it.</p>
