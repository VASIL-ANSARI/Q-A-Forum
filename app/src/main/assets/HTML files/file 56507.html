<p>I have the same problem you noticed when i use setResizable(false) and pack() method in a JFrame.
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11225144/java-setresizablefalse-changes-the-window-size-swing">Here</a> you can find an answer which describes the problem, but i didn't find a solution that works for me.</p>

<p>In my applications i use a sort of "trick" if needed: i check if the contentPane preferred width is equal to his effective width, if not i recall pack() method.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0;i&lt;5 &amp;&amp; contentPane.getPreferredSize().width!=contentPane.getSize().width;i++) frame.pack();
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this isn't a really good solution, but it works for me and if you use a parameter to limit the maximum number of times that pack() should occur, you don't risk to block your gui...</p>
