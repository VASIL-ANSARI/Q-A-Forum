<p>I have tried both of your examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your first example executes without any exception on my project (in debug mode under Eclipse with ADK plugin) - how did you embed the Rhino library? I have been content with "Configure Build Pathâ¦/Add External JARâ¦"</li>
<li>Your second example throws the same exception on a standard JVM - meaning it's not an Android problem.</li>
</ul>
