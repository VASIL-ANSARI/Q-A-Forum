<p>The Ruby code fragment you provided is essentially the same as this Java fragment:</p>

<pre><code>  int[] odds = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};

  for(int item : odds) {
     item *= 2;
     System.out.println(item);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Both Ruby and Java provide iterators for collections.  They also both provide other looping or iterating constructs if you want them.</p>
