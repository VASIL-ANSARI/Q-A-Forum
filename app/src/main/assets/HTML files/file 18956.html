<p><code>Thread.Abort</code> makes no guarantees about anything and should be avoided. Why it hangs in this specific case depends on the code in the <code>startExport</code> method.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ty8d3wta%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Thread.Abort on msdn</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thread is not guaranteed to abort immediately, or at all. This situation can occur if a thread does an unbounded amount of computation in the finally blocks that are called as part of the abort procedure, thereby indefinitely delaying the abort. To wait until a thread has aborted, you can call the Join method on the thread after calling the Abort method, but there is no guarantee the wait will end.</p>
