<p>The <code>UINavigationController</code> that contains the <code>PlayersViewController</code> controller is at index 1 in the tab bar controller's <code>viewControllers</code> array. The indexing is from left to right, that is, the leftmost tab has index 0. The "Players" tab is to the right of the "Gestures", and the tab bar has two items, so therefore the view controller associated with that tab index is at index 1.</p>

<p>The message you are seeing is because at index 0 there is a <code>UIViewController</code> instance corresponding with the label "View Controller - Gestures" in your storyboard, and you are trying to send it a message that <code>UIViewController</code> does not respond to, in the belief that it is a <code>UINavigationController</code>.</p>
