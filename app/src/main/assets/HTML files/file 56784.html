<p>Few Ways i could think off..</p>

<p>1.using plan cache</p>

<pre><code>select query_plan from sys.dm_exec_cached_plans cp
cross apply
sys.dm_exec_text_query_plan(cp.plan_handle,default,default)
where objtype='proc' and object_name(objectid)='usp_test'
</code></pre>

<p>Now the above query plan is an xml which will contain all the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30595952/dynamically-retrieve-parameter-names-current-values-inside-t-sql-stored-proced/30598253#30598253">values used at compile time</a> .This procedure is very cuber some and you will get only compiled values.But with time due to plan cache invalidation which can occur due to  <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly/what-caused-that-plan-to-go-horribly-wrong-should-you-update-statistics/" rel="nofollow">many reasons</a>,you will get new values over time</p>

<p>2.Modify your stored proc to insert into some other table all the param values some thing like below</p>

<pre><code>create proc usp_test
(
@a int=1,
@b int =2
)

as
begin
insert into sometable 
select @a,@b,getdate()
end
</code></pre>

<p>Other than the above said ways,there is no way i could think off by which you can obtain passed parameter values(Excluding trace you are running)</p>

<p>If you are looking to troubleshoot parameter sniffing,by gathering all parameter values,this might not be the accurate way</p>
