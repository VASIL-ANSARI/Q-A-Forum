<p>Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question, but it sounds like you just need to put close_date into the where clause instead of create_month and create_year.</p>

<p>Something like this</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *, COUNT(INCIDENT_ID),
DATE_FORMAT(CLOSE_DATE,'%d-%m-%Y') AS formatted__closed_Date
FROM incident_view
Where CUSTOMER_COMPANY_NAME = "Company" 
AND (close_date &gt; (NOW() - INTERVAL 1 MONTH));
GROUP BY formatted__closed_Date 
</code></pre>
