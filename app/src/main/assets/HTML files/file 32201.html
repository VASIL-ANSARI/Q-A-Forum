<p>I am way outside my area of knowledge here, but as nobody answers in 10 hours, I will make an attempt.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that julia does not have an aggressive scheduler. You can use concurrency features, but they will be scheduled cooperatively in the same process. Since PyCall does not return or call a (julia?) sleep, the control will not return to the client. You might try addprocs or start julia with -p 2, but I'm not sure it will help.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.2/manual/parallel-computing/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.2/manual/parallel-computing/</a> where this is much better explained.</p>
