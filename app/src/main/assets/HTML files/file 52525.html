<p>If I uderstand your objective correctly, You want to keep the log trail of your changes to the record/tuple instance. </p>

<p>One way to do that, is to create a new record in the update trigger, the table schema should only contain the log trail with the Primary key of the original table as foreign key here.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!! Happy to help further</p>
