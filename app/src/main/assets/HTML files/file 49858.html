<p>There is nothing wrong with your template, but the context with which you are rendering the template does not match what the template is expecting. You need a 'doclist' local containing an array of objects each having <code>galleryName</code> and <code>address</code> properties. The array you read from mongo should suffice. Try</p>

<pre><code>Docket.find({}, function (err, dockets) {
  res.render('dockets/index', { doclist: dockets });
});
</code></pre>
