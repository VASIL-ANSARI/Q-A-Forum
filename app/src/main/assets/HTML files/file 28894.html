<p>I am surprised by your glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, <strong>3</strong>, vertices); the second 3 indicates the stride (a kind of spacing between the numbers)... I think it should be 0 instead of 3.</p>

<p>glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, <strong>0</strong>, vertices);</p>

<p>Actually, do you see a triangle or nothing at all ?</p>

<p>Good luck!

<p>Ok: I tried your code, so I can say :</p>

<p>1) you shall put glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, <strong>0</strong>, vertices); stride of 0 instead of 3, does clearly not work with 3 (even useless to check it) : there is no gap between your values.</p>

<p>2) it may come from your initialisation of the view (common problem): how do you setup the projection and modelview matrices? For instance, to see the triangle, I have to put</p>

<pre><code>glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glLoadIdentity();
gluPerspective(45.0, 1.0, 1.0, 10.0); // field of view=45Â°, zNear..zFar = 1 to 10

glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glLoadIdentity();
glTranslatef(0.0, 0, -3.0);
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. don't forget to tell which matrix you wish to set before doing it, and setup the pojection properly: zNear &lt;= min(your vertices.z), zFar >= max(your vertices.z)  (Oooo it is over now, with OpenGL 4, no more implicit matrices)</p>

<p>I wish you find the bug. </p>

<p>Cheers</p>
