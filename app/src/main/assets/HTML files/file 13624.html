<p>In general, you should use bicubic filtering when making images smaller, and bilinear filtering when making images larger. Bicubic filter helps with sharpness of the image, while bilinear smoothens the image.</p>

<p>However, whether to crop or resize or mix of the two, it is completely dependent on the type of images your users upload and the way they are displayed on the site.</p>

<p>For example, if you have thumbnails for photographs, you probably would want to avoid cropping them as much as possible.</p>

<p>But if you're looking for a sort of "artistic" feel, it could be fine to crop the image from a corner without actually resizing the image much.</p>
