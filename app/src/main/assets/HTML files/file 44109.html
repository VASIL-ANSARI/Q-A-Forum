<p>In C++, a <code>struct</code> is the same as a <code>class</code>, except that it has default <code>public</code> members, as well as default <code>public</code> inheritance.</p>

<p>As for the use of <code>malloc</code>, although it is possible to use it, it is as you say a <code>C</code>-type allocation, and shouldn't be used for <code>C++</code>. If you must, you would use <code>malloc/free</code> the same way for a struct as for a class.</p>

<p>However, the correct <code>C++</code> way is to use <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>, which are also used the same for a <code>struct</code> as for a <code>class</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you're curious as to <em>why</em> <code>new/delete</code> should be used instead of  <code>malloc/free</code>, I refer you to this Q/A: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/184537/in-what-cases-do-i-use-malloc-vs-new">In what cases do I use malloc vs new?</a></p>

<hr>

<p>As far as the use of parenthesis, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>Current *cur = new Current();
//vs.
Current *cur = new Current;
</code></pre>

<p>See this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/620137/do-the-parentheses-after-the-type-name-make-a-difference-with-new">Do the parentheses after the type name make a difference with new?</a></p>

<p>I just did myself, and learned something new.</p>
