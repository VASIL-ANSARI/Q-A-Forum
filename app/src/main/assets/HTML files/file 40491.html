<p>This will work fine for column names, and it is a good practice. I've used it successfully with both tables and views.</p>

<p>Others have pointed out something that's worth repeating: you need to secure your app against crackers.  If a badguy tries sending you a web request containing bogus column names, you definitely don't want your code passing them through. Trying to use column names from an untrusted source in requests to your database server is a big security risk, especially for INSERTs, UPDATEs, or DELETEs. You'll need to take some extra care with the part of your app that ensures column names are clean.</p>

<p>Something to watch out for: case sensitivity.  In MySQL you're in good shape for column-name case sensitivity.  But table name cases can change based on the OS in which your MySQL server runs. For best portability you should probably make your table names all lower case. Here's a writeup of that subject. <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/identifier-case-sensitivity.html</a></p>

<p>If you port this project to Oracle you'll find yourself with case-sensitivity confusion in your column names.</p>
