<p>I'm pretty sure you're looking for:</p>

<pre><code>var staticClass = new CodeTypeDeclaration("Extensions")
    {
        Attributes = MemberAttributes.Public|MemberAttributes.Static
    };
</code></pre>

<p>However, this appears not to work. Interestingly enough:</p>

<pre><code>provider.Supports(GeneratorSupport.StaticConstructors);
// True

provider.Supports(GeneratorSupport.PublicStaticMembers);
// True
</code></pre>

<p>But yet when you go and output it, no changes even though the Attributes property clearly changes from <code>0x00005002</code> to <code>0x00006003</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for reporting this. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we can support static classes for CodeDom. </p>
  
  <p>The reason is that one of the design goals of CodeDom is to be language-independent, so that any code generated for one language can easily be generated for a different language. While static classes are used often in C#, VB does not support them. Therefore, adding support for static classes will mean that some code that can compile for C# won't be compilable for VB, which goes against our goals. </p>
  
  <p>While we can't act on this issue, we ask that you please continue to provide feedback in the future to help us improve.</p>

<hr>

<p>A dirty workaround:</p>

<pre><code>var type = new CodeTypeDeclaration("Extensions");
type.Attributes = MemberAttributes.Public;
type.StartDirectives.Add(
    new CodeRegionDirective(CodeRegionMode.Start, "\nstatic"));
type.EndDirectives.Add(
    new CodeRegionDirective(CodeRegionMode.End, String.Empty));
</code></pre>

<p>Produces:</p>

<pre><code>#region
static
public class Extensions
{
}
#endregion
</code></pre>

<p>Which compiles.</p>
