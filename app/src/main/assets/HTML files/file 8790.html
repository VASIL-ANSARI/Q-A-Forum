<p>There will be some very differents points of view, but hopefully here is some food for thought:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask the site owner first, if they know ahead of time they are less likely to be annoyed.</li>
<li>Is the content on <em>Site A</em> accessible on a public part of the site, e.g. without the need to log in?</li>
<li>If the answer to #2 is that it is public content, then I wouldn't see an issue, as scraping the site for that information is really no different then pointing your browser at the site and reading it for yourself.</li>
<li>Of course, the answer to #3 is dependent on how the site is monetised. If <em>Site A</em> provides advertistment for generating revenue for the site, then it might not be an idea to start scraping content, as you would be bypassing how the site makes money.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the most important thing to do, is talk to the site owner first, and determine straight from them if:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it ok for me to be scraping content from their site.</li>
<li>Do they have an API in the pipeline (simply highlighting the desire may prompt them to consider it).</li>
</ol>

<p>Just my point of view...</p>
