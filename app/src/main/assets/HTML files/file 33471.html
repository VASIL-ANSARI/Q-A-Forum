<p>I think the issue is that you are using position:fixed; when you use fixed positioning you are taking the element out of the regular flow of the document and bolting it to a specific area. Once this is done the overflow attributes no longer apply. In the example below I used the 'right' and 'left' properties to lock the sides of the "top" div and removed the 'width'. Obviously you will have to adjust those values to suite your needs but that is the direction I would go.</p>

<pre><code>topPanel
{
position: fixed;
right: 10px;
left: 250px;
border: solid 4px purple;
}
</code></pre>
