<p>Vendor folder is not web accessible.  One solution is to symlink the css, js, img from vendor folder into the web folder.  Then include that.  Or here is the Yii way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace app\assets;

use yii\web\AssetBundle;

class BootstrapAsset extends AssetBundle {

//set the source path using @vendor or another alias like @bower here
  public $sourcePath = '@bower/bootstrap/dist';

//include css and js relative to the source path set above
  public $css = [
    'css/bootstrap.css',
  ];
  public $js = [
    'js/bootstrap.min.js',
  ];
}
</code></pre>
