<p>I saw this recently using VS2012 &amp; TFS2012.  We'd recently upgraded TFS, so I assume that was when/how my workspace got screwed up.</p>

<p>Can confirm that the TFS workspace nuke-it-from-orbit procedure fixed it for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Manually delete all files on the development machine under the problematic project that can be deleted manually</li>
<li>Right-click on the project and Get Specific Version (VS2012 moved this to Advanced > Get Specific Version)</li>
<li>Make sure both Overwrite check-boxes are checked</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of that is clearly unnecessary, but it's a bit of feel-better voodoo.</p>
