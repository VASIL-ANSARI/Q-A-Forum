<p>What version of the Selenium WebDriver .NET bindings are you running? The semantics of the .NET InternetExplorerDriver class's <code>.Dispose()</code> method in 2.25 or earlier are not equivalent to calling the <code>.Quit()</code> method. This means that to correctly shut down the IEDriverServer.exe process in versions 2.25 or earlier of the .NET bindings, you have to explicitly call the <code>.Quit()</code> method. It should be noted that with the yet-to-be-released 2.26 version of the .NET bindings, this has changed, and calling <code>.Dispose()</code> will be equivalent to calling <code>.Quit()</code>, whether called explicitly or implicitly via the <code>using</code> construct.</p>
