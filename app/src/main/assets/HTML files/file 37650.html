<p>I noticed this same problem running the sample code on my Nexus 4 (Android 4.4.4). I found that if I commented out the following line of code in the ActivityDetectionRemover continueRemoveUpdates() method, it fixed the problem:</p>

<pre><code>mCurrentIntent.cancel();
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry, I don't yet have a good explanation as to why canceling the PendingIntent causes this issue.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I also commented out the cancel in the MainActivity onStopUpdates() method:</p>

<pre><code>mDetectionRequester.getRequestPendingIntent().cancel();
</code></pre>

<p>Which is effectively doing the same thing as the first line above.</p>
