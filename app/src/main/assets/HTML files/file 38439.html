<p>I think the typical way of dealing with this is storing <code>Bay9</code> in a ViewModel class that is accessible from everywhere in the app.  See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18976280/windows-phone-8-mvvm-viewmodels-and-app-xaml-cs">this Stack Overflow question</a> and <a href="http://paulstovell.com/blog/mvvm-instantiation-approaches" rel="nofollow">this article</a>.</p>

<p>In my own apps, I've used the technique in the linked Stack Overflow question - making it a static property on the <code>App</code> class, and that's worked fine for me.</p>
