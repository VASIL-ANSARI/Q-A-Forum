<p>Ok, knew it was staring me in the face. So the solution is quite simple. What was happening was that I was sending an array instead of json string...shouldn't matter right? well it does. So the simple solution was before sending the data to my controller, i needed to convert the <strong>array</strong> to <strong>Json</strong> format...</p>

<p>So here's the updated code that sends my data:</p>

<pre><code>var newJson = JSON.stringify(this.rows);
this.$http.post('makePayment', newJson, function(data){
      this.processed = data;
      console.log(data);
});
</code></pre>
