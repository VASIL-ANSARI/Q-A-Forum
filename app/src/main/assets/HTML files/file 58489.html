<p>For merging dependencies into the compiled assembly, check out Costura for Fody: </p>

<p>I've used it before, and it works well. You can define certain dependencies to merge in a file called <strong>FodyWeavers.xml</strong> (<em>see the Costura-Fody link for examples</em>).</p>

<p>So, for example (<em>taken from the Costura README.md</em>) you can have two dependencies 'Foo' and 'Bar' that can be merged into your target assembly as follows in the FodyWeavers.xml file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Costura&gt;
    &lt;IncludeAssemblies&gt;
        Foo
        Bar
    &lt;/IncludeAssemblies&gt;
&lt;/Costura&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that, ILMerge is a fine way to go: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ilmerge" rel="nofollow">https://www.nuget.org/packages/ilmerge</a></p>
