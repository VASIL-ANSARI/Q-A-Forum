<p><code>poly</code> is a pointer, to use your custom <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> you need to say</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; *poly; // output the object pointed-to, not the pointer itself
</code></pre>

<p>You haven't overloaded what it means to insert a <code>Polynomial*</code>.  Nor should you try.</p>

<p>Besides that, you probably should accept the object by <code>const</code> reference, there's no reason for a stream output operator to go changing the object.</p>
