<p>I think your best bet is to write your own <code>X509TrustManager</code> and use your own implementation of <code>checkClientTrusted</code>. Unfortunately, you may have to write a great deal of plumbing code unless you can find another class to extend to do the heavy-lifting of managing the trust store, the revocation, etc.</p>

<p>It might be worth your time using a debugger to trace-through the JRE's classes to see what's happening down in the default <code>X509TrustManager</code> -- perhaps it's configured incorrectly, or it's possible that Tomcat isn't enabling some features that would make sense to most people.</p>

<p>Just looking at decompiled sources from Java 8, it looks like it comes down to <code>sun.security.validator.SimpleValidator</code> which does seem to consider the (current) date when checking for validity of the certificate. I would expect a <code>CertificateExpiredException</code> to be thrown at some point by the JRE itself. I don't think Tomcat manages any of this.</p>
