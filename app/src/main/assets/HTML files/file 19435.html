<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.system.php" rel="nofollow">system()</a> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php" rel="nofollow">exec()</a> functions.</p>

<p>They allow you to run a program in the context of a console and return its output for you to put in a variable and use.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// outputs the username that owns the running php/httpd process
// (on a system with the "whoami" executable in the path)
echo exec('whoami');
?&gt;
</code></pre>
