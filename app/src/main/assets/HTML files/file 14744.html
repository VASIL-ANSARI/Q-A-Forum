<p>If it is a column that just contains the words phonecall or similar, then yes, that is a good use of SOUNDEX, because you are looking for strings that sound the same but are spelled differently. If you are looking in a huge body of text, then it is less appropriate, as you would have to break the text into words before generating SOUNDEX, so this would fail on two-word versions like "phone call".</p>

<p>For an improved algorithm, I suggest you look into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone#Double_Metaphone_Implementations" rel="nofollow">Double Metaphone</a>.</p>
