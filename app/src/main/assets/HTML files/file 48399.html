<p>Asking to duplicate an array is fine, but we don't even know what language you're using. If you are using Objective-C, then all you have todo in order to copy an array is send the "copy" command on an array. Example below.</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *myArray = [oldArray copy];
</code></pre>

<p>This is called a "shallow copy" which means it'll only copy the pointer references and not the actual objects. If you need to make brand new instances of the objects, then you'll need to adopt the NSCopying protocol in your objects, and override the <code>copyWithZone</code> method.</p>

<p>If you are using Swift then you'll basically do the same thing. To copy the array you'll use the code below.</p>

<p>var myArray = oldArray</p>

<p>Then use the same NSCopying protocol if you want to make a deep copy.</p>

<p>That's it, that is all you've got todo to copy an array.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
