<p>With your algorithm, if the graph has a cycle, it will keep pushing elements of the cycle onto the stack until you run out of memory. You need to keep track of which nodes have already been explored and avoid pushing them onto the stack. There are several standard algorithms for doing this (A<sup>*</sup> and Dijkstra come to mind). See the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" rel="nofollow">depth first search</a> for more info.</p>
