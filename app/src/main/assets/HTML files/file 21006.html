<p>This is expected/known behavior. The simulator is just that: a <em>simulator</em> and not an <em>emulator</em>. OpenGL performance and image quality in the simulator is often much different (and often worse) than on actual devices. The only way to be sure how OpenGL code will look and perform on the device is to test it on the device, and the only way to get good screen shots in your case will be to hunt down such a device and use it to take a screenshot.  Otherwise, as far as the simulator goes, what you see is what you get. There's no magic switch that says "make this look like it would on the device." </p>
