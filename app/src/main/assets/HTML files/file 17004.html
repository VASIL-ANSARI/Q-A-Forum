<p>When you create a view controller from a nib file, the UIViewController is first initialized and then loaded. So when the <code>initWithNibName:bundle:</code> method is called <code>self.view</code> and any other views loaded from the nib will be <code>nil</code>. Also it may happen that the views are unloaded (see <code>viewDidUnload</code>). That's why any view-related initialization needs to happen in <code>viewDidLoad</code>.</p>
