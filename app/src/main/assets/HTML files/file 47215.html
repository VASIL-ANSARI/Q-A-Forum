<p>When I started official sample for Invite API yesterday, I had problem but just because of version of google-services (1st step -> add the dependency of your project's top-level build.gradle), so I have to change it to the latest version:
 classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.3.0-beta4'
 classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:1.3.0-beta4'</p>

<p>and this solves all problems. I don't understand your question, which step you exactly skipped of these 3 steps mentioned and made invite api functional?</p>
