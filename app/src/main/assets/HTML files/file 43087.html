<p>The twitter disconnection error are socket exception,which is a special case of IOError exceptions.In order to catch that you need to do something like </p>

<pre><code>auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(â¦ # set up your oauth here
try:
    stream = tweepy.Stream(auth=auth, listener=SomeListener()) # start the stream
except IOError, ex:
    print 'I just caught the exception: %s' % ex
</code></pre>

<p>If it works wrap in a while True loop with an increasing backoff so to provide some pause between re-connection.Reference <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tweepy/o0lpL3WRoyg" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>
