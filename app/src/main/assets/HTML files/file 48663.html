<p>As mentioned in comments, Spark isn't ideal for such short-lived jobs. You'd better run it on hundreds of files, each being at least a few megabytes in size. Even then it might saturate the HDD reading speed before the CPU gets 100% utilized, ideally you'd have at least a few computers with SSDs to get real advantage from Spark :)</p>
