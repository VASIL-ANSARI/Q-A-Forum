<p>Using your code as a base, you could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>old = set((line.strip() for line in open('1.txt')))
new = set((line.strip() for line in open('2.txt')))

with open('diff.txt', 'w') as diff:
    for line in new:
        if line not in old:
            diff.write('[-] {}\n'.format(line))

    for line in old:
        if line not in new:
            diff.write('[+] {}\n'.format(line))
</code></pre>

<p>There's a couple of tweaks in here:</p>

<ol>
<li>We want to read the individual lines of both the old and new
files to compare.</li>
<li>We don't have to <code>strip</code> each individual line as we have done that while reading the file.</li>
<li>We use <code>{}</code> and <code>.format()</code> to build text strings.</li>
<li>Using <code>\n</code> ensures we put each entry on a new line of our output file.</li>
<li>Using <code>with</code> for the file we are writing to lets us open it without having to call <code>close</code> and (if my knowledge is correct) allows for better handling of any program crashes once the file has been opened.</li>
</ol>
