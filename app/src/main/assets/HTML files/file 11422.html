<p>The problem appears to be the whitespace you use to indent your code. You have a mixture of tab characters and spaces. I suggest you use you "show whitespace" in your editor and change all the tabs in your code to the correct number of spaces.</p>

<p>If your editor doesn't have a "show whitespace" feature, you can spot the tab characters by temporarily inserting a space at the beginning of the line and watching to see if the end of the line also moves by exactly one space. If it either doesn't move or it jumps by (for example) 4 or 8 characters then you have a tab character somewhere on that line.</p>
