<p>Not sure I fully understand what it is your attempting with the above but I have a similar situation in trying to get geocoder and sunspot to play together.</p>

<p>This is untested as yet but this is my current thinking....</p>

<pre><code>Event.search do
      keywords  search_terms
      any_of do
        with(:id).any_of(Event.near(coordinates,50).map(&amp;:id))
      end
end.results
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially I'm trying to combine the two result sets to only bring back the results that match both the distance and keyword terms.</p>

<p>Hope this is of help to someone at least.</p>
