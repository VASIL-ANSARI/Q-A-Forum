<p>First you need to declare your variable and then you can EXPORT it.</p>

<p>so just declare it as in dev.c</p>

<pre><code>unsigned long current_rx_time;
</code></pre>

<p>then export it as in dev.c</p>

<pre><code>EXPORT_SYMBOL(current_rx_time);
</code></pre>

<p>and in other loadable module where you want to use it (let's say in temp2.c)...</p>

<pre><code>extern unsigned long current_rx_time;
</code></pre>

<p>Now make sure when you going to compile temp2.c at that time dev.c is also getting compile.</p>
