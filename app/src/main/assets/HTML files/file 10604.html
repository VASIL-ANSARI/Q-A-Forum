<p>A firewall shouldn't block a cookie.  But, the internet settings for your 64bit machine might have something to do with blocking cookies.  Check these.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/263671/cez">@Cez</a> has pointed out, a software firewall could block a cookie.  If you can clarify that you are using a software firewall, like Zonealarm, then I'd check these settings as well.</p>
