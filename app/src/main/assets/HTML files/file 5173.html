<p>You can't.  You're reading in values from a CSV file.  There is no such thing as a 'null' value in a CSV file.  The next best thing I know to do would be to write some code to test 'null' if a 'magic string' is read from the CSV file.</p>

<pre><code>string orgOne = testContextInstance.DataRow["OrgOne"].ToString();
if (orgOne=="null")
    orgOne = null;
</code></pre>
