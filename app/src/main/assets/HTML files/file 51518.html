<p><code>$().posotion</code> gives you absolute position unfortunately. It won't be helpful in this case.</p>

<pre><code>var increment = $('#vehiclePhotoPreview' + photoID).width() + 10; //10 would be the space between each image

$('.vehicleDetailExpandedPhotoReel').scrollLeft(photoID * increment); //assuming that photoID is always sequential
</code></pre>

<p>That essentially will get the position by using the active number and the current increment to set the scroll position.</p>
