<p><code>Py_ssize_t</code> is signed. See <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/">PEP 353</a>, where it says <em>"A new type Py_ssize_t is introduced, which has the same size as the compiler's size_t type, but is signed. It will be a typedef for ssize_t where available."</em></p>

<p>You should use <code>Py_ssize_t</code> for indexing.  I didn't find a definitive statement of this in the Cython docs, but Stefan Behnel, a Cython developer, said as much in an email (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/brENF_M9zxM">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/brENF_M9zxM</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a general remark, you are using ints as indices. You should
  use the Py_ssize_t type instead (or size_t, if you prefer an
  unsigned type) to properly accommodate for 64 bit architectures.</p>
