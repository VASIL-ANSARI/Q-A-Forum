<p>Yes, and no.</p>

<p>The connect will have timed out within ten seconds, assuming that the connect did not work, however the connect probably did work, and now it is trying to read data from the socket, most likely to get the initial FTP helo sequence out of the way[1]. Indeed, looking at <a href="http://commons.apache.org/net/api/org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#_connectAction_()" rel="nofollow">the javadoc for <em>connectAction</em>()</a>, which is where your stacktrace is stuck, that is exactly what it is doing.</p>

<p>You could try setting <a href="http://commons.apache.org/net/api/org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#setDataTimeout(int)" rel="nofollow">the data timeout</a> before you call connect, that way it might actually fail in the way that you expect. If this doesn't work, you will most likely need to <a href="http://commons.apache.org/bugs.html" rel="nofollow">raise a bug with apache-commons</a>. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NET-35" rel="nofollow">This bug</a> is almost certainly the issue that you are seeing.</p>

<p>[1] According to RFC959:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One important group of informational replies is the connection
        greetings.  Under normal circumstances, a server will send a 220
        reply, "awaiting input", when the connection is completed.  The
        user should wait for this greeting message before sending any
        commands.  If the server is unable to accept input right away, a
        120 "expected delay" reply should be sent immediately and a 220
        reply when ready.  The user will then know not to hang up if there
        is a delay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is why the FTPClient class is awaiting input from the foreign side.</p>
