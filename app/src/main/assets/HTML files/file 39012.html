<p>The Dropdown menu will only display text. But the Glyphicon tag <code>&lt;i class="fa fa-leaf"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code> contains no text, so it won't be displayed. You can maybe try to find a glyph library which actually uses chars and not class, but I can't think of any rght now. Let me search a few seconds.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>It appears that it is impossible to do with the "standard" HTML toolkit. If you're using Bootstrap, check <a href="http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/" rel="nofollow">http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/</a></p>
