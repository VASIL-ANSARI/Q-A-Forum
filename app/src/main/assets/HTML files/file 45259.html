<p>For your example here you can take the whole line with Scanner's nextLine() or BufferedReader's readLine(), and you'd end up with a String "MAX=number1 MIN=number2"</p>

<p>Notice that there's a space separating the two of them. If you're sure that there can't be any spaces in any other place, you can use String's split() method.</p>

<p>In code, it'd look like this:</p>

<pre><code>String line = in.nextLine(); // Scanner input from text file
String[] array = line.split(" "); // split according to the space, you'll end up with "MAX=number1" and "MIN=number2"
</code></pre>

<p>Going further, to separate the MAX and MIN from their numbers, you can use split("="). You can figure out the rest.</p>
