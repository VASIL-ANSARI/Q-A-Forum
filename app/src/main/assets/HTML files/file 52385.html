<p>This is my preferred way.  I don't like the <code>+</code> because it can also be used for mathematical operations.</p>

<pre><code>// Call String.format with three integer codes.
String result = String.format("One: %1$d Two: %2$d Three: %3$d",10, 20, 30);
System.out.println(result);
</code></pre>
