<p>Assuming your already added the column with an <code>ALTER TABLE</code> statement, you would populate it using a <code>CASE</code> statement in the <code>UPDATE</code> query like:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE cancertable ADD Date_Any DATE AFTER Date_Distant;

UPDATE cancertable SET Date_Any = 
  CASE
    WHEN Date_Local IS NOT NULL AND Date_Local &lt;= Date_Distant THEN Date_Local
    WHEN Date_Distant IS NOT NULL AND Date_Distant &lt; Date_Local THEN Date_Distant
    ELSE NULL
  END
</code></pre>

<p>The above statement will update all rows since it has no <code>WHERE</code> clause.  Before doing the <code>UPDATE</code>, test it out with a <code>SELECT</code> to make sure it looks like you expect:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *,
  CASE
    WHEN Date_Local IS NOT NULL AND Date_Local &lt;= Date_Distant THEN Date_Local
    WHEN Date_Distant IS NOT NULL AND Date_Distant &lt; Date_Local THEN Date_Distant
    ELSE NULL
  END AS Date_Any
FROM cancertable
</code></pre>

<p>Consider, however, whether you really even <em>need</em> another column added though.  Depending on how often you intend to query this, you might just create a view using the <code>SELECT</code> statement above instead, so the <code>Date_Any</code> value will be "live".</p>
