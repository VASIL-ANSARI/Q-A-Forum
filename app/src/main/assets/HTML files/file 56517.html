<p>There are a few things I would like to note here. First, the plunker: <a href="https://plnkr.co/edit/IgcuE2fKlqPcT9ZV9GQ5" rel="nofollow">https://plnkr.co/edit/IgcuE2fKlqPcT9ZV9GQ5</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Your script/css references were pointing to relative paths, so I just grabbed the latest versions of the libraries you used from plunker. What you see might not be what you wanted to see but that's the best you get from what you provided.</li>
<li>The response that contains the PokÃ©mon list is an object, not an array. You can iterate over an object with <code>ng-repeat</code>, but you cannot use the <code>filter</code> directive on objects. Therefore, I modified your <code>findValue</code> method so that it creates a new array which will be used with <code>ng-repeat</code>. I removed the <code>if (key === search)</code> check though, as you can use the <code>filter: search</code> directive to filter the array. This search will be instantenous and will be performed as soon as the value in the input box changes.</li>
<li><code>ng-model</code> is only bound to <code>input</code>, <code>select</code>, and <code>textarea</code> so there is no point having them on <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>. See here: <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel" rel="nofollow">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel</a></li>
<li>I'm not sure what you meant with #3. (#2 is missing by the way) If you want to empty the <code>results</code> array, just set <code>$scope.results = []</code> inside <code>ng-click</code> method and you will be good to go.</li>
</ul>
