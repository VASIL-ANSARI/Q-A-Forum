<p>As mentioned in the <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html" rel="nofollow">security</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anonymous users are technically authenticated, meaning that the
  isAuthenticated() method of an anonymous user object will return true.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>//if you want myPage to be accessible by everyone
security:
    firewalls:
        secured_area:
            pattern:    ^/
            anonymous: ~

    access_control:
        - { path: ^/myPage, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
</code></pre>

<p>If you remove the anonymous key, the firewall will always make a user fully authenticate immediately.</p>
