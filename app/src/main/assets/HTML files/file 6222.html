<p>I am not sure what is happening exactly but you may be having a rounding issue. The issue with 1 + delta where delta is small is that doubles are not built to hold the delta to much precision as the 1 dominates enormously and the delta is considered insignificant.</p>

<p>The purpose of the boost library is to allow you to pass in the 1 and the delta separately to not lose the precision of the delta when you take the log, which will give you a number close to 0.</p>

<p>An example is you delta = 0.00000000123456789</p>

<p>If you add that to 1 then subtract 1 again you will not see all those numbers as a double only holds about 15 places of precision but the number above +1 gives requires 17 whereas the numbe I have printed uses just 9 places because the leading zeros don't count.</p>
