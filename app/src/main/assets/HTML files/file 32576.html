<p>The plugin sonar for eclipse FORCE to use the C++ commercial plugin. I.e. whatever you put in 
Window -> Preferences -> Sonar -> Local analysis properties
sonar.language=c++, it is not taken into account.</p>

<p>In other words, in local mode, "sonar.language" cannot be redefined when analysis a C++ project: it is forced to sonar.language=cpp (=> C++ commercial plugin). IT'S REALLY A PITY FROM THE SONAR PLUGIN IN ECLIPSE TO FORCE THE LANGUAGE PROPERTY.</p>

<p>Just as a hint, a workaround is to redefine the language symbol (i.e. cpp instead of c++) of the C++ community plugin by doing some modifications in the sources.  </p>
