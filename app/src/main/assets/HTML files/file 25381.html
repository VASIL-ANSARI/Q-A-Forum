<p>I think you've analyzed the problem correctly and there is no <em>direct</em> solution that I know of.</p>

<p>The workaround that I use for both Firefox and Chrome is to use <code>about:blank</code> for my new tab page, which I prefer anyway. In Chrome this requires an extension.</p>

<p>If you want to keep the "workbench" for your new tab page <em>and</em> use bookmarklets from that page, will have to write or find an extension/addon, although even that may not be possible; I've never looked into it.</p>
