<p>you can remove (Uninstall) the default program you set using <strong>ADB</strong> by doing this :</p>

<pre><code>adb uninstall app.package  ..... //for example (com.example.homeapp)
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to remove the app .. here is a quick hack to do it:</p>

<ul>
<li>adb shell</li>
<li>am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN </li>
</ul>

<p>That way you will have a picker with all apps on your devices that listens to <em>Main</em> Action</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose any home screen app you want . then go to settings and set it as default.</li>
</ul>
