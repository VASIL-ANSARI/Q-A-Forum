<p>Sinatra is essentially adding those as global methods. When you require sinatra, it <a href="https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/master/lib/sinatra/main.rb#L30" rel="nofollow">extends the Object class</a> with <code>Sinatra::Delegator</code> which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/master/lib/sinatra/base.rb#L1705" rel="nofollow">sinatra/base.rb</a>. Methods such as <code>get</code> and <code>put</code> are defined in base, and added via the delegator.</p>
