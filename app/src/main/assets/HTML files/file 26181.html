<p>The Maps app will handle audio guidance for you.  You do not need to enable it.  If you open the Apple Maps URL scheme or Google Maps app, it will guide the user via audio if they have their audio turned on.  Voice directions only work on certain phones for the Apple Maps App.  The iPhone 5 and 4S have voice direction, while the iPhone 4 and 3GS do not.  Just like there is no Siri on iPhone 4, there is no Siri Voice Navigation.</p>
