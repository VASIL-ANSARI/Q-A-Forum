<p>As far as I know there is no max-length (length not lenght) on paragraph tags because they are not inputs. So you can either write a server side function that truncates the text to the desired length before returning it to the user (which would be the preferable route) or use a client side function in javascript/jquery to truncate it during or after loading it for example</p>

<pre><code>var p = $('#myParagraph');
p.text(p.text().substring(0,127)) 
</code></pre>
