<p>Nope, in case that the deprecated notices are turned off in php.ini </p>

<p>But the problem is not with speed. The existence of ereg function will not be guaranteed in the future versions of PHP. </p>

<p>So you should use another regular expression function (<a href="http://php.net/pcre" rel="nofollow" title="PCRE">PCRE</a>). </p>

<p>BTW, you should keep in mind that <strong>ereg</strong> and <strong>preg_match</strong> regular expressions syntax are not the same.</p>
