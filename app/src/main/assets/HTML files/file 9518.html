<p>As  the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxVariables.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH6-SW1">Block Programming Topics</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a reference-counted environment, by
  default when you reference an
  Objective-C object within a block, it
  is retained. This is true even if you
  simply reference an instance variable
  of the object. Object variables marked
  with the __block storage type
  modifier, however, are not retained.</p>
  
  <p>If you use a block within the implementation of a method, the rules
  for memory management of object
  instance variables are more subtle:</p>
  
  <p>If you access an instance variable by reference, self is
  retained;</p>
  
  <p>If you access an instance variable by
  value, the variable is retained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you reference <code>self</code> in block, so <code>self</code> is retained.</p>
