<p>Your problem is <code>context.executeFetchRequest</code> returns an array of <code>AnyObject?</code>. When you're looping through the objects are <code>AnyObject?</code>, which as Xcode is saying, don't have the properties <code>testnumber</code>, <code>username</code> or <code>password</code>.</p>

<p>To solve this and be able to access properties with dot notation you need to create subclasses for your enties:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Select your data model (.xcdatamodel file) and select at least one of your entities. Then go to 'Editor -> Create NSManagedObject Subclass... ' as shown in the picture.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/2t0A9.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Xcode will take you through creating the subclasses. (Just click next and select all the Entities you want to create subclasses for - probably all of them)</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Now you'll have .m and .h files for your managed objects. In the .h file you should see properties for each Attribute and Relationship. You can use these properties to access the values stored in CoreData.</p>

<p><strong>Note -</strong> 'Create ManagedObject Subclass; creates Objective-C Files, hence the .h and .m. Since you're using Swift you need to include the .h files in your bridging header e.g. <code>#include "User.h"</code>. If you don't yet have a bridging header, Xcode should ask if you want to create one. Otherwise, have a look at this link: <a href="https://bohemianpolymorph.wordpress.com/2014/07/11/manually-adding-a-swift-bridging-header/" rel="nofollow">https://bohemianpolymorph.wordpress.com/2014/07/11/manually-adding-a-swift-bridging-header/</a></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Now, when you use <code>context.executeFetchRequest</code> and get your objects, you should cast them to whatever object you are expecting and then you can access their properties. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>let results = context.executeFetchRequest(request, nil)
if let user = results.first? as? User { // User is an NSManagedObject Subclass
    // Now you can access the properties, e.g:
    println(user.username)
}
</code></pre>
