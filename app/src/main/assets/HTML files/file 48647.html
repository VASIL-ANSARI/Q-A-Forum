<p>I'm very new to Xcode/Swift, but I believe the string in your <strong>if (segue.identifier == "ViewController")</strong> is the problem. Instead of "ViewController" you need to use the identifier of your <strong>segue</strong>. Select your segue in Main.storyboard, click on the Attributes Inspector and give it a name in the Identifier field. That's the string you want to use.</p>
