<p>If you simply need a program to log tcp packets, have a look at Wireshark. If you actually want to write your own logger, you can use the <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/" rel="nofollow">libpcap</a> library. It is implemented in C and there are lots of tutorials / examples on the website. If you working in windows, you should have a look at <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/" rel="nofollow">WinPcap</a>. <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a nice easy tutorial for libpcap.</p>
