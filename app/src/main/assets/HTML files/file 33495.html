<p>From the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JSlider.html#setMajorTickSpacing%28int%29" rel="nofollow">JavaDocs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number that is passed in represents the distance, measured in
  values, between each major tick </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A major tick mark would be the larger of the tick marks. With the minor obviously being the smaller ones.</p>

<p>Tick marks on a slider correspond to values. Here is an example of a slider that contains 20 values:</p>

<p>The major ticks correspond to the values 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20.</p>
