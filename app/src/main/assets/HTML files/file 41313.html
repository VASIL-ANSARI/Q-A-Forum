<p>The authentication methods in the Firebase library only work on the client-side. </p>

<p>If you need to authenticate on the server, you should use <code>authWithCustomToken</code> from a generated token. <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/custom.html" rel="nofollow">The Firebase docs have a detailed section on generating tokens</a>.</p>

<p>The real question though, is why do you need to authenticate with GitHub on the server? Firebase is designed to do nearly all of the development on the client.</p>
