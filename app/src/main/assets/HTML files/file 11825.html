<p>Have you tried using Arduino boards to interface real world with your Android device?
Have a look at this <a href="http://blog.bricogeek.com/noticias/arduino/el-adk-de-google-en-un-arduino-uno/" rel="nofollow">project</a>. I think it can be related to what you want to do. This other <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-datalogger-for-your-wireless-sensor-networ/?ALLSTEPS" rel="nofollow">link</a> is more related to the TelosB device. Hope this can be useful to you.</p>
