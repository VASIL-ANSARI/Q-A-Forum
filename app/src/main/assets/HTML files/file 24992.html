<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Regarding the problem with the video playing on a 9790 and not a 9780, those are different devices.  The 9790 came out about a year after the 9780, and apparently RIM added more capability.</p>

<p>So, that explains why you can't get that video to play on the 9780.  If playing this video is fundamental to your app, you might change the settings in BlackBerry App World to list it as incompatible with 9780s.  If this is only one of <strong>many</strong> features of your app, you might at least catch the media exception and inform the user gracefully that their device can't play the video requested, <em>so they don't think it's your app's fault.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14" rel="nofollow">MP4 actually contains a family of related formats</a>.</p>

<p>The actual support for your video probably depends <strong>both</strong> on your BlackBerry OS version (e.g. 5/6/7) and also the device itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/smartphone_users/deliverables/27267/Supported_Media_Types_on_BlackBerry_Tablets_%28English%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here is a BlackBerry reference document</a> that describes video format capabilities of various BlackBerry devices.</p>

<p>Of course, different devices also have <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry-phones-36.php" rel="nofollow">different sizes of screens</a>.</p>

<p>It might be useful for you to produce the videos in a variety of formats and resolutions, and have your BlackBerry app download different versions of the video depending on the device.  Since video downloads are slow, doing it this way will also ensure that the user sees the fastest possible download on their device.  There's no use downloading a higher resolution than the device can display.</p>

<p>You didn't specify whether you have control of the videos on the server side or not, so this may not be an option for you.  </p>
