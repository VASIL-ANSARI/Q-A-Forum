<p>Turns out this is a very old incompatibility problem between DeflateStream and zlib as mentioned here: <a href="https://tlzprgmr.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/net-deflatestreamzlib-compatibility/" rel="nofollow">https://tlzprgmr.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/net-deflatestreamzlib-compatibility/</a></p>

<p>Essentially, DeflateStream does not add the required header or footer to the compressed data. Regards.</p>
