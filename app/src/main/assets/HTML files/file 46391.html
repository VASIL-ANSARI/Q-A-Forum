<p>Eclipse has it's own <a href="http://blog.deepakazad.com/2010/05/ecj-eclipse-java-compiler.html" rel="nofollow">built-in compiler</a>, which is quite separate from the one you'd normally use from Ant or other external applications. That is precisely why you only need the JRE to <em>run</em> Eclipse and not a JDK to compile the code you write.</p>

<p>The page linked to above gives one way to use the Eclipse compiler from an Ant buildfile by defining <code>build.compiler</code>, which may make your Eclipse and Ant environments more compatible.</p>

<p>Other than that, you may want to think about <em>why</em> your strings are so large, there may be a better way.</p>
