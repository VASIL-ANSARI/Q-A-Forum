<p>The second is slightly quicker as it doesn't have to concatenate the strings together.</p>

<p>But really you're only going to see an increase in performance if this is repeated a huge number of times.</p>

<p>Also, as a slight side point, using the multiple parameters of the echo function, such as:</p>

<pre><code>echo("&lt;p&gt;",$var,"&lt;/p&gt;");
</code></pre>

<p>is also quicker than concatenating the string.</p>
