<p>Apple silently increased the horizontal spacing constraints for UIBarButtonItems and sadly, still hasn't added any UIAppearance methods to adjust the horizontal positioning of UIBarButtonItems.</p>

<p>The best solution (which worked for me) is to wrap your UIBarButtonItems in a UIView using <code>initWithCustomView:</code> and adjust the bounds of that custom view to get your desired positioning. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12554715/2245647">Here's a good answer on how to do this</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to take things a step further, you can create a category on UIBarButtonItem with class methods that return the bar buttons you use throughout your app. That way, when you a need a bar button, you can call something like:</p>

<pre><code>self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = [UIBarButtonItem mySearchBarButtonItemWithTarget:self selector:@selector(search)];
</code></pre>
