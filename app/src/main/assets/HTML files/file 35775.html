<p>Since you've changed your topic to android...I can help!</p>

<p>Kivy has a sister project, <a href="https://github.com/kivy/plyer" rel="nofollow">plyer</a>, providing a platform independent way to access different apis through a single pythonic interface. There are quite a few interfaces implemented for Android, including notifications, so you can use plyer directly and/or look at the code to see how it works.</p>

<p>As it happens I've previously made a short video about the android stuff, which you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jwp1PTvECI" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's only a very quick introduction, but might help.</p>
