<p>One option is to get rid of the <code>CASE</code>, break them into multiple <code>SELECT</code> queries with <code>WHERE</code> conditions and then union them:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    'Yesterday' AS Range
    SUM(Total_Calls) AS Calls,
    SUM(Total_Time) AS Time
FROM TableName
WHERE row_date BETWEEN @YesterdayMorning AND @EndOfYesterday
UNION
SELECT
    'WTD' AS Range,
    SUM(Total_Calls) AS Calls,
    SUM(Total_Time) AS Time
FROM TableName
WHERE row_date BETWEEN @WTDMorning AND @EndOfYesterday
UNION
SELECT
    'MTD' AS Range,
    SUM(Total_Calls) AS Calls,
    SUM(Total_Time) AS Time
FROM TableName
WHERE row_date BETWEEN @MTDMorning AND @EndOfYesterday
UNION
SELECT
    'YTD' AS Range,
    SUM(Total_Calls) AS Calls,
    SUM(Total_Time) AS Time
FROM TableName
WHERE row_date BETWEEN @YTDMorning AND @EndOfYesterday
</code></pre>
