<h2>About your HTML</h2>

<p>You're trying to get rid of some HTML code that actually tells you there is an error. Here is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/y8Lz1.png" alt="interpreted HTML response"></p>

<p>Maybe if you solve that problem, your JSON issue will vanish on its own, because you won't have HTML stuff before your JSON.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Earlier part of the response</h2>

<p>I guess you are getting your exception at this line (please tell me if I'm wrong):</p>

<pre><code>jsonResponse = new JSONObject(Content);
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to know what's wrong with the parsing of <code>Content</code>, you might want to log that string and see how it looks.</p>

<p>Apparently, <code>Content</code> is HTML code (It contains some <code>&lt;br</code>, according to the exception) instead of a proper JSON String. Take a look at where you get this string from, this is probably your problem.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>OK, according to what you posted, your <code>Content</code> string contains the JSON string (the one surrounded by braces <code>{}</code>) but it also contains an HTML part, which needs to be removed.</p>

<p>Put this code before you try to create the <code>JSONObject</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int jsonStart = Content.indexOf("{");
int jsonEnd = Content.lastIndexOf("}");

if (jsonStart &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; jsonEnd &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; jsonEnd &gt; jsonStart) {
    Content = Content.substring(jsonStart, jsonEnd + 1);
} else {
    // deal with the absence of JSON content here
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>The previous code snippet does not seem sufficient because your HTML contains braces (<code>{}</code>). If the server always returns that kind of HTML, you might want to just get rid of the <code>font</code> tag <strong>before running the previous snippet</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>Content = Content.replaceFirst("&lt;font&gt;.*?&lt;/font&gt;", "");
</code></pre>

<p>WARNING: This is very sketchy, and answers only this very particular issue. It won't work with every possible server response.</p>

<p><strong>You should have a look at other questions regarding the removal of HTML from a String in Java, for more complete answers.</strong></p>
