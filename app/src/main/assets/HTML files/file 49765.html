<p>Redmine doesn't allow to set the author field of an issue. It is always set to the current user on issue creation.</p>

<p>The easiest solution would be to use the credentials of the author to create the issue with the API (i.e. either their username/password or their API key).</p>

<p>If that is not possible, you can use Redmine's <a href="http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api#User-Impersonation" rel="nofollow">User impersonation</a> feature. This allows you to use the API token of an Administrator for all of your requests. By setting the <code>X-Redmine-Switch-User</code> header to the login of another user in your <code>POST</code> request, you can create the issue as another user.</p>

<p>While I have no experience with your .NET client library, it seems they support this feature as it is mentioned in their README. It seems you can set the login using the <a href="https://github.com/zapadi/redmine-net-api/blob/f4c1fd7d8eadfd42fdcfbf8dcf1b6b0ecedd085f/redmine-net40-api/RedmineManager.cs#L89-L92" rel="nofollow"><code>ImpersonateUser</code> property</a> of the <code>RedmineManager class</code>.</p>
