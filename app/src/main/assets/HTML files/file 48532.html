<p>If you check the ACL column on your User class on parse.com, you will see that it has Public Read but what it doesn't have is Public Write so you cannot update row information if you are not logged in as that user. I believe you will have to add Public Write to the ACL of that user if you want to be able to update while not logged id, although I wouldn't recommend it. Another solution is to create a ParseObject to store non-login information, that way you will be able to update it from anywhere since the ACL will be set up to Public Write by default.</p>
