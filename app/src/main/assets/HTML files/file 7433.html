<p>Try the simplest thing first: just set the <code>backgroundColor</code> property on that view and then use <code>performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:</code> to change to the next color after a suitable delay.</p>

<p>Unless you're doing the whole screen with OpenGL, it's not likely to be any faster that way. The bottleneck is most likely compositing the "ball" image and text over the background rather than the creation of a solid-color background. Profile it, instead of guessing or relying on my guessing.</p>
