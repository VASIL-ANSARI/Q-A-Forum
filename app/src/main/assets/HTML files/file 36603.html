<p>you need to look in <code>Mage/Adminhtml/Block/Media/Uploader.php</code>, <code>Mage/Adminhtml/controllers/Media/UploaderController.php</code> and <code>Mage/Media/Model/*</code></p>

<p>Some advices if you are really new to magento : </p>

<ol>
<li>Create a module to override core items (there are plenty of tutos over the net my prefered is the <a href="http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/overriding-magento-blocks-models-helpers-and-controllers/" rel="nofollow">inchoo's one</a>)</li>
<li>The architecture of adminhtml is specific and you'd better have a close look at it to moke it</li>
<li>The cache and compilation are strong enemies in module development so deactivate them if is not yet done</li>
</ol>
