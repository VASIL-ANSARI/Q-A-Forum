<p>You should avoid hardcoding colors of GTK+ widgets from the code. See for instance <a href="http://ometer.com/gtk-colors.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for some discussion of the available methods.</p>

<p><a href="http://eric.extremeboredom.net/2005/01/10/107" rel="nofollow">This blog post</a> explains why sometimes, you simply can't (not all widgets actually render to "their" background pixels). </p>

<p>I think you should consider re-designing your application so you don't need to hardcode the widget colors, or see if the RC-based route can work for you.</p>
