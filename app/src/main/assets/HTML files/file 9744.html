<p>You can't return locally-allocated arrays from a function. As soon as the function finishes, the array ceases to exist, so the pointer you've returned no longer points to a valid object.</p>

<p>Instead of using a <code>char</code> array to represent your bitstring, you should consider using <code>std::string</code>, which has sensible value semantics (i.e., you can copy it, return it from a function, etc, without having to worry about it except from an efficiency standpoint).</p>
