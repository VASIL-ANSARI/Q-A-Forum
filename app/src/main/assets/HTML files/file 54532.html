<p>The <code>subsets</code> array is initialized using this code: </p>

<pre><code>// Create V subsets with single elements
for (int v = 0; v &lt; V; ++v)
{
    subsets[v].getTheParent() = v;
    subsets[v].getTheRank() = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you subsets having <code>parent</code> values from 0 to V-1</p>

<p>The code then tries to find those subsets using this line</p>

<pre><code>int x = find(subsets, next_edge.getSrc());
</code></pre>

<p>But your edges have source and destination set to 'A', 'B', 'C' etc. So it will never be able to find anything in <code>subsets</code>. It is probably accessing items outside the array bounds of <code>subsets</code> and causing undefined behaviour.</p>

<p>To fix it, either change your <code>edges</code> array to use 0, 1, 2, as the node IDs (probably easiest), or change the <code>subsets</code> initialize code to set the parents to 'A', 'B', 'C' etc. Note: there may be more places that assume the node IDs start from 0.</p>
