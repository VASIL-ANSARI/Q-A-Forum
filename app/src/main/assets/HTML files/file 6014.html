<p>Does the library dynamically or statically link to Boost? If statically linked, does the library expose the symbols in the DLL (declspec export)?</p>

<p>If the library is statically linked and the symbols are not exposed, <em>and</em> you do not pass any Boost data structures (smart_ptr, threads, etc) back and forth, you are likely safe to use your own version of the Boost library in your DLL.</p>
