<p>You can't license Segoe UI from Microsoft without direct contact, you can license the mono font from <a href="http://www.ascendercorp.com/font/segoe-ui/">Ascender Corp</a> who are linked to from Microsoft webpage for Segoe UI, however it is not the same as Segoe UI.</p>

<p>I would suggest <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts#UsePlace%3ause/Collection%3aOpen+Sans">Open Sans</a> as an alternative to the Segoe UI font, it is quite similar and has much more open licensing for using as webfont (that link is actually to Google's hosted version of the font) - So you could have Segoe as the main font then fall back to Open Sans on non Windows 7+ Systems.</p>
