<p>Just tested your snippet with a couple of my own raw emails. Works fine...</p>

<p>get_payload() returns either a list or string, so you need to check that first</p>

<pre><code>if isinstance(payload, list):
    for m in payload:
        print str(m).split()

else:
    print str(m).split()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Per our discussion, your issue was that you were not checking is_multipart() on the fp object, which actually is a message instance. If fp.is_multipart() == True, then get_payload() will return a list of message instances. In your case, based on your example mail message, it was NOT multipart, and fp was actually the object you were interesting in.</p>
