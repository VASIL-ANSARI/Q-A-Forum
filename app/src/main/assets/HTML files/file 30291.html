<p>Make sure variables <code>graphDb</code> and others are not local variables but fields of an instance of some class <code>Neo4jConnection</code>. Then, create single instance of that class (singleton), run <code>setUp()</code> once and use that connection whenever you need access the database. How to manage that singleton, depends on your environment (do you use Spring?). Simplest way is to have a static variable referring that singleton.
