<p>Hope I understand your question. You have a HTM file with a list of links and these links are links to specific files on a remote server and you want to download all the files.</p>

<p>There is no fail proof way to do this.</p>

<p>Check this question. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/516811/how-do-you-parse-an-html-in-vb-net">How do you parse an HTML in vb.net</a> Even though this is for VB.net it is related to what you asked for. You can get an array of links and then start downloading the files.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ack30t8y.aspx" rel="nofollow">Computer.Network.DownloadFile</a> method to download the remot file as save it on a location of yours.</p>

<p>Thi is not a fail prrof method because if a download requires authentication then it will download the HTML page [mostly loin page]</p>
