<p>I don't know if this explains what's going on, but the ActiveRecord <code>count</code> method queries the database for the number of records stored. The <code>length</code> of the <code>Relation</code> could be different, as discussed in <a href="http://archive.railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=6255" rel="nofollow">http://archive.railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=6255</a>, although in that example, the number of records in the database was <em>less</em> than the number of items in the Rails data structure.</p>
