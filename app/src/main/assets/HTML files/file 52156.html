<p>To answer the question from the post title, the <code>run()</code> method from ProxyThread class is called by JVM, after the thread has been started <code>new ProxyThread(serverSocket.accept()).start();</code> and it usually contains the actual work that a thread should performed (in this case, it handles whatever the server socket receives and it accepts a connection from a client).
The moment when JVM calls <code>run()</code> method cannot be controlled by the programmer, but is after the thread has been started.</p>

<p>run() method is never called explicitly by the programmer.</p>
