<p>The <code>REQUIRES_NEW</code> propagation means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Create a new transaction, suspend the
  current transaction if one exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the transactions would not be nested - the first one is suspended, shunted out of the way, and a new, unrelated, transaction is started.</p>

<p>You don't really need to nest the transactions themselves, you just need to ensure that each time you pass through a transactional boundary, you inherit the existing transaction (or start a new one). The default propagation <code>PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</code> is generally good enough.</p>

<p>Interestingly, JDBC 3.0 did introduce the concept of nested transactions, but the EBJ spec has yet to catch up.</p>
