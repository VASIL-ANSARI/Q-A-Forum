<p>As I am doing the something in my application, You just put all the images in a single array. you can try as images are changes based on the duration. You can do..</p>

<pre><code>UIImage *img1 = [UIImage imageNamed:@"1.png"];
UIImage *img2 = [UIImage imageNamed:@"7.png"];
UIImage *img3 = [UIImage imageNamed:@"8.png"];
UIImage *img4 = [UIImage imageNamed:@"9.png"];
UIImage *img5 = [UIImage imageNamed:@"10.png"];

animationImages = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:img1,img2,img3,img4,img5,nil];
[imgView setAnimationImages:animationImages];
[imgView setAnimationDuration:1.5];
[imgView startAnimating];
</code></pre>

<p>and then apply the [imgView stopAnimaiton] where you want to stop this effect. It works fine for me.</p>
