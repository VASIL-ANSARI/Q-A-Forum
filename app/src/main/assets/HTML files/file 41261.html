<p>Output redirection is a shell feature, i.e. the shell sets that up before starting the child.</p>

<p>You're not using a shell, instead going directly to the kernel asking it to start a process, so you don't get that service.</p>

<p>You need to set up the required redirection yourself. This is done in the <code>STARTUPINFO</code>'s <code>hStdOutput</code> member. See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682425%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>, of course.</p>
