<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft believes it's OK to make their APIs use macros for names since they do it for 95% or more of their APIs to make them work 'transparently' for ANSI vs. Unicode APIs.</p>

<p>It doesn't look like they've provided a clean way to prevent the macro from being defined.  I think you're stuck with choosing from several bad options, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>#undef BitTest</code> yourself</li>
<li>modify the <code>winnt.h</code> header</li>
<li>segregate your code that uses Windows APIs directly into modules that aren't dependent on your <code>BitTest&lt;&gt;</code> template</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are other options - I'm just not sure sure which one is the least distasteful.</p>
