<p>Android Views will automatically clear their canvas before onDraw() is called, so you'll have to do one of two things: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep a list of items to draw, add to the list when a button is pressed, and iterate over it in onDraw(). This is simple to implement, but might slow down the draw process if your list gets long. This happens on the UI thread, so be careful. </p></li>
<li><p>Make your own Canvas from a private Bitmap matching the size of your View, and draw on it when a button is pressed. In onDraw(), use drawBitmap() to copy your buffer onto the View. </p></li>
</ol>
