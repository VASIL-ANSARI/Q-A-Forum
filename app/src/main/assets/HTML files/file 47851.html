<p>A cleaner and efficient, although not necessarily different, way to do this is to create a <strong>singleton class</strong>, e.g. <code>AppData</code>, which you can access in a variety of ways, and which would be available to all your other classes. It has the benefit of separating your app-specific stuff from the app delegate stuff. You might define the class this way:</p>

<pre><code>@interface AppData : NSObject

// Perhaps you'll declare some class methods here &amp; objects...

@end
</code></pre>

<p>you can define ivars for the AppData class, and then manage a singleton instance of AppData. Use a class method, e.g. <strong>+sharedInstance</strong>, to get a handle to the singleton on which you could then call mehods. For example, </p>

<pre><code>[[AppData sharedInstance] someMethod:myArgument];
</code></pre>

<p>Your implementation of <strong>+sharedInstance</strong> can be where you manage the actual creation of the singleton, which the method ultimately returns.</p>
