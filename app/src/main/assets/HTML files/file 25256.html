<p>You should cache the TypeFace, otherwise <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9904">you might risk memory leaks on older handsets</a>. Caching will increase speed as well since it's not super fast to read from assets all the time.</p>

<pre><code>public class FontCache {

    private static Hashtable&lt;String, Typeface&gt; fontCache = new Hashtable&lt;String, Typeface&gt;();

    public static Typeface get(String name, Context context) {
        Typeface tf = fontCache.get(name);
        if(tf == null) {
            try {
                tf = Typeface.createFromAsset(context.getAssets(), name);
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                return null;
            }
            fontCache.put(name, tf);
        }
        return tf;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I gave a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16648457/1266551">full example on how to load custom fonts and style textviews as an answer to a similar question</a>. You seem to be doing most of it right, but you should cache the font as recommended above.</p>
