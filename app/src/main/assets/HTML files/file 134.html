<p>This sounds very much like background compiling; though if you're precompiling, that shouldn't be an issue.</p>

<p>First thing I would look at is your ORM (if any). NHibernate, in particular, has a serious startup penalty, as it runs multiple compilers in the background at startup to turn each class in your data layer into its own in-memory assembly.</p>
