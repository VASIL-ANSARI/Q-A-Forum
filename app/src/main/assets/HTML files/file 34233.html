<p><code>Am I doing it right? Because I heard that when using POST, the data must be in key-value format,</code></p>

<p>Yes, you are right, you have to specify that you are sending an <code>XML</code> that's all.</p>

<pre><code>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER =&gt; array("Content-Type: application/xml"),
// or text/xml instead of application/xml
</code></pre>

<p>You do not need to put the <code>$xml</code> under a key. Just pass it as you are doing, its fine.</p>
