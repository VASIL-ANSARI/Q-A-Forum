<p>Google no longer uses the PageRank algorithm to rank search results. They may still generate a number, but it's largely irrelevant. A better means of judging the site would be to use WooRank or something similar. The PageRank value is literally useless.</p>

<p>Hope this puts you on the right path.</p>
