<p>You could use a <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/union.html" rel="nofollow">UNION</a> to <code>SELECT</code> the static row and combine it with a <code>SELECT</code> of the random rows provided you have a specific condition.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM cars WHERE column = 'static condition'
UNION
(SELECT * FROM cars WHERE column != 'static condition' ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 5)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't have trouble with the <em>static condition</em>, comment back with more detail about your the <em>static</em> record.</p>
