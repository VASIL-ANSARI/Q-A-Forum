<p>To answer my own question if anybody else comes this way: Specifically setting stdout in octave doesn't seem to work, and neither do any attempts to temporarily redirect stdout at the system level. However, octave has the command dup2, used as described here:</p>

<p><a href="http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/dup2-on-stdout-or-using-disp-on-another-file-stream-td1611884.html" rel="nofollow">http://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/dup2-on-stdout-or-using-disp-on-another-file-stream-td1611884.html</a></p>

<p>This can be used to redirect octave's stdout to a file to be read by another program (or likely to fast-cgi's own stdout stream once you have the PID)</p>
