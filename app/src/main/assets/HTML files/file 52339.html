<p>This is not a good way to populate a <code>ListView</code> using an adapter which populates the data from multiple <code>ArrayList</code>. Generally we use a single source of dataset to be passed to an adapter in case of showing a list in Android. </p>

<p>So in your case, when you'll call the <code>notifyDatasetChanged</code> it shouldn't take effect in the list properly as far as I can guess. </p>

<p><code>notifyDatasetChanged</code> basically calls the <code>getCount</code> function of the adapter and checks if the size of the <code>ArrayList</code> associated with the adapter is changed or not. If the size of the <code>ArrayList</code> is changed, it refreshes the <code>ListView</code> and the <code>getView</code> function gets called. </p>

<p>In your case, I don't see any <code>getCount</code> function though. <code>getCount</code> usually returns the size of the <code>ArrayList</code> associated with the adapter.</p>

<p>So I would suggest, using a single <code>ArrayList</code> to be passed to the adapter. You can merge multiple <code>ArrayList</code> and can use one joined <code>HashMap</code> in your case too. Its your decision, exactly how you can pass a single list of your dataset to the adapter to populate them into a <code>ListView</code>. </p>
