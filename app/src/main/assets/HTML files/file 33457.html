<p>I do not quite understand your error message, is that what is displayed on the webpage or what?</p>

<p>Firstly, are you sure your SQL query works? Usually SQL likes you to use ' ' around table names with space in them. In general bad idea to have spaces in table and field names. Use underscore or something like TabelName.</p>

<p>Now on to your PHP code: 
In PHP when using SQL you should use the field/variable names as indexes. 
So instead of writing:</p>

<pre><code>while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
 echo "&lt;h2&gt;";
 echo $row[1]."";
 echo "&lt;/h2&gt;";
 echo "&lt;p&gt;";
 echo $row[2]."";
 echo "&lt;/p&gt;";
 }
</code></pre>

<p>You can write:</p>

<pre><code>while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){
 echo "&lt;h2&gt;";
 echo $row['MPN']."";
 echo "&lt;/h2&gt;";
 echo "&lt;p&gt;";
 echo $row['Model']."";
 echo "&lt;/p&gt;";
}
</code></pre>

<p>I assume your field names are 'MPN' and 'Model' in your database. 
To make your code more concise you can write: </p>

<pre><code>while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){
     echo "&lt;h2&gt;".$row['MPN'].".&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;".$row['Model']."&lt;/p&gt;";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>However, got with what you find is easier to read. Hope this helps.</p>
