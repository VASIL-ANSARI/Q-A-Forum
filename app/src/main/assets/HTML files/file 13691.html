<p>You haven't checked that your prepare() actually succeeded:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "INSERT ....";
$stmt = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql);
if (!$stmt) {
    die($sql . $dbh-&gt;errorInfo());
}
</code></pre>

<p>Never assume a query succeeded, especially when you're building one totally dynamically as you are.</p>
