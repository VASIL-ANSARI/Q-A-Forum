<p>You were almost there:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
    if (i &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; i % 2 != 0){
        sum-=input.nextInt();
    } else {
        sum+=input.nextInt();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first two numbers contribute to the result with the "plus" sign, their sign does not alternate, hence the additional <code>i &gt; 2</code> condition.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Side note:</em> I would suggest renaming <code>sum</code> to <code>result</code> and changing the output text to something like <code>System.out.println("The result is:"+result);</code>. 
The reason is that it's not the <em>sum</em> being calculated, to the name <code>sum</code> is a bit confusing. </p>
