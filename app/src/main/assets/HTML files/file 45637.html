<p>When you say 'in order' you need to clarify, do you mean in sorted order or do you mean insertion order, etc.</p>

<p>There are lots of resources available on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16630823/binary-tree-insert-algorithm?s=17%7C3.8160">inserting into binary trees</a> or the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6380231/difference-between-binary-tree-and-binary-search-tree">difference between to types of binary trees</a>, or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4965335/how-to-print-binary-tree-diagram">how to print a binary tree diagram</a>, that I suspect this is a duplicate. </p>

<p>What is different about your example? Having '1' as the root node means you must not have a rebalancing tree since both '2' and '3' are larger than the value for your root node.  Your insert rule seems inconsistent since if '1' is the first node inserted then all other values will cascade to the right branch of the tree unless you use a different rule for the root then at the other levels which would be a pain to code.</p>
