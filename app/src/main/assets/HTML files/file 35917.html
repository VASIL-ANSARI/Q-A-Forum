<p>Go to your S3 console and make sure the bucket is set to "Do not enable website hosting" in "Static Website Hosting".</p>

<p>I'd recommend you to store your s3 credentials only in ENV variables and dump the s3.yml file. It's more secure.</p>

<p>You could setup your paperclip defaults in the environment files (production.rb, development.rb, test.rb, etc.) like this:</p>

<pre><code>  config.paperclip_defaults = {
    :storage =&gt; :s3,
    :s3_credentials =&gt; {
      :bucket =&gt; ENV['AWSBucketName'],
      :access_key_id =&gt; ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
      :secret_access_key =&gt; ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>you won't need to repeat those in your model (game.rb)</p>
