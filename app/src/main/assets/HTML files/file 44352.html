<p>In the error message, it shows <code>'"D:\\LifeFrame"'</code>, which to me looks like you have extra quotes in <code>path</code>. Try adding <code>print path</code> to see what its value is.</p>

<p>Maybe you want to upload data from <code>filename</code> to your server, not from <code>path</code>, in which case Python showed in the error message is where the bug is: you should be opening <code>filename</code> instead.</p>
