<p>Because you are going to a different view (i.e. you are redirecting back to the signup view), Play performs a redirect, which means that the errors are no longer in scope, as the signup view is treated as a new request.</p>

<p>To get around this, you need to keep the validation messages available for the next request, which is achieved by using the <code>validation.keep()</code> function.</p>

<p>So, change your code, so that just before you call <code>signup()</code>, you call <code>validation.keep()</code>.</p>

<p>Your code should look like</p>

<pre><code>if(user != null) {
    Logger.warn("User account already created for email %s", email);
    validation.addError("email", "This email address already in use.");
    params.flash();
    flash.error("Please correct the error below!");
    validation.keep();
    signup();
}
</code></pre>
