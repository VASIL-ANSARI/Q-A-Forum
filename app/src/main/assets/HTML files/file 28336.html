<p>The best way to do authentication is to used the built-in systems, but since you've already said you don't like them, you'll just have to settle for not the best way.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you use membership or not, authentication works the same way in WebApi as it does in MVC and WebForms.  You use an FormsAuthentication cookie, which is automatically authenticated by the framework when the request comes in.  This is stored in the HttpContext.Current.User.Identity object.</p>

<p>This has not changed (much) since at least .NET 2.0, other than to improve the encryption techniques.</p>
