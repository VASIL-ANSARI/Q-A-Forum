<p>If <code>vim</code> has been set up to recognize PHP, type <code>=G</code> at the top of your file and it will reindent your code to the end.</p>

<p>To expand on rkulla's comment, <code>=</code> is the indentation command, while <code>G</code> is the command to go to the end of the document and <code>gg</code> goes to the beginning.  If you want to indent the next 5 lines beginning from your current line, you can type <code>=5=</code> or <code>5==</code>.</p>
