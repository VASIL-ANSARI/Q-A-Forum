<p>So, I didn't find such built-in tool. Just two major gems: <code>active_model_serializers</code> and <code>jbuilder</code>. In <code>active_model_serializers</code> you should write ruby classes for serializers, so there isn't specific syntax. But in <code>jbuilder</code> you should use <code>*.json.jbuilder</code> files for rendering json and there are "syntactic sugar" and builder-style DSL. JBuilder is my choice)</p>
