<p>Not sure I understand. If you want to be able to specify what must be fetched, you'll need to mark your associations as lazy, and load your objects using queries. By default *ToOne associations are eager, and *ToMany associations are lazy. Once marked as lazy, the following queries are possible:</p>

<pre><code>select p from Product p // load only the products

select p from Product p 
left join fetch p.type // load products with their type

select p from Product p 
left join fetch p.type t 
left join fetch t.pf // load products with their type and the family of their type
</code></pre>

<p>If the association is eager, whatever to code used to load the entity, its association will be fetched.</p>
