<p>Microsoft makes the source of MFC available <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bs046sh0.aspx" rel="nofollow">as described here</a>, so you can examine the MFC source code yourself and see exactly what it does.  See C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\atlmfc\src\mfc\wincore.cpp for the implementation of CWnd::Create and it's clear that no new thread is created.</p>
