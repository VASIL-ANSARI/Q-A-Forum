<p>I had exactly the same issue under iOS 7 using Xamarin.iOS.</p>

<p>What has helped, is adding <code>GC.Collect()</code> in <code>didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo</code> method.
In C# <code>GC.Collect()</code> "cleans up" the memory from unused/disposed objects. </p>

<p>For sure, there's no direct equivalent for that in Obj-C, but that may shed some light on your problem also (it could be memory-related).</p>
