<p>I think the easiest way to do this would be to add a separate property for serialization (it can be even private). In this property you can return the string to serialize (without control characters).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>[DataContract]
public class MyClass 
{
    public string MyProperty { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    private string MyPropertyForSerialization
    {
        get 
        {
            return RemoveControlCharacters(this.MyProperty);
        }
        set
        {
            this.MyProperty = value;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>MyProperty</code> is <em>not</em> marked with <code>DataMember</code> attribute - the <code>MyPropertyForSerialization</code> is marked with the attribute instead.</p>

<p>The code also assumes that you have a RemoveControlCharacters method which removes control characters from the specified string.</p>
