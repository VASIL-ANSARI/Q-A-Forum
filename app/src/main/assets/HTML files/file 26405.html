<p>Look at both the files for <code>ClassX</code> and <code>ClassY</code> - What targets are they included in? Basically the <code>_selected</code> method is duplicated in both of them. I am going to guess this is a plain C method that happens to be named the same in both files. Try renaming <code>_selected</code> in one of the files.</p>
