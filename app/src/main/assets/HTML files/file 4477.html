<p>try not to Destroy/Create, but <code>.trigger("reloadGrid");</code></p>

<p><strong>UPD:</strong>: try to pass loadonce:false to grid creation params</p>

<p><strong>UPD2:</strong>: Seemed like jQgrid cant operate with column changes "On fly". Try to destroy first grid and create another one instead of it. </p>
