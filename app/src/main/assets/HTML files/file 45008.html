<p>As a developer you have no control on where or how the files are copied as you don't own or manage the file system. </p>

<p>The only thing you can do is come up with a method to determine where the original file was installed (using the installer etc.) and determine if the running application path is the same as the installed path. One way of doing this is by reviewing the InstallDirectory from install shield from the Registry.</p>

<p>Install Sheild Registry Keys:

<p>WPF Getting Executable Path:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3123870/find-the-location-of-my-applications-executable-in-wpf-c-or-vb-net">Find the location of my application&#39;s executable in WPF (C# or vb.net)?</a></p>

<p>Combining those two techniques should help limit the user from "running" the application from a path that it was not installed to.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
