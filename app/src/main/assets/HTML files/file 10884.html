<p>You can set an array of strings which will be used as the title for each scope button.  These can be set in InterfaceBuilder, or in code as follows:</p>

<pre><code>self.mainSearchBar.scopeButtonTitles = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"All", @"Device", @"Desktop", @"Portable", nil];
</code></pre>

<p>You also need to set the showsScopeBar to YES.</p>

<pre><code>self.mainSearchBar.showsScopeBar = YES;
</code></pre>
