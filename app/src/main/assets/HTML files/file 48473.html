<p>If you look closely at your VS output you will see a message along the lines of âapplication verification failedâ, complaining about their provisioning profile. Are you sure that you have the correct provisioning profile installed on your iPhone 6 plus? </p>

<p>Thanks for reporting the crash on the server side. There might be issue on our side where we might accidentally try to respond twice to the same request, which is an error and produces the crash of the server. </p>
