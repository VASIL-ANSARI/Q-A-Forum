<p>When you hit "refresh", the post data is sent again to the page (an alert box is displayed in modern browsers informing you that).</p>

<p>One way to avoid that is to have a page between the displaying html and the action execution. The form then, is submitted to the action execution and, after whatever action is done, it forwards the user back to the HTML page.</p>

<p>Does this makes sense?</p>
