<p>I'm not sure about the method you mentioned, but the way I have got it to work in a previous project is to set a second base url in the config (like "base_url_secure"), and then set the form post to the secure version directly, which means you won't need a redirect.</p>

<p>I don't think you can redirect with post, so the form should post directly to the secure url.</p>
