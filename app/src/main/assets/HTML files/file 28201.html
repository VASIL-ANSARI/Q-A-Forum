<p>I think you're having problems with this: <a href="https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/pull/39" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/pull/39</a>.  I'm sure that cqlengine isn't updated yet to take advantage of that fix (I just merged the pull request today), but that at least explains what the problem is.</p>

<p>As a workaround, you might be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>from binascii import hexlify

hex_image = '0x' + hexlify(myImage)
myTable.create(..., image=hex_image)
</code></pre>
