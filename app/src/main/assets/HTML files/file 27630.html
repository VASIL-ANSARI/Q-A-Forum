<p>A number of manufacturers provide examples of encryption algorithms for their processors.  Here is one for the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa547/slaa547.pdf" rel="nofollow">TI MSP430 processor family</a>.  I would recommend using with caution and a full investigation of the security impacts of your own implementation.  Key management as always is a major problem, particularly how you keep this secure if the device is accessible by an attacker.</p>

<p>Other algorithms that are readily available are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/twofish.html" rel="nofollow">Twofish</a> and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html" rel="nofollow">Blowfish</a> by Bruce Schneier.  </p>

<p>You can also use a standard hash on a shared key plus some message varying data known to both ends (time or message count spring to mind) to produce a "random" array of bytes that can be XORed over the message data.</p>
