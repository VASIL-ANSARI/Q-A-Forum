<p>You're creating a new dictionary on every iteration of your <code>for</code>, so only the update from the last iteration is kept, others have been thrown away.</p>

<p>You can solve this by moving the dictionary setup outside the <code>for</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new_dict = {}
for i in range(10):
    ...
</code></pre>
