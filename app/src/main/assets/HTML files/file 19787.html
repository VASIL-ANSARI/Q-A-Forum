<p>It seems unlikely that a library exists for such a specific task. You could use <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/libs/filesystem/doc/" rel="nofollow"><code>boost::filesystem</code></a> to check for existence of directories. The size of the code to implement the needed functionality shouldn't exceed 20 lines.</p>
