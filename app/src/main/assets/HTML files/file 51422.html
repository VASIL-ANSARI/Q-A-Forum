<p>Simple, just have a Boolean variable which causes the ship to shoot only when it is true. Then set it to true in the space bar is pressed and set it to false when the ship shoots. I can't show you how to implement it in your program as I don't know how your shoot method works. However, if you were to post the method which causes the ship to shoot then, I could show you how to implement it or, you could try your self.</p>
