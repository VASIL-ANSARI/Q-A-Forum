<p>(This isn't really iPhone specific - the same thing will happen in regular Cocoa).</p>

<p>NSUnknownKeyException is a common error when using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/KeyValueCoding.html" rel="nofollow">Key-Value Coding</a> to access a key that the object doesn't have.</p>

<p>The properties of most Cocoa objects can be accessing directly:</p>

<pre><code>[@"hello world" length]    // Objective-C 1.0
@"hello world".length      // Objective-C 2.0
</code></pre>

<p>Or via Key-Value Coding:</p>

<pre><code>[@"hello world" valueForKey:@"length"]
</code></pre>

<p>I would get an NSUnknownKeyException if I used the following line:</p>

<pre><code>[@"hello world" valueForKey:@"purpleMonkeyDishwasher"]
</code></pre>

<p>because NSString does not have a property (key) called 'purpleMonkeyDishwasher'.</p>

<p>Something in your code is trying to set a value for the key 'kramerImage' on an UIView, which (apparently) doesn't support that key.  If you're using Interface Builder, it might be something in your nib.</p>

<p>Find where 'kramerImage' is being used, and try to track it down from there.</p>
