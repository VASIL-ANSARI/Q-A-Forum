<p>The database creates a temporary index on the column <code>id_bill</code> of the subquery <code>d2</code>.</p>

<p>It is not possible to create this index explicitly, unless you explicitly create a (temporary) table for this subquery.</p>

<p>Ignore the warning.
If you need to optimize this query, consider rewriting it so that it is not necessary to do a join with such a complex subquery, i.e., so that <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html#flattening" rel="nofollow">subquery flattening</a> is possible.</p>
