<p>I think that the reason </p>

<pre><code>App.$inject = [CONFIGURATION, LOG_SERVICE];
</code></pre>

<p>doesn't work, is because you have 2 other parameters "$rootScope" &amp; "$location" that you need to inject in the $inject. So it needs to be:</p>

<pre><code>App.$inject = ["$rootScope", "$location", CONFIGURATION, LOG_SERVICE];
</code></pre>

<p>Another way you can inject your service is to use this version:</p>

<pre><code>app.run(["$rootScope", "$location", CONFIGURATION, LOG_SERVICE, 
         function ($rootScope, $location, Configuration, LogService) {

}] );
</code></pre>
