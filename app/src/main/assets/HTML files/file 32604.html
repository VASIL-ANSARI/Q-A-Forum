<p>Do you have a signature being added to your email, like "<em>Sent from my iphone</em>" etc.? 
Remove it and resend the email and attachment and see if the attachment suddenly appears.</p>

<p>There seems to be a problem with Apple Main and Outlook where Outlook will strip out attachments if there is any text added after the attachment has been added.</p>
