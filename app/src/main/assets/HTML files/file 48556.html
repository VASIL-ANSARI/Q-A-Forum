<p>I suggest you use email_verifier gem. (<a href="https://github.com/kamilc/email_verifier" rel="nofollow">link</a>)</p>

<p>email_verifier gem is using smtp for check email.</p>

<p>To get info about realness of given email address, email_verifier connects with a mail server that email's domain points to and pretends to send an email. Some smtp servers will not allow you to do this if you will not present yourself as a real user.</p>
