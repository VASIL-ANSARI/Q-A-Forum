<p>The event broker always broadcasts to anything that is dealing with the event, you can't use it to send to one specific thing. </p>

<p>If you are in a Handler you can get the current part in the @Execute method and set a value directly in your class - something like:</p>

<pre><code>@Execute
public void execute(@Named(IServiceConstants.ACTIVE_PART) MPart activePart)
{
  Object part = activePart.getObject();

  if (part instanceof MyClass)
   {
     ((MyClass)part).setValue(xxxx);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>If you are in another part use the <code>EPartService</code> to get the active part:</p>

<pre><code>@Inject
EPartService partService;

...

MPart activePart = partService.getActivePart();

Object part = activePart.getObject();

if (part instanceof MyClass)
 {
    ((MyClass)part).setValue(xxxx);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>EPartService.findPart("part id")</code> to find a part with a given id.</p>
