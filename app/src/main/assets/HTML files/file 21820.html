<p>final fields prevent you from changing the field itself (by making it "point" to some other instance), but if the field is a reference to a mutable object, nothing will stop you from doing this:</p>

<pre><code>public void someFunction (final Person p) {
    p = new Person("mickey","mouse"); //cant do this - its final
    p.setFirstName("donald");
    p.setLastName("duck");
}
</code></pre>

<p>the reference p above is immutable, but the actual Person pointed to by the reference is mutable.
you can, of course, make class Person an immutable class, like so:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person {
    private final String firstName;
    private final String lastName;
    public Person(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    //getters and other methods here
}
</code></pre>

<p>such classes once created, cannot be modified in any way.</p>
