<p>An obvious solution is to let the publisher initiate the HTTP request right after storing the message, but this begs the question, why then are you using a message queue?</p>

<p>Having a set of consumers listening on a queue and doing their job as messages come is not a kludge, it is good, scalable design. (Though I agree that running a PHP process in an infinite loop has its cons.)</p>

<p>Why have you chosen a message queue as opposed to, say, a database which stores the messages? The "producer" could store the message as a row in a table and then trigger the "consumer" with the message's PK.</p>
