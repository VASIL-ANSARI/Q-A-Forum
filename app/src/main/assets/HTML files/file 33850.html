<p>Hi just remove position:fixed it will solve the issue.</p>

<p>Don't position your images with position: fixed; for your current situation.  position: fixed; is for keep an element fixed on the screen so that it never moves. When you view your images on a smaller screen, the text must move somewhere, so it overlaps the fixed images.</p>

<p>I have verified it in Mozilla Firefox fire bug by removing position:fixed attribute, it was working.</p>

<p>Best of luck.</p>
