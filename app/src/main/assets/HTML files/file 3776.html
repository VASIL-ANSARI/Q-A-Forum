<p>Instead of JLayer you could look into JMF.  Here is the link                <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/mp3/download.html" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/mp3/download.html</a>
Then it looks like you can control the volume using their media player. <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/2.1.1/apidocs/javax/media/bean/playerbean/MediaPlayer.html" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/2.1.1/apidocs/javax/media/bean/playerbean/MediaPlayer.html</a>  I hope this helps, I haven't tried it but the links look promising.</p>
