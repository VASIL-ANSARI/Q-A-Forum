<p>Ok - for anybody that reaches this point...
I downloaded this version: <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html" rel="nofollow">http://curl.haxx.se/download.html</a> win 32 generic.
It is compiled to run under ssh, ntlm and kerberos etc. The download includes the relevant DLL's you will need to create apps for any environment that requires cached credentials.
If you want specific code - pertaining to using callbacks, chunking etc, drop me a line and I can forward it to you. Given the flexibility of the curl library - it would be a bit much to just drop a ton of code here. Once you have the curl.exe up and running, there is a cmd line switch that can output the equivalent code to a text file (although it doesn't include information regarding any writecallback functions etc - just the easy setup options required). Thanks to n.m for your help - much appreciated. G</p>
