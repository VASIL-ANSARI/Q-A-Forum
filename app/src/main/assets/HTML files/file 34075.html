<p>Do you mean, you need to return Customer detail even if doesn't have an address.</p>

<p>If so, use Left Join</p>

<pre><code>SELECT FirstName, LastName, Line1, City, State, ZipCode
FROM Customers LEFT JOIN Addresses
    ON (Customers.CustomerID = Addresses.CustomerID and 
Customers.ShippingAddressID=Addresses.AddressID)
</code></pre>
