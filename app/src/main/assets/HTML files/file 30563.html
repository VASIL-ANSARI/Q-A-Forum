<p>You want your code to be escaped for use within string.  You can do this by using the output wrapper command-line options to specify as so:</p>

<pre><code>--output_wrapper="%output|jsstring%"
</code></pre>

<p>Here you wouldn't be actually adding any wrapper text but simply taking advantage of the ability to specify that you want the output escaped for use in a string for embedding purposes.</p>
