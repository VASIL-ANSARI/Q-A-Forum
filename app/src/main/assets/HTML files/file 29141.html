<p>I worked with iOS SCEP quite long time ago. So, don't remember all details. However, I have answers to several of your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>does the scep have to have any relationship with my mdm server </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. CA/RA are absolutely stand alone entity and doesn't have to have anything in common with mdm. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone know of a public scep server i can access to check what a valid GetCACert resopnse looks like ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can take a look at <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jscep/" rel="nofollow">jSCEP</a>. It's open source light weight SCEP implementation and I know that it works with iOS. </p>

<p>I would recommend to set it up and check what it will return.</p>
