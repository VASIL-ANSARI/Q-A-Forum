<p>Remove <code>public static boolean isLeapYear;</code> from your code and every time you need to call a function, in this case <code>public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) { ..}</code> you must use a parenthesis to let the compiler know that you are actually calling a function there.</p>

<p>In this case you should go with <code>isLeapYear(year)</code></p>

<p>and then <code>if (isLeapYear(year)) { .. } else {..}</code></p>
