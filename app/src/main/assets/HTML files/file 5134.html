<p>In your paintComponent() method you can use the FontMetrics to get the width of the string you want to paint:</p>

<pre><code>FontMetrics fm = getFontMetrics( getFont() );
int width = fm.stringWidth("your string here");
</code></pre>

<p>Then you calculate the offset where to start painting based on the width of the component.</p>

<p>The question is why are you trying to do this. You can just use a JLabel and set its alignment to the right.</p>
