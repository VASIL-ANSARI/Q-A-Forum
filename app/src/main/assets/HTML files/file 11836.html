<p>Make a class that is responsible for creating a Loan object. You could call this LoanCreator or if it is helpful for you to think of it in the following way you could call it Librarian. You would pass this new class a Book and a Patron object and it would create the Loan for you. Generally if you find yourself unsure if a method should belong to a particular class then perhaps it is time to consider creating a new class.</p>
