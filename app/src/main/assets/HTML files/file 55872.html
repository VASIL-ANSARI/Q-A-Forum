<p>These are flags which you can set. In this instance <code>|</code> refers to the bitwise operator.</p>

<p>In your example, this conveniently allows you to combine multiple flags through a single parameter.</p>

<p>Suppose the two flags have the following values:</p>

<pre><code>SDL_RENDERER_SOFTWARE = 1 // Binary 0001
SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED = 2 // Binary 0010
SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC = 4 // Binary 0100
</code></pre>

<p>A logic bitwise OR of the two, would leave you with the value 6 for the <code>flag</code>.
We can easily determine from this value which flags have been set using bitwise AND.:</p>

<pre><code>flag = SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED | SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC // flag = 6 (0110)
flag &amp; SDL_RENDERER_SOFTWARE == 0 // Not set
flag &amp; SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED == 2 // Set
flag &amp; SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC == 4 // Set
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it's important here for the flags to be powers of two, to ensure all flag combinations result in a unique value.</p>
