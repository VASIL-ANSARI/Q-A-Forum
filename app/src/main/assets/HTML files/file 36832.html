<p>No data upon app launch points to the persistent store coordinator. </p>

<p>Looks like the evaluation for the options dictionary is fine, but in either outcome you're always setting up the coordinator with the same persistent store URL. </p>

<p>Likewise, in the migration routine, you're migrating the persistent store object, but with the same URL. That can't work, as that's where the actual files are saved. You need a different URL for the local store and for the iCloud store, then you can correctly migrate the data across and choose to delete the URL you no longer need (after removing the store from the coordinator). </p>

<p>Setup the coordinator with the respective URL, depending on the outcome of your evaluation - and hopefully - you should see your data upon app launch.</p>
