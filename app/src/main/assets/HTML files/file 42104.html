<p>You're overwriting variables. In the beginning you declare a variable <code>body</code>, and then you say <code>body = new CANNON.Body...</code> and after that you use the same sentence for the second sphere, so the first one gets overwritten. You should have a variable body2, a variable mesh2 to avoid this. This approach would work ok if you only need two bodies, but if you're planning to have more you need a different approach: Arrays. In an Array you can store all your bodies and then loop through it and handle each one singularly. Example:</p>

<p>Here we create 10 bodies:</p>

<pre><code>var bodies= []; //create the array

for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    bodies.push({ //insert into the array an object that contains the information for each body/mesh
        body: new CANNON.Body({mass:0.2}),
        mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry,material)
    })
};
</code></pre>

<p>And then we use them:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i=0, l=bodies.length; i &lt; l; i++) { //we loop through each body
    var body = bodies[i]; //this will be the current body
    //MOVE THE BODY AND UPDATE THE MESH HERE
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would be a better approach. It's more maintainable and you can have as many bodies as the browser can handle. If you only need two, your fastest fix would to add a second variable for the second body and handle it separately.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Watch this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW6pmzd34Hc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW6pmzd34Hc</a> he stores the circles into an array as well. I hope it makes it a little bit clearer.</p>
