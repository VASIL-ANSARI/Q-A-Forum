<p>The behavior in firefox is a result of the scaling being applied to the divs current width/height which is set to 100% of its container.  As the container is shrunk, the scale of the child will be some percent of that.</p>

<p>One fix for this would be to set the child to a fixed width and then scale it from there.  You will also need to set the transform-origin to 0 0 (top, left):</p>

<pre><code>#ui{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    z-index: 1000;
    width: 800px;
    height: 600px;
    background-color: red;
    opacity: 0.5;
    -o-transform-origin: 0 0;
    -moz-transform-origin: 0 0;
    transform-origin: 0 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the linked fiddle, I used 800 x 600: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/0sm284qz/3/" rel="nofollow">demo fiddle</a></p>

<p>Ultimately, I don't think scaling will provide the best result for you.  Instead, I'd suggest changing your layout to use relative height, width and position.</p>

<p><strong>Using relative height/width</strong></p>

<p>If your aspect ratio is a constant 800x600 you can change your CSS for <code>.ui-button</code> to use a width of 10% (80px/800px) and a height of 13.33% (80px/600px) rather than adjusting the scale during window resize:</p>

<pre><code>.ui-button{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    width: 10%;
    height: 13.33%;
    background-color: #000;
    opacity: 0.5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will provide a similar end result to the scaling you were doing before.</p>
