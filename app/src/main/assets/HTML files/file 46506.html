<p>As far as I know, there is no existence of such a built in functionality.</p>

<p>The sanitize filters from <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.sanitize.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.sanitize.php</a> doesn't look to cover your request. You may take a look at <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.filter.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/book.filter.php</a>, but no filter is there set to filter HTML. </p>

<p>I know you don't ask for an external library, but this is the one I think that may help you with the issue you're facing: <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/" rel="nofollow">http://htmlpurifier.org/</a></p>
