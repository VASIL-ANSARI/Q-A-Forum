<p>If I understand correctly you are trying to get the value that is in the div, and trying to store it in Javascript? If so try  declaring a variable in the Javascript to store the value, e.g.</p>

<p>var day = document.getElementById("day_content").value;</p>

<p>This variable will now store the value of this div.
Correct me if I'm wrong - Good Luck ^_-</p>
