<p>I shall form my brief comment into a proper answer for you.
To provide an immediate solution, you can change your stored procedure to a scalar-valued function instead:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[Product_Bucket_Type] (
    @productcode nvarchar(4)= NULL
) RETURNS nvarchar(30)
AS BEGIN   
    DECLARE @bucket nvarchar(30)
    Select
         @bucket = Case
         WHEN @productcode IN ('20','22', '26','27','28','2A','2B') THEN 'CA'
         ...
    RETURN @bucket
END
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can run your query as <code>SELECT Product, Cost, dbo.Product_Bucket_Type(Product) AS whatever FROM ...</code></p>

<p>Better yet, you follow Beth's and Gordon's advice, and separate your codes out into 1 or 2 tables that you join your query on. Without proper knowledge of what your tables look like presently that is a bit hard to say - as a wild guess I'd put this (pseudo-structure) together:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Table ProductCodes (ID, ProductCode)<br>
  1    '20'<br>
  2    '2XA'<br>
  3    '2XB'<br>
  and so on</p>
  
  <p>Table BucketTypes (id, BucketType)<br>
  1    'CA'<br>
  2    'OU'  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>... (depending on 1:n, n:1 or n:m connections, which is hard to see, you may want something like this for n:m's  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TABLE ProductCodes_Link_BucketType (ProductCodes_ID, BucketTypes_ID)<br>
  1    1<br>
  2    2<br>
  3    2  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what may fit your requirements, so I shall leave it at that. Hope it helps.</p>
