<p>Applying <code>height:100%</code> won't actually do anything if its parent's height is set to <code>auto</code>, which is the default value if it is not specified.</p>

<p>When an element has its height set to auto, its height actually reflects how tall it must be to accommodate all of its children.</p>

<p>So, if the child of that element has a height of 100%, you are specifying that the height must be calculated based on the height of the parent. But the parent's height is determined by the height of the child...which is determined by the height of the parent...</p>

<p>This infinite loop cannot exist, so in these circumstances, the child's height will revert back to <code>auto</code>.</p>
