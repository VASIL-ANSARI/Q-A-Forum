<p>I had the same problem when I moved different javascript functions out of the main page to an separate .js file. For some reason, Android can't find externally-loaded JavaScript webview functions from Java - only the ones in the main page. Once I moved the function back from the JS file, it immediately started working.</p>

<p>Try making a "proxy" function like this directly inside the main HTML:</p>

<pre><code>function proxy() {
    call_some_other_function_from_JS_file();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This worked for me. I'm sure there must be a way to get find these functions, because I didn't have this problem on iOS. Someone please comment if you know a better way.</p>
