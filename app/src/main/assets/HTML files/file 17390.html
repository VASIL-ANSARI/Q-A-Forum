<p>Don't use uppercase letters in your routes. Use all lowercase like this:</p>

<pre><code>$route['games/(:num)/(:any)'] = 'games/game/$1';
</code></pre>

<p>Routes won't work if you use uppercase controller name. As for method names, they can be either lowercase of uppercase, both will work... no need for duplicate routes!</p>
