<p>This is too long for a comment.</p>

<p>Subqueries in the <code>SELECT</code> are called <em>scalar</em> subqueries.  These always return one column and at most one row.  If they return no rows, then the value is <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>They <em>do not</em> filter rows out of the result set.  It is as simple as that.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>nothing</em> you do in the two subqueries in the <code>SELECT</code> will affect the number of rows returned.  They only affect the value for that particular column.</p>
