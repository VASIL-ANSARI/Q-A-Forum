<p>volley (and i guess all other caching systems) use the exact detailed url u call as a key for cache data.
if you wanna delete a cache entry u need to do it by exact full link.
the link "www.example.com/amir?id=1" is different from "www.example.com/amir?id=2". otherwise caching would be more trouble than efficient.</p>
