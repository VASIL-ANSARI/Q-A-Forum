<p>I attempted to implemented the same circle packing example and had overlapping circles, too.  For me the problem was cause by the fact that data parent nodes had 0 children and size 0.  Once I changed the parent nodes with an empty array of children into correctly formatted leaves, the problem went away. </p>

<p>Bad overlapping before data structure: </p>

<pre><code>root = {name:"root",
    children:[
       {name:"badchildlessparent", children:[]},
       {name:"parentnodewithchild", children:[{name:"a leaf",size=50}]}
     ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Nicely packing after data structure:</p>

<pre><code>root = {name:"root",
    children:[
        {name:"fixedit_now_child", size=1} ,
        {name:"parentnodewithchild", children:[{name:"a leaf",size=50}]}
    ]
}
</code></pre>
