<p>The exception is happening because your different code branches (for the different types of rows) could each be dealing with a re-used row view that has any kind of tag object associated with it.</p>

<p>The best solution is to override <code>Adapter</code>'s <code>getItemViewType(int)</code> and <code>getViewTypeCount()</code> methods to specify how many different types of item views you have and map those to the list positions. This will simplify your logic in <code>getView(...)</code> and let <code>ListView</code> handle the row recycling pools differently for different view types.</p>

<p>You can change your tests in <code>getView(...)</code> to something like: </p>

<pre><code>if (getItemViewType(_position) == TYPE_CATEGORY) {
   // code for categories
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>TYPE_CATEGORY</code> is an <code>int</code> that your Adapter subclass knows about.</p>
