<p>Is your block reference a 3D object?  If so. I noticed that you currently get the bounds of the object along the X axis (Width) and Y Axis (Height) but you're missing utilizing the Z Axis.  If the Block Reference is a 2D object, then going about the method you described won't work since that information simply isn't there.</p>

<p>You can also try looking at the properties of the Block Reference under the AutoCAD 'Properties' palette. Depending on how the block reference was made, there may already be values for it's dimensions that you can simply access via the API.</p>

<p>Here's a link to Kean Wamsley's blog giving some brief examples of how to utilize the API to access the block info directly - <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/03/accessing-the-properties-of-a-dynamic-autocad-block-using-net.html" rel="nofollow">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/03/accessing-the-properties-of-a-dynamic-autocad-block-using-net.html</a></p>
