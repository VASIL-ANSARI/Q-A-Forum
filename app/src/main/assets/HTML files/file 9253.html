<p>You could add some script to the dialog form that finds and closes the parent. However a better approach would be to use Ajax.Form instead of Html.BeginForm in your dialogs.</p>

<p>That way the submit button on the dialog will update only a specified area within the dialog and has an OnComplete handler that can close the dialog if required. </p>
