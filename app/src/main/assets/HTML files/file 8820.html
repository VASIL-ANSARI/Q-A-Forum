<p>It looks like there is a <code>try... except</code> block in the <code>IntegerField</code> ancestry which will place all non ints into the <code>process_errors</code> property and that the class is specifically prevented from allowing you to have data populated with anything but valid data. I believe you can still get the values you seek in the <code>raw_data</code> property, however.</p>
