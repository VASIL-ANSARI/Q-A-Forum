<p>You can't really rely on the title being set correctly at the time a window is created. You may have to play around with other properties to find some that are set correctly from the beginning. You might try something like <code>isInProperty "WM_WINDOW_ROLE" "pop-up"</code> instead of <code>title =? "Google - Bookmarks - Chromium"</code> or similar.</p>
