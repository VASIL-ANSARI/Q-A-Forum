<p>If you're going to process the file on the user's machine then there is no need to upload the file anywhere, it's already exactly where you need it. All you need to do is popup a dialog to allow the user to browse their file system and select the file they want your app to process. You can create a button and call <a href="https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/v0.36.9/docs/api/dialog.md#dialogshowopendialogbrowserwindow-options-callback" rel="nofollow">dialog.showOpenDialog</a> when the user presses it, that will get you a filename and you can then use Node's <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_file_options_callback" rel="nofollow">fs.readFile</a> to read it from disk, then you can go ahead and process the contents in whichever way you want.</p>
