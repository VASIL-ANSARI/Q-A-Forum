<p>There's a lot of options here and many use cases to think through.  Maybe you can start with something very simple that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tracks the last date/time of login for each user</li>
<li>On some page (specific to the logged in user), display all DinnerEvents created since last login that match their Food preferences.  Should be simple Active Record to pull this.</li>
<li>Continue to show this list until they dismiss it (record this date/time) or login again</li>
</ol>

<p>A full blown messaging system will probably require more complex stuff like queues for each user that are subscribed to a master queue.  And, possibly an additional backend data store like Redis.  I'm purposefully leaving out the details of something like this for now; it's a much bigger topic.</p>
