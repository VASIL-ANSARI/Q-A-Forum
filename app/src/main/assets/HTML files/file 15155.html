<p>If there's no reason that <a href="http://www.iopus.com/guides/winscheduler.htm" rel="nofollow">Windows Task Scheduler</a> won't work for you, I would recommend you use that.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use task scheduler, I would have a simple loop which checks for any upcoming events (lock/unlock sites) and execute any which are due.  If no events are coming up, sleep for a long period (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d00bd51t.aspx" rel="nofollow">Thread.Sleep()</a>).<br>
I haven't looked into any side effects of long sleeps, but a sleep time of one minute shouldn't consume much in the way of resources.  If it wasn't a service, I would probably put in a termination check, but I assume that the service isn't meant to terminate.</p>
