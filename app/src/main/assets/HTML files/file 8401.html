<p>Your code ends up testing mainly garbage collection performance because appending to a String in a loop ends up creating and immediately discarding a large number of increasingly large String objects. </p>

<p>This is something that inherently leads to wildly varying measurements and is influenced strongy by multi-thread activity.</p>

<p>I suggest you do something else in your loop that has more predictable performance, like mathematical calculations.</p>
