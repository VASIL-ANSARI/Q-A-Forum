<p>The problem seems to be that you're grouping by year/month and trying to sum values outside that year/month range.  Without sample data, I can't be certain, but it sounds like you want a rolling 12 month sum.  Something like below should get you where you want to go.</p>

<pre><code>;with monthlySubtotal as
    (
        select 
                dateadd(m, 1-datepart(day, p.dt), p.dt) as PeriodMonth
                ,P.Plant
                ,Sum(Case When Left(Upper(Material),2) = 'ZZ' then 1 else 0 end) as Stock
                ,Sum(Case When Left(Upper(Material),2) &lt;&gt; 'ZZ' then 1 else 0 end) as Special
                ,Count(*) as MonthTotal
        from 
                iesaonline.dbo.DS_POs  as P where
