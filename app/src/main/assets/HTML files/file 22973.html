<p>I think one possible solution can be
If you are using a list item and you'll notice as you pull the list down the height of the component (scroll area) increased (the only time, height will increase). You can try to get the initial height and add an event listener on change of component height, send your server request for new data. I haven't use as3 for a while, but try something like this.</p>

<pre><code>1. Store initial list height
2. add an event listener on initialise() of the view; For the event listener you can even use swipe down(event.offsetY) method and look for height change.
3. on change of height (i.e increased), send new request to server
</code></pre>

<p>Post the code if you try, We may solve it together.</p>
