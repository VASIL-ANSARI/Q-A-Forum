<p>If that's really all you know about the object, then all you can really do is store it in a <code>bytea</code> field and retrieve it again later when needed.</p>

<p>Use <code>bytea</code> not <code>text</code>. It's faster for binary data (no collations or natural language support) and it supports storing zero (null) bytes, unlike <code>text</code>.</p>

<p>This should be an absolute last resort way to store data in a DB. It <em>always</em> leads to pain. Someone will come along and ask "ok, now write a query where you find all objects of type <code>com.mycompany.Apple</code> with their <code>colour</code> property set to <code>"red"</code>. You will have to reply "sorry, I can't do that, the database just sees a pile of binary gibberish". You will be told <em>"Do it anyway"</em>. So you read <em>every</em> object out of the database, deserialize it, check its type, check its properties by reflection and discard it or keep it based on the result. The database gets bigger and this gets slower and slower. So you start adding columns to cache information about the objects in the DB, but then they start getting out of sync with the stored data because some code forgets to update them...</p>

<p>I've written queries that poke around in <code>bytea</code> strings to manually deserialize and examine parts of Java objects before. Horrible stuff. Do not recommend.</p>

<p>If you can possibly do so, use a more practical serialisation of the object structure, like <code>json</code>. Something you can query in a practical manner from the database when you are inevitably asked to do so.</p>
