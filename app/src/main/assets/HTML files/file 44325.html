<p>For "sum the balance column values and write the result in ytotal6 where id is 1 column" try this</p>

<pre><code>  UPDATE finance f1, (SELECT SUM(balance) AS bal
            FROM finance ) f2
  SET ytotal6 = bal
  WHERE f1.id = 1;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For error like "You can't specify target table for update in FROM clause" we need to create a temporary table</p>
