<p>The <code>base</code> value tells python to interpret the given string to be a value of a different base.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>1011</code> in base 2 is 11. Thus, <code>int('1011', 2)</code> returns <code>11</code>.<br>
On the other hand, <code>1011</code> in base 3 is 31. Thus, <code>int('1011', 3)</code> returns <code>31</code>.</p>

<p>Decimals are in base 10, which is why the default value of <code>base</code> is <code>10</code>.</p>

<p>A fun side-effect of choosing a numeric base, is that there does not exist a digit in that system that is higher than (or equal to) the base itself. This is why we do not have a digit for ten in the decimal system, while the hexadecimal system (base 16) uses the digit <code>A</code> for ten. This is why you were getting errors for asking a number with the digit <code>5</code> to be interpreted in base 4.</p>
