<p>It does not insert anything, because (among other things) your query string is not being built correctly.</p>

<pre><code>('@lid','Array[0],'Array[1],'Array[2])
</code></pre>

<p>The apostrophes are messed up. I'd like to suggest a (in my opinion) cleaner and more structured way to perform your task:</p>

<p><strong>Note: You are obviously working with the mysql_*-stack, so my example is also based on it. But be aware that this is deprecated. Please use mysqli or even better: <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php" rel="nofollow">PDO</a> instead.</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$maininsert = "INSERT INTO `camptest`
              (`name`, `city`, `phone`, `photo`)
              VALUES
              ('{$_POST['name']}', '{$_POST['city']}', '{$_POST['phone']}', '$photoinfo')";

//perform the main insert and fetch the insert id
mysql_query($maininsert);

$last_id = mysql_insert_id();

// Put the keys and values of the acts in arrays. We can already 
// populate them with the one key-value-pair we already know
$act_keys = array('cid');
$act_values = array($last_id);

foreach($_POST['classact'] as $key =&gt; $value) {
  //walk through the POSTed acts and add them to the corresponding array
  $act_keys[] = 'act'.($key+1);
  $act_values[] = $value;
}

//Now build the whole string:
$insert_acts = "INSERT INTO `class_act` 
               (`" . implode("`, `", $act_keys) . "`) 
               VALUES 
               ('" . implode("', '", $act_values) . "')";

//and finally perform the query:
mysql_query($insert_acts);
</code></pre>

<p>Please also note that this code is highly vulnerable concerning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection" rel="nofollow">SQL-Injection</a> and should <em>absolutely not be used in production</em>!!! Make sure to either use prepared statements (like with PDO) or/and to sanitize your input properly.</p>

<p>Also, this solution is just my suggestion and one of many ways to do it. But hey, you asked for an opinion :) PHP is <em>very</em> flexible language, so it's easy to get stuff done, but there are many ways to get it done, so there are always chances to pick a hard an ugly one. Other, especially strong typed languages might prevent that by design. But PHP is really easy to learn and I'm sure your code will improve gradually :)</p>

<p>Another thing I've noticed: You don't need to specify the array-keys in your HTML, you just need to make clear that it's an array with <code>[]</code> behind the name. Also, I'm not sure if the <code>id</code>-attributes you using are valid, but you might want use something more simple:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" name="classact[]" value="" id="classact1"&gt;
&lt;input type="text" name="classact[]" value="" id="classact2"&gt;
&lt;input type="text" name="classact[]" value="" id="classact3"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the next step, you might want to refactor your code a little to make it even more structured and readable. Since you are performing one task, which is 'inserting something into a table', twice, we could also make a resusable function out of it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 

function my_insert($table, $data) {
  // We leverage the flexibility of associative arrays
  $keys   = "`" . implode("`, `", array_keys($data)) . "`";
  $values = "'" . implode("', '", $data) . "'";

  mysql_query("INSERT INTO `{$table}` ({$keys}) VALUES ({$values})");

  return mysql_insert_id(); //This might come in handy...
}

//in order to use this function, we now put our data into associative arrays:
$class_insert = array(
  'name'  =&gt; $_POST['name'],
  'city'  =&gt; $_POST['city'],
  'phone' =&gt; $_POST['phone'],
  'photo' =&gt; $photoinfo
);

$class_insert_id = my_insert('camptest', $class_insert); //and pass it to the function

// You can either build the array while looping through the POSTed values like above, 
// or you can pass them in directly, if you know that there will always be 3 values:
$activities_insert = array(
  'cid'  =&gt; $class_insert_id,
  'act1' =&gt; $_POST['classact'][0],
  'act2' =&gt; $_POST['classact'][1],
  'act3' =&gt; $_POST['classact'][2]
); 

$activities_insert_id = my_insert('class_act', $activities_insert);
</code></pre>

<p>There sure is enough room for improvement and optimization - just wanted to show you how awesome PHP can be :-P</p>
