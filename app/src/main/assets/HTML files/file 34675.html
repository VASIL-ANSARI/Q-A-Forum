<p>I don't recommend putting code that can fail in an enum constructor or as parameters of an enum value declaration. If the code throws an exception, the enum class will likely not load.</p>

<p>You could try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>/** An enum of different materials, with different properties and images. */
public enum Material {
  GRASS (5, false, null, true),

  DIRT (5, false, "res/Dirt.png", true), 

  ...

  AIR(1, false, null, false);


  private final int resis;
  private final boolean traspasable;
  private final String imagePath;
  private Image image;
  private final boolean treesCanGrow;

  private Material(int resis, boolean traspasable, String imagePath,
      boolean treesCanGrow) {  
    this.resis = resis;
    this.traspasable = traspasable;
    this.imagePath = imagePath;
    this.treesCanGrow = treesCanGrow;    
  }

  public synchronized Image getTile() throws SlickException {
    if (image == null &amp;&amp; imagePath != null) {
      image = new Image(imagePath);
    }
    return image;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, however, I prefer enums to be immutable, so if it was my code, I would put the creation of the Image somewhere else (perhaps in a <code>Map&lt;Material, Image&gt;</code> that is lazy-loaded).</p>
