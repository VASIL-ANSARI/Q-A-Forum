<p>I extracted this answer from Stack&nbsp;Overflow question <em><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2447458">Default template arguments for function templates</a></em>:</p>

<p>To quote C++ Templates: The Complete Guide (page 207):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When templates were originally added to the C++ language, explicit
  function template arguments were not a valid construct. Function
  template arguments always had to be deducible from the call
  expression. As a result, there seemed to be no compelling reason to
  allow default function template arguments because the default would
  always be overridden by the deduced value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2447458">the Stack Overflow question</a> to understand quite more. NOTE: the default parameter in a function template  C++ is a new feature in gnu++0x.</p>
