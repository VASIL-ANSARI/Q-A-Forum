<p>To formalize my recommendations in my comment:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't mix AWT components with Swing components unnecessarily as 
<ul>
<li>you will be mixing heavy and light weight components in one GUI which if not done correctly can lead to side effects</li>
<li>you will lose the advantage of Swing's default double-buffering.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do your drawing in a JComponent's or JPanel's <code>paintComponent(...)</code> method, not a <code>paint(...)</code> method. Again, this will give you the advantage of Swing's default double buffering.</li>
<li>Don't get your Graphics object by calling <code>getGraphics()</code> on a component as this will return an evanescent object that will soon become null leading to unstable images. '
<ul>
<li>Much better to draw background images to a BufferedImage, but note that it is fine to call <code>getGraphics()</code> to get a Graphics object for the BufferedImage, but don't forget to dispose of it when done.</li>
<li>Then draw the BufferedImage in the <code>paintComponent(...)</code> override by calling <code>drawImage(...)</code> on the Graphics object that the JVM passes into the paintComponent(Graphics g) method's parameter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Draw any short-lived or moving images in the <code>paintComponent(...)</code> method, again using the Graphics object given to you by the JVM.</li>
<li>Do not dispose of a Graphics object given to you by the JVM.</li>
<li>You almost <em>never</em> call <code>paint(...)</code> or <code>paintComponent(...)</code> directly. I've only done this myself when printing a component or when I need to do some very fancy graphics like those shown in the <a href="http://filthyrichclients.org/" rel="nofollow">Filthy Rich Clients</a> book.</li>
<li>Avoid use of KeyListeners as they are low-level constructs and require a component to have focus.
<ul>
<li>Better to use Key Bindings -- check out the tutorial for more on these.</li>
<li>If you must use KeyListeners, you must be sure to give the listened to component the focus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check out the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html" rel="nofollow">Swing Graphics Tutorials</a> </li>
