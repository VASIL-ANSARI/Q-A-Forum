<p>The pattern itself looks fine, but I guess, its because of Backslash escaping.</p>

<p>Please take a look this <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/java.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.regular-expressions.info/java.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In literal Java strings the backslash
  is an escape character. The literal
  string "\\" is a single backslash. In
  regular expressions, the backslash is
  also an escape character. The regular
  expression \\ matches a single
  backslash. This regular expression as
  a Java string, becomes "\\\\". That's
  right: 4 backslashes to match a single
  one.</p>

<p>So, if you reuse your Javascript regex in java, you need to replace <code>\</code> to <code>\\</code>, and vice versa.</p>
