<p>This was used in ancient times for those typewriters which didn't have the umlauted vowels...  </p>

<p>Trick: Try inserting something between the u and the e, like replacing "ue" with "u-e" before reading it.  </p>

<p>i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>tts.speak(txt,replace("ue", "u-e"), TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH, null);
</code></pre>

<p>Where txt is your string ("Minuendo") and tts is the TextToSpeech instance.</p>

<p>It should work, because the TTS engine won't recognize the ue as a diphtong anymore.<br>
And "-" won't be read (or use a comma instead or some other MUTE character).</p>
