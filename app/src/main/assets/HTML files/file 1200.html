<p>I don't think there is a generic way to do this.</p>

<p>From a pure Platform Security perspective, I expect only the phone manufacturer or operator to be able to give your application the capability to restore the handset factory settings.</p>

<p>For example, firmware version can be obtained via <code>SysUtil::GetSWVersion</code></p>
