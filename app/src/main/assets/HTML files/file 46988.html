<p>As of my understanding from your writing above your database query returning the same result set. To solve this kind of problem we are using candidate key. In your program if you add one more column <strong>count</strong> to company table then we can use both employee_id and count as a candidate key. Plz update your code so i can modified it as per you need.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can add a auto increment id in your company table then also it will work  </p>
