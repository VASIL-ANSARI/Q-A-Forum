<p>You have two divs with the same id, when you bind something with jQuery using an id, it only does the first one.</p>

<pre><code>$('#searchOptionMap').click(function()
    {
        window.alert("map clicked");
    });
</code></pre>

<p>So use a class instead, or make the panel external if it's going to be the same panel for both pages.</p>

<p>(#searchOptionMap2 works in this case because there's only one of them)</p>
