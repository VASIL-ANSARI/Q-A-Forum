<p>The problem is that the text is drawn with a texture for each letter applied to the quad. Any transparent objects must be drawn after objects that they appear in front of. Changing the draw order to draw the text last is the only good solution. Basically, you already found the solution. Draw the text second. Although there are some ways to get the effect you want while drawing the text first, I really don't recommend them.</p>
