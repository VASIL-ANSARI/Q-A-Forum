<p>I would do what Nimesh stated, though I would make a few tweaks.  You want to do aggregation as late as possible:</p>

<p><code>SELECT  DunsNum ,
        CompanyName ,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ( Age = 1 ) THEN Amt
                 ELSE 0
            END) AS [Amount_Cur] ,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ( Age = 2 ) THEN Amt
                 ELSE 0
            END) AS [Amount_31-60] ,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ( Age = 3 ) THEN Amt
                 ELSE 0
            END) AS [Amount_61-90]
FROM    tblARAged
GROUP BY DunsNum ,
        CompanyName;
</code></p>

<p>I haven't tested this code</p>
