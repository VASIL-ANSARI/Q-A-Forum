<p>Couple of ways to do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Simplistic way would be using just css absolute property and top/left properties to position the location icons on top of the map.png. Add the map.png to a div and make the div css position relative. Add each location icon at top/left property and make sure location icon css position is absolute.</p></li>
<li><p>Better way would be to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/" rel="nofollow">Google Map Api</a>. Draw the polygons for the states in you map.png on top of the Google map and then position Google location markers. Much slicker and very easy to use.</p></li>
