<p>According to one of the answers to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25373052/3929902">this</a> question, your problem might be caused by changes in MySQL 5.6 (see the InnoDB Notes on <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-20.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-20.html</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>InnoDB Notes</p>
  
  <p>Important Change: Redo log writes for large, externally stored BLOB
  fields could overwrite the most recent checkpoint. The 5.6.20 patch
  limits the size of redo log BLOB writes to 10% of the redo log file
  size. The 5.7.5 patch addresses the bug without imposing a limitation.
  For MySQL 5.5, the bug remains a known limitation.</p>
  
  <p>As a result of the redo log BLOB write limit introduced for MySQL 5.6,
  the innodb_log_file_size setting should be 10 times larger than the
  largest BLOB data size found in the rows of your tables plus the
  length of other variable length fields (VARCHAR, VARBINARY, and TEXT
  type fields). No action is required if your innodb_log_file_size
  setting is already sufficiently large or your tables contain no BLOB
  data.</p>
  
  <p>Note In MySQL 5.6.22, the redo log BLOB write limit is relaxed to 10%
  of the total redo log size (innodb_log_file_size *
  innodb_log_files_in_group).</p>

<p>Does it help if you change <code>innodb_log_file_size</code> to something bigger than 50M? (Changing that variable needs some steps to work correctly: </p>
