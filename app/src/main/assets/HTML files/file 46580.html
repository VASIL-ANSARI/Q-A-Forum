<p>You can't do it during initialization because member variable initialization must be static, and you're trying to call a function. From <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.properties.php" rel="nofollow">the manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This declaration may include an initialization, but this
  initialization must be a constant value--that is, it must be able to
  be evaluated at compile time and must not depend on run-time
  information in order to be evaluated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, do it in the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php" rel="nofollow">constructor</a>:</p>

<pre><code>class Controller {
    protected $database;
    function __construct() {
        $this-&gt;database = DatabaseFactory::getFactory()-&gt;getConnection();
    }
}
</code></pre>
