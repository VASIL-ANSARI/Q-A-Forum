<p>I am not sure what you're trying to do but in your sample project above, <code>PropertiesUtil</code> extends from <code>PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer</code> but your XML configuration refers to <code>PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer</code> and not your sub-class. So if that's all you have, your class is not even invoked.</p>

<p>I tried that locally with the following config and it worked:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id="applicationProperties" class="com.foo.yourpackage.PropertiesUtil"&gt;
    &lt;property name="location" value="classpath:app.properties"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I understand you're trying to access to the properties in your code.The <code>Environment</code> abstraction has all that you need, check <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2011/02/15/spring-3-1-m1-unified-property-management/" rel="nofollow">this blog post</a> and the <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html" rel="nofollow">javadoc of Environment</a> for more details.</p>
