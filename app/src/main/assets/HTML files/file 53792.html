<p>You don't need any JavaScript to display a progress bar. You may want some JavaScript to <em>update the progress bar</em> when user changes something on the page <em>without page reload</em> - which, as I understand, is not your case.</p>

<p>A progress bar, basically, is two nested divs; the inner div is colored with CSS and its width set to the given percent of its parent's width. All you need is to generate the correct markup in your template.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="progress"&gt;
  &lt;div class="progress-bar" ... style="width: {{course_completion_percent}}%;"&gt;
    {{course_completion_percent}}%
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(of course, in your view function you need to calculate the <code>course_completion_percent</code> variable and pass it to the template). Something like this would do:</p>

<pre><code>course_completion_percent = 100.0 * len(completed_assessments) / len(all_assessments)

return {
    ...
    'course_completion_percent': course_completion_percent,
}
</code></pre>
