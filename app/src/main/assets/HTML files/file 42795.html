<p>Near as I can tell if your hmeasy.txt file looks like this: </p>

<pre><code> firstGamePlayWord    0
 secondGamePlayWord    0
</code></pre>

<p>And if the first entry is played it will soon look like this:</p>

<pre><code> firstGamePlayWord    0
 secondGamePlayWord    0
 firstGamePlayWord    1    TODO
</code></pre>

<p>Which, I suspect, is not what you want.  It's doing this because you use this line:</p>

<pre><code>easyFileUpdateList.add(gameplayWord + "    " + strUsed + "    " + "TODO");
</code></pre>

<p>since this is an <code>ArrayList</code> <code>add()</code> just tacks that line at the end.  </p>

<p>I could tell you to instead use <code>set()</code> with the <code>i</code> you worked so hard to find but that would be encouraging a bad design.  You should stop using <code>ArrayList</code> for this.  It wasn't designed for lookups.</p>

<p>Instead I encourage you to look at using a <code>LinkedHashSet&lt;String, Integer&gt;</code>.  No need to tokenize, lookups will be fast, and everything will be in the same order it was added.   </p>

<p>When trying to find the right data structure in java I look at this:
