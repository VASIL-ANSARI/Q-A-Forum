<p>If you're on Unix, one possibility is to load the data into memory, and then have the script use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.fork" rel="nofollow"><code>os.fork()</code></a> to create a bunch of sub-processes. As long as the sub-processes don't attempt to <em>modify</em> the data, they would automatically share the parent's copy of it, without using any additional memory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this won't work on Windows.</p>

<p>P.S. I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6270849/placing-python-objects-in-shared-memory">once asked</a> about placing Python objects into shared memory, but that didn't produce any easy solutions.</p>
