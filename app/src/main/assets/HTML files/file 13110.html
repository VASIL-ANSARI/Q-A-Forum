<p>Is this a question?  Once you submit to the store, you'll mark the app as being available for iPad only.</p>

<p>The SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS conditional is meant for libraries that can be compiled for both MacOS and iOS (a.k.a. iPhoneOS... there is no such thing as iPadOS). It can also be used for libraries that build to work on only the device (such as things that utilize hardware connectors) and not the simulator. </p>

<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>
