<p>Finally, I have found the reason of my problems: as I suspected, internal Visual Studio configuration has been broken.</p>

<p>I did all standard steps, that can be performed in case of LNK1104, however:</p>

<pre>
- kernel32.lib was in valid location
- all include and library directories was correct
- standard *.props files were attached to each project
</pre>

<p>However, the cause was lying elsewhere.</p>

<p>All paths are defined using standard macros. One of them is $(WindowsSDK80Path), which is used to build include/library paths. On my system, this macro was defined as</p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Phone Kits\8.0
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it. I do not know, when or how, this problem arosed. Visual Studio repair via orginal installer was sufficient method to fix everything. All projects compile now without any problems.</p>
