<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>OP has solved this question himself by removing an existing cygwin install and mysql install and then subsequently reinstalling the mysql and cygwin again.</em></strong> </p>

<p>I tried it out myself and ran into the same problem at first. However, this how I solved it. I added <code>c:\xampp\mysql\bin</code> to the path system environment variables. I use XAMPP but your can change it to your installation directory. Note that that I didn't set the path in the user variables. If you add the path to the user variables it doesn't work, however when you add the path to system it does. Make sure your MYSQL server is running otherwise that you will get a message that your can not connect.  Hope this helps. </p>
