<p>To page the outer repeater i have used the method outlined in <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/081804-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">this post</a> in the past. I don't think it should make much difference to the outcome if your repeater is nested. Your inner repeater will count as one row.</p>

<p>Repeaters generally though don't have great support for paging. You could consider using <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/021308-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">ListView</a> (if using ASP.Net 3.5 or greater) or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479347.aspx" rel="nofollow">GridView</a> (ASP.Net 2.0 or greater)  which have more support for paging out of the box.</p>
