<p>I've decided to do another work-around instead. Seems the datepickers only work on some pages and not others, and am against the clock on this one. So instead I've simply got two calendar controls (you've got to have a "from" date and "to" date) and am using them. Bit ugly, but it works for the moment.</p>
