<p>The problem is in the fact that <code>mysql_execute_query</code> always returns a result that resolves to <code>TRUE</code> when the given query is correct.</p>

<p>You should read the results of the select statement, and base your logic on that, not on the fact that the query worked or not.</p>

<p>That being said, there is a lot wrong with your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>the nested-if structure in your main code is not very readable or maintanable</li>
<li>you are open to SQL injection attacks, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement" rel="nofollow">prepared statements</a></li>
<li>connecting to the database for each query is unnecessary</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope I helped you a little, good luck, and happy coding!</p>
