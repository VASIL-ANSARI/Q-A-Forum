<p>Looking at the Documentation on the website, I see:</p>

<pre><code>Elements resultLinks = doc.select("h3.r &gt; a"); // direct a after h3
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like it must work from left to right, so it first selects every <code>h3</code> and then it selects those <code>h3</code> which have an <code>a</code> after them.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.jsoup/jsoup/1.7.2/org/jsoup/parser/TokenQueue.java#TokenQueue" rel="nofollow">code</a> seems to confirm this.</p>
