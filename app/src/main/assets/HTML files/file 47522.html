<p>You have to add another view controller in your storyboard which will be opened after tapping the cell.</p>

<p>In <code>tableView(_:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:)</code> you have to remember which cell was tapped, and in <code>prepareForSegue</code> you can pass data to the destination view controller. In destination view controller just load the image based on data passed.</p>
