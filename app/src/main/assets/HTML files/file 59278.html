<p>After playing around for a while, I think I found a solution:</p>

<p>In the NuGet console, I ran "update-package -reinstall", and then rebuilt the solution.  I still have a warning in the error window that says "Found conflicts between different versions of the same dependent assembly that could not be resolved.  These reference conflicts are listed in the build log when log verbosity is set to detailed.", but I seem to be able to run the application without receiving that exception any more.</p>
