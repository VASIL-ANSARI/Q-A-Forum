<p>In your second query rewrite the condition on </p>

<pre><code>WHERE id not in (SELECT website_id from.....) 
</code></pre>

<p>with <code>&lt;&gt;</code> you can compare it with just one value but your select returns list of values, so you can use <code>not in</code> to get results that are different then the selected list of IDs</p>
