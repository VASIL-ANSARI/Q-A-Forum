<p>Well once you implement facebook connect , the user will be prompted to provide permissions for your app. You need to explicitly provide what permissions you need from the user. In your case post to wall. If the user allows your app, you will get a auth token which you can use in the background to post any message on to the users wall. This is fairly simple and doesn't need user interaction.</p>

<p>I assume you know how to get the authtoken other wise you can check the facebook book graph API integration tutorial by ray wenderlich. Developer.facebook.com has got the list of permissions and sample SDK hosted on github.</p>
