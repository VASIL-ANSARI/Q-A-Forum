<p>You need a reference to the actual buttonCell you want to disable. Creating a new instance of LivroCell will not help you. </p>

<p>The easiest way to do this is when someone clicks the "Buy" button, and you create the new UIViewController, pass a reference to the buy button (if "Buy" calls an IBAction then pass sender to the child view controller you create). So make a property on your child view controller to store the button, set that property when you do alloc/init, then it's easy to disable later.</p>
