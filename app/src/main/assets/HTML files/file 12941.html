<p>In your activity, make an <code>ArrayList&lt;String, int&gt;</code> that will hold the data you want to display. String is the sms number of the sender, int is the count.
Then query for the incoming messages:</p>

<pre><code>cursor = getContentResolver().query(&lt;sms table, assuming all are incoming. if not, you need to filter it on your where clause&gt;, new String[] {sender column name}, null, null, null};

while(cursor.moveToNext()) {
  String sender = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnName(&lt;sender column name&gt;));
  // check if the sender string exists in your arraylist. if not, create a new entry and set count to 1. else, get the position of the existing number and increment count by one.
};
</code></pre>

<p>then feed this to a ListAdapter or ArrayAdapter. CursorAdapter won't cut it.</p>
