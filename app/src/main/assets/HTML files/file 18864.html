<p>Why not:</p>

<p><code>/(.*) \d+ hrs\/w/</code></p>

<p>This should capture all characters before the <code>x hrs/w</code> part.</p>

<p>For a little more explanation, this just creates a capturing group that contains whatever it found before seeing: a space, one or more digits, another space, and then the sequence "hrs/w". Since you don't care what's before the end part, why try to recognize it?</p>
