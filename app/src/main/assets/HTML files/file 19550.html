<p>I would create it like this:</p>

<p>Start with a UINavigationController.  </p>

<p>This will allow you to use the UINavigationBar at the top in order to get your Top Menu Bar. </p>

<p>Then, create a custom UIViewController which contains a UITableView and a UIView (not controllers) and push it onto the navigation stack.  This allows you to control both views from the same controller, making interaction between them trivial.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you need to swap out the right or left views a lot and want them to be "stand-alone" then you will be better off using view controller containment as you initially thought.  This is slightly more involved, but the UIView class reference has very good documentation on how to accomplish this.</p>
