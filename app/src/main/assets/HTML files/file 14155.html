<p>If the child of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is causing the event handler to trigger, stop the bubbling up on those children.</p>

<p>With all the HTML posted, it's going to be a wild guess, but maybe this will work:</p>

<pre><code>$("a.click").children().on('click', function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); });
</code></pre>
