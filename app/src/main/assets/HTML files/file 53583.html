<p>DFS and BFS are graph traversing algorithms and not used for traversing matrix. A graph can be represented in form of an Adjacency matrix and if an algorithm talks about traversing an adjacency matrix using DFS, it actually means that it is doing so for the graph or a tree that the matrix represents. <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is an example in Java.</p>
