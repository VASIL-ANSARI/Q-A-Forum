<p>I figured out what was going on. You can have user controls in shared projects, but only if you are running Visual Studio on a Windows 8 or above PC.</p>

<p>It requires the 'Windows Phone 8 SDK' which can be downloaded standalone, but cannot be installed on Windows 7.</p>

<p>You can still do shared projects on Windows 7, just not containing XAML items.</p>
