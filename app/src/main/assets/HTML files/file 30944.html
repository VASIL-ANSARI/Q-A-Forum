<p>You need to define your model classes inside of your Data Access Layer project.  This way they will be available to both the DAL project (because they are in the project) and the MVC project (because it references the DAL project).</p>

<p>Entity Framework would take care of this but only due to the fact that the generated entity models become part of / same location as the .edmx file that EF would generate.</p>

<p>You should be able to essentially drag/drop your models folder into your DAL.  However, take care as your Namespaces will be broken and you will need to update the namespaces in each file.  Additionally, you will need to add the appropriate references anywhere in your MVC project in which you use one of your models.  For example, if your models are in the <code>Data.Models</code> namespace, you would need the following at the top of your controller:</p>

<pre><code>using Data.Models;
</code></pre>
