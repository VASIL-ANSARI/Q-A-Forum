<p>Have to looked at Python's regular expressions? Take a look at the 're' package. You can use that to search for numerical entries. You can identify the lines of interest like this (from the top of my head and not checked):</p>

<pre><code>import re
...
m = re.match(r'&amp;(\d+)', the_line)
if m:
    print 'found ', m.group(1)
    # modify it...
</code></pre>

<p>The expression matches any number of digits (the \d+ part). Not sure if &amp; is special, but if it is you can put in in square brackets.</p>

<p>Granted, You'll need similar regular expressions to capture that the line before is cost, and then capture the value. You can do that with a simple flag to signal net line is cost.</p>
