<p>Compiler adds padding to struct in order to align data in memory for performance. Size of struct will not always be adding size of its all members.</p>

<p>Add <code>#pragma pack (1)</code> at beginning of your file, and see the result. <code>#pragma pack (1)</code> will instruct compiler padding as 1 byte. </p>
