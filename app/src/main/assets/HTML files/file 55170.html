<p>Supposing the image which is being displayed at the moment is pic1 and that you have pic2, pic3, pic4 as well.
First you need to create an array in javascript containing the location of these files. Now assuming that the id of that image is "mainpic".</p>

<pre><code>var a=['pic1','pic2'....'pic4'];
var l=a.length;
var currentpic=0;
function changeright(){
    documnet.getElementById("mainpic").src=++window.currentpic%window.l;
    }
function changeleft(){
    document.getElementById("mainpic").src=abs(--window.currentpic%window.l);
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Now for the html part you need too superimpose these signs-
    &lt;> which you can do by using position:absolute and z index:-1. You can find the examples on w3school.
 It should be something like
  &lt;aaaaaaa</p>
And in css</p>

<pre><code>enter code here
     #superimpose{
 position:absolute/relative;
 top:100px//or some other value to move the text over the pic or use "left"        and "right"
  }
</code></pre>
