<blockquote>
  <p>partition2d is a string array where I need to skip the first column

<p>This is called slicing:</p>

<pre><code> for partitionCol in partitionRow[1:]:
</code></pre>

<p>the above snippet will skip the first column. </p>

<pre><code> for colDataset in dataset2d:
</code></pre>

<p>Already does what you want. There is no structure here like in C++ loops. Although you could do stuff in a very Unpythonic way:</p>

<pre><code> i=0
 for i in range(len(dataset2d)):
    print dataset2d[partitionCol][i]  
    i=+1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This is a very bad way of doing stuff.</strong> For arrays and matrices, I suggest you don't re-invent the wheel (that is also Pythonic stuff), <strong>look at <code>Numpy</code></strong>. And especially at:
