<p>I think the PHP stuff is ok.</p>

<p>But you are parsing the returned data twice and that is not necessary.</p>

<pre><code>function getVersions() {
    $.post("../Middleware/CrashManagement.php",
        { type: "GetVersions", appID: getParameterValue("id") },
        function (result) {
           // parse returned json string into a json object
           var obj = $.parseJSON(result);

           // No need to reparse this as its already done above
           //var resultData = JSON.parse(obj.RESULT);

           var resultData = obj.RESULT;
           if (resultData.actionSuccessful === true) {
               alert("hello");
           }
        })
}
</code></pre>

<p>If your prefered browser is Chrome, can I suggest that you get familiar with the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools" rel="nofollow">Chrome javascript debugger</a> </p>

<p>This would have shown you where you were going wrong in a second.</p>
