<p>The best way to accomplish this is to use JavaScript for loading the values and validation. I would use a framework to make it easier. </p>

<ul>
<li>ExtJS </li>
<li>Dojo</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
</ul>

<p>are a few of the most well known. These have form validators built in along with AJAX functionality to make your like easier.</p>
