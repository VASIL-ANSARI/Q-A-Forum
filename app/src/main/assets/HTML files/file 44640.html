<p>You should consider deriving your own class from <strong>CStatic</strong>. You should define the static control with the <strong>SS_OWNERDRAW</strong> style, so you will be able to handle its rendering in <code>CStatic::DrawItem</code>. When <code>DrawItem</code> is called, you will receive a pointer to the <code>DrawItemStruct</code>, which has embedded in it, a handle to the control's DC that you can use to render into the control. </p>

<p>I'd also suggest looking at this implementation: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9064/Yet-Another-Transparent-Static-Control" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9064/Yet-Another-Transparent-Static-Control</a></p>
