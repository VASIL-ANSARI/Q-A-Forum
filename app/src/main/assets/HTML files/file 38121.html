<p>This does not do exactly what you're asking for, but should allow you to spend quite a lot less keystrokes/mouse click.</p>

<p>If the cursor is placed after an opening angle bracket <code>&lt;</code>, you can use the shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select <em>the content of the enclosing tag</em> e.g. with the cursor anywhere on line two after the first <code>&lt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is content...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Would select the text: <code>This is content...</code>.</p>

<p>You would still have to do moving to next tag yourself.</p>
