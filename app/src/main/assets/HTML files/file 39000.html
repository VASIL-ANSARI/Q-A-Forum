<p>Using <code>fseek</code> on <code>stdout</code> is not possible. Instead, you can use the backspace character, <code>'\b'</code>, to move the cursor back one space:</p>

<pre><code>fprintf(stdout, "1,2,3,4,");

fprintf(stdout, "\b)");
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this will <em>only</em> work if <code>stdout</code> points to a terminal, and has <em>not</em> been redirected to a file or pipe. Also, if the cursor is currently at the beginning of a line, then this isn't guaranteed to work. In general, there are only a few cases where this will work.</p>
