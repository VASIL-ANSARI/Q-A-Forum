<p>Here are the logical steps to take. Add the following to the Save button's click event:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a loop to iterate over each row in table A. </li>
<li>While looping, add the row information from table A, along with the other data that must be copied, to table B.</li>
<li>Verify that the data in table B contains the information you need</li>
<li>Use a loop to iterate over each row in table A again, but this time remove each row.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
