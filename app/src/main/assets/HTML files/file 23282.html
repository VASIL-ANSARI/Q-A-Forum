<p>Use this instead :</p>

<pre><code>return (min &lt;= amount &amp;&amp; amount &lt;= max);
</code></pre>

<p>There is no shortcut. And there is a good reason the JavaScript engine can't guess your intent : what you typed was valid, it just isn't interpreted as you'd like. You were testing, in fact</p>

<pre><code>((min &lt;= amount) &lt;= max)
</code></pre>

<p>and the result of the first comparison, which is a boolean, is converted to <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> for the second one (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence" rel="nofollow">more details here about operators precedence</a>, those comparison operators are left-to-right).</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> want a shortcut, you could do this :</p>

<pre><code>Number.prototype.isin = function(m,M) {
   return m&lt;=this &amp;&amp; this&lt;=M; 
};

console.log(0.5.isin(1,2)); // logs false
console.log(3..isin(2,5));  // logs true
</code></pre>

<p>but I personally would use the standard solution with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> that everybody can read and which doesn't involve an additional function call.</p>

<p>Aside : I could have called my function <code>in</code> instead of <code>isin</code> but it might break ES3 browsers.</p>
