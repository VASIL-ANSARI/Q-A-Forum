<p>The default is <code>{}{0:t}</code> for the ShortTimePattern aka "6:22AM" as you see. To add seconds easily, just make it the LongTimePattern just by capitalizing the "T" in the same string which gives you <code>{}{0:T}</code> like;</p>

<p><code>ValueStringFormat="{}{0:T}"</code></p>

<p>and you're done, nice and easy...</p>

<p>Hope this helps, cheers.</p>
