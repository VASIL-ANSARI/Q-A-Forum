<p>Can't you do something like the following and provide the filled out form as a model to the controller and do DB-insertions from there?</p>

<p>Stripped down example;</p>

<pre><code>using (Ajax.BeginForm("Action", "Controller", new AjaxOptions()
{
    HttpMethod = "POST",
    OnBegin = "CanHaveJsFunctionsHere",
    OnComplete = "CanHaveJsFunctionsHere",
    UpdateTargetId = "transactions-results"
}))
{
    //whatever properties you want to post must be part of the model as that is what will be sent back.
}

&lt;div id="transactions-results"&gt;
    @Html.Partial("NewsFeedPartial")
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
