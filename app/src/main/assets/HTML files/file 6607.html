<p>To my knowledge, you don't retain <code>NSTimer</code> objects because they are retained by the 'system'. And by doing an <code>invalidate</code> you release it from the system.</p>

<p>Your best bet is probably to use <code>performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:</code> anyway, since this will allow you to cancel the trigger easily and you won't have to create a whole object to do it... If I understand your question correctly. To start the timer you'd do</p>

<pre><code>- (void)buttonPressed
{
    [NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:self selector:@selector(doSomething) object:nil];
    [self performSelector:@selector(doSomething) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.7];
}

- (void)doSomething
{
     NSLog(@"Something happens now!");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for the cancel is so that if you click the button again in the 0.7 second period, the 'timer' is canceled and a new one is created.</p>
