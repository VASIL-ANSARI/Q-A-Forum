<p>You need to <kbd>Shift</kbd> + Refresh, or, just clear your browser's cache.</p>

<p>This is normal behavior:</p>

<p><strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> files do not even check for a new version (an <code>If-Modified-Since</code> request) if the old version is still valid according to the cache headers in the response sent the first time.</p>

<p>I believe that if you put in any query string, even just <code>?</code>, at the end of the url (i.e., <code>Scripts/jquery-1.4.1.min.js?</code>) some browsers (Firefox at least) will change to check for a new version of the file every time like it will for images.  This could be useful during development.</p>

<p>Some developers will also append a version to the file (<code>?123</code>) so that they can cause the browser to ignore the cache completely when a new version of a web app is released.  I'm not sure how effective this is if you already have a question mark at the end, since it will be looking for an updated version anyway (again, not sure about all browsers).</p>
