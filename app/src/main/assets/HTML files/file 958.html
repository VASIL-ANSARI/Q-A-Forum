<p>The only advantage I see is a reduction of the page size, and thus a lower bandwith need.</p>

<p>Edit: As I'm being downvoted, let met explain a more my answer.</p>

<p>My point is that, using a link as an empty anchor is just a bad practice, nothing else! Of course separation of JavaScript <strong>logic</strong> from HTML is great. Of course it's easier to refactor and debug. But here, it's against the main principle of unobtrusive JavaScript: <strong>Gracefull degradation</strong>!</p>

<p>A good solution would be to have to possible call of the comments: one through a REAL link that will point to a simple page showing the comment and another which returns only the comments (in a JSON notation or similar format) with the purpose of being called through AJAX to be injected directly in the main page. </p>

<p>Doing so, the method using the AJAX method should also take care of cancelling the other call, to avoid that the user is redirected to the simple page. That would be Unobtrusive JavaScript. Here it's just JavaScript put on a misused anchor tag.</p>
