<p>In Java arrays are objects (quote from <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.3.1" rel="nofollow">Java Language Specification</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An object is a class instance or an array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in the Java version of your application the array created in the <code>foo</code> method is actually  stored on the heap, not on the stack. Therefore it can be accessed outside the <code>foo</code> method.</p>
