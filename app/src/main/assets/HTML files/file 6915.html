<p>Progress Bar is trying to print stuff to TTY so that it can show you your pretty spec progress output while it's running your tests.  I am guessing forking the process using autospec inherits STDOUT file descriptor, but can't write to it, so it throws the pipe error. </p>

<p>Try removing progress bar from RSpec helper.  Alternatively, try re-initializing progress bar plugin after fork.</p>
