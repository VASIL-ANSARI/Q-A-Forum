<p>Why do you need connection between <code>Poll</code> and <code>User</code>? That is redundant information - you can always get that data by query through <code>Options</code>. If you really want it introduce forth entity called <code>Vote</code> which will keep <code>PollId</code>, <code>UserId</code> and <code>OptionId</code>. Your application logic will have to ensure that valid combination of <code>OptionId</code> and <code>PollId</code> are used. Another way to solve this is creating composite key in <code>Option</code> consisting from <code>OptionId</code> and <code>PollId</code>. Then you will create many to many relation between <code>User</code> and <code>Option</code>. It will partially solve needs fro Poll dependency in user and it will completely remove problems with checking valid pairs of <code>OptionId</code> and <code>PollId</code>.</p>
