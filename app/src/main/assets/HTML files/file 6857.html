<p>This works for me:</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap viewCapture = null;

theViewYouWantToCapture.setDrawingCacheEnabled(true);

viewCapture = Bitmap.createBitmap(theViewYouWantToCapture.getDrawingCache());

theViewYouWantToCapture.setDrawingCacheEnabled(false);
</code></pre>

<p>I believe the view has to be visible (ie. getVisiblity() == View.VISIBLE).  If you are trying to capture it but hide it to the user at the same time, you could move it off screen or put something over it.  </p>
