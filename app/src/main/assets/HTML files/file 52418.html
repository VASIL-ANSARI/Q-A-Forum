<p>The <code>vendor</code> folder is not a resource root. A resource root is a folder where resources such as images and scripts will be served from by the web server.</p>

<p>In your case the only folder that should be marked as a resource root is probably the <code>web</code> folder, but ironically, is almost the only one you haven't selected as a resource root. Marking <code>web</code> as the resource root means that the absolute URLs <code>/css/foo.css</code> and <code>/images/foo.jpg</code> could be valid resources served by the web server; you probably want to remove all other folders from resource roots.</p>

<p>It is correct to exclude the <code>vendor</code> folder because it is not part of your first-party project code. In order for code completion to work for third-party code you must add the vendor folder as an external library. This can be done by navigating to <em>Languages &amp; Frameworks</em> > <em>PHP</em> in the options and specifying the vendor folder as an include path.</p>
