<p>JSONP works if the server you are calling on can return JSONP formatted response. Which basically means a script that calls a callback function on your page after getting loaded. 
see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONP" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONP</a></p>

<p>In your case it won't work unless the other site is willing to cooperate or you have a proxy script on your own site. </p>

<p>If you want your script to work with sites not under your control, your best bet will be to use a proxy or a iframe hack.</p>
