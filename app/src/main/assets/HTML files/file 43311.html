<p>What you are trying to do defeats the purpose of the client-server model. All validation should first be done on the client side, and any extra validation for example check if a user exists in a database should be done on the server side. </p>

<p>To answer your question you could maybe just do nothing on the client side first, send all the info to your server and on your response back do whatever you need to do on the client side again. I advise you restructure your code because this is not best practice</p>
