<p>Your associations are backwards.</p>

<p>If an Auction is created first, and then Bids are created for an auction, then your <code>Bid</code> needs an <code>auction_id</code> foreign key.</p>

<p>If a Transaction is created <em>after</em> a series of bids happen for an auction, your <code>Transaction</code> should have a foreign key <code>bid_id</code>, and does not need an <code>auction_id</code> foreign key as there is already an implicit link through the <code>bid</code>.</p>

<p>Your Rails associations would then be setup thusly:</p>

<pre><code>class Auction
  has_many :bids
end

class Bid
  belongs_to :auction
end

class Transaction
  belongs_to :bid
  has_one :auction, through: :bid
end
</code></pre>
