  <p>Am I guaranteed to have these values retrieved as such: "z1", "abc9", "abc8", "ABC1"?</p>

<p>Absolutely not. Always treat <code>Dictionary&lt;,&gt;</code> as an <em>unordered</em> collection of key/value pairs. Even though <em>as an implementation detail</em> you'll generally see them in insertion order if you only ever add values, you should <em>not</em> rely on this.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508.aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For purposes of enumeration, each item in the dictionary is treated as a <code>KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code> structure representing a value and its key. <strong>The order in which the items are returned is undefined.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>

<p>If you need a particular order, you should use a different collection - potentially in conjunction with a dictionary, if you <em>also</em> need to be able to fetch by key. (It's not entirely uncommon to maintain an <code>IList&lt;TKey&gt;</code> as well as a <code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code> for example.)</p>
