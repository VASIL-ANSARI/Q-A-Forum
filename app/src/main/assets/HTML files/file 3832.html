<p>For guidance on how to create a "List" class, take a look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. The public API will give you ideas on what sort of functionality such a type should provide. If you are interested in implementation details, you can decompile the type using a tool such as <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/" rel="nofollow">Reflector</a>. You might have some extra design work to do if the goal is slightly different, for example if by "that implements linear lists", you mean a type that represents a list-of-lists.</p>

<p>The C# programming language has no <em>direct</em> support for design-by-contract. Your best bet would be to use a design-by-contract library with tooling support, such as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd491992.aspx" rel="nofollow">Code Contracts</a>. Alternatively, you could use <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/specsharp/" rel="nofollow">Spec#</a>, which is an extension of C# that supports design-by-contract.</p>
