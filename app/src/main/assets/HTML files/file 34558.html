<p>MEF doesn't keep track of all of its created parts, so there is no such functionality built in MEF. For example, once created, the container isn't aware of any <code>NonShared</code> parts (unless the parts are <code>IDisposable</code>). <a href="http://mef.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Parts%20Lifetime" rel="nofollow">You can see here</a> under "Container and parts references" exactly which type of parts MEF keeps reference to.</p>

<p>Either way, you have other ways to achieve what you want. Since you've tagged your question <a href="/questions/tagged/prism" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;prism&#39;" rel="tag">prism</a>, you could simply use <code>IEventAggregator</code> to publish an event which all viewmodels will subscribe to and perform their logic.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could have each viewmodel's constructor add itself to a list of "dirty viewmodels" (this list can be held by another object), and then access this list when the application closes.</p>
