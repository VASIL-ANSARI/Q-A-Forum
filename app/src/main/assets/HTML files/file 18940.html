<p>You should enable remote desktop on your WebRole and connect to one of your instances. Then, try to ping the IP of your TFS server (not the hostname xyz-abcxyx-01). Maybe this is simply a DNS issue (even though using hostnames works with Windows Azure Connect).</p>

<p>If pinging the IP works, but pinging the hostname doesn't work you have a few options left:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the IP instead of the hostname. This won't work if you configured your TFS to use host headers.</li>
<li>Create an elevated startup task to modify the hosts file and map the IP to the hostname. In your code you can keep working with the hostname.</li>
<li>Try to modify the DNS server configured in your WebRole to use the default DNS server + your internal DNS server. But to me this doesn't look like a clean solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways, in each solution you'll want to store the IP/hostname in the ServiceConfiguration and make sure your code supports changes to the ServiceConfiguration. This will allow you to change the IP/hostname without having to redeploy.</p>
