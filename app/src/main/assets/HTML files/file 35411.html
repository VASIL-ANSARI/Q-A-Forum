<p>Try using union all:
The below works:</p>

<pre><code>select my_id, sum(qty) qty
from
(     
  select 1 my_id ,5 qty from dual
union all
  select 1 my_id, 5 qty from dual
)
group by my_id;
</code></pre>

<p>this is because 5 union 5 is always 5. if you do union all it includes everything irrespective of it being the same!</p>
