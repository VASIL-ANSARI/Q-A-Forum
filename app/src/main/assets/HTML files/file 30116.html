<p>Maybe you can use this sample as an initial approach: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/amontellano/hM92y/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/amontellano/hM92y/1/</a></p>

<p>Click on the || mark in the middle and move it to expand left panel.</p>

<pre><code>$('.rsh').draggable({
    axis: 'x', 
    containment: 'parent',
    helper: 'clone', 
    drag: function (event, ui) { 
        var width = ui.offset.left; 
        $(this).prev().width(width); 
    } 
});
</code></pre>

<p>It is using just div elements as containers.
Then, you should start playing and adding enhancements to this.
Hope it helps as an initial idea. You don't need any other library just jQuery UI.</p>
