<p>Two classes are generated, but only one will be re-generated (NoteEntity+CoreDataProperties.swift) if you change your model later.</p>

<p>Thanks to that new feature, you will be able to add some methods or even attributes on the NoteEntity.swift class. And they won't be erased by a new generation of your model !</p>

<p>Before that feature, we had to create our own category to do so.</p>

<p>It is also even more better than before considering this :
You have two classes; Message and Comment (which is a subclass of Message).
Before that, if you had a category on Message and Comment, and needed to use methods inside these two categories, you would have to include these two class.
But now, you'll just have to include Comment.swift, which include the category (because it's kinda category) Message.swift :)</p>
