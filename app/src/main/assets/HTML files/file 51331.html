<p>Your question is a little unclear, but I'll go for it.</p>

<p>You are certainly allowed to have a method in the Program class, though typically you wouldn't for any program beyond a test or homework.</p>

<p>The two lines <em>do not</em> accomplish the same thing. Let's compare what they do:</p>

<pre><code>employeename emp1 = new employeename("Joe");
</code></pre>

<p>This line creates a new variable emp1 with a new employeename object. This variable is in scope only in the main function. The next line calls the InstanceEqual method:</p>

<pre><code>public void InstanceEqual()
{
    string name = "Unnikrishnan";
    employeename emp1 = new employeename(name);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The method creates a new variable called emp1 that is in scope only in the <code>InstanceEqual</code> method. Once the <code>InstanceEqual</code> method is finished, it returns control to <code>main()</code> and you no longer can access the emp1 that you created in the <code>InstanceEqual</code> method.</p>

<p>If you want to accomplish the same thing, you mush <em>return</em> that value you created. A different version to accomplish the same thing would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>namespace trial1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Program p = new Program();
            employeename emp1 = new employeename("Joe");
            employeename emp2 = p.InstanceEqual();
        }
        public employeename InstanceEqual()
        {
            string name = "Unnikrishnan";
            employeename emp2 = new employeename(name);
            return emp2;
        }
    }
    public class employeename
    {
        string _name;
        public employeename(string name)
        {
            _name = name;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
