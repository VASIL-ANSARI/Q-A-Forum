<p>So you're trying to get all posts that don't have a meta key equal to "develop"?</p>

<p>You could do this:</p>

<pre><code>$query = new WP_Query( array( 
    'meta_key' =&gt; 'develop',
    'meta_compare' =&gt; 'NOT EXISTS' 
) );
</code></pre>

<p>Also, see this note from the Codex if you're using a version of Wordpress less than 3.9:</p>

<p>"(Note: Due to bug #23268, value is required for NOT EXISTS comparisons to work correctly prior to 3.9. You must supply some string for the value parameter. An empty string or NULL will NOT work. However, any other string will do the trick and will NOT show up in your SQL when using NOT EXISTS. Need inspiration? How about 'bug #23268'.)"</p>
