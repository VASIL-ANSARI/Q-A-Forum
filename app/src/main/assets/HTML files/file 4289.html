<p>Well I just used this answer for another related question, you can isolate a specific colour, with a fuzz factor and save that to another channel.  On the command line you do it like so:</p>

<pre><code>convert original.png -matte ( +clone -fuzz 5% -transparent #00ffff ) -compose DstOut -composite yellow-channel.png
</code></pre>

<p>Remembering that the brackets need escaping in bash, <code>\( \)</code>.</p>

<p>How this could be converted in to a sequence of IMagick commands, I'm not totally sure as I never use it.  I know you need to take the original image, make a clone, perform the transparency operation with fuzz and then use <code>compositeImage()</code> with the <code>DstOut</code> operator.  I dare say that would rely on the <code>paintTransparentImage()</code> function again though.  Indeed the command-line version will no doubt need that feature compiled in to the ImageMagick version in use.</p>
