<p>You have two options.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do a discovery and see if it shows up in the results (i.e. do you get an ACTION_FOUND for it).  I think this is a bad idea because it is very resource intensive in that the Bluetooth radio can't really do anything else and it consumes a lot of spectrum since it has to broadcast on all channels.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to connect to it, e.g. do a socket connect to a known UUID.  If the device is no longer around the connect will fail in about 5 seconds (which is about a third what it takes to complete a discovery).  If the device is around, and you were recently connected to it (so your Bluetooth radio knows knows its clock offset) then you will connect to it quite quickly. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For implementing #2, this is the method I had in mind:

<p>And here is some code for using it:
