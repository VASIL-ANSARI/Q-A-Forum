<p>You haven't told nginx what to do with .php files. Assuming you're using php-fpm, you'll need something like this:</p>

<pre><code>server {
  listen       80;
  server_name mydomain.com;

  root /home/somedir;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  location /deploy {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    try_files $uri =404;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
    include fastcgi_params;
  }
}
</code></pre>
