<p>Is it okay that your definition of cuboids depends on your initial choice of basis?</p>

<p>If all cuboids begin at the origin and then move into the positive direction of each axis, then is the intersection not just the minimum of all the co-ordinates in each direction?  i.e. intersection = min(left1, left2), min(right1, right2), etc.  Not sure I understand exactly what your cuboids are, or what you want them to be.</p>

<p>Alternatively if your cuboids are aligned in each direction (as it looks like they are from your definition), then you can take the new cuboid to have:</p>

<pre><code>bottom = max(bottom1, bottom2)
top = min(top1, top2)
left = right_most(left1, left2)
</code></pre>

<p>etc...</p>
