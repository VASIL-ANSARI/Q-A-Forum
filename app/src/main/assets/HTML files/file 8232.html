<p>You need to use your <code>GridBagConstraints</code>' <code>anchor</code> property.  This should do it for you:</p>

<pre><code>frame.setLayout(new GridBagLayout());
GridBagConstraints gbc = new GridBagConstraints();
gbc.anchor = GridBagConstraints.NORTHWEST;
frame.add(panel, gbc);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not guaranteeing that you won't have to set other properties of the constraints object to get the layout you desire.  In particular, you may need to set <code>widthx</code> and <code>widthy</code> to be <code>1</code> so that the panel takes up all of the available space given to it.</p>
