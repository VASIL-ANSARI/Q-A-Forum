<p>Cribbing from another answer, <a href="http://www.reigndesign.com/blog/using-your-own-sqlite-database-in-android-applications/" rel="nofollow">this example</a> shows one quick and dirty way to solve your problem.</p>

<p>As an additional point, some of your code may be simplified as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public float sumProteins(String[] items) {
    float sum = .0f;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {
        Cursor c = database.rawQuery(
                "select SUM(food_protein) from food where food_name='"
                        + items[i] + "'", null);
        if (c.moveToFirst()) {
            sum += c.getFloat(0);
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could further improve the code by building a query string like <code>select SUM(food_protein ) from food where food_name=items[0] OR food_name=items[1] OR ...</code> so you only need to perform a single query.</p>

<p>Also, it's <code>carbs</code> not <code>crabs</code>!</p>
