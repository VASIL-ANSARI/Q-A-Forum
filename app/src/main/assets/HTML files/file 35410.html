<p>Basically you want the owner to be set on creation and not on subsequent updates. For this I think you should set the owner in the POST view. I think it is more logical and robust that way. Update is done via PUT view so your data should always be correct since no way on updation the owner can be changed if the owner is not editable on PUT.</p>

<p>For making the views you can use DRF's generic class based views. Use the RetrieveUpdateDeleteView as it is. For ListCreateView override the post method. Use a django model form for validating the data and creating an account instance.</p>

<p>You will have to copy the request.DATA dict and insert 'owner' as the current user. </p>

<p>The code for the POST method can be:</p>

<pre><code>def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    data = deepcopy(request.DATA)
    data['owner'] = request.user
    form = AccountForm(data=data)
    if form.is_valid():
        instance = form.save(commit=false)
        instance.save()
        return Response(dict(id=instance.pk), status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
    return Response(form.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
</code></pre>
