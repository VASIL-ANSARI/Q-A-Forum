<p>Below is a basic threading sample. It will spawn 20 threads; each thread will output its thread number. Run it and observe the order in which they print.</p>

<pre><code>import threading
class Foo (threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self,x):
        self.__x = x
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
    def run (self):
          print str(self.__x)

for x in xrange(20):
    Foo(x).start()
</code></pre>

<p>As you have hinted at Python threads are implemented through time-slicing. This is how they get the "parallel" effect. </p>

<p>In my example my Foo class extends thread, I then implement the <code>run</code> method, which is where the code that you would like to run in a thread goes. To start the thread you call <code>start()</code> on the thread object, which will automatically invoke the <code>run</code> method...</p>

<p>Of course, this is just the very basics. You will eventually want to learn about semaphores, mutexes, and locks for thread synchronization and message passing.</p>
