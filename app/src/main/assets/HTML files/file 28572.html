<p>It will be very helpful if you can post a plot that you wish to make. But based on my understanding, you just want to do something to the colorbar at one or more particular spot. That is easy, the following cases shows a example of writing a text string at 0.5.</p>

<pre><code>x1=np.random.random(1000)
x2=np.random.random(1000)
x3=np.random.random(1000)
plt.scatter(x1, x2, c=x3, marker='+')
cb=plt.colorbar()
color_norm=lambda x: (x-cb.vmin)/(cb.vmax-cb.vmin)
cb.ax.text(0.5, color_norm(0.5), 'Do something.\nRight here', color='r')
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to have value 0.5 at exactly 1/3 height of the colorbar, you need to adjust the colorbar limit using <code>cb.set_clim((cmin, cmax))</code> method. There will be infinite possible <code>(cmin, cmax)</code> fit your need so additional constrains are necessary, such as keeping the min constant or keeping the max constant or keeping the max-min constant.</p>
