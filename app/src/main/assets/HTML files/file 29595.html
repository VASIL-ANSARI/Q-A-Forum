<p>DmozSpider should inherit from BaseSpider (or Spider, depends on your scrapy version). So, make a following change in your code:</p>

<pre><code>from scrapy.spider import BaseSpider

class DmozSpider(BaseSpider):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>I tried that by myself and when spider class inherits from object that KeyError is raised.</p>
