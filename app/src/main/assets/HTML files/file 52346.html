<p>The compiler doesn't know the type of the contents of <code>NSMutableArray</code> and the mutable collection types <code>NSMutableArray</code> and <code>NSMutableDictionary</code> cannot be implicitly bridged to Swift.</p>

<p>Since the contents of the array seem to be <code>NSValue</code> objects consider to declare <code>leftOvers</code> as a native Swift type. Using the <code>var</code> keyword you get mutability for free.</p>

<pre><code>var leftOvers : [NSValue]!
</code></pre>

<p>In many cases â in particular for concrete objects like data source arrays â the array is supposed to be declared as non-optional</p>

<pre><code>var leftOvers = [NSValue]()
</code></pre>
