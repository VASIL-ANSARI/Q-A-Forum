<p>Most probably you change your collection during iteration. To avoid crash you can copy keys and iterate with them as shown in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6686515/collection-was-mutated-while-being-enumerated-uitableview">this post</a> or use methods suggested by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Collections/Articles/Enumerators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000135-SW2" rel="nofollow">apple</a>. I think the simplest method is to copy collection before iterate. </p>
