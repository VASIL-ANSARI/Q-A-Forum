<p>Standard C++ has the <strong><code>__LINE__</code></strong> macro.</p>

<p>That is, <code>__LINE__</code> is a "C++ construct", as requested, in contrast to <code>__COUNTER__</code>, which isn't.</p>

<p><code>__LINE__</code> differs from Visual C++&rsquo;s <code>__COUNTER__</code> in that at least earlier versions of Visual C++ produced garbled expansions of <code>__LINE__</code> when a certain compilation option was used.</p>

<hr>

<p>Depeneding on your needs you may however be able to simply use <code>type_info</code> instances for identification. C++11 added general support for comparing <code>type_info</code>, called <strong><code>std::typeindex</code></strong>. This means you can use standard collections.</p>
