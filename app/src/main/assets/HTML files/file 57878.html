<p>Yes, this is possible and probably the easiest most common way to scale out your application servers.  Unlike IPC, it can work across hosts over a network.  (It will also work locally if you want it to... but do make sure you actually are CPU-bound in your application.  Despite JavaScript itself being single-threaded, most of the libraries for IO and some NPM modules use thread pools.)</p>

<p>There's no reason to use Node.js as the server load balancing between the backend servers.  Node.js is better for your application server.  For something just proxying HTTP requests, I'd use Nginx or similar.  Nginx can efficiently handle all the dealing with the client, and can be easily configured to load balance.</p>
