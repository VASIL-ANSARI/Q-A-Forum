<p>Yes I'd say the best fallback is raw jdbc or even Oracle PL/SQL functions (or equivalents).</p>

<p>For sure it's much easier to understand a special call to raw jdbc than some very complicated java code to extend Hibernate.</p>

<p>I worked on a project in which the "Architect" used a lot of custom annotations and modified Hibernate to support his idea of a "perfect" ORM... Ultimately he was fired and all the crap removed because nobody else was able to make it work.</p>
