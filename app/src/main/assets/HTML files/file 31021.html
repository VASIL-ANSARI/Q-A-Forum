<p>You should use raw string literals for file paths on Windows (note <code>r</code> before the double quote):</p>

<pre><code>leftImage = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open(r"C:\Users\usr\Desktop\left.png"))
rightImage = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open(r"C:\Users\usr\Desktop\right.png"))
</code></pre>

<p>It worked differently for the rightImage because <code>\r</code> is a special character (yes, it's <em>one character</em>, not two) - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return" rel="nofollow">carriage return</a>.</p>

<p>To quote a great man (and Python documentation):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The backslash (\) character is used to escape characters that
  otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself,
  or the quote character. String literals may optionally be prefixed
  with a letter "r" or "R"; such strings are called raw strings and use
  different rules for interpreting backslash escape sequences.</p>
