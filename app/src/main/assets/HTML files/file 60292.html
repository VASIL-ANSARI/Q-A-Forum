<p>sets are unordered collections by design. If you want a collection of items that retain order, consider using a list, instead. Lists have <code>insert</code> and <code>append</code> methods available to you.</p>

<pre><code>my_list = []
for item in some_iterable:
    my_list.append(item)
</code></pre>
