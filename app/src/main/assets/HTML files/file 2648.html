<p>It looks like you want a left-rotate?  That shouldn't be very difficult.  Just dequeue the first <code>k</code> elements, shift the remaining <code>n-k</code> elements to the left (possibly by putting them at the beginning of a temporary array), and then add in the first <code>k</code> at the end in order.</p>

<p>To modify your code in this manner might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>void move (int a[100], unsigned n, unsigned k) {
        int t[100];
        unsigned i;
        for (i=k; i&lt;=n-1; i++) t[i-k]=a[i];
        for (int x=0; x&lt;=k-1; x++) t[i++-k]=a[x];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And since this is still ugly, you might rewrite it to make the logic more clear, but I will leave that as an exercise.</p>

<p>This also assumes you are not allowed to use STL data structures; if that is not the case, see Jerry Coffin's answer.</p>
