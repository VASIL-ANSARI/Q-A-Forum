<p>Yes, but it quickly gets ugly coding it.  However, pick up the package <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses" rel="nofollow">ncurses</a> and all will become clear.</p>

<p>Basically, the trick is that you must set the terminal device to "raw" mode so you can get the special key sequences directly in your program, then have to interpret them -- they tend to be things like "<code>&lt;ESC&gt;33;5A</code>".  Then you need to emit the control sequences that move you around on the screen, and all of these things are device dependent so xterm may differ from gterm and so on.</p>

<p><em>ncurses(3)</em> already hides all that stuff.</p>
