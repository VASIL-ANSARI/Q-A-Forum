<p>No, it is not easy.  At a bare minimum, you'll need to find where the screen resolution is selected and change it to provide the new resolution.  If you're lucky, that's the only change you'll need to make; more likely, assumptions about the resolution are scattered throughout the code (buffer sizes, UI locations, etc.) and any pre-rendered graphics.</p>
