<pre><code>$todayParts = getdate();    
$startToday = mktime(0, 0, 0, $todayParts['mon'], $todayParts['mday'], $todayParts['year']);
$sevebDaysFromNow = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
$seventhStart = $startToday + $sevebDaysFromNow;
$seventhEnd = $seventhStart + 60 * 60 * 24;
$sql = "SELECT * FROM &lt;table&gt; WHERE the_date BETWEEN $seventhStart AND $seventEnd";
</code></pre>

<p>This will calculate 7 days from the start of the day you are now. Hope this helps</p>
