<p>Perhaps using <code>NOT EXISTS</code>?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT tbl2.id, tbl2.customer, count
FROM tbl1
INNER JOIN tbl2
    ON tbl2.id = tbl1.id

UNION ALL

SELECT id, costumer, NULL AS 'count'
FROM tbl1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM tbl2
        WHERE tbl2.id = tbl1.id
        );
</code></pre>

<p>Even tho I don't see a reason not to use <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, that's the purpose of it.</p>
