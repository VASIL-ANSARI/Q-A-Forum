<p>Ok I have this working now. The problem was with my HTML. After taking a step back from thinking the JS or PHP was the problem, I concluded that HTML might be the issue here. Using a tool like <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" rel="nofollow">https://validator.w3.org/</a> to look at the HTML identified a few issues and once corrected, the form works as expected.</p>

<p>The first problem was I had multiple <code>id</code> fields (which are not required anyway) and the fields were not unique - which is required if using <code>id</code>. </p>

<p>Second, issue was an extra <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> causing a formatting issue.</p>

<p>Third, I changed my JS extra location div from <code>class="hidden"</code> to <code>style="display:none"</code>. </p>
