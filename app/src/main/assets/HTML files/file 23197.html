<p>I am assuming that you made sure that you are getting <code>newX, newY</code> values in onTouch(). 
I feel that your aim is to <strong>edit</strong> the Layout parameters but instead of doing that what you are doing is, you are assigning a <strong>new</strong> set of parameters with width and height as <code>LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT</code> and then setting the margins. </p>

<p>You might try to first get the existing parameters as follows:</p>

<pre><code>LinearLayout.LayoutParams params =
 ( LinearLayout.LayoutParams) img.getLayoutParams();
</code></pre>

<p>Then change the margin:</p>

<pre><code>params.setMargins(newX, newY, 0, 0);
img.setLayoutParams(params);
</code></pre>

<p>Try it and notify if it helps. If not then we can talk further. </p>
