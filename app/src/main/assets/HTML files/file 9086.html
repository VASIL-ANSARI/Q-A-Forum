<p>The last 2 queries do not give any result because they contain contradicting conditions - story must have the word "bananas" and must not have the word "bananas". This is not possible and hence no results.</p>

<p>However the first query means that "bananas" must be present but no "banana".</p>

<p>Also, you may use * with the minus operator.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
