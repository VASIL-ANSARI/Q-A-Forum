<p>Did you write the request to the socket using fwrite/fputs?  Also, judging by the length of that response, you may need to read more than 1024 bytes from the stream.  That's getting awfully close.</p>

<p>You may want to read the response in a loop:</p>

<pre><code>$resp = '';
while (!feof($fp)) {
    $resp .= stream_get_contents($fp, 1024);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can separate the headers from the body using:</p>

<pre><code>list($headers, $response) = explode("\r\n\r\n", 2);
</code></pre>
