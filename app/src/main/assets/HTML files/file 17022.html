<p>I assume you mean something similar to the python interpreter. The reason there is not equivalent in Java is because Java needs to be compiled to bytecode before it can be executed.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something with good auto-complete capabilities. I would recommend eclipse or netbeans. They also compile your application automatically, allowing you to quickly run your code once you are done writing it.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
