<p>You script is using syntax from JQuery, add the following between your <code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> tags:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code will work as expected after you do this (though the effect looks kinda weird with the images used by the script).</p>

<p>Also, as this question is related to JQuery, you should add that tag to your question.</p>
