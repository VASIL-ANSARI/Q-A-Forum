<p>It is fine if an aggregate root has a reference to an other aggregate root. The idea is that you are not allowed to reference to parts of other aggregates.</p>

<p>What you want to do is not easily possible. Someone needs to know which Guid to put into CountryId-column. If your application can't answer that question, nobody can.</p>

<p>What you might try is to have a class that will contain the mapping between the country and the person:</p>

<pre><code>public class CountryToPersonMapping
{
    public Guid Find(Person entity)
    {
    }

    public void AddMapping(Person person, Country country)
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then find a way to pass the instance of this class to a custom type in NHibernate to set the correct column. Probably using a service locator.</p>
