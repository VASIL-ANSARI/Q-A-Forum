<p>I'm not really clear on why this became an issue on my XAMPP installation, since I'm also running PHP 5.3.x on the server's local box and wasn't experiencing those issues there. However, it has to do with my mySQL server running in "old password" encryption mode. Newer versions of PHP won't allow those kinds of connections, so you need to update your mySQL server to use the newer password encryption. Here are the steps, assuming you have control over the mySQL server. If you don't, that falls out of the scope of my knowledge.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>locate the configuration file for the mysql server called <code>my.cnf</code>. I found mine at <code>/etc/my.cnf</code>. You can edit it with <code>sudo nano /etc/my.cnf</code></p></li>
<li><p>Look for a line that says <code>old_passwords=1</code> and change that to <code>old_passwords=0</code>. You have now told the server that the next time it is run, and it is asked to encrypt a password using the PASSWORD() command, it use the new 41-character encryption rather than the 16-character 'old' style encryption</p></li>
<li><p>Now you have to restart your mysql server / service. YMMV, but on Fedora that was easily done with <code>sudo service mysqld restart</code>. Check your OS' instructions for restarting the mysql daemon or service</p></li>
<li><p>Now we have to actually edit our <code>user</code> table within mysql. So open up an interactive shell to mysql (on the server you can type <code>mysql -uYourRootUsername -pYourRootPassword</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Change to the <code>mysql</code> database. This is the database that holds all the good stuff for server operation and authentication. You must have root access to work with this database. If you get an 'access denied' you're SOL. Sorry. <code>use mysql;</code> will switch to that database</p></li>
<li><p>Now we want to update the user that was giving you grief. Ultimately you'll probably want to update all your users, but for now, we're just focusing on the user that threw the error. <code>update user set Password=password('YOUR_PASSWORD') where User='YOUR_USERNAME';</code></p></li>
<li><p>Now you just need to tell mysql to use the new password for authentication when that user attempts to connect. <code>flush privileges;</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You should be good to go!</p>
