<p>Yes it is. But I am afriad, how much time will your tests take. You must fix your tests to not depend on server startup and shutdown. Its fine to run tests inside container, but container should be started once before tests.</p>

<p>Well to answer your question, you can execute the relevant <code>.sh</code> or <code>.bat</code> files from Java using system calls. Something like below,</p>

<pre><code>Runtime r = Runtime.getRuntime();
Process p = r.exec("start.sh");
p.waitFor();
</code></pre>
