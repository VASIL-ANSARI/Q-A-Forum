<p>This is what I would do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the result using <code>createQuery</code> or <code>createNativeQuery</code></li>
<li>Run the query from simple php script outside of symfony</li>
</ol>

<p>If with all 3 methods you get the same issue then it might be problem with the size of data limitation. 
I would start with <code>max_execution_time</code> and <code>memory_limit</code> settings in php.ini</p>

<p>I found also some oracle limitations that might be set at:
oci8.statement_cache_size in php.ini or in file oraaccess.xml in Oracle directory. It is also significant if you use APC for query caching.</p>

<p>Anyway what does app_dev.php say?</p>
