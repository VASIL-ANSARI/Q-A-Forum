<p>In Ruby, unless you use an explicit <code>return</code> statement elsewhere in your method, the last line executed in your method is what's returned.  Maybe the complexity is getting lost in your simpler example, but: can you store the result of <code>terminate</code> in a variable and return that? </p>

<pre><code>def other_method
  data = "cow"
  result = terminate data
  data = "fox"
  result
end
</code></pre>
