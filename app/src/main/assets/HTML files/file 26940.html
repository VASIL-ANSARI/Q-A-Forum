<p>The Javascript Date API can have somewhat mixed results between browsers, as you've discovered.</p>

<p>The best option I can suggest is to use one of the third-party libraries that are available for this. There are two I can recommend  --  either <a href="http://momentjs.com/">Moment.js</a> or <a href="http://www.datejs.com/">Date.js</a>.</p>

<p>Both of these libs have much better validation and parsing, and are more consistent cross-browser than the built-in Date class.</p>
