<p>In google maps or in the component you use for managing event check if the z-index of the Department is more high of that related to Arrondissment  .. otherwise  the mouse hover event in managed form the wrong polygon .. if you need you can change dinamically  by setOption or a similar based on your need .. </p>

<pre><code> yourPolygonObj.setOptions({ zIndex: 200 });
</code></pre>
