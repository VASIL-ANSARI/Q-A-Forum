<p>The redirect from <code>/#/about/clients</code> to <code>/about/clients</code> sounds reasonable, but applying the reverse could cause problems - if your Flash detection doesn't work correctly (perhaps Flash is blocked etc.) then you may send the user into an infinite redirect loop.</p>

<p>Personally, I would recommend that non-hash links always load their content as expected, in a static manner.  If the user then navigates, you may either end up with a URL like <code>/about/clients#/</code> (if they went to the home page) (this shouldn't be an issue as crawlers will never end up visiting them this way) or you can have them redirect to <code>/</code> next time they navigate.</p>

<p>IMHO, I'd say that a pure JavaScript solution to the hash problem would be easier to manage as there are already many good examples of this.</p>

<p>Also consider using <code>#!</code> instead of <code>#</code> - this 'hash-bang' technique is being pushed by Google as a way of identifying to search engines that your hash is important and that its contents differ from what you would see without the hash part.  Google can already point to <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/jump-to-information-you-want-right-from.html" rel="nofollow">specific parts of a page using <code>#</code></a> and if you follow the hash-bang technique on the client and server-side, it will be able to index your AJAX/Flash links just like regular links (<a href="http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html" rel="nofollow">see the implementation details and the requirements you need to fulfill</a>).</p>
