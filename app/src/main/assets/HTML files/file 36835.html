<p>Hmm.. hard to answer without knowing the context. Who is providing that CachedRowSet? They might or might not offer a way to generate a new instance. Are you using CachedRowSetImpl from the RI?</p>

<p>The RowSet is not really intended for that. Can you add it to the generating SQL?  <code>SELECT a,b,'additional' from ...</code>. Or you can use your CachedRowSet and generate JoinedRowSet with a FULL_JOIN with a single field result set. </p>
