<p>To answer the question in your last paragraph: The standard way for distributing binaries (specially ones that depend on shared objects), is using your target distribution's package management system (dpkg, rpm, or both). These package formats will require the system to have the dependencies installed (libconfig++, in your case). And if not, the user can use apt/yum to automatically download and install them.</p>
