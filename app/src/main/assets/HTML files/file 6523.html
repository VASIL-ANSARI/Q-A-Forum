<p>I think you need to do it in pieces.</p>

<p>you can do selectnodes of document for body or html as follows</p>

<pre><code>doc.DocumentNode.SelectSingleNode("//body") // returns body with entire contents :)
</code></pre>

<p>then you can check for null values for criteria and if that is provided, you can take the string as it is. </p>

<p>Hope it helps :)</p>
