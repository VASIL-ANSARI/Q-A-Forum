<p>There are several possibilities for this failure. One is security, meaning that PUT header is being blocked:</p>

<p>Does your web server allow PUT headers? Try this:</p>

<pre><code>...    
 &lt;security&gt;
            &lt;requestFiltering&gt;
                &lt;verbs&gt;
                    &lt;add verb="PUT" allowed="true" /&gt;
                &lt;/verbs&gt;
            &lt;/requestFiltering&gt;
        &lt;/security&gt;
    &lt;/system.webServer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The other possibility is that your test is being subject to CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) and you may need to enable it in MVC. I have personally not done this MVC but only WebApi. I hope this link can help you:</p>
