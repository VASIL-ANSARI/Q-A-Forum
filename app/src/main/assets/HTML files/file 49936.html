<p>It's possible to use <code>static const int</code> member as an array size, but you'll have to define this member within class in your .hpp file like so:</p>

<pre><code>class foo
{
public:

    static const int nmConst = 10;
    int arr[nmConst];

};
</code></pre>

<p>This will work.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> About the logic behind it, I believe compiler wants to know size of the array member as soon as it encounters class declaration. If you leave <code>static const int</code> member undefined within the class, compiler will understand that you're trying to define variable-length array and report an error (it won't wait to see if you actually defined <code>nmconst</code> someplace).</p>
