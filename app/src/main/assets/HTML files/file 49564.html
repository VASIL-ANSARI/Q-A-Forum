<p>When you use <code>layout_heightPercent</code>, you are asking for a percentage of the space allotted to the <code>PercentFrameLayout</code> - i.e., if the <code>PercentFrameLayout</code> had a height of <code>100dp</code>, a child view with a <code>layout_heightPercent="12%"</code> would be given <code>12dp</code>. As your <code>PercentFrameLayout</code> has no other children and is <code>wrap_content</code>, there's no clear indication what 12% of an unspecified value is, leading to no space being allocated at all.</p>

<p>If you're trying to set the size of the view as a percentage of the total screen size or of the total visible height available to the <code>RecyclerView</code>, you'll have to do that elsewhere, ideally as a subclass of <code>LinearLayoutManager</code> as that is what is controlling the height of individual elements.</p>
