<p>The problem is that you are creating a window:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>... but you forgot to stop the storyboard from <em>also</em> creating a window! If you are going to create a window manually like this, you should delete the storyboard and set the <em>Info.plist</em> so that it has no main storyboard setting. You cannot <em>both</em> create a window manually <em>and</em> use the storyboard - you've created an inner conflict in the structure of the app.</p>
