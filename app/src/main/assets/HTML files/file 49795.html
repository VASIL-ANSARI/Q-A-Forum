<p>The <code>[33m</code> is not a time duration; it's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code" rel="nofollow">ANSI color code</a> and it's how RSpec prints its output in color.  RSpec is meant to sense that output isn't going to a TTY and disable the color for this case but it appears that's not working.  You can pass <code>--no-color</code> to manually disable it, though.</p>
