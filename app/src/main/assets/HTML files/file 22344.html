<p>I believe there is a "check gac first" rule for DotNet dependency resolution.</p>

<p>So I do my references like this.</p>

<pre><code>\MySolution.sln
\BALLayer\Biz.csproj
\DALLayer\Data.csproj
\PresLayer\MyWebsite.csproj
\ThirdPartyReferences\
\ThirdPartyReferences\SuperCoolDll111.dll
\ThirdPartyReferences\SuperCoolDll222.dll
\ThirdPartyReferences\SuperCoolDll333.dll
</code></pre>

<p>This way, all csprojects reference the needed dll(s) with a relative path.
All cs projects reference the SAME dll.</p>

<p>This has helped me avoid the "I'm gonna look in the GAC no matter what you want me to do" issue.</p>

<p>Nuget does this similarly.</p>

<pre><code>\packages\
\packages\repositories.config
\packages\SomeLibrary\SomeDll.dll
\packages\SomeLibrary\MyNugetDll.dll
</code></pre>

<p>and cs projects reference the same .dll with a relative path.</p>

<p>............</p>

<p>Footnote:
Open up your .csproj file(s) in notepad, and look for the HintPath.
Mine always say something like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Reference Include="MyNugetDll.dll&gt;
  &lt;SpecificVersion&gt;False&lt;/SpecificVersion&gt;
  &lt;HintPath&gt;..\packages\SomeLibrary\MyNugetDll.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt;
&lt;/Reference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Reference Include="SuperCoolDll333.dll&gt;
  &lt;SpecificVersion&gt;False&lt;/SpecificVersion&gt;
  &lt;HintPath&gt;..\ThirdPartyReferences\SuperCoolDll333.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt;
&lt;/Reference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>.........</p>

<p>But I think the crux of your issue is "copy local" and the "gac first" rule.</p>

<p>.........</p>

<p>PS</p>

<p>Here is another question that discusses the order...better than I could.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49972/in-what-order-are-locations-searched-to-load-referenced-dlls">In what order are locations searched to load referenced DLLs?</a></p>

<p>EDIT::::</p>

<p>So lessons learned:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have your third party references checked into source control, and the build machine says "i cannot find xyz.dll", then make sure that dll is actually in source control.  There are alot of "voodoo" paths on (the local development) machine with visual studio installed, and subsequently will NOT be on the "build machine".  </p></li>
<li><p>If you use nuget and you check in your dlls, make sure they are all checked in.  You might add a new entry to the packages.config and then forget to put the actual dll(s) into source control.  </p></li>
<li><p>There are some ways to use nuget that you only put the packages.config in source control, and not the third party dlls.  Check the comments of this post for articles about that.</p></li>
