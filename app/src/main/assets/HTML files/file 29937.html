<p>The most general way is to start with your query and then unpivot using separate logic:</p>

<pre><code>select (case when n = 1 then 'Quality' else 'Speed' end) as Assessment,
       (case when n = 1 then avg_quality else avg_speed end) as Value
from (select AVG(r.quality) as avg_quality, AVG(r.speed) as avg_speed
      from reading_assestment r join
           people p
           on r.person_id =p.person_id
      where person_id = 3
     ) t cross join
     (select 1 as n union all select 2) n
</code></pre>
