<p>My first thought is to add an extra column to Dictionary which references a primary word. The two tables might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Language
--------
language_id
name

Dictionary
----------
id
word
language_id
primary_id
</code></pre>

<p>If the primary word is in English, it would have a primary_id of null. Each successive language added would then set primary_id to the id of the English word.</p>

<pre><code>language_id | name
-----------   ----
201         | English
202         | Spanish

id | word    | language_id | primary_id
--   ----      -----------   ----------
1  | hello   | 201         | null
2  | goodbye | 201         | null
3  | hola    | 202         | 1
4  | adios   | 202         | 2
</code></pre>
