<p>To get a random element from array:</p>

<pre><code>function randChoice(array){
    return array[Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length)];
};
</code></pre>

<p>There are 2 method to generate a mesh from random points that I know of:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull" rel="nofollow">convex hull</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/alpha-shape" rel="nofollow">alpha shape</a>. Creating a mesh by repeating picking 3 random points would almost surely result in spaghetti. </p>

<p>If you just want to generate terrain like in the picture, there is <a href="http://www.chadvernon.com/blog/resources/directx9/terrain-generation-with-a-heightmap/" rel="nofollow">terrain generation from heightmap</a>. </p>
