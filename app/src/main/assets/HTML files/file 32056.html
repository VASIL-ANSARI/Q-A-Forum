<p>Oke you can add a zul page to an other zul page by doing this :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?component name="details" macro-uri="../folder/myzul.zul" inline="true"?&gt;
&lt;window&gt;
...
&lt;details/&gt;
...
&lt;/window&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the code to handle that part is in your MVVM of the main zul page.  So if you do in the details an <code>@bind(vm.list)</code> you will need to have an <code>getList</code> and <code>setList</code> in your viewmodel.</p>

<p>Mine trick is that I write interfaces for those specific pages (you can implement multiple interfaces so multiple components are possible that way).</p>

<p>By that I know I will not forget any getter or setter that I need and they will remember me also on what variables I need to declare.</p>

<p>The visibility you can do with :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tab label="tab2" visible=@load(vm.tab2Visible)/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this can help you. </p>
