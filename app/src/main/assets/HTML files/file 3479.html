<p>Does your stored procedure return a simple (that is to say <em>scalar</em>) value?  If so, the designer <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb896231.aspx">will not generate the code for you</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the Return Type is set to a simple
  type, Visual Basic or C# is not
  automatically generated for the
  Function Import.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this has been fixed <a href="http://www.danrigsby.com/blog/index.php/2009/05/20/entity-framework-40-scalar-and-void-functions/">in the newest version of the Entity Framework</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can select the None and Scalar
  return types as you could before. 
  However, when the âFunction Importâ is
  created, some new code is injected
  into the Model code behind file that
  materializes the stored procedure into
  an operation on the ObjectContext
  itself.</p>
