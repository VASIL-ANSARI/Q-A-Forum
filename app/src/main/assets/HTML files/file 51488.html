<p>Intent flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP should produce the desired behavior.  The <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/tasks-and-back-stack.html" rel="nofollow">documentation for Tasks and Back Stack</a> says this in the section for Using Intent Flags:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the launch mode of the designated activity is "standard", it too is
  removed from the stack and a new instance is launched in its place to
  handle the incoming intent. That's because a new instance is always
  created for a new intent when the launch mode is "standard".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP" rel="nofollow">documentation for FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</a> describes the same behavior in more detail.</p>
