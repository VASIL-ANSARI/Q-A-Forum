<p>Figured out how to do this. Makes Squish totally unnecessary, but it requires source code access.</p>

<p>In your test class, store a pointer to the QApplication and any widgets you want to test. For ease of use, store a pointer to your application's QMainWindow. Then, either instantiate your test class with pointers to the widgets you plan on testing, or use window->findChild() to grab any element you need. Keep in mind that you will need to call app->processEvents() after everything. Call it after showing the widget so that all of the child widgets appear. Call it after interacting with a widget so that the interaction is actually processed on the GUI. If you need things to be slow enough to watch, use QTest::qSleep().</p>
