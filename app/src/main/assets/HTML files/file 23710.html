<p>Have you previously installed the <strong>com.doptrixevo</strong> app on this device, and then removed it? It looks as if whichever launcher you are using is expecting to find the app (a shortcut or a widget) when it's redrawing the home screen, and is surprised to find that it's no longer there.</p>

<p>If this is a third-party launcher, you may want to file a bug report.</p>
