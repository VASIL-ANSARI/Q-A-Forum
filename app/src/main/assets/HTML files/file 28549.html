<p>In order to get the result, you will need to UNPIVOT the data.  When you unpivot you convert the multiple columns into multiple rows, in doing so the datatypes of the data must be the same.</p>

<p>I would use CROSS APPLY to unpivot the columns in pairs:</p>

<pre><code>select t.employee_id,
  t.employee_name,
  c.data,
  c.old,
  c.new
from yourtable t
cross apply
(
  values 
  ('Address', Address_Old, Address_new),
  ('Income', cast(income_old as varchar(15)), cast(income_new as varchar(15)))
) c (data, old, new);
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!3/2a69f/1" rel="nofollow">SQL Fiddle with demo</a>.  As you can see this uses a <code>cast</code> on the <code>income</code> columns because I am guessing it is a different datatype from the <code>address</code>.  Since the final result will have these values in the same column the data must be of the same type. </p>

<p>This can also be written using CROSS APPLY with UNION ALL:</p>

<pre><code>select t.employee_id,
  t.employee_name,
  c.data,
  c.old,
  c.new
from yourtable t
cross apply
(
  select 'Address', Address_Old, Address_new union all
  select 'Income', cast(income_old as varchar(15)), cast(income_new as varchar(15))
) c (data, old, new)
</code></pre>
