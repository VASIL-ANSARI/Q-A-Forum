<p>Regarding your point 1.): I'm not clear what you mean: if you assign indexes sensibly, you <strong>can</strong> use index hints to force index usage, but it's a far better idea to let the optimzer do it's work first and then, if your index is not being used, analyse <strong><em>why</em></strong> (it could be that index usage under specific circumstances is not the quickest way). For example, if you are combining a search by id with a search using the wildcard match,the optimizer may decide that, if it has to be a complete table scan anyway (because of your <code>'%search%'</code> term) that there is no added benefit using the index on your id column.</p>

<p>Regarding your point 2.): it is (very) unlikely that an index can be used if you are using a wildcard match at the beginning of your search term. For searches like that, take a look at the Oracle fulltext syntax here:</p>
