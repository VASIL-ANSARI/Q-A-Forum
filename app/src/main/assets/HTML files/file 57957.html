<p>It works fine for me in Spring 3.2.X. Though, controllers often have data members on their instances, but they're usually autowired instances that are services. So I wonder if you're misunderstanding the overall design pattern of the Spring framework.</p>

<p>I can't think of any real benefit in using a static method, the controller instance is already there, so even if you made the controller have all static methods it's still going to get instantiated. I would think the instance invocation overhead would be minuscule and lost in the noise as far as performance.</p>
