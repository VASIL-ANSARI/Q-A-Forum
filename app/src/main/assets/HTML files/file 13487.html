<p>You don't have to allocate memory each time you call <code>push_back</code>. The vector starts off with a given capacity, and it only allocates extra capacity when the original capacity runs out, typically by doubling the previous capacity. You should only reserve if you are sure you are going to need the extra capacity. And you can check how much capacity you start off with using the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/capacity" rel="nofollow">capacity</a> member. So, yes, a call to <code>reserve</code> can help, but only if you know from the outset that you really need the extra capacity. But you can also trust the vector to increase its capacity if and when it needs it.</p>

<p>On my particular platform, when I initialize a vector with 5 <code>Foo</code> elements, it has capacity 5. As I add a new element, the capacity jumps to 10. This is not mandated by the standard, the original capacity could have been much more than 5.</p>

<pre><code>struct Foo {
  long long n;
};

int main() {

  std::vector&lt;Foo&gt; f(5);
  std::cout &lt;&lt; f.capacity() &lt;&lt; "\n";
  f.push_back(Foo());
  std::cout &lt;&lt; f.capacity() &lt;&lt; "\n";

}
</code></pre>
