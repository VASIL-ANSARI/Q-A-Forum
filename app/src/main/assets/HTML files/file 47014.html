<p>So as @SLC suggested I used jQuery. I chose jQuery DateTimePicker <a href="http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/" rel="nofollow">http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/</a> </p>

<p>According to SLC: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's no best practice for this, the jquery date picker would work fine and is pretty simple</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he is right. I fixed my problem within 7 minutes.</p>

<p>All I did was:</p>

<ul>
<li>added jQuery DateTimePicker files to my project(from the site above)</li>
<li>followed the instructions provided on that site(added 2 script and 1 css file to the cshtml file, added an id to the input field needed and called jQuery function on previously added id - Voila!)</li>
<li>0 minutes spent on getting that data saving to db with DateTime data type</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel that one place for improvment is my jQuery function calling. Is there a better way than this?:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
$(document).ready(function () {
    jQuery('#datetimepicker').datetimepicker();
});
</code></pre>

<p></p>
