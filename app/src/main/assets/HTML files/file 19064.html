<p>It is the common difference between a "deep" and a "shallow" copy, also an issue with the almost-deprecated IClonable interface.  The Clone() method creates a new Bitmap object but the pixel data is shared with the original bitmap object.  The Bitmap(Image) constructor also creates a new Bitmap object but one that has its own copy of the pixel data.</p>

<p>Using Clone() is <em>very</em> rarely useful.  Lots of questions about it at SO where the programmer hopes that Clone() avoids the typical trouble with bitmaps, the lock on the file from which it was loaded.  It doesn't.  Only use Clone() when you pass a reference to code that disposes the bitmap and you don't want to lose the object.</p>
