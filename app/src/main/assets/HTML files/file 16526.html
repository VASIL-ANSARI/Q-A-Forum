<p>To your question, the answer is YES.</p>

<p>But I'll stop trying to look intelligent right there. You're looking at the wrong SO question and answer. What you are looking for is a two step process:</p>

<ul>
<li>use the GMaps Directions API to get a list of waypoints etc</li>
<li>draw a line using those points. </li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily, there's apparently a Github project that does what you need. I didn't use it, so I don't know it's quality, but it's certainly much better than me explaining here how to do it.</p>

<p>I advise you to look at it.</p>
