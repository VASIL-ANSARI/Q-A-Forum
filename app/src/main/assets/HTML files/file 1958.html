<p>I might not be sure what your asking but im pretty sure you should just do a for loop to create the labels and text</p>

<pre><code>for (int i=0; i&lt;hours; i++) {
  JLabel label = new JLabel();
  ...
  myJFrame.add(label);
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since I assume you want to have data just define an array with the size hours and the type JTextArea (or whatever the data is returned as) and then loop through the array to get the data back out.</p>

<p>Your question seems kind of vague and without the code I cant say this is the best implementation but it should work.  Post the code somewhere and you should get a better response.</p>
