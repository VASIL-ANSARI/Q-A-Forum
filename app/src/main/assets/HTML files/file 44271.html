<p>Microframe works are libraries that helps you in building applications that are concise, extensible and testable. </p>

<p>For example <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/" rel="nofollow">Silex</a> is one micro-framework that has the best support of modern PHP programming techniques, is developed in sync with Symfony2, unit-tested, well documented and provides possibility to introduce 3rd party libraries through a very good DI-container mechanism.</p>

<p>In my opinion this framework is best for anything that does not need extensive caching, user-managing, heavy database interaction or security. </p>
