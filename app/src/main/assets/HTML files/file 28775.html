<p>I found the answer for this error . Actually i did the mistake in assigning file path . Previously i have assigned file path as following :</p>

<pre><code>private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        StreamReader sr = new StreamReader"E:/123.txt");
        richTextBox1.Text = sr.ReadToEnd();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>so after creating executable file , when we running the executable file in some other system we should copy this txt file in the same folder (E:/123.txt). But thats not fair . But Using installer method we can embed the files, and if you dont want to create installer file and directly exe file means do the following .</p>

<ol>
<li>Add the file by right clicking project name and select add existing file . It will add the file in the list.</li>
</ol>

<p>2.</p>

<pre><code>private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)        
    {
        string path;
        path = System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(
           System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().CodeBase);
        path = path.Replace("file:\\", "");
        StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(path +"/123.txt");
        richTextBox1.Text = sr.ReadToEnd();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>you should add the namespace of <code>System.Reflection</code>.
3. Then Publish your project , it will deploy the file with your published data.</p>
