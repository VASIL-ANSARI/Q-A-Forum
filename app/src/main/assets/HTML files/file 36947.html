<p>I found the proper way to use log messages with level as instructed by Apple using the ASL (Apple Logging System).</p>

<p>That said using this great wrapper by <a href="https://github.com/MikeWeller/MWLogging" rel="nofollow">Mike Weller</a> did the job and I can control better the logging to console plus I finally have console output from my static framework.</p>
