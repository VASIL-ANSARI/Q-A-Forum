<p>Your curl request is going to <code>https://www.google-analytics.com/collect</code> and your Node.js request is going to <code>https://www.google-analytics.com/debug/collect</code> (notice the <code>debug</code> in the URL).</p>

<p>The debug endpoint is for debugging errors only. It does not send actual hits to Google Analytics. I suspect that's your problem.</p>
