<p>Do you have control over the code of Schedule?</p>

<p>If so, it might be helpful to have a common interface for both items (that has the property <code>start_time</code>) and then use that to order them inside the playlist.</p>

<p>I guess that would also require that <code>playlist</code> includes a list or an enumerable for both of these items, and you can select whether you want media or graphics with something like <code>.Where(x =&gt; x.GetType() == Media)</code>, or have that hidden behind some other property like you already use <code>media</code> here.</p>
