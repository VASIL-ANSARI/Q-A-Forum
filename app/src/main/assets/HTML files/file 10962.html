<p>I would like to advise a different approach to rotation using matrices.The code would look like</p>

<pre><code>canvas.save(Canvas.MATRIX_SAVE_FLAG);
canvas.rotate(cwRotation);
//draw first circle here
canvas.restore();
canvas.save(Canvas.MATRIX_SAVE_FLAG);
canvas.rotate(ccwRotation);
//draw second circle here
canvas.restore();
</code></pre>

<p>This approach has the advantage of being very straightforward and requiring no additional classes and APIs and it is similar to what you would do with OpenGL. </p>
