<p>So far as I know, neither of the things you are looking for exist.  The closest I can think of for the first requirement would be a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.typeconverter.aspx" rel="nofollow">TypeConverter</a>.  However, TypeConverters seem geared toward designer support and are specific to a single type that will always be either the source or destination type.</p>

<p>To find the conversion methods on a type, you could make a function to look for methods with the special names <code>op_Implicit</code> and <code>op_Explicit</code> (as per <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229032.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a>) on either the source or destination types with the appropriate arguments and return types.</p>

<p>As an aside, the reason <code>IsAssignableFrom</code> returns false in this case is that it checks if one type can be <em>assigned</em> a variable of another type directly <em>without</em> conversions.  Conversion operators add confusion to this issue because in the source code it <em>appears</em> that you are doing a simple assignment, but you are actually calling a method and assigning its result.</p>
