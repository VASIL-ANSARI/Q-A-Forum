<p>If you can't use NTP server you have to write it by yourself.</p>

<ol>
<li>The two application both implements a WCF service and are one client of the other;</li>
<li>The application that have its local time modified notifies the other and sends a DateTime;</li>
<li>The application that receives the updated DateTime changes local time (but be aware that your application will need higher privilege to do this because you have to do it via unmanaged code);</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't need much precision you are done. If you need greater precision, you will need to estimate the time lost between the data sending and arrivals and is not trivial.</p>
