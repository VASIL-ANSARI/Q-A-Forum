<p>There aren't different <code>nullptr</code> types. <code>nullptr</code> is a value of type <code>std::nullptr_t</code>. There are different pointer types, and any pointer type can have a null value, which when compared to <code>nullptr</code>, results in <code>true</code>. And the number of pointer types is infinite. Since you can form a pointer to any type, and the result is itself a type which you can form a pointer to. <em>(i.e. you can have <code>int*************************</code>)</em></p>

  <p>Is it sufficient in any check (where we want to determine if something
  is null) to simply check if == to std::nullptr ?</p>

<p>Not <code>std::nullptr</code>, just <code>nullptr</code>. But otherwise, yes.</p>
