<p>There is no http status code for the timeout you're talking about since the timeout is specifically that no http status code was returned in that timeframe.  There are some status codes that may be returned by proxies if their upstream connections timeout but I think thats different than what you're testing.  I responded on your other question about how to get puffing billy to make a connection take longer than your timeout setting - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37818108/rails-how-to-stub-a-certain-response-time-for-a-stubbed-fake-http-or-ajax-re">Rails - How to stub a certain response time for a stubbed / fake http or ajax response</a></p>
