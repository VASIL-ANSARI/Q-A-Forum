<p>You're using the SVN version of the plugin, which is probably unmaintained. <a href="http://github.com/rails/exception_notification/tree/master" rel="nofollow">Latest version can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Second thing which you can do is check the production log. Mailings get written to the log, so you'll see if Rails ever even <em>tried</em> to send it. If there are no entries, that means things are silently failing, which probably happens because -- for some reason -- exceptions are not caught properly.</p>
