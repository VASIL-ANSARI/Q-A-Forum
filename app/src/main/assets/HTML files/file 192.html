<p>At my last job I was tasked with finding a cross platform and preferably free way to write our application specific files to cd/dvd.  I quickly found that writing CD's wasn't hard on windows, but I couldn't write DVD's easily, and that only worked on windows.</p>

<p>I ended up writing a wrapper around <a href="http://cdrecord.berlios.de/private/cdrecord.html" rel="nofollow">cdrecord</a>  cdrecord is an open source project that builds easily with cygwin.  I would create a staging directory where I added the files that needed to be written, called mkisofs on that directory to make a cd iso, and then called cdrecord to burn the image.  This may not be the best solution if you have a strictly windows audience, but it was the only thing I could find that did window, Linux, and OS X.</p>

<p>Another option worht checking out is the <a href="http://www.rocketdivision.com/burn_sdk.html" rel="nofollow">StarBurn SDK</a>, I download the trial and used it, it worked well, but in the end it wasn't free so it was too expensive for my purposes.</p>
