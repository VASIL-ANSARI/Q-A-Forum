<p>In the asynchronous library made by the MS robotics team, they had concurrency primitives which allowed for using an iterator to yield asynchronous code.</p>

<p>The library (CCR) is free (It didn't use to be free). A nice introductory article can be found here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163556.aspx" rel="nofollow">Concurrent affairs</a></p>

<p>Perhaps you can use this library alongside .Net task library, or it'll inspire you to 'roll your own'</p>
