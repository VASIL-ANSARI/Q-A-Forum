<p>I think you should change your hosting solution. 
From what I know DNN7 only works with .NET 4.0 / 4.5</p>

<p>MySql - god forbid, you're in a world of pain. I have heard about attempts to make the DNN Core compatible with MySql... but it's only the Core, and any such projects would be outdated in a matter of months, as DNN does release quite often. </p>

<p>Talking about third party modules, which sooner or later you'll be bound to download from codeplex or buy from Dnn store - forget about. no dnn developer out there provides scripts for mysql.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
