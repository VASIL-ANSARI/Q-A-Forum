<p>The JVM does not necessarily release memory back to the OS after it has asked for it. It expands quickly to meet your needs, up to the maximum allowed. Once it has the memory it tends to hold onto it for a long time. Even though your program is now only using maybe 50MB, the JVM will still hold onto the other 650MB.</p>
