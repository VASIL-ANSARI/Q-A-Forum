<p>I've been looking to do the same thing but haven't found a solution yet. The example provided in the docs (<a href="http://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/sHoxp" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/sHoxp</a>) almost works, but there's no way (that I know of) to tell MagnificPopup to start the modal with a specific piece of content from the json source.</p>
