<p>I think you will have to go through the plugin/library route. Not sure if PHP natively provides PDF generation capability.</p>

<p>There is one nice opensource library I have used for PDF generation but it has a steep learning curve if you are not familiar with XSLT. Its called <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xslfo/" rel="nofollow">XSL-FO</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/" rel="nofollow">Apache FOP</a> <a href="/questions/tagged/fop" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;fop&#39;" rel="tag">fop</a> is a nice FO Processor which I have used.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.java4less.com/apache/fop.php?info=xslfophp" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a tutorial link I just googled to use XSL-FO with PHP. This was the first link which I encountered I am sure you can find many others which might be better than this one.</p>
