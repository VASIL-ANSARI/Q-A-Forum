<p>Enums can be thought of as classes where you have a static reference to named instances of that class. </p>

<p>Thinking this way leads you to the idea of declaring the static 2d array in the enum the same way you would any other static data in any class.</p>

<pre><code>public enum MyEnum {

Type1,Type2;

private static int [][] _2dArr = new int[10][10];
static {
    _2dArr[0][0] = 1;
}
}
</code></pre>
