<pre><code>Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[Incentive.User setNumOfTarget:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x1702c1c70' 
</code></pre>

<p>It means that the User class doesn't know about setNumOfTarget:. Check if your CoreData model actually properly defines it.</p>
