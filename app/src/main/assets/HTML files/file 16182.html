<p>Yes, you can't invalidate <code>session</code> from another <code>session</code> due to security reasons. What you can do is to manually store all <code>sessions</code> in some <code>static attribute</code> available to admin. So user logs in, you add him and his <code>session</code> to this attribute (usually a <code>Map/HashMap</code> with user as a <code>key</code> and <code>session</code> as <code>value</code>). </p>
