<p>There are loaders like <code>css-loader</code> and <code>url-loader</code> which resolve urls to base64 inlined data strings instead of serving up the static asset. </p>

<p>You can see <a href="https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto#5-stylesheets-and-images" rel="nofollow">this great guide</a> for how to implement with <code>url-loader</code>. If you are having issues you need to make sure you are using the correct relative path. </p>

<p><code>'./path/to/image.png'</code></p>
