<p>Did you read the docs on the 960.gs site? They explain the difference between the 12, 16 and 24 grid columns like this:</p>

<p>The 12-column grid is divided into portions that are 60 pixels wide. The 16-column grid consists of 40 pixel increments. Each column has 10 pixels of margin on the left and right, which create 20 pixel wide gutters between columns.</p>
