<p>Ok, this probably boiled down to poor design on my part.  I had display: none set for the div, and in JQuery 1.4.1, calling the animate() function seemed to overwrite that setting.  However 1.8.2 does not (which is probably better).</p>

<p>just needed to add</p>

<pre><code>$("#toast").css('display', 'block');
</code></pre>

<p>to my function</p>
