<p>You should not need to update any Java code or WSDLs.  This is all a function of the server configuration.  The server is already listening on regular HTTP, presumably on port 80.  A listener needs to be added for HTTPS, presumably on port 443 - and mapped to the same web context as your existing application.</p>

<p>Alternatively, this can be done outside of the web server (WebSphere, in your case) by fronting it with something like Apache HTTP Server or a dedicated load balancer that supports SSL/TLS offloading - which can be more efficient.</p>

<p>Since this really isn't a programming question, I'd recommend opening a new question at <a href="http://serverfault.com">http://serverfault.com</a> for details on how to configure WebSphere or something related to the configuration I proposed above.</p>
