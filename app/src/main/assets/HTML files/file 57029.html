<p>Your specific question seems to be: <code>How do I find out what part of the code is taking so long? Is it the updating of the UILabel that's eating up 0.54~~ of the time?</code></p>

<p>Inside Instruments, provided with Xcode, is a Time Profiler tool.

<p>You can run your code and watch this tool to see exactly how much time is being spent executing every part of your routines. It will break down exactly which method is taking the most time, by percentage of overall time and concrete time spans, giving you a precise understanding of where you should focus your efforts in shaving off those precious partial seconds through refactoring/optimizations.</p>

<p>I'm an Objective-C guy, so rather than try to muddle my way through a Swift example, I'll let this guy do the talking.
