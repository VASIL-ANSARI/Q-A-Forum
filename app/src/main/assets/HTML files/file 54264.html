<p>The only difference between the two approaches is that the former (literal notation) creates one specific object, while the latter defines a <em>constructor function</em> which can be used to create objects. It's the difference between being able to only have one object (asterisk argument about object cloning here), and being able to instantiate many similar objects from the same template ("class").</p>

<p>Both are equally valid, depending on what you want. Both are equally object oriented.</p>

  <p>Cant we have object oriented javascript with namespace notation(former one)? If so can you create an object of that and inherit them.</p>

<pre><code>web.app.Customer = function (name) {
   ..
};
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why can't I have private fields in first approach(namespace)? If I declare any field with var, javascript error is thrown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because "private fields" don't exist in Javascript. You can use the characteristics of closures/variable scoping to emulate something like "private properties". But for that you obviously need a <em>function</em>. With an object literal notation, you don't get that.</p>
