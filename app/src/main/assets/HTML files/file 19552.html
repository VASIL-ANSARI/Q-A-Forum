<p>In coffeescript, the <code>@</code> is equivalent to <code>this</code>, but the value of <code>this</code> is dependent on your current scope within the code. In your example, <code>alert(@ == window)</code> returns true because <em>in that context</em> <code>this</code> is the window. But when you use it in another context, for example inside a function definition (<code>@googletag.cmd.push -&gt; ...</code>) then it will get the context of whatever scope that function is called from.</p>

<p>In the end this is not a coffeescript issue but a Javascript issue. I'd recommend reading up a bit more on <code>this</code>, it's a somewhat confusing concept at first.</p>

<p>Here's one article that helped me understand the concept better: <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/" rel="nofollow">http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/</a></p>
