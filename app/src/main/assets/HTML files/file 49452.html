<p>While generally on Stack Overflow you shouldn't ask for software recommendations, I had a similar problem recently and I know how hard it is to find a Python <em>anything</em> that fits a specific need in this area. </p>

<p>You may be interested in a library called <a href="http://simplecv.org/" rel="nofollow" title="SimpleCV">SimpleCV</a>.</p>

<p>With this library it is possible to do advanced image editing, including reconstructing backgrounds. An example of the power of <code>SimpleCV</code> is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/m68js/trying_to_write_a_very_simple_green_screen_code/" rel="nofollow">this</a> Reddit post detailing a problem with greenscreens that was solved with <code>SimpleCV</code>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps! </p>

<p>Best of luck, and happy coding!</p>
