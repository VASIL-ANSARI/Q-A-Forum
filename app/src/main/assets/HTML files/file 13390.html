<p>Please use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect the affected row after it has been edited (and displayed in the wrong way) - right-click on any cell and select "Inspect Element" in the popup menu. The DevTools window will show up, and you will be able to examine (in the Elements panel) whether the final DOM is correct. If it is, then it's a Chrome/WebKit bug.</p>
