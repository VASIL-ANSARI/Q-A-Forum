<p>As far as I can tell from your code <code>$tree</code> isn't a function, its an element
on line 89  <code>var $tree = jq('ul#VTCTree');</code>  </p>

<p>therefore I assume <code>.tree()</code> is a JQuery widget and isn't working as expected?</p>

<p>Just seen some of the comments and the updates.  Have you checked the path/file inclusion of the tree plugin/widget?</p>
