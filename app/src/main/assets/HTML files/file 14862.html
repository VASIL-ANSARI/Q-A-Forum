<p>you can reverse the order and get the first 5. That is the same as getting the last 5 and sorting the other way around</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `x`  WHERE `USER_KEY` = '$RK' ORDER BY `dd` ASC limit 5
</code></pre>

<p>or if you need the desc order you can do</p>

<pre><code>select * from (SELECT * FROM `x`  
               WHERE `USER_KEY` = '$RK' 
               ORDER BY `dd` asc 
               limit 5) as x 
order by `dd` desc
</code></pre>
