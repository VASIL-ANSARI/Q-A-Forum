<p>There are some ways to do this, however none of them are native to WP functions.</p>

<p><strong>1. You can add a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API" rel="nofollow">Shortcode</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The idea is that you register a shortcode, with what you want to show like <code>[post-image-stuff]</code> and then you add that code to your post content and it will load. To paginate, you use <code>&lt;!âânextpageââ&gt;</code></p>

<p>Ex:</p>

<pre><code>Article content and so on

&lt;!âânextpageââ&gt;

[post-image-stuff]
</code></pre>

<p>This will be your post content, the negative part is that you need to register the shortcodes, but it's not that hard.
I confess I've never tried this, but it should work.</p>

<p><strong>2. Do you really need to paginate?</strong> Why don't you put a section with Tabs to show the other content? You can put a gallery, a map and author information inside it without the need to reload the page.</p>
