<p>The good way to do this would be to use the new(ish) unicode character classes in regex, such as <code>\P{L}</code> to match anything that is <em>not</em> a letter (in any language) according to unicode. Unfortunately, it seems that Ruby doesn't support this, even in 1.9.</p>

<p>Perhaps the 1.9 regex parser is smart enough to not match the bytes that make up special symbols in unicode characters, so simple enumerating all the characters to strip can work, though. That assumes you really can enumerate all characters you wish to filter out, which might be a lot more than the symbols in ASCII, like logical not, aeroplane, etc...</p>
