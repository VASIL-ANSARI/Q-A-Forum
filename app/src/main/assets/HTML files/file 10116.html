<h2>Large requests and temp files</h2>

<p>Play! is already storing large HTTP requests in temp files named after UUIDs (thus reducing the memory footprint of the server). Once the request is done, this file gets deleted.</p>

<h2>Monitoring uploads in Play!</h2>

<p>Play! is using (the awesome) <a href="http://www.jboss.org/netty" rel="nofollow">Netty</a> project for its HTTP server stack (and also on the client stack, if you're considering <a href="https://github.com/sonatype/async-http-client" rel="nofollow">Async HTTP client</a>.</p>

<p>Netty is:</p>

<ul>
<li>asynchronous</li>
<li>event-driven</li>
<li>100% HTTP</li>
</ul>

<p>Given Play!'s stack, you <em>should be able</em> to implement your "upload progress bar" or something. Actually, Async HTTP client already achieves <strong>progress listeners for file uplaods</strong> and <strong>resumable download</strong> (see the <a href="https://github.com/sonatype/async-http-client/blob/master/docs/AHCQuickStartGuide.pdf" rel="nofollow">quick start guide</a>).</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> <a href="https://github.com/playframework/play/tree/master/framework/src/play/server" rel="nofollow">play.server</a> package doesn't seem to provide such functionality/extension point.</p>

<h2>Monitoring uploads anyway</h2>

<p>I think Play! is meant to be behind a "real" HTTP server in reverse proxy mode (like nginx or lighthttpd).</p>

<p>So you'd better off using an upload progress module for one of those servers (like <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUploadProgressModule" rel="nofollow">HttpUploadProgressModule</a> for nginx) than messing with Play!'s HTTP stack.</p>
