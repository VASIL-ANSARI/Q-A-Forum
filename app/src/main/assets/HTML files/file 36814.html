<p>You are probably using the VS2013 presentation style and this is a known issue (<a href="https://shfb.codeplex.com/workitem/35347">https://shfb.codeplex.com/workitem/35347</a>).  The namespaces are all there you just need to expand to topmost node (the one with the help project title).  The other workaround is to add conceptual content or enable the root namespace container.  I'm looking into fixing it for the next release.</p>
