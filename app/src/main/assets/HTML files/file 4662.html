<p>You can do this when you create the mapper. Basically, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var results = db.ExecuteSprocAccessor("some_sproc",
    MapBuilder&lt;MyTargetType&gt;.MapAllProperties()
        .DoNotMap("SomethingThatDoesntMatch")
        .Build(),
    param1, param2, param3);
</code></pre>

<p>That'll match all the parameters to results by name, but not map anything to the property SomethingThatDoesntMatch.</p>

<p>Something to be aware of: creating the result set mapper by the MapBuilder is kind of expensive, and it doesn't get cached automatically. If you're doing this call in a loop, it'll probably be slow. I'd recommend creating the mapper ahead of time and holding onto it, or creating the accessor separately and holding onto the accessor.</p>
