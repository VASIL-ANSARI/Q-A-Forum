<p>Just realised that a module is probably my best bet, I changed the class to the module below and have achieved the result I wanted  </p>

<pre><code>def start(fname):
    """
    Create FileLock and Prepender objects.
    """
    global lockfile_name
    global file_lock
    global file_writer

    lockfile_name = fname

    file_lock = FileLock(fname)
    file_lock.acquire()

    file_writer = Prepender(fname)

    print "LockFile: File lock and writer acquired!\n"


def add_command(command):
    """
    Prepend a command to the LockFile
    """
    print "LockFile: Adding command: " + command + "\n"
    file_writer.write(command)

def end():
    """
    Close and remove the LockFile
    """
    print "LockFile: Closing &amp; Removing LockFile:\n"
    file_writer.close()
    file_lock.release()

    os.remove(self.fname)
</code></pre>
