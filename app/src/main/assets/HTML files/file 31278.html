<p>Go to <strong><em>project->TARGETS->Build Settings->Achitectures</em></strong> and remove armv7 from valid architectures by double clicking the options there and then selecting armv7 and pressing '-' as shown in the image below. This might solve the problem. If it does not you may have to build the respective api which you want to add to you project and then add the respective .a file to the project.
