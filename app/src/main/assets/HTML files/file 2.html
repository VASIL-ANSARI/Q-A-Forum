<p>I would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here.  What if you created an abstract base class for a "multimedia driver" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure.</p>

<p>My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem.</p>

<p>I would reference something like a <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextdocument.html">QTextDocument</a> in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation.</p>
