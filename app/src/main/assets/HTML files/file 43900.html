<p>You can't upload to an arbitrary URL, you need to have a servlet that handles multipart on the <code>POST</code> http method.</p>

<p>We have a demo that includes the server side code here: <a href="http://codenameone.com/blog/build-mobile-ios-apps-in-java-using-codename-one-on-youtube.html" rel="nofollow">http://codenameone.com/blog/build-mobile-ios-apps-in-java-using-codename-one-on-youtube.html</a></p>

<p>Notice that you also did some other "problematic" things in the code such as using <code>PRIORITY_CRITICAL</code> and using the InputStream API rather than just giving the file URL (which is more efficient).</p>
