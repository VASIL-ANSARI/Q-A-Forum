<p>You need to flush the output stream explicitly when writing to a file handle like that.</p>

<pre><code>f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("this is a test\n")
# no text in the output file at this point
f.flush()
# buffers are flushed to the file
f.write("this, too, is a test\n")
# again, line doesn't show in the file
f.close()
# closing the file flushes the buffers, text appears in file
</code></pre>

<p>From the documentation of file.write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that due to buffering, flush() or close() may be needed before the file on disk reflects the data written.</p>
</blockquote>
