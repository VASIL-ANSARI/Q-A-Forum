<p>When I learned Ko3, documentation didn't exist at all, read the source starting from index, bootstrap, request, etc. and continued as long as there was something I couldn't understand. Altough it took some time to get through everything, eventually I got to know it as if I wrote it, so yeah - I think this is the best way.</p>

<p>Anyways, there are many <a href="http://forum.kohanaframework.org/discussion/4691/resources-for-learning-kohana/p1" rel="nofollow">sources for learning Kohana</a> today:</p>
