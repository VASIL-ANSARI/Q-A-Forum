<p>You're not going to get anything in C# that isn't available via the Excel object model. If such an event exists, it would probably have some form of it on the <code>Application</code> object (the <code>Application</code> object has events like <code>SheetBeforeDoubleClick</code> that are duplicates of the events that happen on the individual books/sheets like the <code>BeforeDoubleClick</code> event of the <code>Worksheet</code> object).</p>

<p>The <code>SheetTableUpdate</code> event may help you.</p>
