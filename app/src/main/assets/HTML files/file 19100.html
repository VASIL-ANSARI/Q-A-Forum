<p>Found the error.it's because I doing testing using my custom string group user name. so it will be running well. but on real class, error is because username group format not valid. error 2202 is : <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/186555" rel="nofollow">error number description for Terminal Server </a>. So the problem is closed.</p>
