<p>I saw this in the "Notes" section of the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.oci-connect.php" rel="nofollow">PHP documentation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If</strong> you're using PHP with Oracle Instant Client, you can use easy connect naming method (...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think it's rather clear that you can connect to an Oracle DB without the Oracle Instant Client, using only the PHP Oracle extension.</p>
