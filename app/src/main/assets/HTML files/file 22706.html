<p>At the current time, I believe the answer is "no". To the best of my knowledge, "protoc" (Google's tool for parsing .proto files, which is used under the hood) silently discards the comments - so there is nothing available to read from. If a custom parser was written, then yes it would be possible, but there is also a language ambiguity about which comments apply to which lines, for example:</p>

<pre><code>// this probably relates to resourceId
required string resourceId = 1;

required int foo = 2; // but... is this foo? or bar?
                      // and what about this?

       // what does this relate to? and why?

// and this? what are the rules?
required int bar = 3;
</code></pre>

<p>So for 2 different reasons: at the moment, no. All suggestions considered, though... especially if they come with a custom parser included :)</p>

<p>Note that AFAIK this information is missing from most (all?) implementations for this reason. I'm happy to be corrected, though.</p>
