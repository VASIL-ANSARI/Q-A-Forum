<p>Since nobody answered properly and I figured it out. If you don't do a "setPreferredSize(new Dimension(width,height))" then once there are no more items in the list it will simply just be width=0 and height=0. If you do call setPreferredSize() with any non-zero values then it will display.</p>

<p>I did this and it worked:</p>

<p>southItems.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(150,150));</p>
