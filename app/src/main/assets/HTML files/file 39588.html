<p>As pointed out by Michael Berkowski the official documentation states: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-indexes.html" rel="nofollow">The index also can be used for LIKE comparisons if the argument to LIKE is a constant string that does not start with a wildcard character.</a></p>

<p>So wildcard of any kind will eliminate the use of the index and <code>_</code> is a wildcard.  </p>

<p>Here's some quick screen capture's of explained queries illustrating use/non-use of index:</p>
