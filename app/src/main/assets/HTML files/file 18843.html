<p><code>' \267 '</code> Should be what you're looking for. Javascript uses an octal encoding for special characters that differs from the html/css encoding syntax.</p>

<p>Here's a site with a nice lookup table: <a href="http://www.evotech.net/blog/2007/04/named-html-entities-in-numeric-order/" rel="nofollow">http://www.evotech.net/blog/2007/04/named-html-entities-in-numeric-order/</a></p>

<p>-EDIT-</p>

<p>ruakh brought up this version of <code>' \u00B7 '</code> which is also just as valid. You'll notice on the page that there is a column for hex codes and for middle dot it is <code>B7</code>. In css you would write <code>\00B7</code> but in javascript we need to qualify that this is not an octal by appending the little 'u' to the front and you'd end up with <code>\u00B7'</code>.</p>
