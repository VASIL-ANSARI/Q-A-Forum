<p>I'm not writing the loop that will build this query for you. This will get the job done, but it will be pretty inefficient.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table 
  WHERE (
    TOUPPER(category) LIKE '*HELLO*' AND
    TOUPPER(category) LIKE '*GOOD*' AND
    TOUPPER(category) LIKE '*MORNING*' AND
    TOUPPER(category) LIKE '*WORLD*'
    );
</code></pre>

<p>You could also research using REGEXes with SQL.</p>
