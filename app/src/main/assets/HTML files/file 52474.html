<p>pandas does not allow you to keep malformed rows and to be honest I don't really see a way of ignoring some <code>"</code> characters but not others in your example. I think your intuition of using <code>'", "'</code> as the delimiter and then doing a cleanup is the best approach.  If you're really worried about doing this in one line:</p>

<pre><code>message = pd.read_csv('test.txt', sep='", "', names = ['col1','col2','col3','col4'], skiprows=1).apply(lambda x: x.str.strip('"'))
</code></pre>

<p>which handles stripping quotes in the column names as well and gives you:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; message
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
  col1 col2 col3                                     col4
0   v1   v2   v3                                       v4
1  v21  v22  v23  this, "creating, what to do? " problems
</code></pre>
