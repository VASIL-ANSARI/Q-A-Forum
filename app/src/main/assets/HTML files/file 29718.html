<p>The type of jQuery event handlers you are using install themselves on DOM objects that EXIST at the time you run the initial code.  They do not work on DOM elements you might create in the future so thus they don't work on content loaded with <code>.load()</code>.</p>

<p>You have two choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can rerun the code to install event handlers on the new content.</li>
<li>You can switch to delegated event handlers which will work on dynamically created content.</li>
</ol>

<p>For info about delegated event handlers see these other posts:</p>
