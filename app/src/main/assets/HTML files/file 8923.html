<p>If you only use LogCat for debugging purposes, you might want to read <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html#logcat" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>

<p>After you Activated LogCat, you can open the LogCat-View in Eclipse which will then show you all the LogCat-Output, so you don't need to write it to a file in the first place.</p>
