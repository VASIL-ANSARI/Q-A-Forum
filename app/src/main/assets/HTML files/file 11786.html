<li><p>Yes, this isn't anything new. Think about JDBC, java provides the
interfaces (<code>Connection</code>, <code>Statement</code>, <code>ResultSet</code> etc) but it is up
to database vendors to provide implementations.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're using a JSR-311 implementation like Jersey or Apache CXF
then you'll annotate your classes with the <code>javax.ws.rs</code> annotations, such as <code>@Path</code>, <code>@GET</code>, <code>@Produces</code> etc. This is why you need to explicitly have JSR-311 as a maven dependency.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, usually. Have a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Specification_Request">JSR list on wiki</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You need both the JSR and the implementation. The annotations are in the JSR, the implementation provides supporting classes, such as <code>com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>No, it is necessary to have both as dependencies (see point 4); you won't get classpath conflicts.</p></li>
