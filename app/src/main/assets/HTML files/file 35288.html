<p><code>$.ajax()</code> doesn't make real <code>POST</code> requests.</p>

<p>I think it actually sends a <code>GET</code> request with the <code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code> Header set to <code>POST</code>.</p>

<p>You can add support for this behavior by adapting your server-side code to match.</p>
