<p>Well,I got a faint idea about it.
Semicolon will be there in some methods like methods generated for <code>Intent</code> as there wont be any possibility of a succeeding code at the end of that method.</p>

<p>Whereas,</p>

<p>In other auto generating stubs, the comma wont be there where there is a possibility of some code like <code>show()</code> succeeding it.</p>

<p>I am not sure about it.Can my consideration be right??</p>
