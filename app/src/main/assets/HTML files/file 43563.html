<p>Your exception handlers makes more method calls (to <code>System.out.println()</code> and either <code>f()</code> or <code>g()</code>). These calls may throw a new <code>StackOverflowError</code>, which may be caught a few levels down the call stack, so you'll see the numbers going down and back up infinitely (since as the exception goes down the methods in the call stack, some space is freed in the call stack, so there's room for additional calls to be made).</p>

<p>Here's part of the output I got (to make it clearer, I added "catch" to the <code>println</code> statements inside the catch blocks) :</p>

<p>The first <code>StackOverflowError</code> happens when <code>System.out.println(String)</code> attempts to call <code>println()</code>, which is why no new line is displayed in <code>g :9662catch g :9663</code>. For some reason, after the first <code>StackOverflowError</code>, there is room to about 50 additional calls until we get another <code>StackOverflowError</code>, after which the errors come more periodically.</p>
