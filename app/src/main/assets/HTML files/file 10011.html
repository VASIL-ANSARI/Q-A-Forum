<p>I can't find any class named UISearchView - did you mean UISearchBar? If so, keep reading...</p>

<p>You can't disable (gray out) the button programmatically. Implement the <code>searchBar:shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementText:</code> method on the <code>UISearchBarDelegate</code> to check for the replacement text @"\n" (thats the return key press) and if they have entered enough text to allow it to search, and do nothing if they haven't.</p>

<p>If you <strong><em>really</em></strong> want to disable the return key, you can build your own keyboard view (with no framework keyboard to inherit from to get existing functionality) and return it from the inputView property of a <code>UITextView</code> (which means building your own search view as well)</p>
