<p>Well it's complaining that you don't have the column "KEY_ROWID" in your table <em>ScoreList</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Show us the value that you've defined for the variable *KEY_ROWID*</li>
<li>Show us how you created the table <em>ScoreList</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Double check that the value you set for the KEY_ROWID const (it is a const variable, right?) matches the column name you used when you created the table.</p>
