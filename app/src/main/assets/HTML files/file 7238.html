<p>If your queries are really that expensive, then your best option is to load them in a local database and do your processing there. I'd suggest SQL Server Express Edition as you'll be able to take advantage of t-sql
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Database/" rel="nofollow">link</a>).</p>

<p>As for loading the data, you could use your queries, BCP, DTS packages, or about 50 other options.</p>
