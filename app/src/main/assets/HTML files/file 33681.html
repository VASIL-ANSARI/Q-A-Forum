<p>As far as I can tell without debugging (a concept you should get more familiar with), you are calling binaryTree's treeToList method with the head pointer of the list set to NULL.
You should check in your insertToList function whether head == NULL and if it is, allocate it and set its data I think that is why it is passed by reference, so it can be changed outside the scope of the function. 
You also don't need to allocate temp in the function insertToList as you only use it as a pointer to traverse the list.
And use a debugger.</p>
