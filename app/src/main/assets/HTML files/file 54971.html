<p>Perhaps you have some animation or some other background (or foreground) activity that updates your UI on the main thread frequently. This causes the app to never be "quiesce" - at least on this tab. In our application we had UIView animation with option Repeat. CPU usage was fine and it wasn't a battery drain, but it made the test fail every time. Disabling the animation fixed the issue. I couldn't find a way to force the test not to wait to be idle, so we ended up disabling the animation <strike>using #ifdef for the UI test target</strike> using runtime arguments as described here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/33466038/168996">http://stackoverflow.com/a/33466038/168996</a></p>
