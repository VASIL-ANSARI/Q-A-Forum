<p>You are looking for retries.  A "retry" is Sidekiq's term for a job which has failed and will be retried sometime in the future.</p>

<p>The Web UI uses the Sidekiq API documented on the API wiki page to list retries on the Retries tab:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/API#retries" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/API#retries</a></p>

<pre><code>retries = Sidekiq::RetrySet.new
retries.each do |job|
  p [job.klass, job.args, job.jid]
end
</code></pre>
