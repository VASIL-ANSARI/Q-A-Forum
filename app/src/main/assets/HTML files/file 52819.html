<p>With SQL you can use a left outer join. This will give you all of the records in Table 1 and only those in Table 2 that match, so the records in Table 1 that have no match will have NULL for column C in the corresponding Table 2.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.* FROM `Table 1` t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN `Table 2` t2
ON t1.C = t2.C 
WHERE t2.C IS NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>For your example, this should give:</p>

<pre><code>A      B     C
'..' '..'   'e'
</code></pre>
