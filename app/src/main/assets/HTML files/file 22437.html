<p>You can remove spaces in a string with a regex, and if it's an elements href attribute, you'll need to get and set the attribute by using a selector and some javascript, something like:</p>

<pre><code>element.href = element.href.replace(/\s/g, '');
</code></pre>

<p>Fixing it on the serverside is probably a better idea, but without more code it's hard to write an example?</p>
