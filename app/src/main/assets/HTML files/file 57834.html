<p>I had this problem as well. I had fonts working properly locally, but couldn't seem to get it right on GitHub.</p>

<p>I figured out how to do this: The root of the gitHub.io page appears to be different than the local root directory, which leads to fonts in the wrong folder.</p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>@font-face {
    font-family: F16;
    src: url("../SubSkipper/F16_Panel Font.ttf") format('truetype');
    font-weight: bold;
    font-style: normal;
}
</code></pre>

<p>SubSkipper is the name of my project and the .ttf font is in the apparent root directory what I mean by this is: "SubSkipper/" .</p>

<p>The path <code>./</code> goes back one level, then opens the root directory (SubSkipper) of the project as it appears locally.</p>
