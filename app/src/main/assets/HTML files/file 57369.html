<p>It's simply not possible in WinForms. A partially transparent form cannot have opaque controls. Some people might recommend using two forms, one fully transparent with opaque controls over another partially transparent, but I won't go into that.</p>

<p>The opacity of the form will change all controls in the form</p>
