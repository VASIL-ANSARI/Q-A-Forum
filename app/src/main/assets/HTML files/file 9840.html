<p>Unfortunately, there isn't such an event even in the native objective-c <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MediaPlayer/Reference/MPMoviePlayerController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/MPMoviePlayerController" rel="nofollow">MPMoviePlayerController class</a> and neither in the client-side video control, see <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniPhoneOS/Articles/iOS4_3.html" rel="nofollow">release notes</a>.</p>
