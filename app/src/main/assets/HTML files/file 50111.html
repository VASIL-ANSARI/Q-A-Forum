<p>I have no idea how you're getting this data from the database, but I'll assume that you're able to get it as a List if you desire.  LINQ seems like the best option regardless.  </p>

<pre><code>var results = yourListFromDataBase.Where(s =&gt; s.yourIntValue == &lt;your criteria&gt;).Take(100);
</code></pre>

<p>You can even add OrderBy in there if you want to organize it a bit.</p>

<p>You did mention doing some calculations too, so I'm not entirely positive that this will be practical for you.  </p>
