  <p>How can I ensure, that these 3rd party units are not snooping with my User data like User SMS, User call logs, User contacts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not request permissions for those things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am using those permissions for my app as some of my functionalities are based on it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then remove those functionalities or remove the "3rd party units" that concern you.</p>

<p>For the subset of "3rd party units" that are open source, you are welcome to read through the source code to see what they do, then build your own copy of the library from the reviewed source code.</p>
