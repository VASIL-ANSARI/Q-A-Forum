<p>Okay, you are dealing with arrays, so you may need to use <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php" rel="nofollow">functions that modify arrays</a>. You will most likely also need a <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php" rel="nofollow"><code>foreach</code></a> loop to iterate over the array. Auxiliary variables may also be useful.</p>

<p>It is similar to the kid's toy where they insert objects into various shapes. Just match the values against each other. If they fit then merge them. It is only difficult if you do not care to learn it.</p>
