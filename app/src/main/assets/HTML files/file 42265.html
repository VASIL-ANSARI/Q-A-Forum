<p>Setting <code>e.Cancel = true</code> is the problem of course.  So just don't do that.  It is in general a fairly unpleasant feature, making data entry very modal.  A much friendlier approach is to give the user free reign of the data entry task, entering data in an order that isn't necessarily the one you envisioned when you set the tab order.</p>

<p>Just write a little helper method that makes it easy.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>    private Control firstInvalidControl;

    private void SetValidation(object sender, bool ok, string errMsg) {
        var ctl = (Control)sender;
        if (ok) errorProvider1.SetError(ctl, "");
        else {
            if (firstInvalidControl == null) firstInvalidControl = ctl;
            errorProvider1.SetError(ctl, errMsg);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Call SetValidation() in the Validating event handlers of your controls.  Now you have a very easy time to get all the appropriate warnings displayed, as well help the user navigate to a control that he probably needs to work on first.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>    private void OKButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        firstInvalidControl = null;
        this.ValidateChildren();
        if (firstInvalidControl != null) firstInvalidControl.Focus();
        else {
            // Data is good, use it
            // ...                
        }
    }
</code></pre>
