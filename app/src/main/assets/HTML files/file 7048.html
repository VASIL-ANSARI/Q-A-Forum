<p><code>what is the problem in this code:</code>, 6th line down. </p>

<p>If you want to add comments, prefix them with <code>//</code> (<code>// comment here</code>) or surround them with <code>/* ...</code>*/ (<code>/* comment here */</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Edit after your edit</strong></p>

<p>Syntactically, the code is fine. Probably some function you are calling is raising the error but without sufficient information it is impossible to tell. Get a better error message (turn on debugging/error logging on the server).</p>
