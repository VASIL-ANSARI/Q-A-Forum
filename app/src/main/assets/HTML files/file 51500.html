<p>The solution provided by @user949300 would be like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Legacy {

    public int value;

}

public class LegacyWrapper {

    private Legacy legacy;

    public LegacyWrapper(Legacy legacy) {
        this.legacy = legacy;
    }


    public void setValue(int newValue){
        legacy.value = newValue;
        notifyChange();
    }

    public int getValue(){
        return legacy.value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As said this proxy pattern (relationship between the proxy wrapper and the real subject is at compile time) is only recommended if your legacy objects are changed directly by you, so control over the way (with the setValue method call) it changes is possible.</p>
