<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/" rel="nofollow">Quartz</a>. It enables you to run a standalone java programs or run inside  an web or application container (like JBoss or Apache Tomcat). There is a good integration with Spring and Spring batch in particular.</p>

<p>Quartz can be configured outside of the java code - in XML and the syntax is exactly like in crontab. So, I found it very handy.</p>
