<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern" rel="nofollow">Look into the Composite Pattern</a>, with an eye of the items being part of the "contents" of the inventory.</p>

<p>Then you can have a bag which is "contained" in the user's contents, while having contents which are contained in the bag.</p>

<p>Top level stuff like calculating weight will sum up the weight of each item in the current container.  If that involves asking an item that is a container it's weight, the container-item will calculate it's weight by using the same technique (until eventually non-container items just report back their non-calculated weights).</p>

<p>Either way, you want to get away from arrays for collections that exhibit behavior, as you can't add the behavior into the collection with an array, and having it outside (in a bunch of methods) will eventually make your code hard to maintain / fix / change.</p>
