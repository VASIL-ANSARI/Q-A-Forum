<p>This is not true.<br>
There are different type of exceptions, some you need to handle, some you should throw, some you should catch, some you should not. Read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2008/09/10/vexing-exceptions.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> please.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should catch exceptions that you can do something with them</li>
<li>If you want to just log exceptions catch, log, and then use <code>throw</code> not <code>throw ex</code> (it resets the call stack)</li>
<li>Prevent exception from happening if you can, check for conditions that prevent exceptions(<code>IndexOutOfRangeException</code>, <code>NullPointerException</code>, <code>ArgumentNullException</code>) do that instead of executing the action and catch the exception</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Donât catch fatal exceptions; nothing you can do about them anyway, and trying to generally makes it worse.</li>
  <li>Fix your code so that it never triggers a boneheaded exception â an "index out of range" exception should never happen in production code.</li>
  <li>Avoid vexing exceptions whenever possible by calling the âTryâ versions of those vexing methods that throw in non-exceptional
  circumstances. If you cannot avoid calling a vexing method, catch its
  vexing exceptions.</li>
  <li>Always handle exceptions that indicate unexpected exogenous conditions; generally it is not worthwhile or practical to anticipate
  every possible failure. Just try the operation and be prepared to
  handle the exception.</li>
  </ul>
