<p>Tried to create working example but i don't have enough time.
When you reach last li, just take one from top, append it at the end of the list, and remove first one. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var cloneLi = $(_child.find('li')[0]).clone()
_child.append(cloneLi);
$(_child.find('li')[0]).remove()
</code></pre>
