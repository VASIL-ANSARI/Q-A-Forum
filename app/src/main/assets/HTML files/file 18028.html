<p>There is probably a better more abstract and reusable way to do this that I'm not aware of, but here is a suggestion that could help in your specific project that requires just a bit of special knowledge of your specific project.</p>

<p>If you use introspection in your prepare for segue, you can check to see if methods exist by using the responds to approach.</p>

<p>So for example, in typical implementations of a splitview controller (note - not all) the detail view will implement the methods to handle rotation.  So if this is true in your project, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {

    if ([segue.destinationViewController respondsToSelector:@selector(splitViewController:shouldHideViewController:inOrientation:)]) {
    //do something
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>You could use this same approach based upon something that was unique but constant in your project related to either the master or detail view.</p>

<p>hope that helps,
be well</p>
