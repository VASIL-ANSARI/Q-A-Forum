<p>I would suggest extracting this responsibility into an <code>EntityRepository</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class KinderRepository extends \Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository
{

    public function findByKindergartenAndAge(Kindergarten $entity, $minAge = 10, $maxAge = 20)
    {
        return $this-&gt;createQueryBuilder()
                    -&gt;... // your query logic here
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>All the lookups should really happen in classes where you have access to the entity manager.</p>

<p>This is actually the way suggested by the Doctrine architecture. You can never have access to any services from your entities, and if you ever think you need it, well, then something is wrong with your architecture.</p>

<p>Of course, it may occur to you that the repository method could become pretty ugly if you later decide on adding more criteria (imagine you'll be searching by kindergarten, age, weight and height too, see <a href="http://www.whitewashing.de/2013/03/04/doctrine_repositories.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitewashing.de/2013/03/04/doctrine_repositories.html</a>). Then you should consider implementing more logic, but again, that should not be that necessary.  </p>
