<p>Actually you <strong>do</strong> have to free <code>mStack</code> <em>somewhere</em> or you will leak memory. If <code>StackDestroy</code> doesn't do it for you, you'll have to do it yourself later.</p>

<p>When designing an API that allocates and frees stuff think of a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did the client allocate the object ? Perhaps he should also free it. Is it possible he passed an object that wasn't obtained via <code>malloc</code> ?</li>
<li>Can the client do useful things with the object beyond the demise of our object ?</li>
</ul>

<p>In your case the client doesn't even know about the existence of <code>mStack</code> (technically you could use opaque objects) so, since <em>you</em> allocate it, you should also free it.</p>
