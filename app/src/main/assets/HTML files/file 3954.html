<p>From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms179304.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a>:</p>

<p><em>AFTER triggers are never executed if a constraint violation occurs; therefore, these triggers cannot be used for any processing that might prevent constraint violations.</em></p>

<p>And <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175943.aspx" rel="nofollow">then</a>:</p>

<p><em>You can request AFTER triggers by specifying either the AFTER or FOR keywords. Because the FOR keyword has the same effect as AFTER, DML triggers with the FOR keyword are also classified as AFTER triggers</em></p>

<p>It would seem there is no difference.</p>
