<pre><code>input[type=text]{

}

input[type=password]{
color:#FFFF00;
}

input[type=submit]{
color:#FFFFFF;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It supports password, submit, text, select, radio and a couple more. I'll edit in the list when I find it. You should note that some behave strangely, for example an input box (text) with 100px width and 2px padding will appear differently to a submit input box with the same properties, you'll need to pad the submit with an extra 3/4 pixels, if I remember correctly. </p>
