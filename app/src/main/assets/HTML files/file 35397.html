<p>When you call <code>pthread_setschedparam</code> the thread id variables haven't been initialized yet. So you're trying to change parameters on an indeterminate thread.</p>

<p>The easiest way to change the priority is to do it in the thread themselves.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding uninitialized local variables, their values are indeterminate until explicitly initialized. Using uninitialized local variables leads to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" rel="nofollow"><em>undefined behavior</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you see the example in the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_setschedparam.3.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pthread_setschedparam</code></a> you see it being called with <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_self.3.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pthread_self</code></a> to set the own threads priority. You can use this to either add a field in the structure you pass to the thread that contains the priority, or have a wrapper thread-function which sets the priority and then calls the actual thread function.</p>
