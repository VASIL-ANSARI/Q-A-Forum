<p>Contrary to what virtually all the other answers are saying, the problem is not with your use of <code>event.stopPropagation();</code>. The sole issue is with the line <code>$('input, select').bind('focus blur', function (event) {</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/j08691/mcdgnh7r/" rel="nofollow">focus event is triggered prior to the click event</a>, the class <code>panel-primary</code> is then being applied to the panel div and the left margin is moving it over to the right, and therefore the checkboxes or radio button don't receive the click event. An easy way to verify this is to either change the CSS so the left margin doesn't move, or remove the entire <code>$('input, select').bind('focus blur', function (event) {</code> block.</p>
