<p>The cookie keeps the connection with the session and its associate with the domain. In some cases the domain maybe called with <code>www.</code> in front and in some other case not - and the cookie will be lost, so an the session.</p>

<p>To avoid that place on web.config the domain name as</p>

<pre><code>&lt;httpCookies domain="domainname.com" .... /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with out the <code>www.</code> to keep the cookies with or with out it.</p>

<p>Now because you use <code>InProc</code> that is run as a service and keep the session on memory and not on a database, this service is known that is drop the session for some reasons. To avoid that you must use a database to keep your session.</p>

<p>Other case can be a move from <code>https</code> to <code>http</code> and if you have place the cookie only to be secure, will be lost again.</p>
