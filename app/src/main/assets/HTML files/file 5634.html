<p>Not sure what the problem here is exactly (if you can post the Trade class and details on what exactly is not working it would be helpful), but in general if the Trade class is serializable, you should be able to just add the [Serializable] attribute to the Profile class and do not need to do custom serialization by implementing ISerializable.</p>

<p>Usually you only need to implement ISerializable when you need to do custom serialization (e.g. when your data members are not serializable).</p>

<p>Edit:
 Just realized you are using an ObservableCollection so my previous comment of just using [Serializable] attribute is not correct. See here for info on serializing ObservableCollection: <a href="http://kentb.blogspot.com/2007/11/serializing-observablecollection.html" rel="nofollow">http://kentb.blogspot.com/2007/11/serializing-observablecollection.html</a> or you should also be able to use ObservableCollection.CopyTo() to get a Trade[] instance and add that directly to the SerializationInfo. </p>
