<p>Depending on the nature of your app, you may well want to turn location services off when you go into the background or when the screen is locked. These notifications hooks are provided generally in your app delegate file (<code>.m</code>). Yes you are right, location services significantly drain battery and it a highly recommended practice for iOS apps using location services to use it cautiously.</p>

<p>Apple seems to have thought about this and has provided an API that notifies the app only if the user has moved "significantly" Apple <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH5-SW2" rel="nofollow">the significant change location service</a>. The definition of "moved significantly" varies on various aspects depending on WiFi availability, cell tower availability, GPS availability etc. Luckily all this is obfuscated within this API.</p>
