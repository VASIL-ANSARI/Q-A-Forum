<p>If you're just trying to generate a random name, use a list and random.choice. Here is an example. <code>print(random.choice(["Hello","World","!"]))</code>, this will give you a random string from the list either 'Hello', 'World', or '!'. If you want more help on the random module I suggest looking at the docs, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html</a>.  </p>
