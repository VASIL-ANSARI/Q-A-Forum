<p>You have to implement an Adapter (ie a DataModel) following to your requirement for your JTable.</p>

<p>I suggest you to read the Java documentation <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JTable.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Personnaly, I recommend JAXB to parse your xml data because it can build a model. Your architecture should be based on the model your xml file represents. Then your Adapter will be a transition to the AbstractDataModel class and your model.</p>
