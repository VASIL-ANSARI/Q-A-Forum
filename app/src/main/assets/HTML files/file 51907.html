<p>As @Shadow commented, you have to <code>INSERT</code>, because the rows do not exist. </p>

<p>However, given you want to set values in 2 tables at once because <code>gender</code> is from <code>products_item_codes</code>, while <code>feature_set_id</code> is from <code>feature_set_to_products</code>, you'll have to use <strong>at least</strong> 2 insert queries.
You should either use a transaction, or do the insert at the application level (ie. PHP, Perl, or whatever language you use)</p>
