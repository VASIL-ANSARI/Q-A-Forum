<p>You need to loop by <code>address</code> for example and insert first of all in <code>address</code> table. After that you need to get the id of the inserted row and use it when you insert in <code>schedules</code> table.</p>

<p>As you didn't try any code I just explain here how you should do and if something is not working let me know what have you tried and what error you have.</p>

<pre><code>foreach($_POST['address'] as $key =&gt; $value){
   //insert to address table: $_POST['location'][$key] and $_POST['address'][$key]
   //$last_inserted_id_from_address = Get the latest inserted id from address table.
   //insert to schedules tables: $_POST['day'][$key] ,.... and $last_inserted_id_from_address
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>You don't need to loop twice if you want to have match 1 to 1.
Change your loop to this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($location as $key =&gt; $value) {
    $addr = new Address;
    $addr-&gt;location = $location[$key];
    $addr-&gt;address = $address[$key];
    $addr-&gt;save();

    //Use the same $key when creating Schedule. For each address will create one schedule.
    $sched = new Schedule;
    $sched-&gt;day = $day[$key];
    $sched-&gt;start = $start[$key];
    $sched-&gt;end = $end[$key];
    $sched-&gt;address_id = $addr-&gt;id;
    $sched-&gt;save();

}
</code></pre>
