<p>Try <code>cell.StyleIndex = (UInt32Value)1U;</code></p>

<p>Edit in response to renathy's comment</p>

<p>This code was adapted from the code provided by the Open XML SDK 2.0 Productivity Tool. When viewing a percentage formatted cell in this tool the code it generates is:</p>

<pre><code>// Creates an Cell instance and adds its children.
public Cell GenerateCell()
{
    Cell cell1 = new Cell(){ CellReference = "A1", StyleIndex = (UInt32Value)1U };
    CellValue cellValue1 = new CellValue();
    cellValue1.Text = "0.2";

    cell1.Append(cellValue1);
    return cell1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As to what the <code>1U</code> is, it appears to be the magic number that Microsoft decided to use to represent styles (the  U part just means that the number is unsigned). </p>
