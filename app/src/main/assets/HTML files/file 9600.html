<p>You seem to be using some JDBC metadata methods you have not posted. I believe what you are seeing is the name of the column along with the JDBC <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/sql/Types.html" rel="nofollow">type constant</a> from which you can derive the column type. Have a look at the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?java/sql/index.html" rel="nofollow">java.sql API</a> to read more on how to get more meta data.</p>
