<p>Include this method as well in your code:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)shouldAutorotate{
  if([[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft ||[[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight)
  {
    return YES;
  }
  else{
    return NO;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Read <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/RespondingtoDeviceOrientationChanges/RespondingtoDeviceOrientationChanges.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> for more info. Here it is mentioned that we should override <code>shouldAutorotate</code> to suppress orientations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to temporarily disable automatic rotation, avoid
  manipulating the orientation masks to do this. Instead, override the
  shouldAutorotate method on the topmost view controller. This method is
  called before performing any autorotation. If it returns NO, then the
  rotation is suppressed.</p>
