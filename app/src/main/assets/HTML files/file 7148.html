<p>The operation of exporting a table into a XML file is a typical asyncronous process, I don't see any way to syncronize table variations (update/delete/insert) with the exported XML file.</p>

<p>You have only to re-export the table at every variation.</p>

<p>Or you can decide to schedule a re-export every hour, for example, minimizing the differences between the real table and the exported XML file.</p>
