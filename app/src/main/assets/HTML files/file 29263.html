<p>The short answer, from my experience, is that it doesn't. </p>

<p>For example, if you don't call <code>SpiceManager.shouldStop()</code> and execute a request, the reference to the RequestListener is still retained and you may end up with a memory leak as it tries to update whatever is referenced within it if your Activity/Fragment/Service no longer exists.</p>
