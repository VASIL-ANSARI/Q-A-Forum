<p>You probably have a method new in your posts controller. There, if you want rabl to render the content and photo values, you need to put:</p>

<pre><code>def new
  @post = Post.new(content: "some_content", photo: "some_photo")
  render('path_to_your_rabl_file', formats: :json) # or respond_with(@post) if the routes are correct
end
</code></pre>
