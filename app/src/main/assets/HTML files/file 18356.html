<p>In the example above, sample.pdf is presumably a File created in Plone. In this case, the URL without /view will render the file for download, and the URL with /view will render a Plone page with a link to download it. This is standard behaviour.</p>

<p>It isn't really possible to stop people from downloading the PDF. You can modify the File FTI in portal_types (go to portal_types/File in the ZMI and change the method aliases tab). If you change the "(Default)" alias to be the same as the "view" one, it will behave the same. Note that this will affect all files.</p>
