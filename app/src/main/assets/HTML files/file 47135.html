<p>I think it could be the version of numpy your distribution is using. From <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> choice was only added in 1.7.0 and from <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/package-index/" rel="nofollow">the enthought package</a> I can see it only has 1.6.1 in version 7.2, a later version than your own. You may wish to upgrade your version of numpy.</p>
