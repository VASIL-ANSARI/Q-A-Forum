<p>Maybe you need to check if the connections string is correct in your remote host.
Other problem may be the date parameter, if the language (and date format) of your first server is different from your second server. Sorry i couldn't simple comment in your question, 'coz I don't have any reputations here.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
