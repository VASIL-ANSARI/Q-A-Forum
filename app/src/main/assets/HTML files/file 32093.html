<p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. A parent class reference can hold the objects of any of its subclasses. So a collection of a parent can hold the child classes objects. For example:</p>

<pre><code> List&lt;MyClass&gt; myClassList = new ArrayList&lt;MyClass&gt;();
</code></pre>
