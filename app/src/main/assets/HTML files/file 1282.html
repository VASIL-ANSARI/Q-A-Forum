<p>I had a similar problem, the way I solved it was to strip the string down to 60 characters and append an '...' to the end of it.</p>

<p>An ugly solution? Yes, but unless there is a jQuery solution it's probably your best bet.</p>

<p>If you're using Smarty, this is how I solved the problem:</p>

<pre><code>{$my_string|truncate:60}
</code></pre>
