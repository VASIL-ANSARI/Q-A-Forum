<p><code>findall</code> returns the captured groups, stated in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow"><strong>documentation</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. <strong>Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to use alternation inside of one capturing group, and I would write this as:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; test = '348249432'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall("(20[0-9]{7}|3[0-9]{8})", test)
['348249432']
</code></pre>
