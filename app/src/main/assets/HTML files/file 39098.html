<p>Ok i've managed to Solve it.</p>

<p>The problem is i was in a different matrix, that i've passed from c++ code. When returning a matrix address from jni, i had to use:</p>

<pre><code>Mat ret = getSomeMatrix();
return (jlong) new Mat(ret);
</code></pre>

<p>because the java constructor Mat(long addr) doesn't add a reference to the counter of the matrix, but the finalizer does remove one reference.</p>
