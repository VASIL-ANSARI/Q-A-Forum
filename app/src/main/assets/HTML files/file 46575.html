<p>This is the normal behavior for a public property with both a getter and a setter that has a value at design-time that is not the [DefaultValue].  You have to tell the designer to not serialize the property and not display it in the Properties window:</p>

<pre><code>[DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden)]
[Browsable(false)]
public Classes.Customer Customer
{
    get { return customer; }
    set { customer = value; }
}
</code></pre>
