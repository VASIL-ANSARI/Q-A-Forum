<p>One mutex and at least one condition variable.</p>

<p>One mutex because there is one 'thing' (i.e. piece of memory) to synchronize access to: the shared state between all workers and the thread pushing the work.</p>

<p>One condition variable per, well, condition that one or more threads need to wait on. At the very least you need one condition variable for waiting on new jobs, the condition here being: "is there more stuff to do?" (or the converse: "is the work queue empty?").</p>

<hr>

<p>A somewhat more substantive answer would be that there is a one-to-many relationship between a mutex and associated condition variables, and a one-to-one relationship between shared states and mutexes. From what you've told us and since you're learning, I recommend using only one shared state for your design. When or if you need more that one state I'd recommend looking for some higher level concepts (e.g. channels, futures/promises) to build up on abstraction.</p>

<p>In any case, don't use the same condition variable with different mutexes.</p>
