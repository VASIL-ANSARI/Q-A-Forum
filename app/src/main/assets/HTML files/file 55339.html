<p>Presumably, BetterForm does not call super, so the chain stops there.</p>

<p>The only thing you can do is to swap the order of classes in the declaration:</p>

<pre><code>class NewEntityForm(FileFormMixin, FilterForm):
</code></pre>

<p>Although of course this might affect any other methods that are defined in both classes.</p>
