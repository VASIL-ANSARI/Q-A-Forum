<p>I have a similar problem, with web applications. Apparently Microsoft are aware of this: <a href="http://go4answers.webhost4life.com/Example/remote-debugging-symbols-not-loaded-207525.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://go4answers.webhost4life.com/Example/remote-debugging-symbols-not-loaded-207525.aspx</a></p>

<p>Hopefully, they will release a fix soon.</p>

<p>There is also a suggestion by BrianR on a related question, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/151966/why-are-no-symbols-loaded-when-remote-debugging">Why are no Symbols loaded when remote debugging?</a>, saying to create a folder with the debug files and on the remote server to point the environment variable _NT_SYMBOL_PATH to it.</p>
