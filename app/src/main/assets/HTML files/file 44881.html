<p>It's totally possible, you're just going to need a configured (possibly custom) Hydrator.</p>

<p>Your hydrator will need to know the logic to inject your parameters into your objects from a flat array, and how to reduce your object models back to a flat array on extraction.</p>

<p>You're probably looking at a few Hydrator Strategies or a hydrator naming strategy and potentially a combination of both.</p>

<p>With the correct hydrator, you can achieve what you're looking for.</p>
