<p>The GC will eventually dispose of the objects correctly.  I think you may be a bit too paranoid.  Although it does not hurt to set the object to null.</p>

<p>And to answer your question if you've called myObject.clear which just does myObject = null then there is no reason to reset it to null again.</p>
