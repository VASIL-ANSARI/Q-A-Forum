<p>You first should know what you are trying to do before doing it:</p>

<ul>
<li>RSA without padding is completely insecure;</li>
<li>you use a key for Password Based Encryption which only makes sense with - well - a password;</li>
<li>you come out with a DES key, which again is completely insecure;</li>
<li>you probably generate it with a salt, which is random, so the output is random.</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole protocol doesn't make sense. That you're trying to encrypt directly with DH (a scheme to perform key agreement) shows that you haven't studied crypto enough.</p>

<p>With cryptography it's not about getting things to work. It's about getting things <em>secure</em>. You cannot do that by just trying things out. Learn at least the basics of cryptography <em>then code</em>.</p>
