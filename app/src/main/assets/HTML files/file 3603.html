<p>According to the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/services.html" rel="nofollow">Google Maps docs</a>, "The Google Maps API provides a client geocoder for geocoding addresses".  So I would say that since you are requiring the google maps API, you are requiring a geocoder.</p>
