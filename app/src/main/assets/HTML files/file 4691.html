<p>The test simply determines if an async operation results in a <code>NotSupportedException</code> or not. The test code doesn't care about the async operation completing it simply cares if it throws an exception when called. </p>

<p>The person who wrote the test probably assumes that async operations imply IOCP support and that this test should really be named "IsAsyncOperationSupported()".</p>

<p>I imagine that mono/linux doesn't support async operations everywhere due to the lack of IOCP support and the person who wrote the test knows this...</p>
