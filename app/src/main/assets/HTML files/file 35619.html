<p>FIrst of all, <strong>do not use mysql_* functions</strong>, since those are deprecated. Use mysqli_* or PDO. That said, you probably need something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$fields = "pt".join(", pt",array_keys($q)); //pt1, pt2, pt3, ..
$values = "'".join("','",array_values($q))."'"; //values

echo "INSERT INTO ({$fields}) VALUES ({$values})";
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, you will need to adjust this to fit your requirements, but this should give you good sense on array manipulation.</p>
