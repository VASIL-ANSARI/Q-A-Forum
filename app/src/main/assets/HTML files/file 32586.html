<p>I'm not familiar with the candy crush game but from your description I would use a Table Layout as it looks like every item you'll have will stay in its' assigned cell. GridLayouts are very helpful if you have Views that extend past their cell boundaries. Just in case you should decide to use a GridLayout here's a wonderful article on them: <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/11/new-layout-widgets-space-and-gridlayout.html" rel="nofollow">http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/11/new-layout-widgets-space-and-gridlayout.html</a></p>

<p>"Shall I create an array for objects (e.g. food, crackers) where it will be placed?" - That sounds like a fine thing to do to me!</p>

<p>"are buttons in android shall be used to swap it with different objects?" - Buttons are simply a type of View, replacing a Button with some other View inside a TableLayout should be pretty straight forward. </p>

<p>I know this was asked forever ago but maybe this could help someone? GL!</p>
