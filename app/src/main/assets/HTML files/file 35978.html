<p>See the answer listed here regarding the incorrect parsing of dates according to the ISO standard, as I was unable to mark this as a duplicate.  The reason for you issue is the same.  If you check</p>

<pre><code>date.toISOString();
</code></pre>

<p>You will see that the ISO format of the date is correct, but the Date object will by default show the parsed date under the current Time Zone.</p>
