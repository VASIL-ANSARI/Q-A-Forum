<p>You have to use two join, because your query need a table Spot meaning Origin, and a table Spot meaning Destination.</p>

<p>Try like this :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT LEAST(
   ST_Distance(ST_GeographyFromText('SRID=4326; POINT(-3 40)'), sOrigin.point), 
   ST_Distance(ST_GeographyFromText('SRID=4326; POINT(-3 40)'), sDestination.point)
) FROM transport t
LEFT OUTER JOIN spot sOrigin ON t.origin = sOrigin.id 
LEFT OUTER JOIN spot sDestination ON t.destination = sDestination.id;
</code></pre>
