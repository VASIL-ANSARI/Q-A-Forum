<p>You need to clear the floats:</p>

<pre><code>p {
    clear:both;    
}
</code></pre>

<p>As for the second question, HTML ignores all whitespace, including linefeeds and carriage returns, collapsing them into a single space. To have newlines, either insert break elements with <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> or end the paragraph elements properly with <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could also modify the handling of whitespace by setting <code>whitespace:pre</code> on the <code>p</code> elements in your CSS, but this is nearly never what you want. Just close the paragraphs properly to get actual paragraphs.</p>
