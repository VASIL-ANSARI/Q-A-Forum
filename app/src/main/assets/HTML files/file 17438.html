<p>I would use a stop character, instead of a simulated button click.
Append a special character that is normally not found in your php-generated string and let your scanner read it character by character until special char is found.</p>

<p>Java code:</p>

<pre><code>boolean found = false;
String parameter = "";
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    while(!found){
       String input = sc.next();
       parameter += input + "\n";
       if(input.contains('&lt;specialchar&gt;')
            found = true;
    }
Thread.CurrentThread().wait(10);
//here goes the code to deal with finished input
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
