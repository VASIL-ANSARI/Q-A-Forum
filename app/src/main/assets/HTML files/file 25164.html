<p>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/" rel="nofollow">Web Storage API</a> is available in all major browsers including mobile and desktop. I haven't used it before, but from my research I can tell that it doesn't use SQL queries. It seems to be the best option, even so I would recommend still using a fallback for browser that won't support the API (for example anything before IE8).   </p>

<p>Hope this works out for you!</p>
