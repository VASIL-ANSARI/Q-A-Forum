<p>Change your method to <code>district.calculation</code>, rather than <code>district.calculations</code>.</p>

<p>Things work when you use a has_many calculation because district.calculations calls all of the (one or more) calculations that reference that district. Rails expects a plural form of calculation for a has_many association.</p>

<p>This breaks when you change the association to a has_one, because when District has_one calculation, you can never reference multiple calculations. Rails is smart enough to know this, and requires the singular .calculation method for a has_one association.</p>
