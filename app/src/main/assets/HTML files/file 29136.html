<p>The problem is you're creating 4 <code>App</code> objects and in each one you create different random spheres. So your 4 views have different sets of spheres in different places. If you want the views to match you have to put the objects in the same places in each App.</p>

<p>I pasted this code at line 129 in your sample</p>

<pre><code>var randomSeed_ = 0;
var RANDOM_RANGE_ = Math.pow(2, 32);

Math.random = function() {
  return (randomSeed_ =
          (134775813 * randomSeed_ + 1) %
           RANDOM_RANGE_) / RANDOM_RANGE_;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a random function that returns the same values for each App since randomSeed_ starts at 0 in each app.</p>

<p>It would help to know what you're ultimately trying to achieve. The Three.JS sample you linked to is intended to show how to spread rendering across multiple monitors on 4 different machines in a grid. </p>

<p><a href="http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_multiple_canvases_complex" rel="nofollow">This one shows if the monitors are different sizes and not in a grid</a>. <a href="http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_multiple_canvases_circle" rel="nofollow">This one shows if the monitors are in a circle or semi circle</a>. For example Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Liquid%20Galaxy&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch" rel="nofollow">Liquid Galaxy</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_multiple_views" rel="nofollow">This one shows multiple views in a single canvas</a> although at the time of writing this answer it looks like it needs some updating.</p>
