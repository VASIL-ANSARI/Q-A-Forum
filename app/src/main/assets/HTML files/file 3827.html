<p>design your programs in a way, that there is less need for getters and setters.
You could create them by a macro or implement some kind of propertysyntax(which is possible but there are always things that don't work right)..
However, I suppose just writing the accessors when they are needed or generate them with your IDE is the best and most usual way.</p>

<p>As for your second question, you should use it at least for object type, you don't really need it for primitives. Personally I don't use it either if I need a copy of the object anyway, however others may claim that it might be better to do this explicit. </p>
