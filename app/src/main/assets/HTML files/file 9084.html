<p>What <code>AsyncTask</code> are you passing in to retry? an <code>AsyncTask</code> can only execute once, so you need to create a new instance, and not try to restart the already executed instance. Taken from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">javadoc for AsyncTask</a>:</p>

<p><code>The task can be executed only once (an exception will be thrown if a second execution is attempted.)</code></p>

<p>Edit: .. this is how I interpret the stacktrace. Something is going wrong when executing done in AsyncTask. The thing that is wrong is a cast of <code>Object[]</code> to something that it isn't. Possibly when going from <code>doInBackground</code> to <code>onPostExecute</code>, but that's just a wild guess. Might be caused by a restart of the task, if that is what you are trying to do.</p>
