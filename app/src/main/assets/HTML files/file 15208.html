<p>You probably just want to set the <code>failonerror</code> attribute of <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/exec.html" rel="nofollow">the exec task</a> to true. If you do this and the executable's return status code is anything other than 0, then the buildwill fail.</p>

<p>Youi could also store this status code in a property using the <code>resultproperty</code> attribute, and execute some task only if this property is set (or is not set).</p>
