<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/releases/tag/v1.12.0" rel="nofollow">new autoformat feature</a> was released one week for the version 1.12 of JSCS. </p>

<p>Checking the <a href="https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/blob/master/package.json" rel="nofollow">gulp-jscs</a> source you can see that it's still using version 1.8 of JSCS, and it's been a while since the repo has been updated. With this new feature it might be possible that in the next few days we're going to have an update for <code>gulp</code> and <code>grunt</code>.</p>

<p>I guess for now, you can try using <a href="https://github.com/sun-zheng-an/gulp-shell" rel="nofollow"><code>gulp-shell</code></a> or tweak the gulp-jscs source to support autoformat.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
