<p>My first problem was that I had accidentally ran make in a different build directory.  I deleted all build directories and tried again.  Then I received the following error:</p>

<pre><code>CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
World_INCLUDE_DIRS 
    used as include directory in directory /Users/pdl/Development/Patricia's New World Sandbox/HelloWorldCMake/Hello/src
World_LIBRARIES 
    linked by target "hello" in directory /Users/pdl/Development/Patricia's New World Sandbox/HelloWorldCMake/Hello/src

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
</code></pre>

<p>Contemplating this error, it occurred to me that CMake, of course, is not aware of my Eclipse Environment Variables.</p>
