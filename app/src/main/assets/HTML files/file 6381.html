<p>The first place I would look at in in frameworks/base/libs/ui/EventHub.cpp, it will go through /dev/input to find the different input devices on your platform and what "kind" of input those are.</p>

<p>More...</p>

<p>Next step is in frameworks/base/services/jni/com_android_server_KeyInputQueue.cpp and frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/KeyInputQueue.java.</p>

<p>If all you are doing is implementing the input interface for a new piece of hardware, I don't think you need to do any further than that...</p>
