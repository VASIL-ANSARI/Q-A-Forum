<p>I would use a framework. The one I'm most familiar with is Twitter Bootstrap. This is how simple your problem would be using that:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt; // Create a full-width container
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-xs-6"&gt; // 50% Width of the row, made up of 12 Columns
      &lt;img src="..."/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-xs-6"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Info text about POS System.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div
</code></pre>

<p>And it would be done. A container that resizes depending on the size of your browser's width, that is centered and does not overlap.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is also a bit of an opinion based question, and I don't have a good solution using base CSS.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you some insight though. Frameworks are there to make your life simple, and provide easy to use, complaint HTML/CSS layouts.</p>

<p>Cheers! </p>
