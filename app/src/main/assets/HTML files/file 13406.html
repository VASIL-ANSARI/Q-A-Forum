<p>I have seen same problem as mentioned by Hot Licks. My xib file got corrupted. You can define corruption of xib as for example, a control is wired to more than one actions, or wired with  couple of ivars. Obviously, by mistake.</p>

<p>Fastest thing to check your xib file,right click on control and see whether it has more than one association.</p>
