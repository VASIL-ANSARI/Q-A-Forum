<p>You are using incorrect event. You use DataBound, but need to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.gridview.rowdatabound%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">RowDataBound</a></p>

<p>RowDataBound has <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.gridviewroweventargs%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">GridViewRowEventArgs</a> args, and they have needed way to do it</p>
