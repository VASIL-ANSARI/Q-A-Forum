<p>I understand that what you want are <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-mocktest.html" rel="nofollow">Mock objects</a>.</p>

<p>As you described it, one of the ways one can generate "test versions" of objects is by implementing a common interface and using it.</p>

<p>However, what you are missing is to simply extend the class (provided that it is not declared <code>final</code>) and override the methods that you want to mock. (NB: the possibility of doing that is the reason why it is considered bad form for a library to declare its classes final - it can make testing considerably harder.)</p>

<p>There is a number of Java libraries that aim in facilitating the use of Mock objects - you can look at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito/" rel="nofollow">Mockito</a> or <a href="http://easymock.org/EasyMock3_0_Documentation.html" rel="nofollow">EasyMock</a>.</p>
