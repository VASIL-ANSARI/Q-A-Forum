<p>First you need a <code>ref class</code> that acts as a wrapper around the <code>struct</code> for each item. You can store a pointer to the <code>struct</code> as a field in the <code>ref class</code>. Let's call it <code>StructWrapper</code>.</p>

<p>Then you need something to represent the list. The most flexible way to do that is to expose an <code>IEnumerable&lt;StructWrapper&gt;</code>. Either write your own implementation (not as bad as it sounds) or just load all the items into a <code>List&lt;StructWrapper&gt;</code> and return that.</p>
