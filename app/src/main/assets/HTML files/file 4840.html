<p>I'm not sure how to resolve your issue, but maybe you could trying using <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> or another OS X package manager to handle your software.</p>

<p>Will make upgrading in future a breeze.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry, just realized you are using OS X SERVER, I'm not familiar with it or if you should be using Homebrew on it.</p>
