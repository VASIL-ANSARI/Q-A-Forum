<p>Alvin, you're handling the Twitter callback in the wrong place. The callback code should not be in your activity's <code>onCreate(Bundle)</code> method. Assuming you've followed a tutorial something like this...</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.blundell-apps.com/sending-a-tweet/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.blundell-apps.com/sending-a-tweet/</a></p>

<p>... where you've added an intent-filter in your app manifest for your <code>Main</code> activity to catch the callback, the callback code should then be in your activity's <code>onNewIntent(Intent)</code> method.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
