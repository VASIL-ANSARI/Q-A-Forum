<p>A swipe and a pan gesture can not be recognized at the same time because a swipe gesture is just a special type of pan that has to be faster, short lived, and in one direction.</p>

<p>What you should do is setup the pan gestures to require the swipe gesture to fail before they can start. You will need to set each of the <code>UISwipeGestureRecognizer</code> to be a <code>requireGestureRecognizerToFail</code> on the <code>UIPanGestureRecognizer</code></p>

<pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    let swipeGestures = setupSwipeGestures()
    setupPanGestures(swipeGestures: swipeGestures)
} 

private func setupSwipeGestures() -&gt; [UISwipeGestureRecognizer] {
    let swipeUp = UISwipeGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: Selector("handleSwipes:"))
    let swipeDown = UISwipeGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: Selector("handleSwipes:"))

    swipeUp.direction = .Up
    swipeDown.direction = .Down

    circleView.addGestureRecognizer(swipeUp)
    circleView.addGestureRecognizer(swipeDown)

    return [swipeUp, swipeDown]
}

private func setupPanGestures(swipeGestures: [UISwipeGestureRecognizer]) {
    let panGesture = UIPanGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: Selector("handleThePan:"))
    for swipeGeature in swipeGestures {
        panGesture.requireGestureRecognizerToFail(swipeGesture)
    }
    circleView.addGestureRecognizer(panGesture)
}
</code></pre>
