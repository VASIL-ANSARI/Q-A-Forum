<p>Did you have a look at this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32513379/how-to-record-screen-and-take-screenshots-using-android-api">post</a> ?
You're stating that every 'value' is 8 bytes, so 1 pixel is 4x8 = 32 bytes? But you are using 32bpp image format, so 32 bits per pixel -> 1 pixel = 4 bytes.</p>
