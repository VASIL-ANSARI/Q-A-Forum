<p>It looks like this is intended, according to <a href="http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/input-validation-vs-model-validation-in-aspnet-mvc.html" rel="nofollow">Brad Wilson</a>. I should have searched for "ConstraintException" and EF4. :)</p>

<p>According to Brad, input validation is fired before the model is bound resulting in the "Required" error to be thrown.  In addition, these fields are non-nullable, meaning they throw the same "Required" during model-binding.  In my opinion, it's a bit confusing that it would show the same message specified in the "Required" attribute, rather than a SQL exception message, since it makes it look like the same error.  Which it most certainly is not.  That's where the ConstraintException comes in.  In order to prevent the duplicate messages, simply wrap your model-binding code like so:</p>

<pre><code>if (ModelState.IsValid) {
    ValidateModel(award);
    repository.Add(award);
    repository.Save();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Simple as that.  Thanks!</p>
