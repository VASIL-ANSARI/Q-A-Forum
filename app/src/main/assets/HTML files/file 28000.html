<p>Only the second way is correct. Swing components must be created and accessed only in the event dispatch thread. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/initial.html">concurrency in swing</a>. The relevant quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does not the initial thread simply create the GUI itself? Because almost all code that creates or interacts with Swing components must run on the event dispatch thread. This restriction is discussed further in the next section.</p>

<p>So yes, you need to use <code>invokeLater()</code>.</p>
