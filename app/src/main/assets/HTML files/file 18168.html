<p>As I have understood, there's a bug with using SSO on a phone that already has the Facebook app installed. Although it's claimed to be fixed, I've had several issues with this aswell. For me, forcing the login dialog works:</p>

<pre><code>fb.authorize(*YourActivity*.this, new String[] {"publish_stream"}, Facebook.FORCE_DIALOG_AUTH, new DialogListener() {
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you could save the access token and expires token in sharedPreferences to prevent user from having to log in every time. </p>

<p>If this doesn't work, please post the code you're using. </p>
