<p>Reading the comments, it seems there was a typo that caused the error. However, I'll still address the timing issue.</p>

<hr>

<p>The apparent timing mismatch is because of the way the output streams work: Exception stack traces are printed to <code>System.err</code>, but you are printing the error message to <code>System.out</code>. When your IDE displays program output, sometimes one stream is a bit slower than another, and the order gets messed up.</p>

<p>To fix this, try printing <strong>all</strong> error messages through <code>System.err</code>. Within a single stream, messages never get reordered like this.</p>
