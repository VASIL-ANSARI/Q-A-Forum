<p>The size of an ID3v1 Tag is always fixed 128 Bytes.</p>

<p>I will find the following description </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you one sum the the size of all these fields we see that 30+30+30+4+30+1 equals 125 bytes and not 128 bytes. The missing three bytes can be found at the very beginning of the tag, before the song title. These three bytes are always "TAG" and is the identification that this is indeed a ID3 tag. The easiest way to find a ID3v1/1.1 tag is to look for the word "TAG" 128 bytes from the end of a file. </p>

<p>There is another version, called ID3v2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the design goals were that the ID3v2 should be very flexible and expandable...
  Since each frame can be 16MB and the entire tag can be 256MB you'll probably never again be in the same situation as when you tried to write a useful comment in the old ID3 being limited to 30 characters. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ID3v2 always starts at the begin of an audio file, as you can read here: <a href="http://id3.org/ID3v2Easy" rel="nofollow">http://id3.org/ID3v2Easy</a></p>

<pre><code>ID3v2/file identifier   "ID3"
ID3v2 version           $03 00
ID3v2 flags             %abc00000
ID3v2 size              4 * %0xxxxxxx
</code></pre>

<p>The ID3v2 tag size is encoded with four bytes where the most significant bit (bit 7) is set to zero in every byte, making a total of 28 bits. The zeroed bits are ignored, so a 257 bytes long tag is represented as $00 00 02 01. </p>
