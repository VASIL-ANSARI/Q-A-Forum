<p>Not enough code to look at, the posted snippets are not relevant to font scaling.</p>

<p>The big difference between a printed page and an image is the drastic difference in resolution.  600 dpi vs 96 dpi, typically.  Default scaling for the printer is 1 pixel = 0.01 inch, making text and images almost the same size when rendered to the screen vs paper.  Changing that scaling causes the kind of trouble you're having.</p>

<p>Look for any assignments to Graphics.PageUnit in your code, for example.</p>
