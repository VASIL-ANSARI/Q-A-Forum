<p>I think something like this should work:</p>

<pre><code>this.getData = function(){ 
   var deferred = $.Deferred();
   deferred.resolve(new Binary(this.data));
   return deferred.promise();
};
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of returning the data itself, you return a <code>promise</code>, which in this case has already been resolved, so the <code>done</code> callback can get called immediately with the data you resolve it with.</p>
