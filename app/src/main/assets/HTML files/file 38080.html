<p>You must declare your AppWidgetProvider class implementation as a broadcast receiver using the  element in the AndroidManifest.</p>

<p>You should not create a new broadcast receiver as the the AppWidgetProvider class extends BroadcastReceiver. The Widget has the same runtime restrictions as a normal broadcast receiver, i.e., it has only 5 seconds to finish its processing.
Hence the widget should therefore perform time consuming operations in a service and perform the update of the widgets from the service.</p>

<p>It receives following callbacks:</p>

<pre><code>onReceive(Context, Intent) //As it extends the BroadCastReceiver.
onUpdate()
onAppWidgetOptionsChanged()
onDeleted(Context, int[])
onEnabled(Context)
onDisabled(Context)
</code></pre>
