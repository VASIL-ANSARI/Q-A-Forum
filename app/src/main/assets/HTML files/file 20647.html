<p>A C-style array has no concept of an "empty" element. The element will always have a value. You may decide that some value denotes an empty element but that's up to you. If your "empty" placeholder value is named <code>empty</code>, you could do something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>auto empty_it = std::find(std::begin(arr), std::end(arr), empty);
std::rotate(empty_it, empty_it + 1, std::end(arr));
</code></pre>

<p>This will move the first empty element to the back of the array.</p>

<p>You'd be much better off using a <code>std::vector</code>, <code>std::list</code>, or other standard library container. They provide functions for removing elements from the container without you having to care about shifting elements around. For example:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
v.erase(v.begin() + 3);
for (auto&amp; x : v) {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " ";
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will print <code>0 1 2 4 5 6</code>. The <code>3</code> has been removed from the container.</p>
