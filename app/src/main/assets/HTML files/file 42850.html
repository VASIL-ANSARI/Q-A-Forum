<p>jQuery doesn't have cookie support built in. If you grabbed that sample code from somewhere you will also need to include the cookie plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When you set the cookie in lines like these:</p>

<pre><code>$.cookie('currentToggle', $("#secondaryfilter").hasClass('no-filters')?'on':'off' );
</code></pre>

<p>You are just creating a session cookie. This means that the browser will throw the cookie away when you close it. If you want this to be persisted next time they come back then you need to add in an expiry date like:</p>

<pre><code>var currentToggle = $("#secondaryfilter").hasClass('no-filters')?'on':'off');
$.cookie('currentToggle', currentToggle, { expires: 7 });
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that I can't see any problem with your code, although I am wondering if you worded your question correctly as these two lines seem to contradict each other:</p>

<ol>
<li>The toggle states are saved to cookies on and are maintained on page refresh.</li>
<li>I dont know how to save the toggle text state to a cookie also.</li>
</ol>
