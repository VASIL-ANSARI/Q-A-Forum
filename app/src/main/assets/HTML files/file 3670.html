<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "coarse".</p>

<p>"should my model contain methods that are much broader such as: add_record, delete_record, update_record"</p>

<p>Absolutely not.  Never.  That defeats the purpose of having a model.</p>

<p>That kind of "general-purpose" stuff is what a database is for.  The point of a model is to adapt the general database to your specific problem.</p>

<p>Your model should be specific to your problem.</p>

<p>"user model with functions such as: add_user, delete_user, activate_user"  That's the point.  Your model reflects your application, your problem domain, your solution.</p>

<p>Your model should be able to -- in effect -- stand alone.  You should be able to wrap your model in a command-line app or a GUI app or a web page.</p>
