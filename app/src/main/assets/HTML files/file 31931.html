<p>I think you are talking about the Monitor principle. This is used to avoid deadlocks while accessing data on memory, that is shared with many threads or processes.</p>

<p>If you doing so, please inform yourself about the synchronized block in Java. This ensures that no other thread can access this object at the same time as the thread who is holding the synchronized block in his method body. If the other ones wants to access this data, while you are in synchronzied block, the others have to wait until the current worker thread has leave this state on the relevant object/data.</p>
