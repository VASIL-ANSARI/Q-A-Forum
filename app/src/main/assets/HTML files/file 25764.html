<p>I guess they are using different approaches interpreting the color precision. A 32-bit screen is in fact only 24-bit color (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#Direct_color" rel="nofollow">8 last bits is not part of the color space</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.screen.colorDepth" rel="nofollow">Mozilla defines</a> it as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns the color depth of the screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chrome seem to read it directly from the system as-is, while FF and IE9 seem to correctly (based on that definition) identify the color precision (color depth) of the screen.</p>

<p>Please note that <code>screen.colorDepth</code> is not part of any standard and it's up to the implementers how it actually works.</p>

<p>The more correct way of checking color-precision in regards to color depth would therefor be:</p>

<pre><code>case 16: document.bgColor = "..." ;
         break;
case 24:
case 32: document.bgColor = "..."; //32 = 24 bit color depth + 8 bits alpha
         break;
</code></pre>
