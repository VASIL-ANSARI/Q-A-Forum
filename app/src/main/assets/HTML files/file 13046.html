<p>This issue is related with Facebook caching URLs. It appears when you like the content, then unlike and trying to like it again within short time span. The simple solution is to add random hash at the end of the <code>data-href=""</code>, e.g. using <a href="http://php.net/uniqid" rel="nofollow">uniqid()</a>.</p>

<p>Note that OpenGraph tags scrapper will follow the last <code>og:url</code>. Therefore, even if you have random hash appended to <code>date-href</code> parameter, as long as the URL being liked has its own <code>og:url</code> tag, counter is going to function properly.</p>
