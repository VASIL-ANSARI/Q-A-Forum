<p>Since you tagged regex, here's a regular expression replacement that will match and replace based on what you said:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class=MsoNormal [^&gt;]*style='[^']*(text-align:[A-Za-z]*;?)[^']*'&gt;(.*?)&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Replacement:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p style='$1'&gt;$2&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It's not particularly efficient or necessarily the best way to do it. Subtle bugs would be if the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag contains another nested <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (I'm pretty sure this isn't valid mark-up, but thought it best to mention anyway) since it would match the closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> of the nested <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> instead of the outer one we're trying to match. </p>

<p>Another potential bug is that it will mess up if there are nested escaped single quotes inside the <code>style</code> element, such as <code>style='attr=\'value\';text-align:center;'</code>. This is possible to fix with a more complicated regular expression, but at the risk of making it pretty unreadable.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a solution involving parsing would be a lot better, such as NiftyDude's suggestion with javascript.</p>
