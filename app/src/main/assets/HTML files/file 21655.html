<p>The better approach would be to store another table:</p>

<pre><code>Name | Time  | Value
--------------------
Joe  | 10:00 |  9
Joe  | 11:00 | 45
Joe  | 12:00 | 12
Joe  | 13:00 | 23
</code></pre>

<p>Then you don't have to do <em>anything</em> to update, you just add a new row when you want to add a value.</p>
