<p>I updated your <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Brocco/xHmLT/18/" rel="nofollow">fiddle</a> and is working as you'd intended...</p>

<p>Your select is now populated via ng-options and the model is visible.post (as an object). As a result anywhere showing visible.post, is now showing visible.post.Name (field on the object)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select ng-options="s.Name for s in shots" ng-model="visible.post"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The initialization of the selected value is done in the success promise handler:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.visible.post = $scope.shots[0];
</code></pre>
