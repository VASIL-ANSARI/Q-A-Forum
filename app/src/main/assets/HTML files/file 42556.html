<p>Yes, it will always have that output.</p>

<p>The callback inside a <code>setTimeout</code> will not be called until the execution context is clear - i.e. the currently executing sequence of code has finished.</p>

<p>This means that even if you do </p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function () { console.log("1 second!"); }, 1000);

var start = +new Date();
while ((+new Date()) - start &lt; 5000) {}
</code></pre>

<p><code>1 second!</code> will not be logged any sooner than 5 seconds have passed.</p>
