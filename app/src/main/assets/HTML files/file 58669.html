<p>Try to load the property as an optional:</p>

<pre><code>let amount = aDecoder.decodeObject(forKey: PropertyKey.amountKey) as Double?
</code></pre>

<p>Also, in order to get the property from the storage you must save it first. If it is not saved yet, you should handle the case it's <code>nil</code>.</p>
