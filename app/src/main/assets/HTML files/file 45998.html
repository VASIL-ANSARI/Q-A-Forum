<p>What you see, in the role of user, when a notification fires depends on your settings in preferences. You'd need to go to Settings and configure this app to display banners and to display notifications in the lock screen.</p>

<p>Also I would suggest that for purposes of testing you should schedule the notification at a bit later interval. You are saying <code>NSDate(timeIntervalSinceNow: 5)</code> - that is not very much time to get yourself out of the app! The notification may be firing while you are still in the app â in which case no banner will appear. </p>
