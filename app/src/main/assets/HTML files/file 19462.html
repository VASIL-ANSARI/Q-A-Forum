<p>If you were going to start from scratch, a useful search term would be "tree diff".</p>

<p>There's a pretty awesome blog post <a href="http://useless-factor.blogspot.com/2008/01/matching-diffing-and-merging-xml.html">here</a>, although I just found it by googling "daisydiff python" so I bet you've already seen it. Besides all the interesting theoretical stuff, he mentions the existence of <a href="http://www.logilab.org/859">Logilab's <code>xmldiff</code></a>, an open-source XML differ written in Python. That might be a decent starting point â maybe less correct than trying to wrap or reimplement DaisyDiff, but probably easier to get up and running quickly.</p>

<p>There's also <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/html-tree-diff/0.1.2">html-tree-diff</a> on pypi, which I found via this Quora link: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-good-Python-implementation-of-a-tree-diff-algorithm">http://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-good-Python-implementation-of-a-tree-diff-algorithm</a></p>

<p>There's some theoretical stuff about tree diffing at <a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/10205/efficient-diff-algorithm-for-trees-and-levenshtein-distance">efficient diff algorithm for trees and Levenshtein distance</a> on cstheory.stackexchange.</p>

<p>BTW, just to clarify, you <em>are</em> talking about diffing two DOM trees, but not necessarily rendering the diff/merge back into any particular HTML, right? <strong>(EDIT: Right.)</strong> A lot of the similarly-worded questions on here are really asking "how can I color deleted lines red and added lines green" or "how can I make matching paragraphs line up visually", skipping right over the theoretical hard part of "how do I diff two DOM trees in the first place" and the practical hard part of "how do I parse possibly malformed HTML into a DOM tree even before that". :)</p>
