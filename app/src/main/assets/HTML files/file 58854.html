<p>There is a system cache for images per the documentation of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiimage/1624146-init" rel="nofollow"><code>UIImage.init(named:)</code></a>; you cannot manually flush it but Apple's design intention is that you wouldn't ever get any benefit from doing so if you could â like all <code>NSCache</code>-type caches it'll automatically flush itself should memory ever become scarce. So in the meantime all a flush would achieve would be fewer cache hits and expenditure of the processor cycles required for the flush.</p>

<p>The documentation advises use of <code>imageWithContentsOfFile:</code> if you want to avoid the cache but if you're loading or being loaded from a XIB or Storyboard then you don't have sufficient direct control to assert influence.</p>
