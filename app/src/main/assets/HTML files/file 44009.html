<pre><code>sum(1) -&gt; ref Function(y)
sum(1)(2) -&gt; invocation Function(2)
Function(2) -&gt; 1 + (sum(y) -&gt; sum(2) -&gt; ref Function(y))
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>1 + (ref Function(y))</code>, as you can see, you're adding a number and a reference.</p>

<p>The javascript is thinking that you're trying to concatenate, hence it calls <code>ToString</code> method of <code>Function</code>, internally, which gives the function body as a string.</p>

<p>So, the next time you call, you're calling on a String and hence the error as String isn't a function.</p>

<p>A correct code would be what Bergi has implemented.</p>
