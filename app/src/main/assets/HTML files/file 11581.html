<p>This has been <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=stackoverflow%20core%20plot%20xcode%204&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">asked (and answered) a number of times</a> on this site alone. The most helpful suggestion on those (many) similar questions that reference the blog post you mentioned says you should read that post's comments since the post refers to older code.</p>

<p>If all else fails, create a new test project and try following the (comment-updated) instructions again. If it still doesn't work, update your question with <strong>much more detail</strong> regarding what you tried and where it went wrong. Include build logs, run logs, etc. - we're not mind readers.</p>
