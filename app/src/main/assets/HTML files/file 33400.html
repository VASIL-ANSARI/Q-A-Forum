  <p>To get the access of database you need to contact to you hosting
  company and ask for database access . If possible ask them to provide
  you the access of phpmyadmin. Then you will be able to access the
  database.</p>
  
  <p>Even if you do not find contents on MYSQL database . Try this link
  <a href="http://archive.org/web/" rel="nofollow">http://archive.org/web/</a> and try to find the the most recent copy of
  your web pages. At least you will be able to get the original contents
  and structure of you site.</p>

<p>I hope it helps</p>
