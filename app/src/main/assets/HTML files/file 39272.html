<p>One way to do it is using a cursor/collection observer.  I'm using this method in my Meteor app to update a Flot chart and it works great.</p>

<p>After your initial plot creation in <code>Template.example.rendered</code> function, add a cursor observer that updates your chart anytime a new document is added (or removed) on the collection:</p>

<pre><code>//  Subscribe to collection (or no need to do this if it's already done on your route)
Meteor.subscribe('dataReadings', someFilterVarOrNot);

//  Add a cursor observer for all documents added with a date greater 
//  than right now (uses moment.js)
//  (If you don't do this, you'll get an "added" fire for every document 
//  that's ALREADY been added - not sure why it does this but it does
dataReadingsObserveHandle = DataReadings.find({
  createdAt: {$gte: moment().toDate()}}).observe({

    //  Fires anytime a new document is added
    added: function(dataReading) {
      $('#flot').data("plot").setData(dataReading.data);
      $('#flot').data("plot").draw();

      //  Or setup whatever query/calculation you need to assemble a 
      //  new data set for your chart, there are also some other observers like
      //  observeChanges() which let you see how a document has changed versus
      //  being added or removed
    },

    //  Fires anytime a document is removed
    removed: function(removedDataReading) {
      //  Update and redraw chart like above...
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>dataReadingsObserveHandle</code> is intentionally global so you can destroy it later because apparently a collection observer is server intensive.  This doesn't necessarily have to be global if you have scope access to it wherever it would need to be destroyed:</p>

<pre><code>//  Once your chart no longer needs to be updated call...
dataReadingsObserveHandle.stop();
dataReadingsObserveHandle = null;
</code></pre>

<p>I believe when a user navigates to a different template and is no longer looking at your chart, the observer automatically gets destroyed.  See <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#observe" rel="nofollow">http://docs.meteor.com/#observe</a> for more information.</p>

<p>I would love to hear about other methods to do this using <code>ReactiveVar</code> or <code>Deps.dependency</code>.  Especially if they're more efficient</p>
