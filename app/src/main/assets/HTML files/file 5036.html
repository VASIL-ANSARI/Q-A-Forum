<p>Try to create a new php.ini file in the directory from where you are executing your script with your required php.ini environment variables.. Also, if it's cPanel hosting that you are using.. there's one more setting that you need to change in the cPanel.. you might be allowed access to turn this setting on or off depending on your web host. I'll post the setting in a moment.. Please confirm if you use cPanel hosting?</p>
