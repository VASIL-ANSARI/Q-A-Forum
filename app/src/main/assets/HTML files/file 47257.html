<p>The other projects are seeing that the <code>:ThirdPartyLibraryWrapper</code> project depends on an artifact called <code>ThirdPartyLibrary-0.1.0:aar</code>. Java (and Android) libraries do not bundle their own dependencies together - instead, they simply publish a list of their dependencies. The consuming project is then responsible for loading not only the library it directly depends on, but all of the libraries <em>that library</em> depends on.</p>

<p>The net effect of this is that <code>:MyAppFree</code> is loading in <code>:ThirdPartyLibraryWrapper</code>, then seeing that <code>:ThirdPartyLibraryWrapper</code> depends on <code>ThirdPartyLibrary-0.1.0:aar</code> and so thus trying to load that in as well. However, <code>:MyAppFree</code> doesn't know where <code>ThirdPartyLibrary-0.1.0:aar</code> lives.. and so it fails.</p>

<p>The solution will be to place similar <code>repositories</code> blocks in all your other projects. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>repositories {
    flatDir {
        dirs project(':ThirdPartyLibraryWrapper').file('libs')
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>project(...).file(...)</code> method will free you from having to hardcode paths, and will instead use the Gradle DSL to resolve the filesystem path by looking up the project and having it do the resolution dynamically.</p>
