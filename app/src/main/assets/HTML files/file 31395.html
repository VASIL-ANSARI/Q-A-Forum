<p>That second line has a number of issues. You have unescaped double quotes inside a double-quoted string, and appear to be trying to concatenate without using the concatenate operator.</p>

<p>Change your second line to this:</p>

<pre><code>echo "&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src='$src' height='30px' width='30px'&gt;&lt;/td&gt;";
</code></pre>

<p>This now has double quotes only at the beginning and end, with single quotes inside. The <code>$src</code> variable will be parsed and work properly since it is in a double-quoted string.</p>

<p>This may be some helpful reading: <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php</a></p>
