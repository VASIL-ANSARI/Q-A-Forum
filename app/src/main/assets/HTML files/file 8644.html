<p>Your syntax looks perfectly fine, so chances are that there might be an issue with the way you are passing in the access token.  </p>

<p>I just look a look at some code I had written, and I'm passing in app ID and app secret, not the access token.  I'm not sure if makes a difference or not since I wrote that code a while ago, but it might.</p>

<p>If you are using PHP, you can use the PHP SDK for Facebook.  This will let you write slightly less verbose code which will be easier to maintain.  You can find it here: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/sdks/" rel="nofollow">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/sdks/</a></p>

<p>Using it I write this to call FQL queries:</p>

<pre><code>    $facebook = new Facebook(array(
        'appId'  =&gt; $fb_config["app_id"],
        'secret' =&gt; $fb_config["secret"],           
        'cookie' =&gt; true,));

    $params = array( 
        'queries' =&gt; $queries,
        'method' =&gt; "fql.multiquery"
    );
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on what you are trying to do you can also use the Graph API to get data.  In the example you are using the Graph API might be simpler.  But if you are trying to get complicated data then FQL would be better.</p>
