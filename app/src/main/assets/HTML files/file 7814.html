<p>I understand why you'd need to have a sequential upgrade of your schema changes but why would you do the same with your application instead of a one-step upgrade? Anyway, there are deployment tools like KwateeSDCM or Capistrano that can automate the deployment to dev/qa/production servers. KwateeSDCM keeps an MD5 hash of every file which allows it to to differential upgrades which is nice when you have large applications with frequent upgrades that impact only small files so it ends up doing pretty much what you want.</p>
