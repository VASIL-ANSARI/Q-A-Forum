<p>You don't need fulltext indices for each column, but a single fulltext index covering both columns</p>

<pre><code>FULLTEXT_INDEX(topic, country)
</code></pre>

<p>Having a single index on each column will <strong>not</strong> work</p>

<pre><code>FULLTEXT(topic); FULLTEXT(country); /* will not work as expected */
</code></pre>

<p>I also think that order is important, but I could be mistaken in that regard</p>
