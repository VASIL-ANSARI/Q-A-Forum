<p>you can try to make two sperate buttons(action) for movie and image. when the user wants to capture image disable the editing. Or, I would go with 
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/UIImagePickerController/UIImagePickerController.html" rel="nofollow">Fully-Customized Media Capture and Browsing</a> which will enable you to do many flexible  things</p>

<p>EDIT: Also 'cameraOverlayView' can help. you make a custom view where you make button to handle the event.  </p>
