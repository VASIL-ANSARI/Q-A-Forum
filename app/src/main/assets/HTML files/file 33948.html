<p>Since images are <code>uchar</code>, what you want to do is the equivalent of </p>

<pre><code>if(selected_pixel==255) 
     selected_pixel = 1; 
else 
     selected_pixel = 0 
</code></pre>

<p>You can create mask, that would be easier. I don't know in <strong>java ImagePlus</strong> but in <strong>matlab</strong> it is <code>mask = image==255;</code>. </p>

<p>Try to use those kind of matrix operations according to your need. I'm sure these methods should be somewhere inside the library(if ImagePlus is image processing library.) </p>
