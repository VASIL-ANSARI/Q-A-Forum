<p>You need to pass some information to the <code>UIViewController</code> which has the <code>UIWebViews</code>, saying which button was pressed. Then, based on that information, decide which of the <code>UIWebViews</code> to display.</p>

<p>As you are using storyboards, I suggest you look into <code>prepareForSegue</code>. It will allow you to set a property on the destination view controller with something like the following. You should add this to the <code>UIViewController</code> which contains the buttons.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {
    if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@"buttonOne"]) {
        ExampleViewController *destViewController = segue.destinationViewController;
        destViewController.buttonClicked = @"One";
    } else if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@"buttonTwo"]) {
        ExampleViewController *destViewController = segue.destinationViewController;
        destViewController.buttonClicked = @"Two";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use the <code>buttonClicked</code> property in the destination view controller to decide which you should display. If you have two separate <code>UIWebViews</code>, you could choose to hide one using <code>webViewOne.hidden = YES;</code> and show the other using <code>webViewTwo.hidden = NO;</code>.</p>

<p>However, it would probably be neater to only have a single <code>UIWebView</code>. You could then use <code>prepareForSeque</code> to pass in the URL of the PDF you would like it to display, rather than just sending the name of the button clicked.</p>
