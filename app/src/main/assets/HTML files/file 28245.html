  <p>Do I need to switch layout managers, or is there a way to add column headers to each panel? Glue seems like an idea, but I am not sure how to position the header at the very top, while still centering the other buttons.</p>

<p>Wrap a <code>JPanel</code> around each of your columns with a <code>BorderLayout</code> and put the header in the <code>BorderLayout.NORTH</code>. The original column panel can be put in the <code>BorderLayout.CENTER</code>.</p>

<p>There is no need to stick to just one layout. Typically it is easier to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5630271/1076463">nest different layouts</a> to obtain a result</p>
