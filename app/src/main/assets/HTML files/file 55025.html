<p>You connected to the database using the <code>mysqli_</code> library.</p>

<p>Then you tried to query it with the (obsolete) <code>mysql_</code> library.</p>

<p>The latter doesn't have a connection to the database, so it tried to open one (and failed).</p>

<p>Pick one library and use it consistently. </p>
