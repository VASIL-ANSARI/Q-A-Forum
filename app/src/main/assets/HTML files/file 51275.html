<p>1)  Yes.  The group by appears in the sub-select</p>

<pre><code>(
    select  w.essn
    from   works_on w
    group by w.essn
    having count(*) &gt;= 2
)
</code></pre>

<p>2) "as" creates an alias, in this case "e" for "employee".  This lets you avoid the tediousness of writing employee everywhere.  Some SQL databases don't require the "as" but it's generally a good idea since it makes your intention clear.</p>

<p>3) "Having" is like a "Where" that operates on each member of a group by clause.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Having_%28SQL%29" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Having_%28SQL%29</a></p>
