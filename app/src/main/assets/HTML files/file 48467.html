<p>You can put the icons anywhere inside the cordova project and it must be relative to the root. So if you put the icons in <code>www</code>, the path must include <code>www</code>.</p>

<p>You don't have to use <code>res</code> or <code>drawable-*</code> in the path you use with Cordova: just put them where you want to.</p>

<p>Note that currently (5.1.1) declaring an icon without density seems to be ignored for Android platform</p>
