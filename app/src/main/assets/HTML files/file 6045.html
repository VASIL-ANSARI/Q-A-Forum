  <p>Is it possible to make IE less sensitive to trivial markup mistakes like this?</p>

<p>No, it's not, <em>output valid markup</em>.  More so by having <code>XHTML 1.0 Strict</code> as your DOCTYPE you're telling the browser "this is perfect", it's one of the top 3 strictest markup DOCTYPEs you can have.</p>

<p>IE can't render a 100% valid page right most of the time, it certainly won't tolerate most invalid ones...fixing the markup is by far the best option, not trying to make the browser cope with it.  After all <em>you</em> control your markup, you don't control the browser (or any updates it may get...or which browser the user's using).  By having valid markup, you've done the best first step in ensuring it renders as close as possible across browsers.</p>

<p>Think of it this way, you're "oops" <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tag...what would you do?  Which <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> was that <em>supposed</em> to close?  You want the browser to take a stab at it, possibly rendering a <em>very</em> improperly formated page?  It can't know what you <em>intended</em>, all it knows is what markup it received.</p>
