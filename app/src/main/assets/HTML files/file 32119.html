<p>You'll want to use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="nofollow"><code>HashMap</code></a> to avoid recalculating the same numbers multiple times. Checking if the HashMap already contains the number is a quick process and can save you many steps.</p>

<p>For Example:
If you get to the number 200,000 for a second time, you already know how many more steps in the Collatz sequence.</p>
