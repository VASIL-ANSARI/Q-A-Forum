<p>You are using, as private key, a PEM-encoded object in a format which is mostly specific to OpenSSL. At its root, it is an ASN.1-based structure, encoded in DER, then re-encoded in Base64 (to make it ASCII-compatible), and finally equipped with some headers (the "BEGIN DSA PRIVATE KEY"). On the other hand, <code>ImportCsbBlob()</code> expects a bunch of bytes compatible with what <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa381988%28v=VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">CryptoAPI expects</a>: a custom, Microsoft-specific encoding of the DSA key elements.</p>

<p>I have used an awful lot of acronyms in the paragraph above in order to underline the fact that converting from one encoding to another <em>is</em> a complex matter. Those things are heavily layered and very different from each other.</p>
