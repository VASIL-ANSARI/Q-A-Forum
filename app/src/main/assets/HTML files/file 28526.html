<p>From the ubuntu pthreads information sheet (LinuxThreads)):</p>

<pre><code>      In addition to the main (initial) thread, and the threads  that  the
      program  creates using pthread_create(3), the implementation creates
      a  "manager"  thread.   This  thread  handles  thread  creation  and
      termination.   (Problems  can result if this thread is inadvertently
      killed.)

   -  Signals are used internally by the implementation.  On Linux 2.2 and
      later,  the  first three real-time signals are used.
</code></pre>

<p>Other implementations use the first two RT signals.  Set SIGRTMIN above these two/three signals that used by threading management.  See what your pthreads(7) man page says about SIGRTMIN. And adjust accordingly.</p>
