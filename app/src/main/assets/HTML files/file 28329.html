<p>You need to understand what references are for first.  A reference is like a permanent pointer to another variable that cannot be changed to refer to something else, and cannot be null.  Since it can't be null, it makes no sense to declare a reference without saying what it refers to.</p>

<p>You can say</p>

<pre><code>std::ofstream outfile_;
std::ofstream&amp; outfil = outfile_;
</code></pre>

<p>if you're still interested in playing with references.</p>
