<p>There only real reason to remove your NSLog entries is to save on memory consumption by running unnecessary code, but unless you're consistenly adding data, it shouldn't be too much of an issue.
Furthermore, if a user has an issue such as app crash, etc. NSlogs can be submitted which the dev can read to work out the reason for the crash. If you're loading the NSlog with a great deal of unnecessary data, it can be troublesome at a later date if you need to go through said log to find a user's issue in order to fix the issue. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I wouldn't worry too much about removing them. That's my 2 cents anyhow.</p>
