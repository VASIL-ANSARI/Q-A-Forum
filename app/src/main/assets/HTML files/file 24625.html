<p>The approach is correct (wrap your Tkinter widgets in a class with the event handler functions as methods), but you forgot to set the widgets as attributes of the class using the reference to <code>self</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Board(Frame):
    def __init__(self,parent):
        # ...
        self.c = Canvas(frame2,width=480,height=480)
        self.c.pack(expand=YES,fill=BOTH)
        # ...

    def place_player_down(self):
        # Use 'self.c', not just 'c'
</code></pre>

<p>I think you want to do something similar with the value <code>number</code>, but it that case I would send it as an argument to <code>place_player_down</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def roll(self):
    number=randint(2,12)
    if b==0:
        self.place_player_down(number)
    return number  # Keep in mind that this value is returned but not used anymore

def place_player_down(self, number):
    # Use 'number'
</code></pre>
