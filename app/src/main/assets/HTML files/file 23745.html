<p>I would separate ViewModels used by web project and DTO's used by business layer.</p>

<p>The reason is that probably you don't need property <code>ShowAdminLinks</code> or some dropdown values in business layer. So business layer knows only about the data it needs to know.</p>

<p>This way you get yourself clean multi-tier application. Of course it means you got to do a bit more coding with creating and setting DTOs values. Some use <a href="https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper" rel="nofollow">automapper</a> for that, but i prefer not to. Why? It's not too hard to do it manually and better yet - no magic.</p>
