<p>The comparison</p>

<pre><code>if (array === [])
</code></pre>

<p>compares the <em>identity</em> of two objects. One object is <em>never</em> equal to (the same as) another, different object, at least in the sense that "equality" is defined in JavaScript. Object comparisons in JavaScript are always just a test to see whether some expression refers to some particular known object or not. The comparisons do not "look inside" the compared objects.</p>

<p>One perhaps non-obvious detail is that the expression <code>[]</code> is not a reference to some global, conceptual "the empty array"; it is a request to create a <em>brand new</em> empty array. Thus it's also the case that the comparison</p>

<pre><code>if ([] === [])
</code></pre>

<p>will be false, because on both sides of the <code>===</code> operator a new, distinct array is created.</p>
