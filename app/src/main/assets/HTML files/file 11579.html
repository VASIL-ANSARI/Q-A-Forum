<p>AFAIK jQuery is written in strict mode (EDIT: not so de iure, but author says it is compatible). Crockford's jslint uses "use strict" at the very beginning (I saw the source code few days ago). I'd say nearly every modern framework which can afford that is strict mode, since it is a bonus point for the framework itself.</p>

<p>Even it wasn't so, your work is not lost, since by adhering to strict mode, you make your code better (it forces you to avoid some of the sins).</p>
