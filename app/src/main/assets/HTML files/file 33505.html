<p>If you are asking how to change the values of individual elements in a 2D array to null, you would do this:</p>

<pre><code> gameBoard[row][col] = null;
</code></pre>

<p>But since you have a 2D char array, you can't do that as char is a primitive type and does not allow having a null value. You could use a different char value to represent empty, or you could make a 2D array have Character objects, but a better solution might be a 2D array of an enumeration type such as:</p>

<pre><code>public enum TicTacToeSquareValue { x, o, empty }
.... later on:
gameBoard[row][col] = TicTacToeSquareValue.empty;
</code></pre>
