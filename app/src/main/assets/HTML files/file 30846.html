<p>After digging through the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#always" rel="nofollow">Android Activity documentation</a>, I tried a different property in my root Activity:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:name=".InteamalloyActivity"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait"
    android:clearTaskOnLaunch="true" &lt;!-- This property --&gt;
    android:label="inTeamAlloy"  
    android:theme="@style/Theme.Titanium" 
    android:configChanges="keyboardHidden"&gt;
        &lt;intent-filter&gt;
            &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
            &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;
        &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With the <strong>clearTaskOnLaunch</strong> property, according to the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether or not all activities will be removed from the task, except
  for the root activity, whenever it is re-launched from the home screen
  â "true" if the task is always stripped down to its root activity, and
  "false" if not. The default value is "false". This attribute is
  meaningful only for activities that start a new task (the root
  activity); it's ignored for all other activities in the task. When the
  value is "true", every time users start the task again, they are
  brought to its root activity regardless of what they were last doing
  in the task and regardless of whether they used the Back or Home
  button to leave it. When the value is "false", the task may be cleared
  of activities in some situations (see the alwaysRetainTaskState
  attribute), but not always.</p>
  
  <p>Suppose, for example, that someone launches activity P from the home
  screen, and from there goes to activity Q. The user next presses Home,
  and then returns to activity P. Normally, the user would see activity
  Q, since that is what they were last doing in P's task. However, if P
  set this flag to "true", all of the activities on top of it (Q in this
  case) were removed when the user pressed Home and the task went to the
  background. So the user sees only P when returning to the task.</p>
  
  <p>If this attribute and allowTaskReparenting are both "true", any
  activities that can be re-parented are moved to the task they share an
  affinity with; the remaining activities are then dropped, as described
  above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this, when the root activity is the one being active when the application is sent to the background, the application will restart after the task related to the root activity is killed by the operative system. While this is not the optimal and most desired behaviour in an app, it certainly is the way to go when using Titanium.</p>
