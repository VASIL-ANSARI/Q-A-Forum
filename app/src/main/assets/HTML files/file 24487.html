<p>If you want to go to an specific site when op==back you should just redirect it in you php code</p>

<pre><code> if(isset($_GET['op']) &amp;&amp; $_GET['op'] == 'back'){
      header('location: yourpath/youurl.php');
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to do this before echoing anything.</p>

<p>If you want to trigger a click when this option is set just print an script conditionally with a document ready and a $('#back').trigger('click') if you are using jQuery:</p>

<pre><code> //$go = (isset($_GET['op']) &amp;&amp; $_GET['op'] == 'back');
 {if $go}
 &lt;script&gt;
   $(document).ready(function(){
        $('#back').trigger('click');
   });
 &lt;/script&gt;
 {/if}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>Clicking on that link will make the browser got to another page, unless you have used something like e.preventDefault(). If you haven't I would recommend using the first solution i proposed.
If you need the request to get to the client, an then redirect, for any reason, or you do something else I would use the second solution.</p>

<p>Hope it helps</p>
