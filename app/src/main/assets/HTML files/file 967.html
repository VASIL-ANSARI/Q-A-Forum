<p>What type? should it be optimised for embedded washing machine controllers, cell phones, workstations or supercomputers?<br />
Should it prioritise gui responsiveness or server loading?<br />
should it use lots of memory or lots of CPU?</p>

<p>C/c++ is used in just too many different circumstances.
I suspect something like boost smart pointers will be enough for most users</p>

<p>Edit - Automatic garbage collectors aren't so much a problem of performance (you can always buy more server) it's a question of predicatable performance.<br />
Not knowing when the GC is going to kick in is like employing a narcoleptic airline pilot, most of the time they are great - but when you really need responsiveness!</p>
