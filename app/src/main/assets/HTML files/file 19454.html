<p>I had a similar issue like this. If I recall correctly (its been a while), I ended up creating a table in a DB to store file names and session keys/time. Each time the script loaded, if there was a dead session in the database, the corresponding session and image/file was deleted.</p>

<p>I don't know if that's a good solution or not, but it solved the multiple user access problem for me.</p>
