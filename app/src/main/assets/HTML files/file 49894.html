<p>I suggest using a fuction to make things a LOT easier i use this myself(because im bias on coding :p)</p>

<pre><code>    function dbConnect($host,$user,$pass,$db){
     $connect = mysql_connect($host,$user,$pass);
     $database = mysql_select_db($db);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then where u want to make connect just add</p>

<pre><code>    dbConnect(localhost,"username","password","database");
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:the reason its not working is because your checking to see if 'Submit' is posted when u should be checking if 'submit' is being posted because ur button name is 'submit' lowercase</p>
