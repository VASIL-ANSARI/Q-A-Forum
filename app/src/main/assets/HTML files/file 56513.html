<p>You are missing a from clause and a correlation condition in the subquery.</p>

<p>Without a from clause, the <code>td</code> in the subselect is the same as the <code>td</code> in the outer select, in other words one of <code>'01'</code> or <code>'02'</code> and the where clause test eliminates the row, resulting in a NULL.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    name, 
    CASE WHEN td in ('01', '02') 
         THEN (SELECT TOP 1 td
               FROM TdTest InnerTDTest -- table to look in
               WHERE InnerTDTest.Name = TDTest.Name -- only look at matching rows.
               AND td not in ('01', '02') 
               ORDER BY paydate DESC) 
         ELSE td 
    END
FROM tdtest
</code></pre>
