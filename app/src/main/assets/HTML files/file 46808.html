<p>Change the place where the function is called.If you bind the function call to the button and inside that you prevent the default action the ajax will be done</p>

<p>something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button type="submit" onclick="createComment(event);" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and at the beginning of the function</p>

<pre><code>function createComment(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>the preventDefault prevent the normal submit button to send the form as "default" and reload the page. I think that your ajax was not fired because the process start whe the page is reloading and you just can't see the result. </p>
