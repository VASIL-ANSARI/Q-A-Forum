<p>A <code>TreeSet</code>'s element doesn't have to implement <code>Comparable</code>, since you can pass a <code>Comparator</code> to one of <code>TreeSet</code>'s constructors in order to impose an ordering for elements that don't implement <code>Comparable</code> (or for elements that do implement <code>Comparable</code> when you want to use an ordering other than the natural ordering defined by <code>Comparable</code>).</p>
