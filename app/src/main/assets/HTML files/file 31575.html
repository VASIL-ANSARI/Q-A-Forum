<p><code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError</code> means the <em>runtime</em> version of the class in the classpath is not the same as that at <em>compile</em> time.</p>

<p>Your stacktrace does not have the <code>ClassNotFoundError</code> - so your problem could be multiple versions of the class being found when the server is deploying. ListableBeanFactory is part of spring-beans.jar</p>

<p>Can you search for how many versions of the spring-beans.jar are found in the run time server environment i.e. within Tomcat as part of the boorstrap you added and also within your own webapp libraries under WEB-INF?<br>
May be there are multiples or <em>the versions are clashing with each other</em>.</p>

<p>Also looks like you're running Tomcat within your IDE in which case you'll have to search in the right location. </p>
