<p>First have a look at <a href="http://www.programcreek.com/2011/11/what-do-java-objects-look-like-in-memory/" rel="nofollow">What do Java objects look like in memory during run-time? </a> and <a href="http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.de/2013/05/know-thy-java-object-memory-layout.html" rel="nofollow">Know Thy Java Object Memory Layout </a>.</p>

<p>But I guess <a href="http://www.codeinstructions.com/2008/12/java-objects-memory-structure.html" rel="nofollow">Java Objects Memory Structure</a> answers your question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to save some memory, the Sun VM doesn't lay out object's attributes in the same order they are declared. Instead, the attributes are organized in memory in the following order:</p>

<pre><code>doubles and longs
ints and floats
shorts and chars
booleans and bytes
references
</code></pre>
