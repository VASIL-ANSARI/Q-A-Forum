<p>Try to put thoses simples functions definitions in Test.h :</p>

<pre><code>bool TestAdd() {return true;}
bool TestSubtr() {return true;}
bool TestTranspose() {return true;}
bool TestMultMatrices() {return true;}
bool TestMultByScalar() {return true;}
</code></pre>

<p>Also make sure than Test.h is in the same folder as main.cpp. It should compile without errors. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The problem you face is than all your tests functions are members of the class Test and cannot be called directly without creating an instance of the Test class. You can create an instance like this in main() :</p>

<pre><code>Test myTest;
</code></pre>

<p>After that you can call your members functions like this within main() :</p>

<pre><code>add = myTest.TestAdd();
</code></pre>

<p>Also, presently your functions are only declared in Test.h, but they have no content. Function content goes within brackets { }. Normally, you declare the function in the .h file and you put the function content in .cpp file. Hoewever, this is not mandatory and you can put content in the .h file.</p>

<p>To get your code to compile, replace your functions declarations by complete functions :</p>

<pre><code>bool TestAdd();
</code></pre>

<p>becomes :</p>

<pre><code>bool TestAdd(){return true;}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
