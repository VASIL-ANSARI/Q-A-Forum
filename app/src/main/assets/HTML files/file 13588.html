<p>The dictionary passed to cache is not copied.  As long as the <code>cache</code> variable is not <strong>rebound</strong> inside the function, it stays the same object, and modifications to the dictionary it refers to will affect the dictionary outside.</p>

<p>There is not even any need to return <code>cache</code> in this case (and indeed the sample code does not).</p>

<p>It might be better if <code>f</code> was a method on a dictionary-like object, to make this more conceptually clear.</p>

<p>If you use the <code>id()</code> function (built-in, does not need to be imported) you can get a unique identifier for any object.  You can use that to confirm that you are really and truly dealing with the same object and not any sort of copy.</p>
