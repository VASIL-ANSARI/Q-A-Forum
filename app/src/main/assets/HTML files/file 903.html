<p>vim supports scripting in python (and in perl as well, I think).</p>

<p>You just have to make sure that the vim distribution you are using has been compiled with python support.</p>

<p>If you are using a Linux system, you can download the source and then compile it with</p>

<pre><code>./configure --enable-pythoninterp 
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Inside vim, you can type</p>

<pre><code>:version
</code></pre>

<p>to list the available features; if it has python support, you should see a '+python' somewhere (a '-python' otherwise).</p>

<p>Then, to check the usage of the python module, you can type</p>

<pre><code>:help python
</code></pre>

<p>P.S: if you're going to compile the vim sources, make sure to check the available configure options, you might need to specify --with-python-config-dir as well.</p>

<p>P.P.S: to create a "custom command in command mode" (if I understand correctly what you mean), you can create a function "MyFunction" in a vim script (using python or the vim scripting language) and then invoke it with </p>

<pre><code>:Call MyFunction()
</code></pre>

<p>Check </p>

<pre><code>:help user-functions
</code></pre>

<p>for details</p>
