<p>I think is that the lack of the dot and the <strong>s</strong> are typos. Otherwise you would need to have an <strong>includes</strong> and an <strong>include</strong> directories on the root of your system with the header files needed.</p>

<p>It doesn't make much sense, since it's not specified elsewhere in the book, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>But I think that when trying the dynamic linking you should delete the archive <strong>./libs/libhfcal.a</strong> you created for the static linking case, and change the third line from:</p>

<p><code>gcc -shared hfcal.o -o ./libs/libhfcal.dll</code></p>

<p>to:</p>

<p><code>gcc -shared hfcal.o -o ./libs/libhfcal.dll.a</code></p>
