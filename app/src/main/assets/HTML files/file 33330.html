<p>You can potentially flatten the nesting with Underscore's <code>flatten</code> method, which will put the object in a one-item array and put <code>street</code> at the top level of that object:</p>

<pre><code>var flatAddress = _.flatten(model.get('address'))
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't quite help if you're working off <code>'area.street'</code>. Given a string representing layers of dot notation, the string likely needs to be broken up in a way that JS objects can digest. Consider something like</p>

<pre><code>var array = properties.split('.');
var fromAddress = model.get('address');
for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++ ) {
  fromAddress = fromAddress[array[i]];
}
</code></pre>

<p>or if <code>Array.reduce</code> is available/preferable:</p>

<pre><code>var property = properties.split('.').reduce(function(prev,curr) {
  return prev[curr];
}, model.get('address'));  
</code></pre>

<p>Either would be worth putting as a property on the model to facilitate reuse.</p>
