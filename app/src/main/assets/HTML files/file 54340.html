<p>A waiter has a configuration associated with it which can be accessed (using your example above) as:</p>

<pre><code>runningWaiter.config
</code></pre>

<p>One of the settings in this config is <code>max_attempts</code> which controls how many attempts will be tried before giving up.  The default value is 40.  You can change that value like this:</p>

<pre><code>runningWaiter.config.max_attempts = 10
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't directly controlling a timeout as your question asked but will cause the waiter to give up earlier.</p>
