<p>You can reach the task with the <code>QueueChannel</code>. Any threads can send messages to it concurrently. On the other side you should just configure <code>PollingConsumer</code> with the <code>fixed-delay</code> poller - single-threaded, as you requested. I mean that poller with the <code>fixed-delay</code> and everything downstream with the <code>DirectChannel</code> will be done only in single thread. Therefore your count and rollover logic can be reached there.</p>

<p>Nothing to show you, because that configuration is straight forward: different services send messages to the same <code>QueueChannel</code>. The <code>fixed-delay</code> poller ensures single-threaded reading for you.</p>
