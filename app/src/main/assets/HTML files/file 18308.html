<p>You almost have it, but you keep reinitializing the counter.  Take <code>int negativeCount = 0;</code> out and put it before the loop.</p>

<p>EDIT
As another user has mentioned in the comment, you are counting positive numbers instead of negative ones.  So, fix the <code>if (arrayNumbers[i] &gt;= 0)</code> also.</p>
