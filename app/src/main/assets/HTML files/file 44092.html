<p>Yes all permissions are required to be approved by the user. If the updated version has new permissions : grouped or others, they need to be approved by user.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users who wish to have full control over new individual permissions being added to an app can review individual permissions for an app at any time, or may consider turning off auto-updates for one or more apps. Any permissions that are not part of a permissions group, including those that are not shown in the main permissions screen, will be shown in the "Other" group.</p>
</blockquote>
