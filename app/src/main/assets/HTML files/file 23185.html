<p>Most probably you are are overriding methods like get with mechanize. Try to wrap your Sinatra application into an application class. That may resolve the issue.</p>

<pre><code>require 'sinatra/base'

class MyApp &lt; Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    # mechanize stuff
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Find out more about that approach in the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Sinatra::Base%20-%20Middleware,%20Libraries,%20and%20Modular%20Apps" rel="nofollow">Sinatra documentation</a>.</p>
