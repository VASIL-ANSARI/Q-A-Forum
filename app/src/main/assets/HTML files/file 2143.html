<p>You can not do what you want to do with the default out-of-the-box widget.  However, you can use the RPX capabilities in a completely custom solution that would allow you to do what you want to do.  In RPXNow, when you click on the "Quick Start Guide" there are three tabs: Popup, Embed, and Custom Interface.  Use the custom interface option to create your own solution.  This will take a fair amount of development, but you can create the experience you want in a fairly straightforward manner.</p>
