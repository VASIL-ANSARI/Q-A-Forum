<p>You are running into two different issues:</p>

<p>First, you are using <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setInexactRepeating(int,%20long,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)" rel="nofollow"><code>setInexactRepeating()</code></a>. As the name implies and the documentation explicitly states, these alarms are inexact. Android will bundle multiple alarms together to minimize device wakeups.</p>

<p>If for whatever reason you believe that your use case requires exact timing you can use <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setExact(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent" rel="nofollow"><code>setExact()</code></a> to schedule a one shot alarm and continue to schedule those alarms as necessary.</p>

<p>Second, Android 6.0 introduced <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html" rel="nofollow">Doze mode</a>, which helps to further minimize device wakeups when the device is not in use. The idea is that if the user isn't actively using their device, no apps should really need to be performing periodic work such as pulling down fresh news articles. Instead, when the user next picks up their device the alarms will trigger and your data will update.</p>

<p>If your app falls into the whitelisting guidelines in the doze documentation, you can ask your users to whitelist your app from battery optimizations.</p>
