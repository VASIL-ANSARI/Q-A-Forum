<p>There's nothing you can do about this. A user who chooses zoomed mode is deliberately throwing away pixel accuracy. The points in the drawing no longer match the pixels on the screen one-to-one (or one-to-two or one-to-three or any integral ratio). This choice therefore blurs the screen for <em>everything</em> the user does, not just your app.</p>

<p>Nor can you detect what is happening, because in effect zoomed iPhone 6 is presented to your app as an iPhone 5 (and a zoomed 6 Plus is presented to your app as a 6).</p>
