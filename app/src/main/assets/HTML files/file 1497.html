<p>Well - if the code is generated, I don't see any advantages in refactoring it as long as the tool which generated it can handle it. <br />The tool (meaning the designer in this case) will "destroy" all your refactoring work as soon as it updates the code.</p>

<p>However, you should split your Control/Window/... into multiple controls - then the code will automatically get shorter and you will be able to maintain your UI more easily.</p>

<p>As a conclusion: Do not refactor the generated code but do refactor your control.</p>
