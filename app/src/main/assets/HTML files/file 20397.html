  <p>Is there an encryption API that will let me encrypt just using a
  password but if not, then I'll consider using private/public keys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've written an open source Java library that encrypts data with a password, using 256-bit AES. You can this find this on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/JNCryptor" rel="nofollow">JNCryptor</a>. This is compatible with the <a href="https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor" rel="nofollow">RNCryptor</a> project for iOS.</p>

<p>This may work for you on Android, or at least you can see how the code works and adapt it as necessary. (If you don't find it works as you'd like, feel free to raise an issue and I will adjust the library).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the current encryption algorithms that I can use and are they
  available internationally or does the US put some restriction on using
  them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a myriad of algorithms available, but you will be fine if you stick something very standard, such as AES.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the US still forbids exporting software that uses 256-bit AES key sizes. There may be other restrictions in other countries too. But I am not a lawyer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would I be better off creating my own custom encryption algorithm and
  modify it from time to time to prevent hackers from easily breaking
  it? Or would you discourage this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do not do this. Always use a well-known algorithm that has been subjected to extensive peer review. There should be no need to regularly change your choice of algorithm, unless it has been known to be compromised.</p>
