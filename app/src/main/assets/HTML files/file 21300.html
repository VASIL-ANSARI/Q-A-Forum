<p>I think that this will not work, global method security has absolutely nothing to do with MVC layer. 
Moreover it's officially recommended to use method security <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/faq/faq.html#faq-method-security-in-web-context" rel="nofollow">only for the service layer</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally we would recommend applying method security at the service
  layer rather than on individual web controllers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>P.S. generally I try to avoid using AOP with Spring controllers, and declare AOP methods  only in the root context(and not in the servlet context), because proxying controller instance can lead to some confusing behavior, and forces the users to know Spring AOP specific things, like difference between JDK proxy and CGLIB proxy, how annotations are processed, etc.</p>
