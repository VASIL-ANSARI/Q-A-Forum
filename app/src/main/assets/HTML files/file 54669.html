<p>It is usually clearer to leave if/case logic outside of <code>where</code> clauses.  You might consider:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE [Private-Accommodation].[Otok] = 'Rab' AND 
      ((@iKapacitet = 1 AND [Private-Accommodation].[maxPersons] &lt; 3) OR
       (@iKapacitet = 2 AND [Private-Accommodation].[maxPersons] &lt; 3) AND [Private-Accommodation].[maxPersons] &gt; 5) OR
       (@iKapacitet NOT IN (1, 2) AND [Private-Accommodation].[maxPersons] BETWEEN 4 AND 6)
      )
</code></pre>
