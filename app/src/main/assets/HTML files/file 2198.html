<p>Not a full answer, but Eclipse does have <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/" rel="nofollow">C/C++ IDE functionality</a> </p>

<p>Here is some information (though it seems a bit dated):  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Support_seamless_debugging_between_JDT_and_CDT" rel="nofollow">Information on CDT/JDT integration</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t143655-jni-with-eclipse.html" rel="nofollow">Info on creating JNI code from inside Eclipse</a> (look at the very last post)</p>

<p>It does seem like an integrated debugging experience would be well within Eclipse's capabilities, but it's obviously not hyper important.</p>

<p>OK - all that said, I do have a recollection of getting Visual C++ debugger to work with a Java application that was making JNI calls...  It's been awhile, but I'm pretty sure you can connect the C++ debugger to the running Java application using the pid.  Then set a breakpoint, and rock and roll (you'll obviously have to compile the JNI library as a debug module).</p>

<p>It wasn't a fully integrated experience, but it was pretty effective.  I try to write my JNI code as thin wrappers around the native calls, though, so I spend very little time debugging my JNI calls.</p>
