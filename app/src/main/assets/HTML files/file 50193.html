<p>If you put your Button in a Grid column they overlap each other. You can put a <code>StackPanel</code> with <code>Orientation</code> <code>Horizontal</code> in your grid, and then put your <code>Button</code> inside the <code>StackPanel</code> (Or a <code>DockPanel</code> where do you align element on the left with <code>DockPanel.Dock="Left"</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously you can rid off <code>Grid</code> completely if you don't need it, but i don't know your layout.</p>
