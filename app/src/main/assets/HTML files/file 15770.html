<p>Using an STA object from an MTA thread requires marshalling. Standard marshalling requires a type library. The error you are getting means the type library could not be loaded.</p>

<p>So I would guess that the type library is not registered correctly. Try unregistering and re-registering the DLL, otherwise try registering the type library directly using REGTLB.exe</p>
