<p>Here is a piece of javascript catching the right-click on any <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> element and sending an AJAX request. The script <code>your_delete_script.php</code> then has to read the posted filename and delete it on the server.</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {    
      $('img').mouseup(function(e){ 
        if( e.button == 2 ) { 
          $.post('your_delete_script.php', {filename: $(this).attr('src')}, function() {});
      }); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>If there are any other <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> elements, you have to assign a special class to those you wish to be deletable and assign the handler to that class.</p>

<p>Note that it might be unsafe to delete the file without checking whether the file is really an image which you wish to be deleted. Furthermore, it's not recommended to intrude into the user's browser handling by catching the right click which should open the context menu by default. Maybe you'll prefer a delete button or a double click event, depending on whether your site will be publicly available.</p>
