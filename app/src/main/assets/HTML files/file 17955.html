<p>You can get the parent of your view:</p>

<pre><code>view.getParent();
</code></pre>

<p>And check if it has parent and is it's parent your listview or no?</p>

<p>But if you don't like these checks,generally the best solution would be to just implement your own layout manager that does your desired layout, as needed, and can also keep track of interesting views it has in it.<br>
