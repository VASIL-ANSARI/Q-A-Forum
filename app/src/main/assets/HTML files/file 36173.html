<p>I believe that you have to enter the full filename in your call to <code>Put</code>.</p>

<pre><code>string strippedFileName = StripPathComponent(FileName);
sftp.Put(FileName,"//u01//" + strippedFileName);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>StripPathComponent</code> is not implemented, you will have to implement that as well if needed. It would strip a path component from <code>FileName</code>, i.e. remove <code>C:\...\</code> or <code>..\...\</code>.</p>
