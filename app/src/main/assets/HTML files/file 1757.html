<p>There is no maximum enforced by code that I am aware of. That being said, even for network I/O, diminishing returns will set in fairly quickly, since the CPU speed of Android devices is fairly small, and RAM is fairly limited.</p>

<p>Please consider using <code>AsyncTask</code> instead of your own threads. This uses a thread pool set up by Android, and so it will use a pool size that the core Android team believes is effective for the platform.</p>
