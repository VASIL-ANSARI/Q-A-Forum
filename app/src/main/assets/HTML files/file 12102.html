<p>If you want an object with automatic storage that has optional semantics (i.e. may or may not exist), you can use <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/optional/doc/html/index.html" rel="nofollow"><code>boost::optional</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>boost::optional&lt;T&gt;</code> is a container that can have zero or one elements. If it is empty, it doesn't store a <code>T</code> object, just like an empty vector doesn't store any object. In fact, you can think of <code>boost::optional&lt;T&gt;</code> as as <code>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</code> whose capacity is always 1 and cannot grow. And since the storage size required for this is fixed and known at compile-time (it's <code>sizeof(T)</code>), <code>boost::optional</code> doesn't need any dynamic allocation.</p>
