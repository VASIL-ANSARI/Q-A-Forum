<p>Add an if/else statment for a variable called <code>var activeAnimation</code>, it should be declared as <code>0</code> outside of your script, then only allow animation if it is <code>0</code>, as soon as it starts the animation set <code>activeAnimation = 1</code>, then at the end of your animation, make the callback include a function to make <code>activeAnimation = 0</code></p>
