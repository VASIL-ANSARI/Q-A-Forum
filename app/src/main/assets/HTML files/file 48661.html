<p>You can try to reexport your pfx and ensure that "Include all certificates" option is cleared to exclude full certificate chain which may cause some problems.</p>

<p>If it does not help use AssemblyKeyName("xxx") instead of AssemblyKeyFile. Command <strong>sn.exe -i key.pfx xxx</strong> should be executed at your build server or development machine first to install the key into CSP. (I guess your error message is caused just by AssemblyKeyFile attribute.)</p>

<p>Let me note that there is no need to use your trusted certificate (signed by some Certification Authority) for assembly (or strong name) signing. Strongly named assembly can be digitally signed for authentication/security purposes later. </p>

<p>So you may also avoid the problem if you generate a new key using Strong Name Tool:</p>

<p>sn -k keyPair.snk</p>

<p>and use your current .pfx only with  e.g. signtool.</p>
