<p>This is what Querystring. Here you assigned 'eid' as variable to pass the string. </p>

<p>On your second page of page_load, do something like this. </p>

<pre><code>string TopicID = Request["eid"].ToString();
</code></pre>

<p>Later store this TopicID into your database.</p>

<p>Practice with this <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5876/Passing-variables-between-pages-using-QueryString" rel="nofollow">link</a> for more clarification. </p>
