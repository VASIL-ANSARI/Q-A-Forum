<p><em>Do we usually show member variables such as JTextfield on the class diagram?</em></p>

<p>No</p>

<p>Only  variables are need to be mentioned in the class diagram.</p>

<p>For the specifications of the variable, create one more file (Known as UISpecification) and there mention the type of your variable like</p>

<pre><code>Variable   Type

Str         Text
</code></pre>

<p>Usually this UISpecification file is made in XL sheet </p>
