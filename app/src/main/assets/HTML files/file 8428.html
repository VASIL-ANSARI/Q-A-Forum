<p>When getting an exception, you should always look at the root cause of the exception to learn about the root cause of the problem. It's the bottommost part of the stacktrace.</p>

<p>In this particular case, it's the following (I emphasized the message):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caused by: com.sun.xml.ws.model.RuntimeModelerException: <strong>A WebService annotation is not present on class: com.giuntilabs.target.ke.competence.ws.KECompetence</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it correct what it is trying to tell you there? Yes? Fix it accordingly. Put the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/jws/WebService.html" rel="nofollow"><code>@WebService</code></a> annotation on the mentioned class.</p>
