<p>You can create two dimensional vector like so</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;float&gt; &gt; table(N, std::vector&lt;float&gt;(N));
</code></pre>

<p>don`t forget to initialize it like this, it reserves memory for N members, so it does not need to reallocate all the members then you are adding more. And does not fragment the memory.
you can access its members like so</p>

<pre><code>table[1][2] = 2.01;
</code></pre>

<p>it does not uses copy constructors all the time because vector index operator returns a reference to a member;
so it is pretty efficient if N does not need to change.</p>
