<p>It may just be that you're not giving enough information when using dateFromString. If you're only giving the hh:mm, the rest of the date could cause several issues for you.</p>

<p>If you only need to show intervals of 30 minutes, and it's simply between two times in the same day (and dates don't matter), it would probably be wise to avoid dates altogether and just manually calculate the intervals between the two. You could easily parse the start time and end times into an hours and minutes integers, and then go from there.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
