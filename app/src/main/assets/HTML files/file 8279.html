<p>The idea is not to compute your graphics every time at draw time, but to render it offscreen in a UIImageView. Then your cell only has to blit the image, which is as fast as can be.</p>

<p>You can still compute your images lazily and asynchronously. The structure of your code could be similar to the Apple sample code LazyTableImages. Google for it. In that sample code, what's slow is not the drawing time, but the network loading time, but that difference is not significant.</p>
