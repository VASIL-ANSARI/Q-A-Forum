<p>I strongly recommend to have all of the data in some sort of config files or database for sure. However, there is no restriction on having small data hard-coded, but here's how I explain..</p>

<p>The reason I am saying this is - no matter how much is data - small or big, you will end up editing.</p>

<p>If the data is hard-coded into the code, It's much likely that you will end-up having bad code quality.</p>

<p>My best suggestion is to do something similar, of course if not database..</p>

<p>Create a data file as "data.lengths.php"</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    return array(
        50 =&gt; array(
             5.5, 5.5, // can have as many as you want..
        )           
    );
</code></pre>

<p>You can prepare same data files for other as well.</p>

<p>and next you can simple use it wherever you would like to use it as.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

      $data['length'] = require_once(__DIR__.'/data.lengths.php'); // Assuming both files are in same directory.
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this way you will have good code quality and on same side you are not forcing yourself to take long path.</p>

<p>My 2 cents, hope this helps.</p>
