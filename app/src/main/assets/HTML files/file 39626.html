<p>Regular expressions are used for <em>matching</em>, not for building strings or building random numbers.</p>

<p>To build a string with a random number between 0 and 9999999 you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>from random import random

myStr = "Data_image_picture." + str(int(random()*10000000)) + ".png"
</code></pre>
