<p>This is answered in some of the answers to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11145053">Can&#39;t find the DLL reference for &#39;HttpContent&#39;</a> as well as in this <a href="http://pfelix.wordpress.com/2012/01/16/the-new-system-net-http-classes-message-content/">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>In summary, you can't directly set up an instance of <code>HttpContent</code> because it is an <em>abstract class</em>. You need to use one the classes derived from it depending on your need. Most likely <code>StringContent</code>, which lets you set the string value of the response, the encoding, and the media type in the constructor.
