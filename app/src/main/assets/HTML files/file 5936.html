<p>Well, that's pretty much it.  The cache that is being used by the Enterprise Library is in-memory, and the ASP.NET and Windows Service applications both have different memory spaces.  When you update the cache in one, you don't update the cache in the other.</p>

<p>The problem exists in the ASP.NET app as well, but it seems that this is a read-only cache, and you are performing the writes from the service.</p>

<p>What you need to do is create a cache that both app domains can share and there are many ways to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Store the items in a shared persistance store (filesystem, database, etc) that both app domains can access easily</li>
<li>Have a cache service which will handle the updates of the cache items, but which you will query (through WCF, for example) for the cache items</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, you are looking to perform "distributed caching".  To that end, you should read the article in MSDN Magazine titled "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd942840.aspx" rel="nofollow">Distributed Caching On The Path To Scalability</a>" for more information on distributed caching options in .NET</p>
