<p>The InnoDB storage engine supports self-referencing foreign keys, and you can use them to emulate a hierarchical structure. To declare the key, you could do something like this in your <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>FOREIGN KEY (`folderId`,`siteId`) REFERENCES `folder` (`Id`, `siteId`)
</code></pre>

<p>An important thing to remember is that this key should be <code>NULL</code>-able, so you can indicate which record(s) are the root of the tree.</p>
