<p>There is <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/locale/tolower/" rel="nofollow">tolower</a>, which is locale specific, but I don't think it'll work with UTF-8 strings.</p>

<p>The correct solution will always be locale specific, because the case rules depend on the language.  For example, the lowercase version of 'I' is not always 'i'.</p>
