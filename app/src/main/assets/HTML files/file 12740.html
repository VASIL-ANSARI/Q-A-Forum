<p>Personally if I were taking that approach I'd use a timestamp field instead of a hash.  That will automatically update any time anything happens to the row and is a whole easier than what your describing.  </p>

<p>The verification approach would be similar to what you describe in your question.  To make auditing easy you could use a trigger to store the timestamp value off to another table.</p>

<p>Or... speaking of triggers.  If your true intent is to block updates entirely you could use a trigger to cancel the update entirely (unless it meets specific requirements that you set).</p>

<p>This is all assuming you have a reason for not just locking down the rights on the table by revoking update / delete rights to all users.  (which would be the easiest of all).</p>
