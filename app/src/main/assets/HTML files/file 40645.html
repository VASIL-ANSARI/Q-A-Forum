<p>This became a practical issue for us in one of our eCommerce clients, the "change" in size would occur when someone switches from landscape to portrait (especially in devices like iPhone where the width is significantly different) i.e. hoding the device vertically and then shifting to horizontal or the other way around and in fact since we used media queries there was a very minor delay (a fraction of a second) in the layout adopting to the new width.  </p>

<p>Another realistic scenario is that people may switch between restored and maximised versions of browsers , then again as commented, wasting spaces is also an issue.</p>
