<p>Volume changes (and for that matter, any gradual changes) are not directly supported by the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/Sequencer.html" rel="nofollow">Sequencer</a> interface.</p>

<p>To change the volume, you have to send actual volume change messages to the target device.
That is, insert the control change messages into the sequencer's tracks at the appropriate time position.</p>

<p>To get a fade out effect, use multiple message with decreasing values.</p>
