<p>I can't understand,why are you using <code>select</code> after fetching questions from database.But,to store the answers on the same table into database,you just have to <code>UPDATE</code> your table.</p>

<p>You can get the id of the user who is giving answer by using either <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>.If you want to allow only logged in user to answer,then just use <code>SESSION</code> OR <code>COOKIE</code> to get the user id.</p>

<p>Please be informed,following code is just for giving you an idea for solution.You should filter the inputs to be safe from SQL Injection</p>

<pre><code> $user_id=$_GET["id"];             //getting id from the url    
 $ans=$_POST["answer"];            //form that has answer field
 $sql2="UPDATE question SET answer='$ans' WHERE id='$user_id'";
 $result2 = $conn-&gt;query($sql2);
</code></pre>

<p>If you have more questions,please let me know.</p>
