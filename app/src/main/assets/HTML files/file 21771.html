<p>Regarding</p>

<pre><code>Scanner c = new Scanner(System.in);
Scanner Warrior = null;
Scanner Rogue = null;
Scanner Mage = null;
if (c == Warrior){
  //....
</code></pre>

<p>This is not how the Scanner class works. Your code will need only <em>one</em> Scanner object, and will need to call methods on this object, such as the <code>nextLine()</code> method, to get input from the user. Have a look at the tutorials including the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/scanning.html" rel="nofollow">Scanner Tutorial</a> before using new tools as it will help get you up to speed quickly. The compiler and the JVM are unforgiving and won't allow you to make up code and pray that it works.</p>

<p>i.e.,</p>

<pre><code>Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

String userInput = scan.nextLine();
if ("Warrior".equals(userInput)) {
   // do something
}
</code></pre>
