<p>You can't make a reference to a variable that is undeclared. The whole point of <code>APP || {}</code> is to get the empty-object value given that APP is declared and falsy (it can be 0, undefined, false, NaN ...). If it potentially is undeclared, you should use the <code>typeof</code> operator to check for it:</p>

<pre><code>(function () { ... })(typeof APP !== 'undefined' ? APP : {})
</code></pre>
