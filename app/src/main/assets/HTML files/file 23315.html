<p>The <code>javaee-web-api</code> is supposed to support the <a href="http://jaxenter.com/introducing-the-java-ee-web-profile-36201.html">Java EE Web Profile</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Introduced in Java EE 6, the Web Profile radically streamlines the platform and enables the creation of a new dawn of lightweight, agile, compelling application servers with a laser focus on web application development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However if you compare the two different jar files there is little that differs between them. I opened them up in 7-zip and these two screenshots shows the only (AFAIK) differences, namely that there is no support for JMS in the <code>javaee-web-api</code> <strong>and</strong> that the <code>xml</code> library seems to be larger in the <code>javaee-api</code>.</p>
