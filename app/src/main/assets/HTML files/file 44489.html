<p>So I was able to figure something out using two different methods. Whichever you use just depends on how you want to display your information.</p>

<p>Method One</p>

<pre><code>@project = PivotalTracker::Project.find(your_project_id)
epicList = @project.stories.all(:labels =&gt; "your_epic_label")
</code></pre>

<p>Method Two</p>

<pre><code>@project = PivotalTracker::Project.find(your_project_id)
@current = PivotalTracker::Iteration.current(@project)
epicList = @currnet.stories.select{ |s| s.labels.include? "your_epic_label"}
</code></pre>
