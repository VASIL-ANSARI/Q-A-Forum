<p>You need to change the way you have autowired the service in the controller.</p>

<p>Change the following code</p>

<pre><code>@Autowired
private UserService userService;
</code></pre>

<p>with following</p>

<pre><code>@Resource(name="userService")
private UserService userService;
</code></pre>

<p>Because in the UserServiceImpl you have defined the @Service annotation with alias "userService".</p>

<p>I hope this would resolve your problem. :)</p>
