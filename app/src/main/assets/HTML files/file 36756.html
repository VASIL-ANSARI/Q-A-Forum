<p>You have a self-referential table ... so you will need something like</p>

<pre><code>select id, parent_id, name
  from (select type_id as id, type_id as parent_id, type_name as name
          from item_types
         where parent_type = 0
        UNION
        select type_id as id, parent_type as parent_id, type_name as name)
          from item_types
         where parent_type != 0)
 order by id, parent_id, name
</code></pre>
