<p>PHP is a server side technology, so by the time you see the page PHP <strong>already done his job</strong>. So, there are no way to respond to client button clicks in php (except for reloading the page, but that's not the case in your situation). So, you need to remove <code>setcookie</code> from php and set your cookie with jQuery.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1458724/how-to-set-unset-cookie-with-jquery">How to set/unset cookie with jQuery?</a> for details.</p>
