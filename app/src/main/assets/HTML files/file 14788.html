  <p>What is the difference ?</p>

<p>They are all equivalent in effect, but they may differ in performance or efficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I take that to mean rdbuf() will not return NULL?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You take it correctly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the stringstream b is empty then is the behavior defined?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wouldn't in that case the first character returned by rdbuf have eof traits?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The first call to <code>.sgetc()</code> (or <code>.snextc()</code>) would not return a character with eof traits, it would return EOF (which <em>is not a character</em>). So, your example would be equivalent to <code>a &lt;&lt; "" &lt;&lt; "some text"</code>.</p>
