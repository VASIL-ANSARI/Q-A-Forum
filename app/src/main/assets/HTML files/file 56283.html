<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Don't run <code>ipython</code> (or <code>python</code>) from the root of the TensorFlow git repository when you want to <code>import tensorflow</code>.</p>

<p>I answered a similar question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/35963479/3574081">here</a>. The easiest solution is to <code>cd</code> out of the current directory (e.g. <code>cd ~</code>) before running <code>ipython</code>. This will prevent Python from being confused by the <code>tensorflow</code> source subdirectory in the current path. The <code>./tensorflow</code> directory in the git repository doesn't contain all of the generated code (such as <code>pywrap_tensorflow</code>) that is needed to run TensorFlow, but does contain a file called <code>__init__.py</code>, and this confuses the Python interpreter.</p>
