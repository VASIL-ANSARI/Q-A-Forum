<p>I think what you're trying to find is a library for <strong>Property Based Testing</strong> in Java (see <a href="http://qala.io/blog/randomized-testing.html" rel="nofollow">types of randomized testing</a>). Shortly: instead of testing the value of the result you're testing a property of it. E.g. instead of checking that 2+2 is 4 you're checking properties like: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>random1 + 0 = random1</code></li>
<li><code>random1 + random2 &gt;= random1</code></li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> that explains Property Based Testing in details. </p>

<p>Another option that you mention is to <strong>check with your Test Oracle</strong> - something that knows the true answer (e.g. old bullet-proof algorithm). So you pass a random variable both to old and new algorithm and you check that the results are equal.</p>

<p>Couple of <strong>Java libraries</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pholser.github.io/junit-quickcheck/site/0.6/" rel="nofollow">JUnit QuickCheck</a> - a specialized lib for Property Based Testing. Allows you to define the properties and passes random values for these properties to check. So far (06/2016) it's pretty young, so you may want to check out <a href="https://www.scalacheck.org/" rel="nofollow">ScalaCheck</a> since it's possible to write Scala tests for Java code.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/qala-io/datagen" rel="nofollow">Datagen</a> - random values generator for Java in case standard randomizers are not enough. Disclaimer: I'm the author.</li>
</ul>
