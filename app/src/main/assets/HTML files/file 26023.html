<p>The first targets in your xcode projects have a build phase to perform a diff on two lock files. But it seems like your xcode projects configurations are not referencing the user defined settings configured in Pods/Pods-libPods.xcconfig. </p>

<p>It looks like you are trying to link a Pod with specific targets in multiple xcodeprojs. If my assumption is correct, you are using the <code>target</code> attribute incorrectly. The <code>target</code> attribute creates a new static library within the Pods project that includes the Pods you configured within that <code>target</code>. </p>

<p>The default target for the Pods xcodeproj is libPods which generates the libPods.a static library. This is generated if you do not specify a <code>target</code>. So if you don't care about generating multiple static libaries in the Pods xcodeproj, don't bother defining a target and use the <code>link_with</code> attribute to link the default libPods <code>target</code> (static library) to the targets in your xcodeprojs. </p>

<p>For example, the following Podfile will create a libPods target in Pods.xcodeproj which will add MBProgressHUD sources to the compile phase then add the xcconfig file defining PODS_ROOT and the PODS_HEADER_SEARCH_PATH for example to each of your xcodeprojs. It will then link this static library to the targets you specified with <code>link_with</code> and <code>xcodeproj</code></p>

<pre><code>workspace 'myWorkspace.xcworkspace'
platform :ios

xcodeproj 'myiPhone.xcodeproj'
link_with 'myiPhone'
xcodeproj 'sharedStuff/sharedStuff.xcodeproj'
link_with 'sharedStuff'

pod 'MBProgressHUD', '~&gt; 0.6'
</code></pre>
