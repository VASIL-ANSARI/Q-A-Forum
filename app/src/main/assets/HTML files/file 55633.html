<p>I think you can use <code>UITableView</code> and custom <code>UITableViewCell</code> for this purpose. On click of "Add More", add one entry to NSMutableArray and just reload tableview.
And no need to manage index separately, you can get it directly by <code>indexPath.row</code></p>

<p>Also you don't need to manage scroll view size as tableview automatically adjust is content height according to row.</p>

<p>If you are using same kind of view,then go with this approach, as its easy and will save your time. </p>
