<p>It depends how generic the item in question is. If each item entry is a unique item as opposed to a type of item (Anchorman DVD as opposed to just DVD for instance) than you could have it belong to a single user. You can change that association over the course of the auction so that it belongs to the highest bidder at any given time. Past that it depends on what other functionality you'd like.</p>

<p>TLDR: belongs_to :user</p>
