<p>You have at least two errors here.</p>

<p>First, you try set <code>ofType</code>, that is <code>String?</code> type to <code>JSON</code> type. Looks like you use <code>SwiftyJSON</code> and it type from there. You need to convert it to <code>String</code> object.</p>

<p>Second, you can not be passed as a parameter the class type, you have to create some object of this class and then pass it.</p>
