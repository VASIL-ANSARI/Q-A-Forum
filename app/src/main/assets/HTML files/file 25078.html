<p>That isn't as safe as it should be.</p>

<p>You are sending the username and password (admittedly in a form that is hard to reverse engineer) over email (which is not secure) â and those usernames and passwords might be reused on other sites.</p>

<p>Use a randomly generated string of characters, not any real credentials. Store the random string in a database and use it to look up which user to reset the password for. Only allow the string to work for a limited time.</p>
