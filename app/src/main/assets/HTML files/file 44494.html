<p>WinVerifyTrust will always check the store for verifying a digital signature. Adding the root and cert to the TRUSTED root store implies that you trust those certificates and therefore the signatures. If you were to remove those certificates from the Trusted Store, then the verification should fail (depending on the flags you set).
