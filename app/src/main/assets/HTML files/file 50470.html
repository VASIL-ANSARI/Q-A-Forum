<p>This is a false alarm, you're doing it the right way.</p>

<p>There are frameworks that can help you with this (e.g. Spring's <code>NamedParameterJdbcTemplate</code>, but they basically do the same thing under the hood.</p>

<p>The static analyzer is probably catching the fact you're building your query by concatenating strings, or that the size of input is somehow involved, and flagging it as a danger (only guessing here).</p>

<hr>

<p>On a side note, a potential problem that however has nothing to do with SQL injection is that you can only use certain number (DB-dependent) of those parameters - AFAIK the limit's 1000 in Oracle, about 2000 in Teradata, not sure about others. If you need to put many values in that <code>IN</code> clause, you'll need to use a different approach like using a temporary table or performing the query in smaller batches and merging the results in Java.</p>
