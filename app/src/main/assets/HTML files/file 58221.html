<p>You have multiple versions of jQuery being loaded</p>

<p>Apart from the obvious version with it's own script tag your main.js file also includes it.</p>

<p>Since it loads after bootstrap.js it overwrites the whole jQuery object and removes reference to bootstrap in original version. That is why you get the error shown</p>

<p>Choose which version of jQuery you want to use and remove the other.</p>

<p>Make sure boostrap.js loads after the selected choice</p>
