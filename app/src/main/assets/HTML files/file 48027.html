<p>If you just put a version to the store with API level 14, than every device below this level should not be able to find the app.</p>

<p>But you can use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html" rel="nofollow">Multiple APK Support</a> of Android.
So you are able to create new versions of your app for a specific API level, without influencing e.g. older api versions.</p>
