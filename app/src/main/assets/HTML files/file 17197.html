<p>Validate the ID passed against the IDs the user can modify.</p>

<p>It may seem tedious, but this is really the only way to make sure the user has access to what they're trying to modify. Using GUIDs without validation is security by obscurity: sure guessing them is hard, but you can potentially guess them given enough resources. </p>

<p>You can do this at the top of the controller before you do anything else with the posted data. If there's a violation, just throw an exception and have your global exception handler deal with it; you don't need to handle it in a pretty way since you can safely assume that the user is tampering with data in an unsupported way.</p>
