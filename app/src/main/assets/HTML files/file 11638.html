<p>I found the issue.</p>

<p>I was calling io_service.stop() in the initialization function of the owning object as it can be re-initialised. I wasn't calling io_service.reset() after the call to stop however and io_service won't run after a stop until reset has been called.</p>

<p>A lesson in RTFM as both stop and reset document this.</p>

<p>However the boost::system::error_code variable didn't reflect this state which is a bit frustrating as it would have saved me messing around.</p>
