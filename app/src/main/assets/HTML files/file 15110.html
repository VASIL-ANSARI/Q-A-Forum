<p>This is an error from the linker (and/or runtime environment) which cannot find some symbols (i.e. code) which the header files you've included promised to exist. In order for these symbols to be found, you must tell the linker to link against the library (or object file) containing them. This library may have come with the code pre-compiled or may have been made during installation. Have you not got a README file where it is explained how to use (i.e. link and run) the code?</p>
