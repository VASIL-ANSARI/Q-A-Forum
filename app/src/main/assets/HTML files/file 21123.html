<p>There are (or were) two good reasons for making window.open() return a fake window object when popup blocker is enabled:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Some site / apps might try to detect popup blocking and force the user to disable the blocker and endure ads and other abuse</p></li>
<li><p>Back when we implemented popup blocking, we often saw scripts that would break if there was no return object. I.e. if they wanted to check win.closed but 'win' was set to undefined.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This "feature" may no longer be required since some browsers implement popup blocking differently. </p>
