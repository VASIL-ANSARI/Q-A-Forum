<p>This issue is answered in a related question that I had:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31563570/how-to-include-x86-mingw32-binaries-when-install-a-gem">How to include x86-mingw32 binaries when install a gem</a></p>

<p>One does not need to install DevKit (and maybe better not too). The problem is that the installer does not download the gem with windows binaries (<code>-x86-mingw32</code>).</p>

<p>Once I updated to newer rubygems version (<code>gem update --system</code>) the problem is solved.</p>
