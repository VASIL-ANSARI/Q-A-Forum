<p>If you use the Qt::X11BypassWindowManagerHint on the window, then the window manager can't steal your keypresses. However, this means you lose the native window frame (including decoration, moving, and resizing), so it is likely <strong>you don't want to do this</strong>.</p>

<p>Another way: if your users are only on 1 or 2 varieties of Linux, add something to the installer which asks the user whether they want to manipulate the gnome (or whatever) keysettings, and if so, changes them via gconftool-2 (or equivalent).</p>
