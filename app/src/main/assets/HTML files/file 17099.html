<p>It depends.</p>

<p>If you're not going to do polymorphic queries, I'd stick to the design you have right now.</p>

<p>This sort of design is called in literature <em>"table per concrete class"</em></p>

<p>On the other hand if most of your queries are going to be like <em>"give me all the people in the system regardless of whether they're a member or staff"</em> you might want to put them all together into a single table called Person.</p>

<p>This sort of design is called <em>"table per class hierarchy"</em></p>

<p>Obviously this mandates that all columns corresponding to properties of your inherited classes would have to be nullable in the database.</p>

<p>If that is not acceptable (I'm finding it hard to believe it would, but...) and for completeness you may end up with a three-class, three-table structure, which is unsurprisingly called <em>"table per class"</em></p>

<p>There's no hard and fast rule for this, and while I generally tend to work with systems where table per class hierarchy makes the most sense, it may or may not be the case for you.</p>
