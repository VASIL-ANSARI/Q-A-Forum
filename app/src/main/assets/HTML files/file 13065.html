<p>Yes, you can come up with the amount to charge the user, but charging them for more than the amount you show them would be fraud and probably theft (i.e. highly illegal), especially if you provide a receipt and the amount on the receipt does not match the charge.  Many credit card companies have a limit for large charges and will put a stop on them, or at least ask the holder if the charge is legitimate.</p>
