<p>You can load the data in a <code>DataTable</code>, update the columns with your C# function and then update the database like:</p>

<pre><code>SqlDataAdapter.Update(Dataset.Tables["table1"]);
</code></pre>

<p>This will send an <code>UPDATE</code> statement for every row though. You should think a bit about your architecture. What do you want to achieve? Is it possible to put the logic in a trigger instead of C# code? Can you reduce the number of rows you have to update by putting another condition (recently added, etc.)?</p>
