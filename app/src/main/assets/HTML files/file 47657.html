<p>I just did some tinkering around, and some google searching and I found the answer. Instead of using the sending option, there is an option for params which makes a hidden field. Here is my ajax piece of code that got it working.</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
            type: "POST",
            url: 'list',
            data: form,
            success: function(data) {
                if (data.success)
                {
                    myDropzone.options.params = {'propertyID': data.propertyID};
                }
                myDropzone.processQueue();
            }
        });
</code></pre>
