<p>As far as the excerpt is concerned, you aren't <code>SELECT</code>ing it in your query. Change the beginning of your query to:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT post_title, post_content, post_excerpt,
       UNIX_TIMESTAMP(post_date) AS post_date_unix, ID
</code></pre>

<p>As for the link to the post, I'm not 100% sure you can get a "pretty-printable" link without going through the WordPress machinery. A short-link style URL is available under the <code>guid</code> column in the <code>wp_posts</code> table, but the WP docs claim that it may not show up if pretty permalinks are disabled. Since you know the ID of the post (it's a part of your query), you could just use the WordPress functions to get the link. See the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_permalink" rel="nofollow">get_permalink</a> documentation page for more.</p>

<p>As an aside, have a look at <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php" rel="nofollow">PDO</a> or <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php" rel="nofollow">Mysqli</a> as a replacement for the <code>mysql_*</code> functions. You should no longer use the latter.</p>
