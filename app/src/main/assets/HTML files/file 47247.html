<p>It works like that. 
Always take the second number and check if it in the right place:</p>

<p>Diagram: </p>

<pre><code>1) 90 &gt; 50 ----&gt; No change
2) now check the second and third number 90 &lt; 1 ---&gt; 1 and 90 swap.
3) check if the first number is lesser than the new second number(1) - 50 &lt; 1 - swap again 50 and 1.
4) 1 is the first number in the array, so go back to 90 and check the number after 90. 
</code></pre>

<p>And it is continue like this. OK?</p>
