<p>extern is used , mostly for functions when the function exists in another file , either sourcecode or an object library.</p>

<p>auto is used for stack variables, but since it is the default few people wite it explicitly.</p>

<p>static is for static variables, kept even when a function exits. auto variables are lost when a function exits, so static variables are often used for total counts, user settings, settings of state, which may change, but are used throughout the whole time the program is running.</p>
