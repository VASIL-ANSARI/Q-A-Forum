<p>The listbox's 'Anchor' property is set to Top, Left by default. Select Bottom and Right as well and it will now resize.</p>

<p>However, I see that you have two listboxes (stacked on top of eachother), so the above suggestion will not get them both to resize evenly in a vertical manner. But it will solve the resizing horizontally for you.</p>

<p>In order to get both to resize vertically, you may need to use a grid splitter, and manually determine the correct position.</p>
