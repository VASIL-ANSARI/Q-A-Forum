<p><code>play eclipse</code> (or <code>play eclipsify</code> for previous versions) is only so that you can import your project in Eclipse and use the debugger, get auto-complete, etc. You're still meant to run the application from the console though.</p>

<p>As to the second part of your question you'd need to provide more details. What exactly do you mean by, <em>"I have included and imported a class from another project"</em>?</p>
