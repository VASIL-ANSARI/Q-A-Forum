<p>You could use some sort of encryption. Then obfuscate the encryption keys by some calculation so that they are not <em>easily</em> retrievable by reverse engineering efforts. Make sure the keys and decrypted data is disposed immediately after usage.</p>

But this is much added effort and introduces potential problem if your server is down.</p>
