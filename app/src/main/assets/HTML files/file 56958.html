<p>Ok I figured it out right after I posted this question... even though I've been fighting with this all day.</p>

<p>The problem is that the Mockito matcher methods return <code>null</code> but Groovy for some reason screws up the type-cast. So you need to do the type-cast manually in order for it to find the correct method to stub. The following works:</p>

<p><strong>MockitoStubTest3.groovy:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public class MockitoStubTest3 {
  @Test
  public void testStubbing() {
    MyInterface myInterface = mock(MyInterface.class);
    when(myInterface.someMethod(isA(MyClass.class) as MyClass)).thenReturn("foobar");
    assertEquals("foobar", myInterface.someMethod(new MyClass()));
  }

  private interface MyInterface {
    String someMethod(MyClass arg);
    String someMethod(String arg);
  }

  private static class MyClass {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I got the answer from this similar question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25857019/mockito-any-matcher-not-working-for-doanswer-with-overloaded-method">Mockito any matcher not working for doAnswer with overloaded method</a></p>
