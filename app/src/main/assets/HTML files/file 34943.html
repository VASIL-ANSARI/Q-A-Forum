<p>Always try to have the images width and height of the power of two because some GPU support textures only in NPOT resolution. (for example 128x128, 512x512 but not 123x533, 128x532)  </p>

<p>And i think that here instead of GL_REPEAT you should use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE :)
GL_REPEAT is used when your texture coordinates are > 1.0f, CLAMP_TO_EDGE too but guarantees the image will fill the polygon without unwanted lines on edges. (it's blocking your linear filtering on edges)  </p>

<p>Remember to try out code where floats are used (sample from comment) :)</p>
