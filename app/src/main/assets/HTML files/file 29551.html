<p>This means exactly what the error message says. You may only use constant expressions declaring arrays. In your case it would be better to use either <code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;</code> or even <code>std::vector&lt;std::array&lt;char,</code> 10>>` or to allocate the array in the heap.</p>
