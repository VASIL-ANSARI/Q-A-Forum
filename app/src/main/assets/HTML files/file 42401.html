<p>I would like help you just i need more information about the disconnection side device.
When you lose the connection, the device is always on?</p>

<p>I think you need to do an another scan, whether the device is again on, for init Android with the spÃ©cifique device.
When your run the scan, Android saves some information of the device and use their information in connection with him.</p>

<p>You can try rescan the device with BluetoothAdapter.startLeScan() and after you have get the device you can use bluetoothdevice.connectGatt().</p>

<p>Tell me if it work.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
