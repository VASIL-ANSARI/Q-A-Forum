<p>They are not right. They just <em>seem</em> to work, because you ask <code>scanf</code> to store an integer and the address where to store it is the <strong>address of the pointer</strong> <code>p</code>. You are basically treating the storage of the pointer itself as the storage of an integer. Likewise for <code>printf</code>, you pass the address of the pointer (which contains the integer) and ask <code>printf</code> to read it from there as... an integer. You could even change the first line to</p>

<pre><code>float* p;
</code></pre>

<p>and it would still <em>seem</em> to work. In the end, this is a good example of why you should avoid C-style interfaces which are not type-safe.</p>
