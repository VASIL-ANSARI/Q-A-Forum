<p>Although not portable, on linux you can use the inotify system and watch for file close events for your file of interest.  See <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-inotify/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-inotify/</a>.</p>

<p>Note that just because the file was closed by the other process doesn't necessarily mean its size has increased.  If you care about file size changes, use <code>stat()</code> to check for size changes before you close it.  See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8236/how-do-you-determine-the-size-of-a-file-in-c">How do you determine the size of a file in C?</a></p>
