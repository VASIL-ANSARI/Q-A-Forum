<p>You may want to hear "Content-Transfer-Encoding".</p>

<p>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8</p>

<p>Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary</p>

<p>or if you have problems specially with those chars</p>

<p>Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64</p>

<p>EDIT:
The "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" makes the "%" signs happen.</p>
