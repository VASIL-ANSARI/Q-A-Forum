<p>There should be an inverse relationship, or else the program would give you a warning. you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSPredicate *predicate=[NSComparisonPredicate predicateWithLeftExpression:[NSExpression expressionForKeyPath:@"user" rightExpression:[NSExpression expressionForConstantValue:yourUser] modifier:NSDirectPredicateModifier type:NSEqualsToPredicateOperatorType options:0];
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that, if you already have the user, you can just get the emails from the user object. An one-to-many relationship is represented in this user object as an NSSet, which you can use either to access all emails from it, or to sort the set into an array. Use the fetch if you need to use an NSFetchResultsController of some sort.</p>
