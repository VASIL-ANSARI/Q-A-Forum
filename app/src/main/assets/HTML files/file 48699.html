<p>The croppic has very good browser compatibility. Download only the clean version. Include one div with the cropicId:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="yourId"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Init the croppic:</p>

<pre><code>    var cropperOptions = {
        uploadUrl:'path_to_your_image_proccessing_file.php'
    }       

    var cropperHeader = new Croppic('yourId', cropperOptions);
</code></pre>

<p>I have found that on the div with the yourId you have to use the defauld id from the css #croppic . If you want to change it make it also in the croppic.css.</p>

<p>If you process the files with php download the examples and use them as they have done in the website build example.</p>
