<p>just a wild guess - you have 2 deduction records for each attendance => the join will duplicate the amounts from attendance table => the sum will sum these duplicated records</p>

<p>easy solution (but not very well performing i'm affraid) would be:</p>

<pre><code>select sum(a) - max_d
from (
  select attendance.amount a, deduction.amount d, max(deduction.amount) max_d
  from attendance 
  join deduction on attendance.staffid = deduction.staffid 
  where attendance.staffid = some_staffid 
      and month(attendance.date) = some_month
      and month(deduction.date_approved) = some_month
)
where d = max_d
</code></pre>
