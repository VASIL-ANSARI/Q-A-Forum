<p>Do it unobtrusively.  tag your last image with a class (we'll use "button-last" for the sake of argument) and put it in the document.ready() event in a javascript behind the scenes, like application.js (this works if you're using jquery, you'd need to translate it to your framework of choice):</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
  setLastID($("img.button-last").attr("id"));
});
</code></pre>
