<p>I think your problem isn't related to DLL checking but simple text rendering.  Event ID and Entry Type are small.  They can be written quickly.  Message is <em>BIG</em> and usually contains a lot of text, so screen rendering takes a long time.</p>

<p>Suggestion:  Create a StringBuilder and append all the text into it instead of repeated Console.WriteLines - then at the very end, do a single Console.WriteLine(myStringBuilder.ToStrion());</p>

<p>That may help.</p>
