<p>The tables from your earlier attempts will still exist in your database. You have two options:</p>

<li>Reverse all the existing migrations, don't delete the content of the migration files</li>
<li>Delete the database in your server and then run the <code>Add-migration</code> and <code>Update-database</code> commands again</li>
</ul>
