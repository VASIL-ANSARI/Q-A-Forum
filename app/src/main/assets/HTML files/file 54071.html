<p>The docs do, indeed, mean that only <code>*</code>, <code>?</code>, and <code>[...]</code> are supported. This means that arbitrary subsets or ranges in alphabetical or numeric order cannot be expressed as a single glob.</p>

<p>Here are some approaches that might work for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the date represented in the file path is also present in the records in the files, then the simplest solution is to read them all and use a <code>Filter</code> transform to select the date range you are interested in.</li>
<li>The approach you tried of many reads in a separates <code>TextIO.Read</code> transforms and flattening them is OK for small sets of files; our <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-beam/blob/92c6149/examples/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/dataflow/examples/complete/TfIdf.java#L155" rel="nofollow">tf-idf example</a> does this. You <em>can</em> express arbitrary numerical ranges with a small number of globs so this need not be one read per file (for example the two character range "23 through 67" is <code>2[3-]</code> plus <code>[3-5][0-9]</code> plus <code>6[0-7]</code>)</li>
<li>If the subset of files is more arbitrary then the number of globs/filenames may exceed the maximum graph size, and the last recommendation is to put the list of files into a <code>PCollection</code> and use a <code>ParDo</code> transform to read each file and emit its contents.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>
