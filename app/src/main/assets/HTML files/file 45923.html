<p>Took me some trial and error and digging around in the code, but the solution turned out to be trivial.</p>

<pre><code>from openpyxl import load_workbook
wb = load_workbook('myfile.xlsx')
ws = wb.active
for row in ws.rows:
    row[col_index].number_format = row[col_index].style.number_format = '@'
wb.save('myfile-fixed.xlsx')
</code></pre>
