<p>Java does not support asynchronous file manipulation. In other words, if you change a file while you already have the file open in a <code>File</code> object, any changes you make to the file without opening a new <code>File</code> object will be disregarded. I would recommend writing your data to a <code>stream</code> instead, something like a <code>StringBuffer</code> (gasp, I hate those) would work here.</p>

<p>In short: You can't do what you want to do the way you are doing it.</p>
