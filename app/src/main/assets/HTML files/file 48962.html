<p>This is a case of <strong>different compiler versions</strong>. When we both ran <code>g++ --version</code> in our terminals, we found he was running <code>4.8</code>, while I was running <code>4.9</code>.</p>

<p>GCC has long supported <code>C99</code> variable-length arrays (VLAs), where a variable is declared, but not given an initialization list. Thus, my co-worker could resolve the errors by removing <code>{'\0');</code> from each initialization (which also broke the code in this case.)</p>

<p>However, in bygone days, GCC has <em>not</em> supported <code>C++1y</code> VLAs, which is what I had in the example in the question. They just added support for those in GCC 4.9 (see the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html" rel="nofollow">Changelog</a>).</p>

<p>Ubuntu 14.04 (what my co-worker has) ships with GCC 4.8, while Ubuntu 15.04 (what I have) ships with GCC 4.9. Thus, we had to get onto the same compiler version, namely GCC 4.9. (Instructions for doing that are on <a href="http://askubuntu.com/q/466651/23786">this question</a>.)</p>

<p>If you're running into this issue on Windows, there are options there as well. As of writing, <a href="http://msys2.github.io/" rel="nofollow">MSYS2</a> currently offers GCC 5.2 by default, and <a href="http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/" rel="nofollow">TDM-GCC</a> offers GCC 5.1.</p>
