<p>Your jsonArray object when executing <code>setTextToTextView(JSONArray jsonArray)</code> seems to be null. I recommend you to use the debugger from Eclipse / Android studio to see where it fails to get data in your <code>public JSONArray GetAllCustomers()</code> method. You need first to make sure that you get the data from your local server. If that's the case, maybe take a look at the json parsing.</p>

<p>I'm also assuming you are running this on an emulator and not on a mobile phone/tablet. You are using a localhost address which will only work if your local server is on the same machine as your "device".</p>
