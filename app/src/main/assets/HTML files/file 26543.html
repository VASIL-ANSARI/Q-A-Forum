<p>No, you cannot get the request from an <code>HttpSessionListener</code>. The reason is simple: session expiry events are independent of request events.</p>

<p>Additionally, since you want to alert when the session is <em>about</em> to expire, the <code>sessionDestroyed()</code> event is not good: it is called <em>after</em> the session has expired (actually destroyed, which may be even after it is expired).</p>
