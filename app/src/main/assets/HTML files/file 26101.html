<p>I have faced such a case to some extent..I had some nodes of different types</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>x, y,z</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and there was a relationship between x and it's corresponding y or z. I simply used the BatchInserter to insert all the nodes of all types, and after that I had some sql queries to get the relations between nodes, by finding the ids of nodes that must be connected.</p>

<p>So, I think you can insert all the nodes for both YEARS and COUNTRIES by looping through the tow sets you have, after that you may need a query or whatever else to get the relation between those nodes.</p>
