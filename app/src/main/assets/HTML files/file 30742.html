<p>in your query</p>

<pre><code>select col from tab t1 where not exists(select col from tab t2 where t2.col &lt; t1.col)
</code></pre>

<p>the </p>

<pre><code>select col from tab t1
</code></pre>

<p>selects all entries then the subquery in</p>

<pre><code>where not exists(select col from tab t2 where t2.col &lt; t1.col)
</code></pre>

<p>selects every entry that is smaller than the current entry it wants to comapre with. So for the entry 1 in the first query it takes no entry since there is no entry that is smaller than 1. then the </p>

<pre><code>not exists()
</code></pre>

<p>kicks in and since there is no result from the subquery, the not exists is true and the whole query returns the 1.</p>

<p>Any other value will not be returned since for any other value you will get a result in the subquery thus leaving the <code>not exists()</code> with the value <code>false</code></p>
