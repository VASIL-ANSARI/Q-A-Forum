<p><code>pygame.transform.scale()</code> does not work very well for your case. If you shrink a <code>Surface</code> by such a small amount, the algorithm just crops the last column and row of pixels. If you now repeat this process over and over again with the same <code>Surface</code>, you get the strange behaviour you see.</p>

<p>A better approach would be to keep a copy of your original <code>Surface</code> around, and use that for creating the scaled image. Also, using <code>smoothscale</code> instead of <code>scale</code> may also lead to a better effect; it's up to you if you want to use it.</p>

<p>Here's a "fixed" version of your code:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
# coding: utf-8

import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

# Define some colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)

pygame.init()

# Set the width and height of the screen [width, height]
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1920, 1080))

org_pic = pygame.image.load('test.jpg').convert()
pic_position_and_size = org_pic.get_rect()
pic = pygame.transform.scale(org_pic, pic_position_and_size.size)
# Loop until the user clicks the close button.
done = False

# Clear event queue
pygame.event.clear()

# -------- Main Program Loop -----------
while not done:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            done = True
        elif event.type == KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == K_ESCAPE:
                done = True

    # background in black
    screen.fill(BLACK)

    # Copy image to screen:
    screen.blit(pic, (0,0))

    # Update the screen with what we've drawn.
    pygame.display.flip()
    pygame.display.update()

    pygame.time.delay(10)    # stop the program for 1/100 second

    # decreases size by 1 pixel in x and y axis
    pic_position_and_size = pic_position_and_size.inflate(-1, -1)

    # scales the image
    pic = pygame.transform.smoothscale(org_pic, pic_position_and_size.size)

# Close the window and quit.
pygame.quit()
</code></pre>
