<p>At the Shopify API authentication process (OAuth), you can add scopes. When you want register orders/create webhook, you need read_orders scope. I think, in your case your scopes are read/customers and write/customers, that is the reason why are you able to create customers/create hook. Try to add read/orders and write/orders.</p>
