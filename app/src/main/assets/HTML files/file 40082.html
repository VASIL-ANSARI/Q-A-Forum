<p>It depends on your requirement and when you want to bind your <code>DropDownList</code>s. According to ASP.Net Page Life cycle <code>Page_Load</code> event firs first and then control events, in this case the <code>ddlProduct_Load</code> event. </p>

<p>And, this is also true according the the <code>DropDownList</code> Load event's definition</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fires when the page has been loaded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you have to make a decision where you want to bind the control.</p>

<p>Since you have more than 10 <code>DropDownLists</code> I would suggests to use their own load event to bind your control rather than making <code>Page_Load</code> looks too busy.</p>
