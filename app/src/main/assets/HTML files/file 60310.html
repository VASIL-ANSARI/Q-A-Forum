<p>By setting your <code>.loader-overlay</code> height to be 100%, you are telling it to occupy 100% of its <em>parent</em>. Being that the parent in your case is <code>body</code>, which does not have a set height, it will not behave as you expect.</p>

<p>What I would suggest is trying out CSS3 Viewport Height (vh). Something like this would set the div to the height of the viewport, which can change dynamically across devices:</p>

<pre><code>height: 100vh;
</code></pre>

<p>This being said, your <code>content</code> isn't even in the div with overflow hidden, so it will add to your page's height regardless of what you do with <code>.loader-overlay</code>.</p>
