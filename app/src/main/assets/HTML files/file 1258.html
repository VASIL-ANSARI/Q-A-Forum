<p>There is wxGlade and <a href="http://wxformbuilder.org/" rel="nofollow">wxFormBuilder</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know if there is another one, but the wxFormBuilder I know is free and open source.</p>

<p>You will find links to other tools on the homepage 
of wxGlade (http:// wxglade.sourceforge.net/).</p>

<p>Most of these programs are able to output xrc files, which are are an XML representation of your GUI. It address the issue of complexity of the generated code but is not as powerful.</p>

<p>Yet personally I don't use any of these tools, except sometimes to see what it's going to look like before I do it but never to actually generate code.</p>
