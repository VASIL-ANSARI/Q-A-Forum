<p>Go to <a href="http://trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html" rel="nofollow">jqGrid Demo page</a> and in left navigation  you will see <strong>Row Editing (new)</strong> and inside it there is <strong>Inline Navigator (new)</strong>. This is inline version  of adding row. However if you want pop-up form while adding row then see <strong>New in version 3.7 >> Add/edit/delete on local data</strong>. I have implemented inline row adding from this example only.</p>

<p>I hope this is the one you are looking for.</p>
