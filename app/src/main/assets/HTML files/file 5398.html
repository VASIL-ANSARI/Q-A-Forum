<p>IMO, Most straight-forward way (i.e., without doing a heck of a lot in PHP), assuming you're hosting the PHP file locally, would be to write a shell script that does the modem dialing / audio playing (Dependent upon OS), then call the shell script via exec in PHP.</p>

<p>Hope this helps -- and that you're not making a telemarketer autodialer that calls my cell-phone in the middle of dinner. :D</p>
