<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with your approach.</p>

<p>If you wanted reusable code, consider implementing a class called <code>MultiWriter</code> or somesuch that takes as input two (or N?) <code>TextWriter</code> streams and distributes all writs, flushes, etc. to those streams.  Then you can do this file/console thing, but just as easily you can split any output stream.  Useful!</p>
