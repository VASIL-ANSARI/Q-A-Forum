<p>Log4j purposely does not let you modify the LogEvent as it might get passed on to other Filters and Appenders that expected the original event. However, the RewriteAppender will let you create a copy of the LogEvent that is modified and then pass that to a subordinate Appender. The RoutingAppender also supports a RewritePolicy that does the same thing.</p>
