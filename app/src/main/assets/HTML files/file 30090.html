<p>I'll post this as an answer as it is a bit long for a comment (even though I cannot provide a complete/direct solution).</p>

<p>The problem occurs because:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>out</code> is not yet set in <code>ClientDataService</code> when you created its object in <code>IncomingHandler</code></li>
<li>so <code>mservice.getOutputstream()</code> return <code>null</code></li>
<li>which you use in <code>Send_Client</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are misusing the <code>ServerIntent</code>, by directly creating a derived object from it using <code>new ClientDataService()</code>.</p>

<p>Instead you need to start a services as follows, acording to the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html#StartingAService" rel="nofollow">Android Service documentation</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(this, HelloService.class);
startService(intent);
</code></pre>

<p>So I guess you need to read more about android services (lots of information in the documentation that looks important to me) in order to properly use them in your application.</p>
