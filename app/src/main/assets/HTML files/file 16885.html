<p>If you need to do SQL intensive work (for instance, a lot of INSERT statements in a normalized OLTP database) you need to have fail-over logic in your code.</p>

<p>On-premise SQL server will not suffer from this, so take this into consideration before switching to SQL Azure.</p>

<p>These two articles inspired me (special thanks to <strong>Joachim Isaksson</strong> for guidance):</p>

<p>To sum of the result, I have provided the two results which is now identical in result (where before some records where not added do to missing fail-over logic in regards to the original question: Timeout Expired):</p>

<p>On-premise SQL Server: 179.285 records in 427 seconds</p>

<p>SQL Azure w. fail-over logic: 179.285 records in 2.247 seconds - a whooping 5.2 times slower!</p>

<p>I hope this can help others struggling with SQL Azure. On a positive note; you learn (the hard way) that you have been lucky and privileged on your native in-house applications :-)</p>

<p>Note: i would still like an explanation how this can happen .. seems to easy to blame on latency, no?</p>
