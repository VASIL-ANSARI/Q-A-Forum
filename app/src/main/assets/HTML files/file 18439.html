<p>The <code>equal_range</code> function doesn't offer that, but you could call <code>lower_bound</code> passing a value with <code>getVal == 110</code>, and <code>upper_bound</code> passing a value with <code>getVal == 120</code>. That pair of iterators should represent all values in the half-open range [110, 120).</p>
