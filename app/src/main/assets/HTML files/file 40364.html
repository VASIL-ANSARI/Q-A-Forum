<p>It's not clear from your question which part of the code is throwing the error, but the likely culprit is that Moment.js simply delegates to <code>Date.parse</code> for non-ISO-8601 strings: <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1407">https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1407</a></p>

<p>So assuming that you're using Moment to parse user input or another field in an unknown format, or to parse a format that's not ISO-8601, you're going to have to specify the format explicitly to get guaranteed cross-browser behavior. Otherwise you're diving into the vaguaries of cross-browser <code>Date.parse</code> - the only format that works consistently there is ISO-8601.</p>
