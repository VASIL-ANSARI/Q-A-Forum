<p>There is no evidence that your <code>&lt;bindingRedirect&gt;</code> is in effect.  You should see:</p>

<pre><code>LOG: Redirect found in application configuration file: 4.5.0.0 redirected to 6.0.0.0.

</code></pre>

<p>There are no breadcrumbs in your question, but whatever you edited appeared to not have been  D:\ConsoleApplication1\bin\Debug\ConsoleApplication1.exe.Config.  Odd drive letter.  Beware of a project already having an App.config project item and you adding App1.config.  Something like that.</p>
