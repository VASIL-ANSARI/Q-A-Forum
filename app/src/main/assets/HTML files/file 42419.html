<p>You can find this information from the additional data section. You get it from the order object.</p>

<pre><code>$order-&gt;getData('additional_data');
</code></pre>

<p>You can see this data is serialized and can retrieve the data by unserializing. The amazon order number is associated with "channel_order_id".
I haven't tried this, but hope this will help you.</p>
