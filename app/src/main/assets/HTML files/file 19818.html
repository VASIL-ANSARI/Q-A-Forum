<p>Found your problem</p>

<p>because of the way that <code>call_user_func_array</code> works you need to use references (the "&amp;") and you are looping through the <code>fetch()</code> method on the same references - <strong>BUT</strong> there is a 2nd result set of "OK" that comes back saying the CALL statement was successful which is overwriting the result set you are looking for with a blank result set</p>

<p>try changing</p>

<pre>
$i = 0;
while( $this->_sqlStatement->fetch() )
{
     $resultSet[$i] = array();
     foreach($resultData as $fieldName => $fieldData)
     {
          $resultSet[$i][$fieldName] = $fieldData;
     }
     $i++;
}
</pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre>
if(!$this->_sqlStatement->fetch())
{
     //break do-while() loop
     break;
}
$resultSet[$i] = array();
foreach($resultData as $fieldName => $fieldData)
{
     $resultSet[$i][$fieldName] = $fieldData;
}
$i++;

</pre>

<p>you also need to set the initial <code>$i</code> value before the do-while() starts</p>
