<p>yes, I had this issue. it is very bad behavior because bitmap won't free itself. best advice is to use smaller bitmap tiles</p>

<p>and other advice is to use <code>SoftReference&lt;Bitmap&gt;</code> to store your data objects. SoftReferenced objects delete themselves when memory is needed. Careful though, you can wind up with missing objects.</p>

<p>the bitmap method though, is just flawed.</p>
