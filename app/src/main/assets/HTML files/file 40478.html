<p>To actually install the service, you have to register it with the Service Control manager. The simplest way to do this is with <code>SC.EXE</code>.   </p>

</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>SC.EXE create "MyService" binpath= "\"c:\program files\MyService\MyService.exe\" arg1 arg2" displayname= "My Service Name"
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a service, and tells the Service Control Manager that to start the service, it should call <code>"c:\program files\MyService\MyService.exe"</code> and pass the two parameters <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code> on the commandline. For example, if it has <code>/debug</code> and <code>/service</code> options for those scenarios.</p>

<p>If your executable service doesn't require any special parameters to run the service you can omit those.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the path to the executable contains spaces then you need to quote it, using the backslash-double-quote, i.e. <code>\"</code> at the beginning and end of the path as I have in my example.</p>
