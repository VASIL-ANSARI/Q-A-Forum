<p>In terms of the data structure, I think this seems to be it. What I didn't realize though is that there's a lot more controllers involved. For example, searching and buying in Twilio involved two CREATE actions, so I had to make another controller. I imagine there would be another controller that would be responsible for routing calls. </p>
