<p>According to <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=sunnyportal.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=sunnyportal.com</a> that server negotiates only one ciphersuite, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, which uses AES with 256-bit key.</p>

<p>If you are using <strong>Oracle Java</strong> to use any symmetric cipher above 128 bits, which includes AES 256, you must <strong>download and install the JCE Unlimited Strength</strong> Jurisdiction Policy Files for your version. For the currently supported version, 8, near the bottom of the general download page <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a> it links to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html</a> .
