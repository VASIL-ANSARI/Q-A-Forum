<p>Well my first suggestion would be get the third party vendor in there to reconfigure and fix. They made the mess, let them clean it up. </p>

<p>Restoring the backup might work but it is critcally important that you 1. change the sa password and 2. do not allow the software to connect using sa. I would make this a deal-no deal item with the vendor.  The vendor though is terminally incompetent if they did this and I would seriously be looking at their competition to replace this badly designed system. </p>
