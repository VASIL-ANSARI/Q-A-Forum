<p>To detail gilly's comment, <code>transition</code> effects require a "from" number, and a "to" number. You can't transition height based on the total amount of text appearing. (This would actually also need to account for resize operations, and perhaps some other cases)</p>

<p>The best way I've gotten something like this working is this. No pseudocode, sorry:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save current clientHeight of div.</li>
<li>Manually apply that height to the div as a style.</li>
<li>Apply text change</li>
<li>Save the scrollHeight of the div (total height, ignoring your style change).</li>
<li>In a <code>setImmediate</code> or <code>setTimeout</code> call, set the div's height to be the height from step 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>You may need to call something similar if the user resizes the browser and the height needs to change when everything auto-adjusts.</p>
