<p>The answer depends upon your application design. After all, synchronization is an opt-in concept - any thread could choose to ignore locks and simply access shared objects regardless.</p>

<p>Similarly with your example, if you are sure the only access to <code>hashMap2</code> is within the synchronized block shown in your example, then you are effectively protecting it with a lock, albeit a lock on another object.</p>

<p>It may be clearer for future maintainers to take locks on both objects before operating on them.</p>
