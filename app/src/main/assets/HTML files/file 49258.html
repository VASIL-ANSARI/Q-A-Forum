<p>You create a new <code>MoveableOject</code>, cast it as <code>ILeft</code>, and then you try to assing the <code>ILeft</code> you got from cast to a MoveableObject reference. Compliler disagree, as expected</p>

<pre><code>Ileft iLeftReference = getILeft();
MoveableOject mObj = iLeftReference; // same error
</code></pre>
