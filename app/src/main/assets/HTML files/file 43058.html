<p>I think you are confused about Maven and Eclipse interaction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I downloaded the parent pom from a repository and did a mvn install to
  get all of the dependencies...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is your first mistake. <code>mvn install</code> is not what you think it is.</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to start by installing <a href="http://eclipse.org/m2e/" rel="nofollow">Maven integration in Eclipse</a>.
This is either already available depending on which package solution
you chose, or it is available in the Eclipse marketplace.</li>
<li>Next you need to create a new Maven project in Eclipse. </li>
<li>Lastly you need to specify a dependency on the jar in the m2e
plugin. This will automatically bring in all the necessary
dependencies into your project workspace.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note the above link has full documentation, including a <a href="http://eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/m2e-extension-development.html" rel="nofollow">Getting Started</a> tutorial.</p>
