<p>I'm a little confused as to what you're asking, but my understanding is this part:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;company&gt;Comp1&lt/company&gt;
    &lt;company>Comp2&lt/company&gt;
</pre>

<p>is the new part, and you want it with no indents and with the first company on the same line as the starting "coveragelist" node?</p>

<p>I know you said you tried XmlTextWriter, but have you tried:</p>

<p><pre><code>xmlTextWriter.Formatting = xmlTextWriter.Formatting.None
</pre></code></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><pre><code>xmlTextWriter.WriteString("\n");
</pre></code></p>

<p>where you need?</p>
