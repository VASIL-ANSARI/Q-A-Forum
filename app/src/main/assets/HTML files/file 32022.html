<p>I think you are doing this in windows. Assuming that what you can do is:
- Go to the Downloads folder in windows.
-Click the addressbar which will give you something like this:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\TomHarris\Documents\ViberDownloads
</code></pre>

<p>Append the name of your designated file on the last of above.</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\TomHarris\Documents\ViberDownloads\MYFILETOOPEN
</code></pre>

<p>While I think both back-slash and forward-slash should work fine ( I am not sure though, check it!), File input in python follows convention which something like this:</p>

<pre><code>fname= "/WALL-E/RedirectedFolders/myname/My Documents/Downloads"
</code></pre>
