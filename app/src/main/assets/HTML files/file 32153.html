<p>The Step Into command is what you are looking for.</p>

<p>When the execution is before a call to a method of another class (The line that calls the other class is marked), press the <code>Step Into</code> button from the debug tool bar. This will jump right into the other class and show you how the method there is executed step by step.</p>

<p>This is what the Step Into button looks like: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/n6EDs.png" alt="Step Into"></p>

<p>If you also have not found a way to execute the program line by line yet, the <code>Step Over</code> command is what you need for that. Look for this button: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/4MfKh.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
