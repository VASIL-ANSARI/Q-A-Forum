<p>I would look for any type of REST or web-based API. Here's for example <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/westwindwebstore/docs/_1400QYNFF.htm" rel="nofollow">some of the vendors</a> providing such APIs. Then, after you harvest information from the form you generate call using something like HttpClient to such API and you can be sophisticated enough to make it appear as call is coming from the desktop browser (if it is a requirement). Then you capture a response, parse it and present to the user</p>
