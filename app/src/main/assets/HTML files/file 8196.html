<p>Since the <code>MyClass</code> type you created is in a assembly that has not yet been loaded in the second AppDomain, consider loading that assembly directly in the 2nd AppDomain.</p>

<p>Your example class is more complicated than it needs to be because you are not doing anything that requires custom serialization/deserialization code.  This will be easier to maintain:</p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
public class MyClass
{
   public string mystr = "NotWorking!";
   public MyClass(string _mystr)
   {
      mystr = _mystr;
   }
   public override string ToString()
   {
      return mystr;
   }
}
</code></pre>
