<p>You left off an equal sign.</p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="convertor_get.php" method "get"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Should be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="convertor_get.php" method="get"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>Get</code> is the default method normally. But putting a <code>method</code> attribute with no value is equivalent to setting <code>method=""</code> so I'm thinking you were sending to the convertor_get.php with no method defined at all. At least that theoretically would be the result in some browsers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However on the url it says .php/amount=X </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the <code>get</code> method that should be <code>?</code> not <code>/</code>. => <code>.php?amount=X</code>. So I think this confirms the request was going to the server with no method defined.</p>
