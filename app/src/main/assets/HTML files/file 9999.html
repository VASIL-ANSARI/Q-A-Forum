<p>We use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/vexi/wiki/BuildRelease" rel="nofollow">Vexi</a> - here's <a href="http://emanate-project.org/vexi_demo/" rel="nofollow">a demo</a> - with a lot of success, mainly because we maintain it.  Documentation is fairly thorough but not well organized online at the moment and the website is broken due to Sourceforge changes (thanks SF.net).</p>

<p>SEO is not really a feature because the applications 'launch' out of the browser rather than exist inside them.  However it is definitely an alternative technology!</p>

<p>It's a shame I can't show you the apps I'm working on at the moment, because they look great.  Our online profile for Vexi is dire though.</p>
