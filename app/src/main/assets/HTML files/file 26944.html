<p>Using the JDatabase is the hands down winner, since you have to find the prefix of all the tables somehow.</p>

<p>With JDatabase, you use <code>#__</code> to automatically access the prefix of this Joomla installation. (Remember that you may have various Joomla installations on one database).</p>

<p>You would have to do various work-arounds to find that in other ways, or you would have to create tables without a prefix which is also a bad idea with Joomla code.</p>

<p>I disagree with wiscWeb. This is not a matter of different opinions. All extensions I have ever seen to the moment, use the JDatabase class or extend that class for their own functions. (and I have seen hundreds of extensions)</p>
