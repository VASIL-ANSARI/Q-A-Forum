<p>Addon to my comment:</p>

<pre><code>def f(lst=False):
    return True if lst else False

f() #False
[f(True) for _ in range(3)] # [True True True]
</code></pre>

<p>This would work, but is this the real problem that you're trying to solve? It seems a really unintuitive use-case which can be solved better by other means.</p>
