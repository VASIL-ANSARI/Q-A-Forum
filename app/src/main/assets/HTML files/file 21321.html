<p>I would prefer <code>std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Type safety -- while this is pretty well abstracted for you in <code>boost::ptr_vector</code>, <code>ptr_vector</code> is still implemented in terms of <code>std::vector&lt;void*&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Clear support for custom deleter -- I think you can get custom deleter behavior with a <code>boost::ptr_vector</code>, but the support is clearer (and explicit) when using <code>std::unique_ptr</code>.</li>
<li>It's standard, and well supported by compliant C++11 compilers.</li>
</ol>
