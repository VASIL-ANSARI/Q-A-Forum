<p>Yes. The async operations will take longer to complete.</p>

<p>No, the code invoking the asynchronous operations doesn't block (that's what <em>asynchronous</em> means).</p>

<p><code>send</code> is usually synchronous, <code>async_send</code> never is. Of course, if you wait for all asynchronous operations to complete, you end up with the same delay, but that's your choice.</p>
