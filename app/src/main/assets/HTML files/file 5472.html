<p>Services are not supposed to show any UI. The only acceptable approach is to display a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html" rel="nofollow">notification</a> which can start an activity through an intent. Your service can also communicate with your UI using a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html" rel="nofollow">BroadcastReceiver</a> or it can start an activity directly.</p>

<p>If somehow your activity gets called on a background thread, you can get it running on the main thread using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#runOnUiThread%28java.lang.Runnable%29" rel="nofollow">runOnUiThread</a>. You should also get intimately familiar with <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html" rel="nofollow">services</a> in general.</p>
