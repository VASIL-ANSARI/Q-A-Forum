<p>From what I can tell, this error code (0x40010004) arises in all sorts of situations, with (as you noted) no obvious common thread.</p>

<p>However <a href="http://www.computing.net/answers/windows-xp/notification-of-a-failed-job/99006.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> says "0x40010004" means "the task is running"!  So, I would <em>surmise</em> that the correct way to interpret it is as saying "this tasked has exited in a way that prevented it setting a proper exit code".</p>

<p>I don't know if this will help, but I would try looking in the Windows Event logs to see if the problem is being reported there.</p>
