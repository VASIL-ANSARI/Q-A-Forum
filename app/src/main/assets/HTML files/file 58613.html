<p>You can do this:</p>

<pre><code>example = example.replaceAll(" +[@#][^ ]+", "");
</code></pre>

<p>What this will do is replace any substrings in your string that match the regex pattern <code>[@#][^ ]+</code> with the empty string. Since that pattern matches the words you want to dump, it'll do what you want.</p>
