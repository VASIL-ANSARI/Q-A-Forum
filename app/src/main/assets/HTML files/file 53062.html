<p>If the build is SUCCESSFUL and If its not an entropy issue. 
It is highly possible that it is an issue related to tomcat.</p>

<p>Check tomcat8 logs :</p>

<pre><code>/usr/share/tomcat8/logs/tomcat.initd.logs
</code></pre>

<p>It will help to figure out where the problem lies. I just used </p>

<pre><code>sudo adduser -d tomcat tomcat
</code></pre>

<p>: Adding a user and a home directory. <code>useradd</code> is not recommended and activate the account with </p>

<pre><code>sudo passwd tomcat
</code></pre>

<p>and then start the tomcat8 installation process. </p>
