<p>I installed postgres using <a href="http://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a>. Running <code>brew info postgres</code> suggested that I install the pg gem including <code>ARCHFLAGS</code>. I guess this might be system-specific, but the following worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>gem uninstall pg
ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg
</code></pre>
