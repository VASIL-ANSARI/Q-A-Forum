<p>Rule of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trust the compiler, in general it has better heuristics than you whether a code should be inlined. Write clean code. Code duplication is your enemy.</li>
<li>Measure the performance or check the generated code, and only try to optimize if you are unhappy with the results.</li>
<li>If there are problems, try to utilize templates to avoid code duplication and generate code at the template instantiation location.</li>
</ul>
