<p>I don't agree that we need more information to be honest. Something like this should work. Another way would be two queries and using the <code>MINUS</code> keyword to get all results from the first query (students in classes x, y and z), except the results from the second query (students in classes a, b and c).</p>

<p>Selecting all students that are in ALL of classes x, y and z, and in NONE of classes a, b and c.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Students s
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Enrollment
    WHERE studentId = s.StudentId AND ClassId = 'x')
AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Enrollment
    WHERE studentId = s.StudentId AND ClassId = 'y')
AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Enrollment
    WHERE studentId = s.StudentId AND ClassId = 'z')
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Enrollment
    WHERE studentId = s.StudentId AND ClassId IN ('a', 'b', 'c')
</code></pre>
