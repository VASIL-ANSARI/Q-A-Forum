<p>Your UI content is most likely contained within another view that isn't being sized to the full screen on the iPad. It was probably sized appropriately for the iPhone screen and isn't being adjusted. You can probably see this if you give a background color to the view that contains those UI elements, or maybe it's parent possibly. If you're using auto layout, you'll want to put constraints that specify no gaps between that view and the superview's edges. If not using auto layout, you'll want to use the autoresizing (struts and springs) to specify that the view should stretch horizontally and vertically, and maintain a fixed distance from all 4 edges.</p>

<p>For the issue with some elements like text fields not appearing to be connected to the controller, maybe you don't have them hooked up in the xib. Right-click on the text fields and such in the xib and see if they show that they're connected. If not, connect them.</p>
