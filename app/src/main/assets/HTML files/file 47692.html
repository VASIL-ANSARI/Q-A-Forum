<p>I'm going to pre-face this answer with a "You really, really shouldn't".</p>

<p>The reasons for this are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The path may not even exist on the target system</li>
<li>You may not have permission to write files to that folder</li>
<li>Your application may be deployed to a Clustered application server behind a loadbalancer, and the Filesystems might be local, creating bugs that are strange and difficult to debug.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you still really really want an answer, this question has been answered here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/941754/how-to-get-a-path-to-a-resource-in-a-java-jar-file">How to get a path to a resource in a Java JAR file</a></p>
