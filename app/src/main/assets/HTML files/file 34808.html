<p>I've had a similar issue like this before. What fixed it for me was not directly calling the <code>content.getBytes()</code> directly into the into the write method, but first making sure it's labeled as a byte array and then writing through the <code>FileOutputStream</code>.</p>

<pre><code>String n_content = (String)content;
byte[] bContent = n_content.getBytes;
fos.write(bContent);
</code></pre>

<p>If this ceases to work I believe your <code>openFileOutput()</code> isn't returning a proper <code>FileOutputStream</code> instance. </p>
