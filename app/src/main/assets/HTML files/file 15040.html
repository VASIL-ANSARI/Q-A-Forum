<p>"significant location changes" over 4 days means your app is not only draining the battery (a no-no since iOS 4.x), but it is taking resources away from the system in the background.  Apps cannot process forever in the background, so the OS makes the choice to kill it.  Just turn off background processing and only update the user's location when they open the app.  And do you want to know the best part:  It's all fairly random!  The OS could have killed Mail or YouTube or some such other app to make room for yours, but it didn't, it killed your app.  There is no documented way around it, sorry.</p>
