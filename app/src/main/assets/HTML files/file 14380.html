<p>Google issues different OpenID Claimed Identifiers to different OpenID realms.  When you log in locally your realm is likely 'localhost' but in production it's obviously different, so Google issues different OpenIDs causing you to not recognize the user.  Google is fairly unique in this respect.</p>

<p>I suggest you obtain your claimed ids from your production realm.</p>
