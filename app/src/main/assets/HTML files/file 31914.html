<p>A target can consolidate multiple conversations into few conversation groups, using the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174987.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>MOVE CONVERSATION</code></a>. The <code>RECEIVE</code> restricts the result set to one single conversation <em>group</em> so moving many individual conversation into a single group can result in bigger result sets, as you desire.</p>

<p>For the records, initiators can also consolidate conversations using <code>MOVE CONVERSATION</code>, there is nothing role specific here. But initiators can also use the <code>RELATED_CONVERSATION_GROUP</code> clause of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187377.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>BEGIN DIALOG</code></a> to start the conversation directly in the desired group, achieving consolidation and thus bigger result sets w/o having to use <code>MOVE</code>. This is useful because you can simply reverse the roles in the app, ie. instead of stores starting the dialogs with central server, have the central server start the dialogs with each store (thus reversing the roles) and the central server can start the dialogs in as few conversation groups as it likes, even 1. This removes the need to issue MOVE CONVERSATION.</p>
