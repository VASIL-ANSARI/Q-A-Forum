<p>Are you able to run your script from shell like this <code>python vmTranslator.py BasicTest.vm</code>?.. This should work if vmTranslator.py includes what it needs to work. If so, you can write the following into your executable shell script <code>VMTranslator</code>: </p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
python vmTranslator.py $1
</code></pre>

<p>Then you should be able to run it like this: </p>

<pre><code>./VMTranslator BasicTest.vm
</code></pre>

<p>You will need <code>./</code> in the beginning for the case if your <code>PATH</code> variable does not include current directory <code>.</code> (which is highly recommended settings these days).</p>

<p>Also, be sure to provide correct shebang line <code>#!/bin/bash</code> to locate shell on your system.</p>
