<p>The attribute you want is "id (identifies a tweet uniquely).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Some further ideas:
If i had to do it in PHP, i would use cronjobs if possible. For storing the unique_id (and desired other fields from the tweet data) you could just use a mysql table (and use the id as primary key). If you don't have experience in that field, it will be harder as that is imo the easiest way to save a lot of tweets and avoid duplicates.</p>

<p>For the search api part: There is a parameter "since_id" what is basically a greater than filter. So if you saved your last retrieved tweet, you can just use this to continue your search and retrieve tweets newer than the last one saved (so there shouldn't be any duplicates anyway). </p>
