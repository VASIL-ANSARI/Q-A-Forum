<p>If you really wanted to do something about this instead of rewriting your UI code, you can actually grab the output from the buffer before it is sent to the client and modify it. Your modifications could be as simple as removing a hardcoded list of script tags and replacing them with a custom script file that you host in your webroot. The custom script file would simply be all of the other script files' contents combined.</p>

<p>To do this: </p>

<ol>
<li>In onRequestEnd in application.cfc you can call <code>var outputBuffer = getPageContext().popBody().getBuffer()</code> which will return the body to be sent to the client. </li>
<li>Run replacements on <code>outputBuffer</code>, looking for those script tags and removing them via regular expressions. You'll want to keep track of whether or not you've actually removed any to use as a flag in the next step. </li>
<li>Finally, you would append to the output with your new master script tag if your flag that replacements have been made is true. After you do that, the buffer will be automatically flushed to the client. </li>
</ol>

<p>I believe that Adobe no longer updates the script files, so you basically don't have to worry about versioning your master script file to clear the browser cache.</p>

<p>Edit/Note: Definitely avoid using the CF UI stuff, but we don't know what your situation is like right now. If you have hundreds or thousands of hours of rewriting to do, then obviously rewriting it all is likely not something that is practical at this time.</p>
