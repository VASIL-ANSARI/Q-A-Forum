<p>I'm going out from the assumption that your example code is inside a loop, thus all you need to do is to ensure that when you hit a certain <code>id</code> (the one you want to keep open), that it gets the status of open at all times.</p>

<p>Assuming, say, the <code>id</code> of the section you want to keep open is <code>3</code>, this is what you could do:</p>

<pre><code>if ($id == 3)
    $state = 'open';
</code></pre>

<p>Insert this statement on top of the code block you added to your question.</p>

<p>As I don't know what else is influencing the variable <code>$state</code>, make sure it's not being changed anywhere else, so that your statement above always remains true ensuring the section to always remain open.</p>
