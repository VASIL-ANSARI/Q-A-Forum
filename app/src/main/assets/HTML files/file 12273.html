<p>I did stuff like you said (collection in model) from different "side" which would work here. When I had a model that had a Collection I used events in the model to create collection.</p>

<pre><code>class ModelA extends Backbone.Model
  initialize: -&gt;
    bind("change", @initializeCollection)

  initializeCollection: -&gt;
    if !@collection
      @collection = new Collection(@attributes.collection) 
    else
      @collection.set(@attributes.collection)
</code></pre>

<p>The rest is the same so I won't put it in. </p>

<p>Also if you go deeper: 
modelA -> collecionB -> modelB -> collectionC -> modelC
Than in modelB in constructor you can create collectionC (providing you don't reuse it)</p>

<p>[Edit]
I've got another idea:</p>

<pre><code>class ModelA extends Backbone.Model
  parse: (resp) -&gt;
    if @attributes.collection
      @attributes.collection.set(resp.collection)
      delete resp.collection
    else
      resp.collection = new Collection(resp.collection)
    resp
</code></pre>
