<p>My subview was placed where the navigation bar usually sits. I had to make sure that my view is on top of it (and everything else, in fact) by using the code:</p>

<p><code>[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] addSubview:myView];</code>, where my view is a subview that I wanted to be on top.</p>
