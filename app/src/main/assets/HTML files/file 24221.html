<p>You must have this control within a Panel or something with <code>runat="server"</code> and the custom control itself is a naming container for its children. If you want identifiers to be how you name them with no change, you'll want to use the <code>Predictable</code> (IIRC) client id mode.</p>

<p>Note: though looking at the documentation for <code>Predictable</code> this doesn't seem to be the case, I'm sure it's what I've always used to get 'clean' .NET identifiers in ASP.NET.</p>

<p>Further, if you want to apply the ClientIDMode globally, then specify it in the web.config file in the attribute of the <code>&lt;pages&gt;</code> element.</p>
