<p>I found the solution for the issue. You can now use Web Components with the native APIs on Chrome and with the polyfills on Firefox and Safari. </p>

<p>Just update this line:</p>

<p><code>var thisDoc = (thatDoc.currentScript || thatDoc._currentScript).ownerDocument;</code></p>

<p>to</p>

<p><code>var thisDoc = (thatDoc._currentScript || thatDoc.currentScript).ownerDocument;</code></p>

<h2>Why does this work?</h2>

<p>The _currentScript comes from the polyfills and allows you to get the correct ownerDocument to query the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> from. If polyfills do not exist, the above code is using currentScript instead, which is available on Chrome.</p>

<p>I already made a Pull request on the github. </p>
