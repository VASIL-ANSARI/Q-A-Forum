<p>Depending on the device you are using and compiler you are using, you can try some "specific" issues. E.g. in some compilers there are techniques that allow to perform wide load from memory and, in result of that, fastest multiple comparisons. Also there are ways to manually unroll the loop, so they are executed faster. But it depends on compiler.
You can always try some ways and check assembler code to see which way is the fastest.</p>
