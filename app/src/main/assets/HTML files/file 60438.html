<p>Here is what solution I figured out. So far is the best way. </p>

<p>I moved all site related routes in another file routing_site.yml and then included that routing with <code>host</code>.</p>

<pre><code>admin:
    path: /
    host:     "admin.%domain%"
    defaults:
        _controller: AdminBundle:Default:index

app:
    resource: routing_site.yml
    host: "%domain%"
</code></pre>
