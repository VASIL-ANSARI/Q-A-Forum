<p>SRIDs are a way to take into account that the distances that you're measuring on aren't on a flat, infinite plane but rather an oblong spheroid. They make sense for the geography data type, but not for geometry. So, if you're doing geographic calculations (as your statement of "in comparison to the geography field I have"), create geography points instead of geometry points. In order to do calculations on any geospatial data (like "find the distance from this point to this other point"), the SRID of all the objects involved need to be the same.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Is the point on the Cartesian plane? Use geometry. Is the point on the globe? Use geography.</p>
