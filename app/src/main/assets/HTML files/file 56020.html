<p>Don't worry about it! Trying to "encourage" the garbage collector to reclaim memory isn't a great idea - just leave it to do its work in the background. </p>

<p>Just load your different set of data. If memory is getting low the GC will kick in to reclaim the memory without you having to do anything, and if there's plenty of memory available then you'll be able to load the new set without taking the hit of a garbage collection.</p>
