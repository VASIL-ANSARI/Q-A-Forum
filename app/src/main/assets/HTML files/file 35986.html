<p>You had the right idea with <code>$('#myTable &gt; tr:last')</code>, but tables actually also include a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> tag...if you don't put one in yourself, then the browser puts it in for you. So you need to use this instead:</p>

<pre><code>$('#myTable tr:last')
</code></pre>

<p>Don't use the <code>&gt;</code> selector, because that requires that the element following it has to be a <em>direct</em> child of the preceding element.</p>

<p>Also, <code>$('#myTable &gt; td:last')</code> is definitely incorrect because a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> element is never a direct child of a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element - it's inside a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, which in turn is inside a <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>.</p>
