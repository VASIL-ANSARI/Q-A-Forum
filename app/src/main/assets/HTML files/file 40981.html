<p>Some suggestions,</p>

<p>If you think about an existing scenario, when we chat we specifically know who we chat with. So if you want your app to have one-to-one communication do something like mapping "user names" to thread ID's handling each client in server. Then for each message send message with specific "User Name" so at server you can identify which thread to forward that message. </p>

<p>Remember You may dynamically create threads to handle more clients and also have checks for "Online clients" [Which could be a future implementation]</p>

<p>P.S- First try to handle multiple clients with multi-cast using thread for each newly connected client. User arrays to store Thread ID and stuff and listen to every client using while loops. You may need Locks here to avoid race conditions.</p>
