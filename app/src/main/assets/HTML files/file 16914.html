<p>One thing you could do is create a wrapper model:</p>

<pre><code>class Thread &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :messages
end
</code></pre>

<p>to act as the parent of your messages. That way, if you know which thread you want to add a message to you can just call <code>@thread.messages.create!(params[:message])</code>. If want to add a message to a new thread, you can just create a new thread and add the message in the same way. You won't have to worry about assigning an incremented thread_id to the message, as the Thread model will automatically auto-increment the id of the new thread and assign it to the message.</p>

<p>This method also allows you keep track of info about the thread, like when the thread was created by having a "created_at" column, if that at all interests you.</p>
