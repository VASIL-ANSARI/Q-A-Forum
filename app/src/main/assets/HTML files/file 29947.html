<p>out means that the parameter passed to it will be passed "by reference", as opposed to "by value". <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee332485.aspx" rel="nofollow">See C# documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with UnityScript. But one way to create an equivalent function would be to create a new class to be returned that contains the Boolean that would normally be returned, as well as the RaycastHit object.</p>

<pre><code>class MyCustomReturnObject
    Boolean OriginalReturnVariable
    RaycastHit hit
</code></pre>
