<p>If I had to design this game, I would try to identify different objects that are hidden in the problem statement as follows :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The player can choose a character from a pool of 12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm. So I am going to need a <code>Player</code> and <code>Character</code> class.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They have similarities between them but each character could move
  differently, could use different items</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok. So there is behavior that is common to each <code>Character</code> but Characters can also have additional behavior that is different from the common behavior. Let's add methods in Character for each behavior that is common across characters. </p>

<p>But what about the behavior that is only applicable for a particular type of Character? Ok so I definitely need a way to add behavior to my characters at runtime. </p>

<p>Hmmmm. Let's create an <code>interface</code> called <code>Behavior</code> which contains a method called.. umm.. behave. Let's create a couple of classes that implement this interface and implement the behave method.  </p>

<p>So far so good. We have a <code>Character</code> class that can be used to instantiate one of 12 characters. We have a <code>Behavior</code> hierarchy for additional behaviors not common across characters. We now need to make these two classes work together in such a way that we can add behavior at runtime. Throughout my career, I have been told to favor composition over inheritance. So I guess I am going to make character <code>have-a</code> <code>Behavior</code> by adding a <code>Behavior</code> reference in <code>Character</code>. There is a name for this pattern.. this is the <code>Strategy</code> pattern.</p>

<p>The most important take-away from the above explanation is that you don't look at a problem and say <code>what design pattern can I apply?</code>. Instead, you come up with an initial draft of what your design will be like and say <code>this looks like the XYZ pattern</code></p>

<p>There are lot of requirements that I have not covered in this answer. The idea of this answer is to explain to you the kind of thought process you can put in to come up with an initial draft of your design and keep evolving it rather than over-designing right at the beginning. </p>
