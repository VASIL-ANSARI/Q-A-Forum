<p><code>CoreLocation</code> will handle all the alerts for you. If locations services are disabled and that you ask for the location, <code>CoreLocation</code> will show an alert telling so to the user with a button to go directly to <code>Settings.app</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to know what append you can check for the delegate call </p>

<pre><code>- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didFailWithError:(NSError *)error
</code></pre>

<p>The error here contains a code that will be <code>kCLErrorDenied</code> if the user doesn't let the app use location services. </p>

<p>Also, you should use CoreLocation when the user need it. It's not necessary to check for location services at launch and the overhead of multiple <code>CLLocationManager</code> is almost inexistent.</p>
