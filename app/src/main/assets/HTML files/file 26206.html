<p>I solved that same problem by replacing the RequestQueue's ResponseDelivery with one that doesn't use the Looper.getMainLooper() but a new Executor. Example code:</p>

<pre><code>public static RequestQueue newRequestQueueForTest(final Context context, final OkHttpClient okHttpClient) {
    final File cacheDir = new File(context.getCacheDir(), "volley");

    final Network network = new BasicNetwork(new OkHttpStack(okHttpClient));

    final ResponseDelivery responseDelivery = new ExecutorDelivery(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor());

    final RequestQueue queue =
            new RequestQueue(
                    new DiskBasedCache(cacheDir),
                    network,
                    4,
                    responseDelivery);

    queue.start();

    return queue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: use Robolectric-2.2-SNAPSHOT, the previous version doesn't play well with Volley.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
