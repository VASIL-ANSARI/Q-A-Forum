<p>Sure you can! And it's really easy. When a file is being redirected to standard input, <code>stdin</code> is a file, so you can treat it just like any other file:</p>

<pre><code>rewind(stdin);
</code></pre>

<p>But keep in mind that this will only work if standard input is being redirected <strong>from a file</strong>. It won't work if standard input is from the terminal or a pipe (e.g, <code>cat file.txt | myapp</code>).</p>
