<p>You really can't do that with the built-in loader, the model <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/blob/2.1-stable/system/core/Loader.php#L303" rel="nofollow">loading code hardcoded</a> with empty <code>new</code> parameters (at least in version 2.1).</p>

<p>You might want to move your code to a library since library loading can take a second array parameter with options, <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/loader.html" rel="nofollow">see here</a>.</p>

<p>Since CI's loader will only create one instance of these classes, you can move your configuration into the config files and read them from there in your <code>__construct</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could extend the <code>Loader</code> class and reimplement the <code>model()</code> method to take some parameters (if you don't mind having a 4th parameter or something like that).</p>
