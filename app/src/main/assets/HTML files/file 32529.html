<p>That is because you need to configurate karma to load then serve them when requested ;)</p>

<p>In your karma.conf.js file you should already have defined files and/or patterns like :</p>

<pre><code>// list of files / patterns to load in the browser
files : [
  {pattern: 'app/lib/angular.js', watched: true, included: true, served: true},
  {pattern: 'app/lib/angular-*.js', watched: true, included: true, served: true},
  {pattern: 'app/lib/**/*.js', watched: true, included: true, served: true},
  {pattern: 'app/js/**/*.js', watched: true, included: true, served: true},
  // add the line below with the correct path pattern for your case
  {pattern: 'path/to/**/*.png', watched: false, included: false, served: true},
  // important: notice that "included" must be false to avoid errors
  // otherwise Karma will include them as scripts
  {pattern: 'test/lib/**/*.js', watched: true, included: true, served: true},
  {pattern: 'test/unit/**/*.js', watched: true, included: true, served: true},
],

// list of files to exclude
exclude: [

],

// ...
</code></pre>

<p>You can have a look <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/config/files.html">here</a> for more info :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> If you use a nodejs web-server to run your app, you can add this to karma.conf.js : </p>

<pre><code>proxies: {
  '/path/to/img/': 'http://localhost:8000/path/to/img/'
},
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT2 :</strong> If you don't use or want to use another server you can define a local proxy but as Karma doesn't provide access to port in use, dynamically, if karma starts on another port than 9876 (default), you will still get those annoying 404...</p>

<pre><code>proxies =  {
  '/images/': '/base/images/'
};
</code></pre>
