<p>Based on your latest change, wouldn't this work:</p>

<pre><code>$votedToday = ($today-&gt;format('Y-m-d') == $lastDate-&gt;format('Y-m-d'));
</code></pre>

<p>I agree it's kind of strange that DateTime doesn't have a method to just extract the date portion, similar to MySQL, but if you're going to use <code>format</code>, why not skip the <code>diff</code> and just compare the formatted date string for the full date of both DateTime objects?</p>

<p>And to simplify it further, you could use:</p>

<pre><code>$votedToday = ($lastDate-&gt;format('Y-m-d') == date('Y-m-d'));
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you are only using <code>$today</code> to confirm if <code>$lastDate</code> is on today.</p>
