<p>Assuming this logic is correct, you can probably just use <code>coalesce()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>coalesce(a13.answerId, a14.answerId, a15.answerId, a16.answerId) as answerId
</code></pre>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>The logic is not <em>exactly</em> the same.  If <code>answerId</code> can be <code>NULL</code> on a matching answer, then this does not do what you want.  Otherwise, though, it is a simpler way to express this logic.</p>
