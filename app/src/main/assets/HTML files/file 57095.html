<p>It depends on what you want to achieve, but an easy fix to your problem is to change your code to this:</p>

<pre><code>body {
  background: black;
  height: 3000px;
  overflow-x: hidden !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If your content is hidden by a parent container in the y-direction, then the content in the child container cannot be scrolled in that same direction.</p>

<p>Edit: You need to add a wrapping container to the green area if you want the green to be scrollable, but not the body. Check the updated fiddle.</p>
