<p>In my opinion, your pattern seems fine. I've done something similar in the past and haven't had any bad experiences with it. If you really have a ton of cases, maybe the observer pattern would be okay here. Your InitialInterpreter can accept the message and dispatch it to all of it's observers (which would be your other interpreters). Each interpreter can choose to do something with the message or not based on regular expressions or string matching or whatever you choose.</p>

<p>In this pattern, interpreters contain the logic of when to interpret inside of themselves. The InitialInterpreter and your controller won't care what interpreter picks up the message as long as it's subscribed to the InitialInterpreter's events.</p>

<p>Another benefit to the observer pattern is that it allows you to easily add multiple interpreters for a single command if you need to do so in the future. Ruby has built in support for observers via the Observable module. I believe Rails has something for it as well but I've never personally used it.</p>
