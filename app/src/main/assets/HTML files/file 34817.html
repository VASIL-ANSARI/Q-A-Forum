<p>I'm not an expert either but I think you are having issues because the source and target values in your connections should be referencing the respective positional array index for the node (not the name of the node).</p>

<p>A simple example, in your fiddle just change the first connection from...</p>

<p>{"connection":{"source":"Rita","target":"Resilient Toronto"}} </p>

<p>to...</p>

<p>{"connection":{"source":1,"target":4}}</p>

<p>1 and 4 being the index of the elements in the nodes array. Hope this is what you are looking for.</p>
