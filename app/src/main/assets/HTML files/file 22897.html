<p>The easiest way I can think to so this is to set all elements to be <code>position: absolute</code> rather than put them into a table. Because it's easier to move if is <code>position: absolute</code>.</p>

<p>When moving, you will need <a href="http://api.jquery.com/animate/" rel="nofollow"><code>$.animate</code></a> for animation effect. You need to the calculation by yourself (I think it's not that difficult) and set the parameters like:</p>

<pre><code>$('.block').click(function() {
    $(this).animate({
        left: 100,
        top: 200
    }, 3000); // animation time is 3 seconds
});
</code></pre>
