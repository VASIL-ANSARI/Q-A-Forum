<p>I think you should be able to use <code>ImageIO.read</code> to parse the image:</p>

<pre><code>InputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(imageDataByteArray);
BufferedImage bufImg = ImageIO.read(in);
ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon(bufImg);
myButton.setIcon(icon);
</code></pre>

<p>As <code>BufferedImage</code> is a subclass of <code>java.awt.Image</code>, you should be able to use it as is.  I haven't tested this myself, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.</p>

<p>Note also that you can't randomly change the byte array and expect it to represent a valid image.  If you supply an array that doesn't contain a valid image data (or contains image of an unsupported format), <code>ImageIO.read</code> will return <code>null</code>.  Have a look at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#read%28java.io.InputStream%29" rel="nofollow"><code>ImageIO.read</code> documentation</a> for more info.</p>
