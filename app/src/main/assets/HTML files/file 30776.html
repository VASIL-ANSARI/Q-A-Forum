<p>There is no library routine for this, and there cannot be because there is no general way of comparing numbers containing errors that is suitable for all applications.</p>

<p>The kinds of errors that can occur in numerical calculations (whether floating-point or otherwise) include errors that are relative to some known final value, errors that are absolute or that are relative to some value other than the final value or even the input values, combinations of these, and more. The magnitudes of errors can range from zero to infinity or can even be non-numerical (when errors during calculation create NaNs).</p>

<p>In order to determine what error can be tolerated, it is essential to know what calculations were performed, what bounds there are on the input data and on intermediate values, and what harms will be caused by falsely accepting as equal two numbers that would not be equal if computed exactly and, conversely, by false rejecting as equal two numbers that would be equal if computed exactly.</p>

<p>All of this is hugely application-specific, so it cannot be solved with a general library routine. The bulk of the work in solving this problem is analyzing the errors and judging the benefits and harms of potential choices. Once that work is done, the actual comparison is so easy (test whether the difference between the two numbers is within the interval judged to be acceptable) that little is accomplished by providing a library routine for it.</p>

<p>Some people approach this problem as âWe do numerical calculations, we get some error, the error is caused by numerical rounding, not by the actual mathematics, so letâs ignore it.â But the actual problem is âThis program computes <strong>wrong numbers</strong>; how do we get right answers from wrong numbers?â</p>

<p>In general, you cannot. There is no library routine that accepts wrong numbers as arguments and returns correct answers as results.</p>

<p>In conclusion, you have to look at your code and the numbers you are working with and figure out what errors you can accept.</p>
