<p>Do you need the table on the other end to be rebuilt in the same order?  If so, you need to send the array positions.  If not, you can just send all strings in any order you like and the client can insert.</p>

<p>The easiest way is to send in text mode, although that often makes for a little more work at the client end.  Personally, I'd send the table size as well as the number of strings to expect, and send one entry per line:</p>

<pre><code>117 5
puppy
kitten
cub
joey
duckling
</code></pre>

<p>And if I needed the array positions too, there's nothing wrong with sending them in text as well (but you may prefer binary):</p>

<pre><code>117 5
8 puppy
42 kitten
57 cub
101 joey
105 duckling
</code></pre>
