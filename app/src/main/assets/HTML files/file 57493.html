<p>What fljs was saying, you are emitting an event called 'player_joined_queue'.
But you are listening for the event 'client_join_queue'. You need to listen for the event with the same name you are emitting. So you would need to change one or the other. for example,</p>

<pre><code>socket.on('player_joined_queue', function (username) {
...
</code></pre>
