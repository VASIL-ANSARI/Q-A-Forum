<p>Only apps that hold the <code>WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</code> permission can modify <code>Settings.Secure</code> values. <code>WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</code> is a <code>signature</code>-level permission, which ordinary Android SDK apps cannot hold.</p>

<p>You are welcome to create your own custom build of Android, turn that into a custom ROM, and install that ROM on Android devices. Your app, with <code>WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</code>, can be a part of that ROM.</p>
