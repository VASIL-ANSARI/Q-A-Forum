<p>Please note that the use of <code>split()</code> is highly discouraged, it's now deprecated. You could use <code>preg_split()</code> or <code>explode()</code>.</p>

<p>What you want to do here is to use REGEX to search for the semi-colons and commas that aren't in the middle of the your text. <code>preg_split()</code> should get the job done with the right expression.</p>
