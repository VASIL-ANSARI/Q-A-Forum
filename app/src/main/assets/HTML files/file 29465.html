<p>Though you are not given code . I can give you idea. When the user clicks on Forget Password link then it will go Forget Password Activity , in this Activity asked user to put a unique filed which already in your Server database,suppose, email id or phone number or any security question. After give this answer or email then you click submit button . When you will press the submit button then in background match this field with server data field and from server side send password to the given email id and send response after that to Android end. Which will show that you password has been send to your email id successfully .</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
