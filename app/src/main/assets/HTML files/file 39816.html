<p>Testing with these inputs (a value that doesn't exist in <code>$blacklist</code>)...</p>

<pre><code>isSomeUser('100500000000000000683'); // should be false.
isSomeUser(100500000000000000683); // should be false.
</code></pre>

<p>...seems to show a bug in older versions of PHP (<em>or in 64bit versions</em>).</p>

<p>Results:</p>

<pre>
a = win 5.5.19 32bit
b = win 5.4.24 32bit
c = lin 5.2.5 64bit
d = lin 5.3.29 64bit
e = lin 5.5.9 32bit  (OP development box)
f = lin 5.3.10 64bit (OP production box)

 expected | a | b | c | d | e | f
----------|---|---|---|---|---|---
 f        | f | f | t | t | f | t
 f        | t | t | t | t | t | t
</pre>

<p>Since <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php" rel="nofollow"><code>PHP_INT_MAX</code></a>, even on a 64bit installation, is less than the input value it is converted to a <code>float</code> and the second test fails for every version. This is understandably erratic behaviour.</p>

<p>But there is clearly something wrong with the results of <code>c, d, and f</code> on the first test where <code>true</code> is returned instead of the expected <code>false</code> <em>for a loose type string comparison</em>.</p>

<p>The failing versions are all &lt; 5.4 <em>and</em> 64bit.  As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27288960/comparision-problems-with-php-when-comparing-strings-with-large-numbers#comment43046469_27288960">I mentioned</a>, you should anyway upgrade the production server to at least the latest 5.4. If the problem persists then I would say this is a bug in 64bit versions of PHP and should be <a href="https://bugs.php.net/" rel="nofollow">reported</a> as such.</p>
