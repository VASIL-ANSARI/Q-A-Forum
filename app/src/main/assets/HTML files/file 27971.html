<p>One way to do this would be to have some data in <code>tblCurrent</code> that enables you to detect the situation you describe as "first uploaded".  For example, a BIT column "FirstUploaded", or a column that is NULL when first uploaded, or even a BIT column "DontFireTrigger".</p>

<p>Then write your trigger to detect this condition, and conditionally update the status fields.</p>

<p>Admittedly this looks like a nasty hack, but perhaps no worse than other solutions.</p>
