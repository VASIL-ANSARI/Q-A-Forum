<p>You may have an error that prevents the page from being rendered properly.</p>

<p>Use some debugging facilities for help :</p>

<ul>
<li>Inside your request spec, use <code>puts page.html</code> to print the page content during your spec.</li>
<li>track the log files (log/test.log)</li>
</ul>

<p>Could you show your ./spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb source ?</p>
