<p>"variables" and "strings" exist in a later phase of compilation; the preprocessor runs at the stage where you have mere tokens. Your idea cannot be made to work in C++.</p>

<p>Not a C++98 problem, either: the same phases of compilation still apply to C++17, and I would be highly surprised if they ever change. More fundamentally, you assume an interpreted language when you write <code>std::string paramList = "int, int"</code>. At the time where you have an actual <code>std::string variable</code>, the compiler must have run in the past, but that <code>int,int</code> is <em>input</em> to the compiler. An interpreter can interpret new code while existing code is running, but a compiler does not.</p>
