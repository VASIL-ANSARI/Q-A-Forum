<p>You probably don't need to have an entity for price, as it will likely just be a float. I'd recommend adding a price attribute to your product entity instead.</p>

<p>I don't know if transactions will need names or not, I suppose if you want to have notes then they should.</p>

<p>Also transactions should probably have a to-many relationship with products. </p>

<p>Will this be used on a single device or will there be many users? If each user (account) is responsible for its own data then it may make more sense to have transactions/session rather than transactions/user.</p>
