<p>Long question, simple answer: You can refer to the pointcut by its name, so if you have multiple advices referring to the same pointcut you only need to change it in one place and leave the references untouched. This is similar to using a variable vs. literals in Java code.</p>

<p>Look at your own example: The two advices <code>trackChange</code> and <code>logFailure</code> both use the same pointcut, which is quite convenient. DRY - don't repeat yourself. ;-) Sometimes pointcuts are a bit more complex than yours, they can span multiple lines in complex scenarios.</p>
