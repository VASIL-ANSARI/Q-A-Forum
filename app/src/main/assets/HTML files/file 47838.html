<p>There is currently no API to know whether there are any outstanding changes that you still have to receive.</p>

<p>I guess it is fair to assume that if you haven't gotten any events from the Firebase server in a few seconds, you probably have all the data that you're listening or synchronizing. Whenever somebody makes a change after that, Firebase sends the actual changes down to your app.</p>
