<p>You might initialize through an Application class. This class is present across all activities. You must declare it in the Manifest file and has a life-cycle similar to an Activity.</p>

<p>Documentation here: <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html" rel="nofollow">Application</a></p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
