<p>There is no "handover".  Every task in a background session <strong>always</strong> runs in a separate process, period.</p>

<p>The <code>application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:</code> method, however, runs only if your app gets terminated by the OS (<strong>not</strong> by the user) while a download is in progress.  If this happens, your app gets relaunched in the background whenever the download finishes.</p>

<p>You can potentially test this by starting a large download in the background that will take long enough to complete that your app will get evicted... or by switching to another app that pigs out on RAM until your app gets evicted.</p>
