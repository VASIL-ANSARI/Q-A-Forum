<p>I fixed this by changing the loaded scripts to execute immediately:</p>

<pre><code>(function () { /* ... */ })();
</code></pre>

<p>and then removing the callbacks.</p>

<p>There was no problem with the browser, but in the reaction time. For some reason, the userscript finished too early in Fx 4.</p>
