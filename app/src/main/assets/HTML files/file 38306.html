<p>It really depends on the hardware you're targeting, but it will probably compile to the same thing as any other function pointer call. It's also possible for the compiler to recognize the constant value given to <code>reset</code>, and optimize it as such. If nothing else, you could always do:</p>

<pre><code>((void (*)())NULL)();
</code></pre>

<p>which basically casts <code>NULL</code> to a parameterless function of type <code>void</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Whether or not the call succeeds is an entirely different matter: on most platforms using virtual memory, the kernel purposefully leaves the <code>NULL</code> address + some amount of space unmapped (maybe a few KB, maybe a few MB). Your instruction pointer will probably still go to 0, but as soon as the CPU tries to fetch an instruction from that address, <strong>KABOOM</strong>.</p>
