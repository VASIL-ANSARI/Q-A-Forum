<p>First off, the concept of <em>composition</em> is on a whole different level than design patterns. Most design patterns <em>use</em> composition âÂ thatâs totally fine.</p>

<p>Secondly, no, you donât use composition here. You invoke the <code>print</code> function of the argument thatâs passed to the printer:</p>

<pre><code>class Printer{
public:
    void print(Message&amp; m) {
        m.print();
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Iâve gone ahead and fixed a bug: the argument needs to be passed by reference (or as a pointer), otherwise you lose the dynamic type. For that reason, the <code>Message::print</code> function also needs to be declared as <code>virtual</code>.</p>
