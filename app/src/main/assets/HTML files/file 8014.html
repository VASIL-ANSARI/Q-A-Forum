<p>It's really hard to tell what do you want to achieve and pieces of code do not cover all possible erroneous areas (i.e. where's the <code>MainWindow</code> constructor's definition?). Also, the formatting is terrible - please use idents and consistent bracing style. </p>

<p>My advice is simply call <code>show</code> on <code>MainWindow</code> instance. Unless you don't mess up <code>ui</code> initialization in <code>MainWindow</code> constructor, this snippet should be enough. If it is not - supply us with missing pieces of code.</p>

<pre><code>void test()  
{
    MainWindow *gui = new MainWindow;
    gui-&gt;addString("WORKS");
    gui-&gt;show();
}
</code></pre>

<p>As a side note, your <code>addString</code> method should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>void MainWindow::addString(char* text)
{
    ui-&gt;textBrowser-&gt;append(QString::fromAscii(text));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Return statement is completely unnecessary, and assigning <code>text</code> to <code>std::string</code> is likely to cause unnecessary memory allocation. It's not like it is the end of the world, but it's really, really bad practice for a C++ programmer.</p>
