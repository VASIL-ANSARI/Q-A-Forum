<p>The version of the json gem you are using is not compatible with Ruby >= 2.2. Please use at least version 1.8.2 of the json gem with Ruby 2.3. </p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/flori/json/blob/master/CHANGES.md" rel="nofollow">Changelog</a> for details about changes in functionality and compatibility.</p>

<p>That said, most of the time you don't even need an external gem to be able to work with JSON data in Ruby. The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.0/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html" rel="nofollow">JSON module</a> shipped with Ruby's standard library is fully functional and compatible with Rails already.</p>
