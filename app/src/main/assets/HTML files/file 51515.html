<p>You could work with padding:</p>

<pre><code>String columnName = "Test 1";
int columnLength = column.length;
System.out.println(String.format("%1$-" + columnLength + "s", value));
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a right padding for the size of the column headline. If those values are the type you are expecting this should work fine. If your row values get bigger you have to take care if the width is higher than the headline width. In that case you might also want to increase the space between your headlines.</p>
