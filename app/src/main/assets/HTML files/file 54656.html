<p>You should create a single <code>DbContext</code> per ASP.NET request.</p>

<p>In your case, it makes sense that the <code>SaveParty</code> creates an instance of the context and make the <code>SaveSingleParty</code> and <code>SaveSinglePartyUser</code> use that instance to create and insert the entities, and then only <code>SaveParty</code> would call <code>SaveChanges</code>.</p>

<p>The advantage is that a single <code>SaveChanges</code> call will send a single SQL query to the database instead of many SQL queries. Also, <code>SaveChanges</code> will run under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction" rel="nofollow">single transaction</a>. This means that all the data will be either saved or not saved. That is, you cannot have a scenario where some of the users are saved and some are not.</p>
