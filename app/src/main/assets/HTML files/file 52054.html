<blockquote>
  <p>I want to make a button out of (just) an Image (not showing any border
  or outline), and I also need to be able to change the image when the
  mouse is hovering over the image and off the image. Any help?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe the easiest way to accomplish that is with QPushButton:</p>

<pre><code>// the button has to be somehow initialized and maybe added to layout
QPushButton* pMyPushButton = new QPushButton(this);
layout()-&gt;AddWidget(pMyPushButton);

// try style it like that
// the concrete example limits the scope to pMyPushButton object 
pMyPushButton-&gt;setStyleSheet(
    "QPushButton {"
        "background: transparent;"
        "image: url(res/images/normal_bn_image.png);"
    "}"
    "QPushButton:hover {"
        "image: url(res/images/hover_bn_image.png);"
    "}"
  );
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to provide correct URLs to images. Maybe this clarifies on image resources a bit: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4458201/unable-to-set-the-background-image-in-qt-stylesheet">Unable to set the background image in Qt Stylesheet</a></p>
