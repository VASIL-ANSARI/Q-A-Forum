<p>The most correct way to behave in this situation would be not to use the module that <a href="https://github.com/allink/pennyblack/commits/master" rel="nofollow">is not maintained</a> and doesn't support several latest <code>django</code> versions. Instead, find an alternative, see <a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/" rel="nofollow"><code>Django Packages</code></a>.</p>

<p>Another possible solution would be to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo" rel="nofollow">fork the project</a> on <code>github</code> and <a href="https://github.com/allink/pennyblack/search?q=email_re&amp;ref=cmdform" rel="nofollow">make it work</a> with the version of django you are currently using. </p>
