<p>In your <code>setEditing:animated:</code> method you are doing two things that you are really not supposed to do. Reloading the table data there makes no sense. And if you have to change the buttons in your tab bar manually then you have not set them up properly. The system takes care of that for you. If you have properly setup an edit button then you don't even manually have to call <code>setEditing:animated:</code> actually.</p>

<p>I think you should review some <code>UITableView</code> sample code.</p>
