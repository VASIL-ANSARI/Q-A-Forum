<p>I'm not sure that I really got what you meant. But I think what you mean is how to trigger a click event on a particular div. </p>

<p>If that is it, you can use <code>$("div#id").click();</code> (It is a shortcut for <code>$("div#id").trigger("click")</code> )</p>

<p>You can run this on the console, of course</p>
