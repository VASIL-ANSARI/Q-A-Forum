<p>You cannot use hyphens in function names in PHP. Only letters, numbers and underscores are acceptable.</p>

<p><code>Function names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid function name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: [a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*.</code></p>

<p>From <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php</a></p>

<p>If you want to achieve this you can use routes in Code Igniter. Alternatively, you can include and implement a <code>_remap</code> function in your controller to send URLs with hyphens to the corresponding function, replacing hyphens with underscores.</p>
