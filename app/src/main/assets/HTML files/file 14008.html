  <p>I could upload the db file to any web hosting service to any directory</p>

<p>Supposing that the service has the libraries installed to handle sqlite, and that sqlite is installed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would I be able to run a Python script that writes to SQLite</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, well, maybe. As of Python 2.5, Python includes sqlite support as part of it's standard library.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What questions should I ask a potential hosting service</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, in their technical specs they will list what databases/libraries/languages are supported. I have successfully ran Python sites w/ sqlite databases on Dreamhost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SQLite would run on Unix</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most *nix flavors have pre-packaged sqlite installation binaries. The hosting provider should be able to tell you this as well.</p>
