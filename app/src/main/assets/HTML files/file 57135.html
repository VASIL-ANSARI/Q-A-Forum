<p>It seems, that you have a serialized json, so try this:</p>

<pre><code>$array = json_decode(unserialize($string), true);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But</strong> it also seems that your data is corrupted, that's why <code>unserialize</code> does not work correctly in some <code>PHP</code> versions. If this is your case then in this question you can find a way to fix this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10152904/unserialize-function-unserialize-error-at-offset">unserialize() [function.unserialize]: Error at offset</a>.</p>
