<p>Use a <code>left join</code> to get <code>0</code> for all not found matches</p>

<pre><code>select c.cname, 
       count(so.idclient) as 'Count'
from client c
left join screening_occapancy so on c.client_no = so.idclient 
group by c.cname
</code></pre>

<p>And BTW don't use the legacy implicit join syntax anymore. Use explicit joins.</p>
