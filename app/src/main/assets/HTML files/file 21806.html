<p>The main problem is that you'll bring the server to its knees if many concurrent requests comes in for your servlet, because you don't limit the number of threads that can be spawned. Another problem is that you keep creating new threads instead of reusing them, which is inefficient.</p>

<p>These two problems are solved easily by using a thread pool. And Java has native support for them. Read <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/executors.html">the tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Also, make sure to shutdown the thread pool when the webapp is shut down, using a ServletContextListener.</p>
