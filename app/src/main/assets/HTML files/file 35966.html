<p>This looks like a linkage issue. </p>

<p>You have to ensure that your jar file is properly copied under the <code>/lib</code> directory of your project <strong>AND</strong> added to the build path. </p>

<p>Should you be using Eclipse/ADT, you should upgrade to the latest version (Juno, released on Jun 24th 2014, at the time I am writing this). It takes care of the linkage automatically once the jar files are under /lib.</p>

<p>Should your app be obfuscated, this may also be a ProGuard issue. In that case please let me know, there's already a SO question regarding this.</p>
