<p>Since SLComposeViewController inherits from View Contoller, we need to strip the SLComposeViewcontroller to it UITextView property and fetch its content. Then  we pass the gathered info to the Twitter API along with the <code>"in_reply_to_status_id"</code>. Easy breezy!! Lemme know if you need help with codes! Spoiler I havent implemented it yet.. but since i was able to retrieve the user input from SLComposerViewController, I assume rest of it will be a piece of cake</p>
