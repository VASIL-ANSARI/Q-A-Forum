<p>If it shows only one image (and the image URLs are correct), you're doing it outside of the loop and <code>$i</code> has the value of the last image iterated from the <code>$images</code> array.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>$arr = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'];
foreach($arr as $a) {

}

echo $a;
</code></pre>

<p>This will output <code>four</code>.</p>
