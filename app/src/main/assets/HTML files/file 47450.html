<p>Since you have not provided any code, I can only help you with design.
So, Here is some design tips for you:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Store your matrices in two-dimensional arrays </p>

<p>Ex: <code>int[][] matrix = new int[5][3];</code> this gives you a 5x3 matrix. </p></li>
<li><p>Since you don't know how many matrices you will have, add them into an arraylist. </p>

<p>Ex: <code>ArrayList&lt;int[][]&gt; matrices = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();</code></p></li>
<li><p>I don't know what you mean with comparison but, you can do it using a nested for loop by retrieving the matrices from the arraylist one by one to compare.</p></li>
</ol>
