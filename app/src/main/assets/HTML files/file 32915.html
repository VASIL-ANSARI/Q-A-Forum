<p>Sure it's possible: </p>

<p>Create the button: </p>

<pre><code>    UIButton *bottonOne = [[UIButton alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 15, 65, 12)];
</code></pre>

<p>The set it up with a title / image as you need. Once you have done that do this: </p>

<pre><code>    [buttonOne addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonOnepressed) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the same class create a method called <code>buttonOnepressed</code></p>

<pre><code>    -(void)buttonOnePressed
{
    //preform the steps needed for your segue method and anything else you want to do when the        button has been tapped
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>After reading your comments - you want a button you've created in code, to perform a segue without manually invoking the segue (Writing code to actually show the new screen) and you want it to behave like it would if you did a drag and drop in IB. If that's the case - the short answer is simply, no. If you create a button in code, all its actions need to be done in code, too. </p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>Try this: </p>

<p>In IB create a "generic" segue like this: </p>

<p>Ctrl-drag from the source view controller to the other view you want to do to when the button is tapped. You can use the view controller object at the bottom of the scene to do this.</p>

<p>Give the segue an identifier. </p>

<p>Then use [self performSegueWithIdentifier@"Your Identifier"]; in your button tapped method to perform the segue</p>
