<p>The obvious difference b/w Java and Python is that in Java you need to escape a lot of characters.</p>

<p>Moreover, you are probably running into a mismatch between the matching methods, not a difference in the actual regex notation:</p>

<p>Given the Java</p>

<pre><code>String regex, input; // initialized to something
Matcher matcher = Pattern.compile( regex ).matcher( input );
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Java's <code>matcher.matches()</code> (also <code>Pattern.matches( regex, input )</code>) matches the entire string. It has no direct equivalent in Python. The same result can be achieved by using <code>re.match( regex, input )</code> with a <code>regex</code> that ends with <code>$</code>.</li>
<li>Java's <code>matcher.find()</code> and Python's <code>re.search( regex, input )</code> match any part of the string.</li>
<li>Java's <code>matcher.lookingAt()</code> and Python's <code>re.match( regex, input )</code> match the beginning of the string.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more details also read Java's documentation of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Matcher</code></a> and compare to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#search-vs-match" rel="nofollow">Python documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Since you said that isn't the problem, I decided to do a test: <a href="http://ideone.com/6w61T" rel="nofollow">http://ideone.com/6w61T</a>
It looks like java is doing exactly what you need it to (group 0, the entire match, doesn't contain the <code>;</code>). Your problem is elsewhere.</p>
