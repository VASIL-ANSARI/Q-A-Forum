<p>If the implementation of <code>handleRequest(Request r)</code> is completely thread safe and it doesn't contain any synchronization block or object then I don't see any benefit/disadvantage in having a single shared object compared to separated objects.</p>

<p>This implies that the object which implements <code>handleRequest</code> doesn't have any mutable state of course.</p>

<p>Every thread can enter the method independently by following its code path, this would be the same with multiple objects but you would have different <code>this</code> references (unless the method is <code>static</code>). Now if the code is thread safe then almost nothing is done through the implicit <code>this</code> reference unless calling other thread safe methods so it's equivalent.</p>
