<p>At the very first sight, you are calling the <strong>controller method</strong> <code>send()</code> but you actually named it <code>emailContactForm()</code></p>

<p>You dont post routes and actions so the quick fix by now is trying to rename <code>emailContactForm</code> to <code>send</code>, despite instead you should probably need to review all your related routing logic.</p>
