<p>Realm does not currently have any way to sort all of your objects in place, as it doesn't make any guarantees about the order objects are stored in the underlying database (which allows for better performance). Most of the time, however, sorting an <code>RLMResults</code> is going to be fast enough that it's not a concern.</p>
