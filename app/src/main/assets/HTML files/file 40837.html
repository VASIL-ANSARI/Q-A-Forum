<p>First off, <code>Backbone.navigate</code> doesn't exist.  <code>Backbone.history.navigate</code> does.  But you still have another issue.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Router-navigate" rel="nofollow">Backbone.Router.navigate API</a>: the first argument is the route you want to re-route to, NOT the function you want it to hit.  This is what you are trying to do:</p>

<pre><code>var sampleA = function(){};

Backbone.history.navigate(sampleRouteA, {trigger: true});
</code></pre>

<p>This will not work.  You need to define the router handler, then <em>navigate to the specified route</em>, which Backbone will handle.  The following will (probably) work:</p>

<pre><code>var sampleA = function(){};

var someRoutes = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    'sampleRoute/A': 'doSampleA',
    'sampleRoute/B': 'doSampleB'
  },

  'doSampleA': function(){
    sampleA();
  },

  'doSampleB': function(){
  },
});

Backbone.history.navigate('sampleRoute/A', {trigger: true});
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/s7em3a5z/2/" rel="nofollow">Here is the corresponding jsFiddle</a>.  Open your devtools (F12 on Chrome), and watch the log as you type in an id and click the button.  The url of the iframe will change to match the route, along with the id you provide.  This is how Backbone routing should work.</p>
