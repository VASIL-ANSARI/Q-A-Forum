<p>Looks like you've hit the most common problem people face when switching to pretty URL schemes. Solution is also simple, just use absolute path in your css, js, images files rather than a relative one. Which means you have to make sure path of these files start either with <code>http://</code> or a slash <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>You can try adding this in your page's HTML header: <code>&lt;base href="/" /&gt;</code> so that every relative URL is resolved from that URL and not the current URL.</p>
