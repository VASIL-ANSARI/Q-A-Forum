<p>Unless you <em>need</em> ArrayList specific methods, go for a List.</p>

<p><strike>I have never heard that invocations of interface methods would be slower than invoking methods on a class type.</strike></p>

<p>Using <code>ArrayList</code> instead of <code>List</code> as static type sounds like premature optimization to me. As usual, favor readability and maintainability over optimizations until you've profiled your program as a whole.</p>
