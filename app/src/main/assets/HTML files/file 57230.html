<p>let's start with a little definition : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>415</strong> Unsupported Media Type </p>
  
  <p>The request entity has a media type which
  the server or resource does not support. For example, the client
  uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images
  use a different format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which can be solved by :</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = "", method = RequestMethod.POST, produces = "application/json; charset=UTF-8", consumes = "application/json; charset=UTF-8")
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation :</strong> Basically you need to specify what kind of data your endpoint is going to consume / produce. Don't forget when sending the request to specify the header </p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: application/json
</code></pre>
