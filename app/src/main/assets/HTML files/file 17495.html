<p>If the <em>geokit-rails3</em> gem depends on the <em>rails</em> gem you can do nothing about it. The only option left is to rewrite the <em>geokit-rails3</em> gem or extract the parts needed from it into your project.</p>

<p>I also suggest looking into the <em>geocoder</em> gem, since it seems to be better maintained at the moment (<em>geokit</em> is practically dead) and it comes with an ActiveRecord integration in the main gem itself...</p>
