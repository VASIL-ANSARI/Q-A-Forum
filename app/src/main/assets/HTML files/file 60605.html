<p>Here is the probable reason from the crash log.</p>

<ul>
<li>Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[ setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key emailTxt.' * First throw call stack: ( 0 CoreFoundation 0x000000010c05634b</li>
</ul>

<p>You might have created an outlet called "emailTxt". You might have then deleted it or changed its name.</p>

<p>To solve this, look at the elements you have in your storyboard, my guess is the login button or the email field might have two outlets. Find the one you no longer need and delete it.</p>

<p>In case you want to know how to find the outlets that UI element is connect to, just right click on it.</p>
