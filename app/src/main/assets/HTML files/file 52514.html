<p>An initial recommendation, is to change this:</p>

<pre><code>var modelList = Model.ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>for this:</p>

<pre><code>var modelList = Model.Where(x =&gt; x.SeasonTeamID == t.SeasonTeamID).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, modelList now will only have the players you are interested in, so you won't have to iterate every single one of them, and you will be able to eliminate this 'if':</p>

<pre><code>if (modelList[i].SeasonTeamID == t.SeasonTeamID)
</code></pre>
