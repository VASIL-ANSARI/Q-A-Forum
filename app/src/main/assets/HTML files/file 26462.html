<p>This is caused by mixing content with different protocols, i.e. http and https.</p>

<p>https is secure, while http is not. So if you have a page that is called with <code>https://domain.com</code> and it uses a file <code>http://domain.com/filename</code> the latter is non-secure!</p>

<p>Solution: either use https or http for everything throughout your site. Don't mix them.</p>
