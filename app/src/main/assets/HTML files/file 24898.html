<p>There is nothing complicated about it and it has nothing to do with data types. </p>

<p><code>new Inner()</code> creates a new object. You are assigning a property to that object in the constructor</p>

<pre><code>this.method = function(){...};
</code></pre>

<p>On the other side, there is not such property <code>private</code>. You never do <code>this.private = ...;</code>. <code>private</code> is just a variable local to the <code>Inner</code> function.</p>

<p>Here is another example which is equivalent to your code but hopefully makes it clearer:</p>

<pre><code>function createObject() {
    var someVariable = '42';
    var obj  = {};
    obj.foo = 'bar';
    return obj;
}

var myObject = createObject();
// works, since we assigned the property to the object
console.log(myObject.foo); 
// does not work, we never assigned such a property to the object
console.log(myObject.someVariable); 
</code></pre>

<p>Inside <code>createObject</code> two variables are declared, <code>someVariable</code> and <code>obj</code>. <code>obj</code> is an object, we assign a property to it and return it from the function. <code>someVariable</code> has nothing to do with the object, but could be used for other purposes within the function.</p>
