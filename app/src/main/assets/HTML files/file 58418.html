<p>Your model classes of your gridItems for your adapter should have an attribute 'color' . </p>

<p>In your getView method - when the 'position' is 3,7,11...etc change the gridview layout color and use the setColor attribute of your item to set the color to that particular item.</p>

<p>Along with this at the start of your getView method you can check if item.getColor is set then change the gridview layout color else it should have the default color.</p>

<p>For getting the desired position you can use the formula if position = (4n-1) which will give you your desired color changing positions i.e. 3,7,11....</p>
