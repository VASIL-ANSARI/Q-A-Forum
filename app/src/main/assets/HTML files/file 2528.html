<p>Well, when <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" rel="nofollow">Reddit</a> first moved from Common Lisp to Python they used web.py (<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit" rel="nofollow">src</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#Technology" rel="nofollow">src</a>).  That made a pretty big splash at the time, which might explain some of its popularity.  It should be said, I guess, that Reddit has since abandoned web.py in favor of Pylons.</p>
