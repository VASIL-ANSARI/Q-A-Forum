<p>the given "error" is missleading :) sometimes if you give some "not existing elements" to jquery, where it hopes to have some element, it just does nonsense ... please try to locate the problem somewhere in your written code: do you have any function calls that you registered for (document).ready() ? Is every dom-node a real dom-node and not null/undefined?</p>
