<p>You're essentially looking at a parse problem. <code>operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp;, string&amp;)</code> is a very simplistic parser that just tokenizes on whitespace.</p>

<p>If your format specification is strict enough, and you should reject <code>(51.5N , 0.0E)</code> (extra space before comma) then just don't extract the comma. Instead, directly after extraction you should check that <code>nLat</code> contains the trailing comma and remove it. You no longer need <code>&gt;&gt;comma</code>.</p>

<p>If you must support optional whitespace anywhere, it may help to preprocess the string by inserting an extra space before and after the comma (unconditionally). If there already was a space, there will now be two. That's no problem as whitespace skipping will skip any amount.</p>
