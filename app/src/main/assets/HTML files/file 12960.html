<p>If you look at the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html#ownership.restrictions.autoreleasing" rel="nofollow">clang notes for <code>__autoreleasing</code></a> it mentions that the magic happens at assignment time, which means that automatic casting can't help here. You need to actually make the assignment using a temporary variable as mentioned in the comments on the original post.</p>
