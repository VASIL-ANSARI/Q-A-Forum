<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">CSV Module</a>. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
with ('output.csv', 'ab') as output:
    writer = csv.writer(output, delimiter=";")

    with open('a.txt', 'rb') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=";")
        reader.readline() // this is to skip the header
        for row in spamreader:
            writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>

<p>If you didn't want to harcode in every file (Say you have many more than three) you could do:</p>

<pre><code>from os import listdir
from os.path import isfile, join
onlyfiles = [ f for f in listdir(mypath) if isfile(join(mypath,f)) ]
    for aFile in onlyfiles:
        with open(aFile, 'rb') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=";")
        reader.readline() // this is to skip the header
        for row in spamreader:
            writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>
