<p>The BBC use a custom JavaScript Library -> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/glow/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/glow/</a></p>

<p>An alternative is the Nivo Slider -> <a href="http://nivo.dev7studios.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nivo.dev7studios.com/</a></p>

<p>IMO there is no need to creating something when its already been written, so a plugin is the best way to go </p>
