<p>A <code>Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;</code> represents a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> and in a hashtable there is no notion of order.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508.aspx">documentation</a> explains it pretty well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For purposes of enumeration, each item
  in the dictionary is treated as a
  KeyValuePair structure
  representing a value and its key. The
  order in which the items are returned
  is undefined.</p>
</blockquote>
