<p>Your problem suggests a self-join to get the users with common interests.  Then, <code>not exists</code> to avoid the contact list.  The following gets the list of users with common interests, ordered by the number of common interests:</p>

<pre><code>select ip2.userid, count(*) as numInCommon
from interested_People ipme join
     interested_People ip2
     on ipme.interested_in = ip2.interested_in and
        ipme.userid = $UserId and  -- Your user id goes here
        ip2.userid &lt;&gt; ipme.userid
where not exists (select 1 
                  from contactlist cl
                  where cl.user1 = ipme.userid and cl.user2 = ip2.userid and
                        cl.accepted = 1
                 ) and
      not exists (select 1 
                  from contactlist cl
                  where cl.user1 = ip2.userid and cl.user2 = ipme.userid and
                        cl.accepted = 1
                 )
group by ip2.userid;
</code></pre>
