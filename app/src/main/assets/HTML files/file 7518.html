<p>You need to look to see how the import statements are written in the related code.  If <code>examples/example_one.py</code> uses the following import statement:</p>

<pre><code>import api.api
</code></pre>

<p>...then it expects the root directory of the project to be in the system path.</p>

<p>The easiest way to support this without any hacks (as you put it) would be to run the examples from the top level directory, like this:</p>

<pre><code>PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python examples/example_one.py 
</code></pre>
