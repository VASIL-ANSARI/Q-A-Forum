<p>One of your (possible) problems is that this section is not atomic:</p>

<pre><code>while (monitor.getSize() &gt; 1) {
    System.out.println("Number of array in list to be sorted: "
            + monitor.getSize());

    String[] f = monitor.getRandom();
    String[] g = monitor.getRandom();

    monitor.add(descSort(f, g));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Typically, if you use any threads, it is very likely that between the call to <code>monitor.getSize()</code> and <code>monitor.getRandom()</code> the size has actually changed. So I guess that one of the <code>getRandom</code> calls (or both) returns null which triggers the <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>

<p>You could add a check for <code>null</code> before calling <code>descSort()</code>. If only one of <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> is <code>null</code>, you probably need to put it back into the monitor (just guessing here).</p>
