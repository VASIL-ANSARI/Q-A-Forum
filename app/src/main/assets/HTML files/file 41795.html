<p>Two hints:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <code>ENGINE=InnoDB</code> when creating your table. InnoDB uses row-level locking, which is MUCH better for bigger tables, as this allows rows to be read much faster, even when you're updating some of them.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ADD INDEX</code> on suitable columns. Indexing big tables can reduce search times by several orders of magnitude. They're easy to forget and a pain to debug! More than once I've been investigating a slow query, realised I forgot a suitable <code>INDEX</code>, added it, and had immediate results on a query that used to take 15 seconds to run.</p></li>
</ol>
