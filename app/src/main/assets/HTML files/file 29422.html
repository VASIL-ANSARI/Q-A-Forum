<p>I know this is a late reply but I've had a very hard time with this issue in recent days. The only thing that helped me was to uninstall the pre-compiled browser capabilities file from the GAC using the <code>aspnet_regbrowsers.exe -u</code> command located in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319. It was only after I did this that the .browser definition files in my site's app_browsers folder are properly recognized. I had installed the hotfix Microsoft provided for this problem and it did not help. And I want to make it clear that copying the new browser files to C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\Browsers in order to do a machine-wide update and running the <code>aspnet_regbrowsers</code> command resulted in an error ("The browser or gateway element with ID 'IE' cannot be found"). So, uninstalling what is already there in the GAC apparently forced my site to use its own browser definition files and everything worked properly after that. I don't really know if there are any negative implications of this approach but so far so good.</p>
