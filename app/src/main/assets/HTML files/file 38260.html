<p>1) There's no way to do this kind of conditional FK you're thinking of. What you need here is basically a FK from tbl_Business_Post which points logically to one of two tables, depending on the value in another column of tbl_Business_Post. This situation is what people encounter quite often. But in a relational DB this is not a very native idea.
So OK, this cannot be enforced with a FK. Instead, you can probably enforce this with a trigger or check constraint on tbl_Business_Post.</p>

<p>2) Alternatively, you can do the below.</p>

<p>Create some table tbl_Basic_Post, put there all columns which pertain to the post itself (e.g. PostTitle) and not to the parent entity which this post record belongs/points to (Business or Classified). Then create two other tables which point via a FK to the tbl_Basic_Post table like e.g.</p>

<p>tbl_Business_Post.Basic_Post_ID (FK)<br>
tbl_Classified_Post.Basic_Post_ID (FK)</p>

<p>Put in these two tables the columns which are Business_Post/Classified_Post-specific<br>
(you see, this is basically inheritable in relational DB terms).</p>

<p>Also, make each of these two tables have FKs to their respective parent tables<br>
tbl_Business and tbl_Classified too. Now these FKs become unconditional (in your sense).</p>

<p>To get business posts you join tbl_Basic_Post and tbl_Business_Post.<br>
To get classified posts you join tbl_Basic_Post and tbl_Classified_Post.</p>

<p>Both approaches have their pros and cons.
Approach 1) is simple, does not lead to the creation of too many tables; but it's not trivial to enforce the data integrity.
Approach 2) does not require anything special to enforce data integrity but leads to the creation of more tables.</p>
