<p><code>ChunkedOutputStream</code> is intended only for writing HTTP responses using the "chunked" transfer encoding. It does not return the same output as <code>BufferedOutputStream</code>, which writes the output as is. Therefore, the memory benefits of each are irrelevant unless you're choosing which class to use to write HTTP responses.</p>
