<p>The best (and easiest) way to code this is to use a JS framework like jQuery. It'll help tremendously in normalizing the browser differences.</p>

<p>But if that's not an option, let's try to fix the existing code. <code>&lt;a href="#payments"&gt;Payment Information&lt;/a&gt;</code> will jump to an element with the <code>id="payments"</code>, not <code>name</code>. Once you fix that, add an <code>onClick="show('tab2')"</code> to that <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In the show function, what is the point of this code <code>if(ie5 || ns6)</code>? This is basically saying, if it's IE5 or Netscape6, then show the element (assuming the variable <code>ie5</code> and <code>ns6</code> are set properly somewhere of course). Try removing this, I don't think you need it.</p>
