<p>When uploading your app to iTunes Connect, you have been asked what your app is compatible with (or at least I have been). It seems like you selected 'iPhone &amp; iPod touch (2nd gen)'. I suggest you dive into iTunes Connect and check if you can change the compatibility settings (maybe look into the iTunes Connect manual).</p>

<p>/edit: seems like they changed it. You now have to change your app's Info.plist and therefore upload a new binary.</p>
