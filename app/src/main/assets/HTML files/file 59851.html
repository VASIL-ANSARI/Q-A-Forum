<p>Your config looks valid, so that shouldn't be the issue.</p>

<p>Some things to check:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is you nlog.config in the correct directory? The best way to test is to copy the nlog.config to the directory with your .dll or .exe.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable exceptions to be sure that errors are not captured by Nlog: <code>throwExceptions="true"</code></p></li>
<li><p>Check the internal log by setting <code>internalLogLevel="Info"</code> and check "c:\temp\nlog-internal.log"</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A full tutorial to troubleshoot could be found on the <a href="https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Logging-troubleshooting" rel="nofollow">NLog documentation</a>.</p>
