<p>To pass data back from child to parent view controller you need to use <em>Protocols and Delegates</em></p>

<p>See <strong>Passing Data Back</strong> section of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5210535/passing-data-between-view-controllers">this</a> SO accepted answer for detailed explanation about passing information back and forth between <em>view controllers</em> </p>

<p>You can have a <code>boolean</code> in the child <em>view controller</em>.</p>

<p>You can set that boolean to true when the user "flags" it.</p>

<p>As shown above you can send back the value to the parent <em>view controller</em> whether it has been flagged or not.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
