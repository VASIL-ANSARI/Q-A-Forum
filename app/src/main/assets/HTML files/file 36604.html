<p>AFAIK there is no easy way to upgrade from old versions of Cordova. You can try follow this guide: <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.5.0/guide_platforms_ios_upgrade.md.html#Upgrading%20iOS" rel="nofollow">http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.5.0/guide_platforms_ios_upgrade.md.html#Upgrading%20iOS</a> but you will have to upgrade step by step (i.e. from 1.5.0 to 1.6.0 to 1.7.0 ...). But even when you do that, if you use some old plugins or API calls in your code you will have to rewrite them according to the new version's API.</p>

<p>I had a project using Cordova version 2.1 and I needed to upgrade it to 3.1 and in the end I was better off creating new project in 3.1 and then update plugins or completely rewrite them.</p>

<p>So to sum up, it all depends on complexity of your projects (how many platforms you support, if you communicate with native code, use plugins..). You can try following the update guide or just create a new project in 3.5. If your project is trivial, I suggest creating new 3.5 application and then copy old html, css, js... files to appropriate places in the new project according to 3.5's documentation.</p>
