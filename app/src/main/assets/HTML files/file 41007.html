<p>I'm gonna guess that you actually need the window size in order to know what your image boundaries are. In this case, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>from kivy.core.window import Window
size = Window.size
</code></pre>

<p>And you can of course use the source image of your canvas with PIL or scipy etc. to get its resolution (which the canvas will match).</p>
