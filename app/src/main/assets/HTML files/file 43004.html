<p>You can create a lookup from park id to facilities, and use this to populate the <code>Facilities</code> property on each of your <code>Park</code> objects. Note that the best place to do this is in the constructor of <code>Park</code>, but in keeping with your existing code this snippet will do it in the object initializer:</p>

<pre><code>var lookup = associations.ToLookup(pf =&gt; pf.ParkID, pf =&gt; facilities.Single(f =&gt; f.ID == pf.FacilityID));
Park[] parks = new Park[]{
    new Park() {ID = 1, Name = "Free Park", Facilities = lookup[1].ToArray()},
    new Park() {ID = 2, Name = "Cost Park", Facilities = lookup[2].ToArray()},
    new Park() {ID = 3, Name="Sneak in Park", Facilities = lookup[3].ToArray()}
};
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, it would be helpful to store all your <code>Facility</code> and <code>Park</code> instances in a <code>Dictionary</code> mapping the ID to the instance. In that case your lookup wouldn't need to do a linear scan through the all the facilities for each association.</p>
