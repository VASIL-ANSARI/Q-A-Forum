<p>If <code>ISomeObject</code> is an interface this should work fine. If you want to get auto-substitute classes, the class needs to have a default constructor, and have all it's public members declared as virtual. </p>

<p>The following tests pass for me:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IFactory { T Resolve&lt;T&gt;(); }
public interface ISomeObject { void CallSomeMethod(); }

public class Tests
{
    [Test]
    public void Example()
    {
        var factory = Substitute.For&lt;IFactory&gt;();
        MyMethod(factory);
    }
    public void MyMethod(IFactory container)
    {
        var myObject = container.Resolve&lt;ISomeObject&gt;();
        myObject.CallSomeMethod();
    }
}
</code></pre>
