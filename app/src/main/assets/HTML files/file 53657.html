<p>This is just too much memory consumption for an android app.. I don't think you really want to load all of those at the same time. I would rethink the requirements first.</p>

<p>There should be a solution that still satisfies the user and does not load that many views into memory. I don't know what is the use-case here, but I would suggest implementing something like paging. Load a limited amount of items, and only if user wants to see more, then show progress bar and load more. </p>

<p>E.g. you can load more if user scrolls to the last item, or just create a button like "Show more". I'm not sure which solution will be okay for your app. Also, I would actually load new items into the same <code>GridView</code> replacing previously loaded bitmaps, because each of them requires a lot of memory. You can always control the scrolling position programmatically if needed.</p>
