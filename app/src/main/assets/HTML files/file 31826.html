<p>There are many ways to serialize an object model, but the one I use is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.serialization.datacontractserializer%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">DataContractSerializer</a>.</p>

<p>It works as you described, you write some classes, add attributes for serialization to them and then simply serialize them with <code>DataContractSerializer</code>.</p>

<p>Images are not serialized by it, you have to take care of that yourself.</p>
