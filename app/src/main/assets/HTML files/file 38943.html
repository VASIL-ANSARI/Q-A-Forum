<p>There's only one object - if you create an instance of <code>LoggingWidget</code>, there's only <em>one</em> object created, with all the fields from <code>LoggingWidget</code> and <em>also</em> all the fields from <code>Widget</code>. It's not like it creates an instance of <code>LoggingWidget</code> that refers to an instance of <code>Widget</code>.</p>

<p>There's only one object, and therefore only one lock, wherever you synchronize on it.</p>
