<p>What you can do is ajax call to a php with the id of the row you want to save and the new data. Then use PDO to connect to the database and update the information. After that is done, use javascript to edit the table itself.</p>

<p>So what you need to do is look up how to use ajax calls and use PDO. I suggest when you echo the table itself
<code>&lt;button href = '#' onclick="updateRow('. $row['Row Number']  .')"&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</code> where Row Number is the ID in the database and updateRow() is the javascript function you will create to get the new information and send it via ajax. Don't use mysql_*, because it is not supported in php 7 and it will die soon. Look up PDO instead. </p>
