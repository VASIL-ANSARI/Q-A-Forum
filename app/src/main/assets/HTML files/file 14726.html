<p>I agree with the following statement in your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are planning to create a wrapper for the business layer in .Net to Decouple the COM dlls from the above 2 so that we have one place(wrapper) to make any enhancements or totally replace COM to something else.</p>

<p>This allows you to "pick and choose" your problem areas, rewrite areas, or leave alone areas.  I can almost guarantee that at least one of your COM components executes some black magic... written by some ex-consultant or ex-employee five years ago... LOL</p>

<p>Unfortunately as far as I know you will have to manually code/design your layer (or layers) of indirection.  However, some of the VS.NET (and Resharper and CodeRush) refactor/auto-generate methods will help you out a little.  But at the end of the day <strong>you</strong> know your product (and design) better than anyone (or any tool).</p>
