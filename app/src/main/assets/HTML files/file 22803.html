<p>My last idea: if the <code>setArray:</code> and <code>setObjects:</code> methods are actually setters for properties declared as <code>@property (copy)</code>, then they'll copy the arrays passed in - and <code>copy</code> always returns an immutable object. In this case, the easy way to fix this would be declaring them as <code>(retain)</code> instead of <code>(copy)</code>.</p>
