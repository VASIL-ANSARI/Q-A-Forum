<p>If you get "connection refused", you are using TCP. In the page you link to it clearly says it uses UDP (UDP has no concept of a connection). Also read carefully how to configure the response ports (there is probably both a local and remote port to configure, the remote port of the sensor must match the listening port on your Pi).</p>
