<p>The <code>File.Copy</code> method accepts full file paths for the source and destination, so if you're using <code>FileInfo</code>, you'll want to use the <code>Name</code> and <code>FullName</code> properties.</p>

<pre><code>File.Copy(file.FullName, Path.Combine(targetPath, file.Name), true);
</code></pre>

<p>Also, as a general rule, you don't want to just call <code>ToString()</code> on an object and hope it returns something meaningful. A class <em>may</em> override <code>ToString()</code> and return some value, or it may not and the value you get back is simply the class type. Check the documentation first.</p>
