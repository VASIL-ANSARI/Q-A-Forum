<p>Sometimes explaining the problem reveals the answer.  In actual fact, the name of the handler, "Init" was being passed as a parameter to the <code>describe</code> block, more like this:</p>

<pre><code>%w{Init}.each do |cmd|
    describe CLI do
        it "should launch the #{cmd} handler if we pass #{cmd}" do
            CLI.const_get(cmd).any_instance.should_receive(:run!)
           CLI::run!(*[cmd])
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In describing the problem I took out the loop to simplify the question, but in doing so made a crucial change -- the name of the class, Init, began with a capital "I", while the name of the command passed to the command line, init, begins with a small "i".</p>

<p>So it turned out the test failed correctly, because I tried to pass the command "Init" when I should have been passing the command "init".</p>

<p>TL;DR -- the original code <em>does</em> actually work!  Sorry for the bother.</p>
