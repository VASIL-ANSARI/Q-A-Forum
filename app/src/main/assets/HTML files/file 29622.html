<p>Presumably only the <code>User</code> model can have a personality type. Why not create an array of these types as a constant in the <code>User</code> model, which you can then refer to in forms etc for selection using <code>User::PERSONALITY_TYPES</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>class User

  PERSONALITY_TYPES = %w{ ENTJ INTJ ISFP ESFP }

  # ... other model code
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then simply store the index of the personality type within the array as the user's personality_type_index.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm oversimplifying your needs, but this is the approach I would start with.</p>
