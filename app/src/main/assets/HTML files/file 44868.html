<p>You can pass data to a new form, and then draw the graph from there. One way would be in the constructor, when you create the new form to draw the graph on, for example:</p>

<p>Form to calculate graph points (or whatever data you need to draw the graph)</p>

<pre><code>public class CalculationForm
{
    public CalculationForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        Point[] points = CalculatePoints();

        GraphForm graphForm = new GraphForm(points);
        graphForm.Show();
    }

    private Point[] CalculatePoints()
    {
        // method to generate points
        return points;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the form you want to draw the graph in:</p>

<pre><code>public class GraphForm
{
    public GraphForm(Point[] points)
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        DrawGraph(points);
    }

    private void DrawGraph(Point[] points)
    {
        // Code to draw your graph goes here
    }
}
</code></pre>
