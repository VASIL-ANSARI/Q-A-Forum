<p>This isn't really a typical messaging pattern.  Typically, you have one receiver and a durable queue or multiple receivers with durable subscriptions to a topic.  in either situation, each receiver will <em>always</em> receive the message.  i don't really understand a use case where "at least one" receiver should receive it.</p>

<p>and yes, transactions only deal with the interactions between client and broker, not between client and eventual receiver(s).</p>
