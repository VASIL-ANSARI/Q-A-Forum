<p>Find the real path based on the relative path of "up three directories," and extract the last part of that real path.</p>

<p>[Edit: In response to your comment I have revised this. In my opinion it is getting complex
enough that your chain of <code>dirname</code>'s is better. At least it is easy to understand what it happening.]</p>

<pre><code>from os import path as p
_, ci_root = p.split(p.abspath(p.join(__file__, '../../..')))
</code></pre>
