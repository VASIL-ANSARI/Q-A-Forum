<p>You should not put all files in your main directory which will look messy and confusing.</p>

<p>Better you put required files in their respective folders and call them properly.</p>

<p>In index.php-> its okay how you have included files.</p>

<p>But in init.php -> you don't need to write folder name "core" as init.php is already inside core folder.
So simply use</p>

<pre><code>require('connect.php');
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly in header.php</p>

<pre><code> require('logo.php');
</code></pre>

<p>And in footer.php</p>

<pre><code>require('counter.php');
</code></pre>

<p>If you have any problem, plz let me know.</p>
