<p>Here's a script I found to replace the radio buttons (and checkboxes and select dropdowns) with styling of your choice.</p>

<p>I recommend you read the short article before you jump into using it.</p>

<p>Also, the script for changing a larger image would be something <strong>like</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>$('.radio').change(function(){
    $('#lgImg').src(newUrl);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>newUrl</code> would be based on some value of the radio button that was changed like: <code>$(this).attr('data-img-url')</code></p>

<p>Finally, just as a side note, you wouldn't be able to do anything like this (client-side) in PHP unless you submitted the radio button on change (again, with Javascript) and reloaded the page with the correct larger image.  But that would be very dirty and fairly unnecessary.</p>
