<p>Two points that may help you:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no need to use multicasting if your communication is only local (you use 127.0.0.1 in your code)</li>
<li>Multicast groups are joined by network interfaces, not by processes. Once a network interface has joined a multicast interface, a second joining of the same network interface to the same multicast group will change nothing. Even when it's another process on the same host that requests the second 
joining.</li>
</ul>
