<p>Your center point is going to be:</p>

<pre><code>centerX = (x2 - x1) / 2 + x1
centerY = (y2 - y1) / 2 + y1
</code></pre>

<p>because you take half the length <code>(x2 - x1) / 2</code> and add it to where your line starts to get to the middle.</p>

<p>As an exercise, take two lines:</p>

<pre><code>line1 = (0, 0) -&gt; (5, 5)
then: |x1 - x2| = 5, when the center x value is at 2.5.

line2 = (2, 2) -&gt; (7, 7)
then: |x1 - x2| = 5, which can't be right because that's the center for
the line that's parallel to it but shifted downwards and to the left
</code></pre>
