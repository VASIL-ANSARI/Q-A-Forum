<p>In short, no. </p>

<p>C++ is not Python (or PHP or some other "higher level language"). In Python, a variable can change from containing a boolean to containing a string to containing a float. In C and C++, a variable is declared to contain a specific type. There are ways that you can store different types in the same structure, e.g. "Boost::variant", which does something similar to what Python does internally - it has a "what type is this variable" inside the data structure. </p>
