<p>If methods from abstract "base" class must be accessible through types inherithing from abstract class, they should be marked (at least) as <code>protected</code>, not <code>private</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class MyClassBase {
   private void DoThis(){}
   protected void DoThat(){}
}

public class MyImplemntation : MyClassBase {

  //I don't know DoThis();
  //I know DoThat();
}
</code></pre>
