<p>This is a problem with io.js and node-gyp. See this line in your logs:</p>

<pre><code>Error: 404 response dowloading http://nodejs.org/dist/v2.3.4/node-v2.3.4.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>node-gyp tries to download v2.3.4 distribution from node.js site, but it's obviously not there since it's io.js. To fix this io.js is shipped patched npm. Unfortunately, if you update npm via <code>npm install -g npm</code> it will be broken again.</p>

<p>You can try <code>npm uninstall -g npm</code> but it seems to just wipe npm entirely, so you have to reinstall io.js. </p>
