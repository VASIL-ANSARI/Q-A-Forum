<p>The issue is your <code>$_GET[]</code> request, since a <code>!</code> character will be encoded to <code>%21</code>.
Since you're working on the system, do it the correct way instead.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use POST requests, as you don't want the users to copy paste a link with a password in them.</li>
<li>Use the new functions in PHP,  <code>password_hash()</code> with <code>password_verify()</code> as they have a salt build into them making it quite secure and very easy to work with.</li>
<li>Bind values to a SQL string do not blindly put them in there as you are currently open to an easy SQL injection. Adding a password like <code>pass; DROP TABLE members;</code> will break it.</li>
</ol>
