<p>Drop the parentheses around the two columns.  I think you intend for a second <code>concat()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW LocUserComp AS
    SELECT concat(l.Loc_Address, l.Loc_City, l.Loc_State) AS Customer_Address, 
           concat(u.User_FName, u.User_LName) AS Customer_Name
    FROM location l JOIN
         users u
         ON l.Loc_ID = u.Loc_ID;
</code></pre>
