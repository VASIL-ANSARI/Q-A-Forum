<ol>
<li><code>s = false</code> is an assignment, not a comparison. Anyway, you don't need to test if <code>s == false</code>, you just need an <code>else</code> clause (since the original condition checks for <code>s == true</code>).</li>
<li>There's no reason to assign the result of <code>time++</code> to <code>time</code>, since it will undo the increment (the post increment operator returns the previous value of the variable, so when you assign that value back to the variable, you cancel the increment).</li>
</ol>

<p>Change</p>

<pre><code>else if (s = false) {
    time = time++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>else {
    time++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit :</p>

<p>As Anthony Grist commented, even after these fixes, the entire while loop won't be executed at all, since <code>y==h</code> in the beginning.</p>
