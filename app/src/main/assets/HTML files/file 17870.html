<p>My educated guess is that you still have a file that includes the "f.h" file</p>

<p>Do a ctrl+shift+f and search for #include "f.h" and see if that exists anywhere in your solution.</p>

<p>Even when a header file is not included in the solution project it will still get compiled into the source if it is referenced somewhere.</p>
