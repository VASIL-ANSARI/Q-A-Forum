<p>Use a data structure (such as an array or vector) to store the moves that have already been made. If a user tries to enter a move that has already been made, re-prompt them:</p>

<pre><code>void getMove()
{
//Get move input from user through something like std::cin
    if (hasBeenPlayed()) //If the move (ex: 1) is already in the array or vector
    {
    getMove();
    }
    else
    {
    playedMoves.push_back(move); // Add the move to the vector (or an array)
    //Compute the move that was entered here
    }
}
</code></pre>
