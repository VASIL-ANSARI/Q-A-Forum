<p>The first way defines an object constructor but does not instantiate a new object, you can pass in arguments this way. If you're creating multiple objects/models this would definitely be less clunky than the second way.</p>

<p>The second way is using object initializer syntax, this instantiates a new object in memory with whatever fields you set it to. In general this produces for smaller code size; if you're creating two objects of the same or similar structures, use the first way.</p>

<p>There is no reason why you can't use the first in place of the second. Simply creating a new object and pass it in wherever it is needed.</p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>function AppViewModel(fName, lName) {
    var self = this;
    self.firstName = ko.observable(fName);
    self.lastName = ko.observable(lName);
}
...
var appViewModel = new AppViewModel("Bert", "Bertington");
</code></pre>

<p>creates the same object as this:</p>

<pre><code>var appViewModel = {
    this.firstName = ko.observable("Bert"),
    this.lastName = ko.observable("Bertington")
};
</code></pre>

<p>The first one just allows for more <code>AppViewModel</code>s to be created, e.g. <code>new AppViewModel("Joe", "Shmoe")</code></p>
