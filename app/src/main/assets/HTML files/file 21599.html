<p>I assume you want to mirror according to a 45 degree line, not the rectangle diagonal.</p>

<p>You have to create a new image, it's width is height of original, and it's height is width of original.</p>

<p>If origin of your coordinate system is bottom left, copy the point (x, y) in the original in the (y, x) position in the new image. If it's another corner, you have to think a bit more ;)</p>
