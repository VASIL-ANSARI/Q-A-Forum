<p>According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12651507/styling-a-select-input-for-ios-first-option-or-initial-state-should-have-smal">this StackOverflow answer</a>, there is no way to change the styling of <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements on iOS, as their display styles are built into the browser and not modifiable via CSS.</p>

<p><strike><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/7313425/2234742">This answer</a> suggests that you can use a customizable replacement such as <a href="http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/" rel="nofollow">Chosen</a> if you would like more control over the style of your <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> boxes.</strike></p>

<p>Apparently Chosen doesn't support iOS. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22016765/2234742">A comment on another answer</a> recommends <a href="http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/" rel="nofollow">Selectize.js</a> as an iOS-compatible replacement.</p>
