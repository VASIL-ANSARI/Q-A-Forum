<p>Yes, you need to apply some algorith, that can solve the problem for you.</p>

<p>You can use this great libray:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://quickgraph.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">QuickGraph</a></li>
</ul>

<p>to solve this part of the problem.</p>

<p>As to the way of storing your data, you need to define vertices (the photos) and edges between vertices like (photo A-photoB), (photo A-photo C), and so on.</p>

<p>You have to recover that info from the database and load the corresponding structure in quickgraph and let it find the path for you.</p>

<p>Here you have extensive docs and samples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://quickgraph.codeplex.com/documentation" rel="nofollow">Quick graph documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For something similar to this I used:</p>

<ul>
<li>MyEdges class, which implements <code>IEdge&lt;T&gt;</code> (T should be you photo ID type, int or whatever is) - represents the edge between to photos (places)</li>
<li>Graph class, which inherits <code>AdjacencyGraph&lt;T,MyRelation&gt;</code>. You load it with the available MyEdges (this is directed graph)</li>
<li>PathFinder algorithm class: I inherited from <code>FloydWarshallAllShortestPathAlgorithm&lt;T, MyRelation&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Then you have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create the edges (i.e. read them from the DB)</li>
<li>Instance a Graph class, and add all edges to it</li>
<li>Use the PathFinder constructor, using the graph as parameter. This finds the paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>This algorithm lets you specify to which photos you can go from a given photo (edges), supposes that the distance is similar between them, but you have to define all the routes (from A to B, from B to A and so on). That's the "un-weighted" part of the OP. If your case differs you'll have to read the docs.</p>

<p>You can implement an <code>UnDirected</code> graph if you prefer that adding A To B also adds B to A. It can spare some lines of code, but I usually prefer adding all the possibilities myself. Its easier to think "from the Library I can go to aisle A and aisle B. From aisle B to Library and Laboratory", and so on, that trying to think of all edges.</p>

<p>You can create two tables in a database:</p>

<ul>
<li>Photos (with IDs)</li>
<li>Path (IdFrom and IdTo)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is easy to maintain and implement.</p>
