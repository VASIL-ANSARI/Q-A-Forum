<p>Assigned operators like <code>+=</code> do an implicit cast. </p>

<p>Note: in this case <code>Math.random()</code> will be rounded down to 0 every time which is a significant loss of precision. ;)</p>

<p>However <code>Math.random() + 1</code> has a very small chance of being rounded to 2. e.g. 1.999999 will be rounded to 1 but 1.9999999999999999 will be rounded to 2 (but the <code>double +</code> operator rather than the cast to <code>int</code>).</p>

<pre><code>long l = Double.doubleToLongBits(1.0);
double d0_999etc = Double.longBitsToDouble(l -1);
System.out.println("The value before 1 is " +d0_999etc+" cast to (int) is "+ (int) d0_999etc);
System.out.println("The value before 1, plus 1 is " +(1+d0_999etc)+" cast to (int) is "+(int)(1 +d0_999etc));
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>The value before 1 is 0.9999999999999999 cast to (int) is 0
The value before 1, plus 1 is 2.0 cast to (int) is 2
</code></pre>
