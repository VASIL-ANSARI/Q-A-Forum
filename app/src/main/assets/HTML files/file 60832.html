<p>Perhaps this will help others. In my case some initialization <strong>before the first view is rendered</strong> caused this error. Both single of the following points seems to bring on the problem unreproducible from time to time:</p>

<ul>
<li>unzipping some kB and copy some files to the app data directory</li>
<li>parsing JSON into a backbone Collection via ajax</li>
</ul>
