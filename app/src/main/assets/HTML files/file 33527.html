<p>Try these conversions:</p>

<pre><code>select CAST(LAST_DAY(to_timestamp('082014', 'MMYYYY')) AS TIMESTAMP) from dual;
</code></pre>

<p>If 82014 would be a number to begin with, try the following version:</p>

<pre><code>select CAST(LAST_DAY(to_timestamp(lpad(cast(82014 as varchar2(6)), 6, '0'), 'MMYYYY')) AS TIMESTAMP) from dual
</code></pre>
