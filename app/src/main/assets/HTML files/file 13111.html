<p>You need to write some client-side Javascript code for this. Using eg JQuery you can easily get the values of the package and pins fields (after the user fills in the pins field), concatenate them, and update the value of the hidden field.</p>

<p>Something roughly like this (you need to add the the right classes to the divs that wrap the fields for this to work):</p>

<pre><code>$('selector for the pins field').blur(function() {
  combined = $('selector for the package_type field').val() + $('selector for the pins field').val()
  $('selector for the hidden field').val(combined)
})
</code></pre>
