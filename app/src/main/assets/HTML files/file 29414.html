<p>I also had the problem.  </p>

<p>It seems to be a bug.  I added this line "this.mouseDownElement = figure;" to SingleSelectionPolicy.js as below to fix the problem.</p>

<pre><code>    if (figure !== canvas.getSelection().getPrimary() &amp;&amp; figure !== null &amp;&amp; figure.isSelectable() === true) {
        this.select(canvas,figure);

        // its a line
        if (figure instanceof draw2d.shape.basic.Line) {
            if (!(figure instanceof draw2d.Connection)) {
                canvas.draggingLineCommand = figure.createCommand(new draw2d.command.CommandType(draw2d.command.CommandType.MOVE));
                if (canvas.draggingLineCommand !== null) {
                    canvas.draggingLine = figure;
                }
            }

            //added to fix Draw2D draggable = false bug
            this.mouseDownElement = figure;
        }
        else if (canDragStart === false) {
            figure.unselect();
        }
    }
</code></pre>
