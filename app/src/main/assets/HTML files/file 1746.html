<p>It would help if you could post your code.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is what you are expecting, but "getContent()" doesn't necessarily return a String with the message in it.</p>

<p>Look at the JavaDocs <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/javadocs/javax/mail/Part.html#getContent%28%29" rel="nofollow">here</a> - it returns an Object. </p>

<p>This might be a String, or a Multipart, or it might be an InputStream. It all depends upon the email message.</p>

<p>I'd suggest trying to print out the type of the Object that getContent() is returning.</p>

<p>Also, please have a read through the docs.</p>
