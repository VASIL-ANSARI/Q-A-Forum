<p>They have a page for integrating with cancan: <a href="https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/wiki/How-to%3A-Integrate-with-CanCan" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/wiki/How-to%3A-Integrate-with-CanCan</a></p>

<p>But ummm, it hasn't yet been written...</p>

<p>So... They also have a page for integrating with Devise: <a href="https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/wiki/How-to%3A-Integrate-with-Devise" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/wiki/How-to%3A-Integrate-with-Devise</a> which has been written, and so extrapolating from that the accepted way would be to inherit the <code>Bigbluebutton::ServersController</code>.</p>

<p>How about creating a custom servers controller as follows:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomServersController &lt; Bigbluebutton::ServersController
  load_and_authorize_resource!
end
</code></pre>
