<p>You are using an index and a slice assignment, which are quite different.</p>

<p>Compare this with indexing and slicing the list in an expression:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c=[1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c[1]
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; d=[1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[1:]
[2, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>By using a <code>:</code> colon in the list index, you are asking for a slice, which is always another list.</p>

<p>In Python you can assign values to both an individual item in a list, and to a slice of the list.</p>
