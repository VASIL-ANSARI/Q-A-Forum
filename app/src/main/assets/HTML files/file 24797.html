<p>In order to get a stripped-down version of your code to display a .gif test image, I had to add a<code>global img</code>statement to the<code>picture()</code>function so the<code>PhotoImage</code>object that variable name refers to would not be destroyed when the function returns.</p>

<p>It seems strange that<code>Canvas.create_image()</code>doesn't increment the reference count of the<code>image</code>object it's passed...looks like it's a <a href="http://effbot.org/pyfaq/why-do-my-tkinter-images-not-appear.htm" rel="nofollow">documented bug</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> For reasons I don't completely understand, adding a<code>can.img = img</code>right after the<code>can = Canvas(root)</code>in  the<code>picture()</code>function accomplishes the same thing in a better way than creating a global named<code>img</code>in my opinion.</p>

<p>Display from working version:</p>
