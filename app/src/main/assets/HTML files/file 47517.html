<p>I'm not really a C# expert, but this block of code:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime epochStart = new DateTime(1970,01,01,0,0,0,0, DateTimeKind.Utc); //Getting UTC DATE since epoch
TimeSpan ts = DateTime.UtcNow - epochStart; //get the current timestamp between now and january 1970
string stamp = Convert.ToUInt64(ts.TotalSeconds).ToString(); //get the total seconds that have elasped
</code></pre>

<p>Appears to just get the number of seconds since the epoch and convert it to a string.  So here is the equivalent Java code:</p>

<pre><code>String stamp = String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000);
</code></pre>
