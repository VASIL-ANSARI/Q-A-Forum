<p>I've tried to remove the first block that goes from <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;div id="Cont_All1"&gt;</code> on line 5 to <code>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code> on line 25 and the problem didn't happen.</p>

<p>So there's no problem in jQuery code, but probably you forgot to close some tag or make some <code>id</code> mistake in your HTML code. So... I've tried to remove the first block, copy the second block and rename it with <code>Cont_All1</code> and <code>HiddenCont1</code> instead of <code>Cont_All2</code> and <code>HiddenCont2</code> and the job is done, easily as you can see <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/fECnT/1/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
