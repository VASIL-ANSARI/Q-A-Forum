<p>What version of the .NET framework does your hoster support??</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;</code> is the WCF section and WCF only came about in .NET 3.0 - if this hoster is only supporting strictly .NET 2.0, then you're out of luck :-(</p>

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>either you can get your hosting provider to install .NET 3.0 (or preferably .NET 3.5 SP1) so you can use WCF </li>
<li>you remove that <code>&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;</code> section from your config file if you don't even need and use WCF</li>
</ul>
