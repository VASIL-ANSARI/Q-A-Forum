<p>Sorry I wrote too fast, but I might as well ask: are you sure Java's regex API is able to identify a group (\1 and \2)?</p>

<p>Because it seems that parts of the string are replaced by actual 1s and 2s so this might not be the correct syntax.</p>

<p>(And it seems that you are only checking for numbers followed by text, not the other way arround.)</p>
