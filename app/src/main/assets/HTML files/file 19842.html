<p>It all looks like it's working to me, you just seem to have confused the concepts of Service URL and Endpoint URL:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is only one service URL per <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> element per protocol. This is used to get the test page, to add a service reference, and to get the WSDL document (via the <code>?wsdl</code> query parameter).</li>
<li>There is also one endpoint URL per <code>&lt;endpoint&gt;</code> element. These are the ones ending in <code>/basic</code> or <code>/secure</code>. The <em>only</em> thing that these URLs will do is accept SOAP requests. You can't get metadata from them or browse to them. There is one exception to this, you can expose a <code>/mex</code> endpoint using a <code>mexHttpBinding</code> or <code>mexHttpsBinding</code> which returns metadata via a SOAP request. This is entirely optional, and in your case is unnecessary, since you are exposing the WSDL via HTTP(S) GET instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the client side, in Visual Studio, you Add Service Reference using <code>http://localhost/[Namespace]/[Service].svc</code>. If defining client endpoints manually, you set their addresses to <code>http://localhost/[Namespace]/[Service].svc/basic</code> and <code>http://localhost/[Namespace]/[Service].svc/secure</code> respectively.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>To prevent the <code>http://localhost/[Namespace]/[Service].svc</code> URL from responding to requests, disable metadata publishing in the service config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;behaviors&gt;
    &lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;
        &lt;behavior name="[Namespace].[ServiceNameBehavior]"&gt;
            &lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="false" httpsGetEnabled="false"/&gt;
            &lt;serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="true"/&gt;
        &lt;/behavior&gt;
    &lt;/serviceBehaviors&gt;
&lt;/behaviors&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously if you do this then you can no longer add a new service reference in any client code, but that is perfectly acceptable in a production environment where you control both client and server code.</p>
