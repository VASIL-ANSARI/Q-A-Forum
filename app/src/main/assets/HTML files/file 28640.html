<p>On Windows default installations of JRE come with HotSpot Client compiler. This compiler does only basic optimizations, contrary to server HotSpot which does more aggressive optimizations and produces much faster code. Server HotSpot is default on most Unix-like and Linux distributions, including Mac OS X. The performance difference between those two compilers can be often 2-3x. The client HotSpot is optimized mostly for faster startup of desktop applications, not for top performance of long running processes.</p>

<p>To check which compiler you are using issue the following command:</p>

<pre><code>java -version
</code></pre>

<p>On my machine it gives:</p>

<pre><code>java version "1.6.0_45"
Java (TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_45-b06)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.45-b01, mixed mode)
                        ^^^^^^  this
</code></pre>

<p>To get Server HotSpot on Windows, you need to download and install JDK and then run your program with <code>-server</code> command line switch.</p>
