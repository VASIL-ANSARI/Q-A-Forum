<p>I think putting the allocation in the <code>viewDidLoad()</code> is correct. In fact, there is a discussion regarding to why <code>init()</code> is not being called in ViewController, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/772182/iphone-uiviewcontroller-init-method-not-being-called">iPhone UIViewController init method not being called</a>. But, it depends on your context, if you want to initialize your structure "before" the view appear, you should put your initialization in <code>viewWillAppear</code>. There's another interesting thread talking about the invoking order in ViewController, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2053498/order-of-uiviewcontroller-initialization-and-loading">Order of UIViewController initialization and loading</a>. Finally, I want to point out Objective-C is an extension of C, so the "basic" allocation/free behavior should be the same.</p>
