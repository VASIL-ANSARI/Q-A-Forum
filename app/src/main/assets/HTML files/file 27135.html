<p>The problem is that if the string only has two parts, the third element of the array (index <code>2</code>) isn't empty - it just doesn't exist. Therefore, the code fails at </p>

<pre><code>String lastInitial = nameFML[2].substring(0,1).toUpperCase();
</code></pre>

<p>If you move these lines</p>

<pre><code>String firstInitial = nameFML[0].substring(0,1).toUpperCase();
String middleInitial = nameFML[1].substring(0,1).toUpperCase();
String lastInitial = nameFML[2].substring(0,1).toUpperCase();
</code></pre>

<p>into the appropriate if statements, everything should work fine. <code>nameFML.length</code> is the correct thing to check.</p>

<p>For future reference, <code>exception in thread main java.lang.arrayindexoutofboundsexception: 2</code> means that you tried to access index <code>2</code> of an array that had less than 3 elements (which occurred when you did <code>nameFML[2]</code>).</p>
