<p>Use memcached and a giant array! :)</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>Both sides of the equation can access the remote Memcached server the same way. Treating the big array as a stack of instructions. So the console can add new ones, and the bot can read, remove one, and perform it.</p>

<p>The cons. This is a really silly idea. Oh, and would be really easy to royally screw up if you aren't careful.</p>

<p>The pros. It is SUPER easy. And prolly really fast.</p>
