<p><code>aop:aspectj-autoproxy</code> needs to be specified in the same application context where you want it to act on, meaning where your controllers are defined (or auto-detected).</p>

<p>This is a mistake that happens often and the reason it is not working is that the Aspect detection and implementation works as a result of <code>BeanPostProcessor</code>s work. And <code>BeanPostProcessor</code>s act in the application context they are defined. In a web app, usually there are two such application contexts and many times aop stuff, transactional, autowiring can fail if such behaviors are not defined in the correct application context.</p>
