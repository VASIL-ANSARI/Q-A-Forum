<pre><code>var jsonData = '["{ staffid :41, firstname :Joe, lastname :Blow}", "{ staffid :42, firstname :Lucy, lastname :Goosey}"]'
</code></pre>

<p>This JSON string does not contain what you think it does.  When parsed, you will have an array of 2 objects.  If you wanted an array of objects, it should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>var jsonData = '[{"staffid": 41, "firstname": "Joe", "lastname": "Blow"}, {"staffid": 42, "firstname": "Lucy", "lastname": "Goosey"}]'
</code></pre>

<p>When you parse this, it should work as you expect.</p>

<p>Also, why do you even have a JSON string here in the first place?  Why not use a JavaScript array/object literal.</p>

<pre><code>var data = [{staffid: 41, firstname: "Joe", lastname: "Blow"}, {staffid: 42, firstname: "Lucy", lastname: "Goosey"}];
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. I <em>highly</em> suggest <strong>not</strong> using <code>async:false</code>.  That will make the browser lock up until the AJAX call is done.  You will not be able to interact with the page (and possibly the browser) until it's done.  That's not great UX at all.</p>
