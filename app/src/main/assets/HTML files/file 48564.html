<p>This post is a bit dated but here are my finding for anyone else who may be struggling with this issue.</p>

<p>With the latest version of WebSphere Liberty (currently @ 8.5.5.6) you can place your application bindings file (ibm-application-bnd.xml) into the web application's META-INF folder and Liberty will parse the bindings file as if it was packaged in an EAR.  I am not sure if this is a documented feature or not.</p>
