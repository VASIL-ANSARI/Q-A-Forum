<p>I highly recommend you extract the styling information from the HTML and transfer it to an external CSS file and create a class called "shadow" or similar. Then you can easily apply the box-shadow to any element by specifying a class name. This is better for testing what will work.</p>

<p>There are some additional issues with your code that could cause it to not render properly. For example, you can't have multiple elements with the same id. This will definitely cause errors.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img id="slidePic" ... /&gt;
</code></pre>
