<p>I would imagine you don't get back that address because the address that <code>ioremap_nocache</code> returns isn't guaranteed to be a virtual address, as it says <a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux-mandocs/2.6.4-cset-20040312_2111/ioremap_nocache.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ioremap_nocache performs a <em>platform specific sequence of operations</em> to make bus memory CPU accessible via the readb/readw/readl/writeb/ writew/writel functions and the other mmio helpers. <strong>The returned address is not guaranteed to be usable directly as a virtual address</strong>.</p>
