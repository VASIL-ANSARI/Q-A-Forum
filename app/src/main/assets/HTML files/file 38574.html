<p>Is this what you want?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.title,
       a.lat,
       a.lon, 
       a.alert_content_id, 
       a.date_added, 
       count(*)
FROM `reply` r INNER JOIN
     `alerts` a
      ON r.alert_id = a.alerts
WHERE `user` = '1'
GROUP BY a.title, a.lat, a.lon, a.alert_content_id, a.date_added;
</code></pre>

<p>The answer to your question is that you don't want to use <code>select distinct</code>.  You want to make an aggregation query that uses <code>group by</code>.  It is just unclear what you want to put into the <code>group by</code> clause.</p>
