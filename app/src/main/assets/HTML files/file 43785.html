<p>I think it'll help you</p>

<pre><code>String abc = "March 2";
String[] split = abc.split(" ");
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; split.length; i++) {
sb.append(split[i]);
if (i != split.length - 1) {
    sb.append(" ");
}
}
String combined = sb.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>At 0 position you'll get your months then get into a <code>String</code> and matches with your static array. </p>

<p>And at 1 position, you'll get your date, you can match it too.</p>
