<p>In C++, a <code>const</code> variable has internal linkage by default (as if it was <code>static</code>)&mdash;which normally means that each translation unit (each <code>.cpp</code> file) gets its own copy. This may very well be why you're seeing them multiple times.</p>

<p>What you'd want to do is declare the variables as <code>extern</code>, and then define them in exactly one source file.</p>
