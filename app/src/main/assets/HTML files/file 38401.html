<p>Couple things, </p>

<p>In Obj-c when you want to initialize an Object, you need to allocate space for it.
That is done using the <code>alloc</code> keyword.</p>

<p>so your <code>ContentPane *pane = [ContentPane init];</code></p>

<p>turns into  <code>ContentPane *pane = [[ContentPane alloc] init];</code></p>

<p>Also, whatever tutorial you are following, Stop... the way you have declared your variables we call them (iVars) is a very old fashioned way of doing things, they should really be properties. and <code>Boolean</code> values are represented by <code>YES</code> and <code>NO</code> not <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code></p>
