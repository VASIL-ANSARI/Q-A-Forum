<p>ImageModel would be the right place. Add a delete method to your ArticleModel in which it will loop over all related images, call the delete method and afterwards delete itself.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
    class ArticleModel {
        public function getImages() {
            //fetch your images
            return $images;
        }

        public function delete() {
            foreach($this-&gt;getImages() as $image) {
                $image-&gt;delete();
            }
            $this-&gt;delete();
        }
</code></pre>
