<p>First and foremost, the GC works, and works well. There's no bug in it that you have just discovered. </p>

<p>Now that we've gotten that out of the way, some thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are you using too many threads?</li>
<li>Remember that GC is non deterministic; it'll run whenever it thinks it needs to run (even if you call <code>GC.Collect()</code>.</li>
<li>Are you sure all your references are going out of scope?</li>
<li>What are you loading into memory in the first place? Large images? Large text files?</li>
</ol>

<p>Your profiler should tell you what's using so much memory. Start cutting at the biggest culprits as much as you can.</p>

<p>Also, calling GC.Collect() every X seconds is a bad idea and will unlikely solve your real problem.</p>
