<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGKILL" rel="nofollow">SIGKILL</a> is a signal that is common across POSIX systems, such as in your iphone OS, which it issued the signal to your application. SIGKILL cannot be caught programmatically. Usually to kill a process involves entering this on the command line, remember you can do this to the processes that you own since you logged into the shell:</p>

<pre>
ps -elf | grep myprocess    

<p>Then to kill 'myprocess' by using the numeric process id based on the PID column from the previous output sample</p>

<pre>
kill -1 9149
</pre>

<p>Depending on 'myprocess' and how the OS handles this, you will receive similar output as shown:</p>

<pre>
myprocess: received SIGKILL.
process terminated
</pre>

<p>Depending on what happened, it is likely when your profiler ran the code, it somehow killed your application whether by intentionally or unintentionally, judging by your question:</p>


My app broke on a line calling drawInRect on a UIImage instance

top of call stack is CGGStateCreateCopy
</pre>

<p>It is likely that <code>drawInRect</code> was supplied with a parameter that was invalid...you need to check the parameters used for that function and verify it. That could be the very reason why the OS killed your application...</p>

<p>Hope this helps,
Best regards,
Tom.</p>
