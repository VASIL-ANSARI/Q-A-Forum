<p>Assuming you have a table named <code>tableName</code>, and has columns: <code>userID</code>, <code>last_login</code>. You can know the most current login date of the user by using <code>MAX</code> which is an <em>Aggregate Function</em>.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT userID, 
       MAX(last_login) most_current_login
FROM   tableName
GROUP  BY userID
</code></pre>
