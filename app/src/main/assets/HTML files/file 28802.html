<p>Don't put the classes and functions inside of <code>stuff</code>. Especially, don't put <code>MyObj</code> inside there.</p>

<p>If you want to use the  <code>if __name__=="__main__":</code> condition, only put the code that is <em>not</em> a class or a function inside of <code>stuff</code>.</p>
