<p>In that line:
<code>else if(Character.isLetter(currentChar) &amp;&amp; (vowels.charAt(index) == (currentChar))){</code>
you are checking if your char is a letter and also if it's a vowel. You could try that in the condition test:</p>

<pre><code>else if(Character.isLetter(currentChar)){
</code></pre>
