<p>I was just having the exact same problem working with displaying stl files. I'm guessing you're having the same problem I had, which is you are in the wrong thread when you are trying to create your new triangles. You've got to make sure your calls to OpenGL methods are on the right thread. I'm pretty new to this stuff myself. I basically just changed my program to queue up the STL that I have to add, and then, within the onDraw method, I instantiate the new stuff. </p>
