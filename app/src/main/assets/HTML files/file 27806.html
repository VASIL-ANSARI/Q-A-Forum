<p>Why do you need the <code>TYPE_STRING</code> test?  taking the address of an array is a noop if you're just going to convert it to a <code>void *</code>, since the array will decay to a pointer in that case.  So just use</p>

<pre><code>#define ROW(x,y,z,v)  { x, &amp;(y.z), v, &amp;(y.z##_b) }
</code></pre>
