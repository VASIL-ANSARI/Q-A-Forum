<p>Best guess is the fpdf can't write to a tmp directory, or the files it's using are some how blocked. Check your apache logs, and can you give an example of the text that is displayed on linux? There might be a white space or return key in your php file. for example</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
echo "woohoo";
?&gt;
&lt;?php
echo "second woohoo";
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the middle with the closing and opening tags, there's a return key which can mess things up on linux but not windows (as windows ignores the special character that causes a new line).</p>

<p>Also, at the end of the fpdf generating code, dont close the tag, ie:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
echo "second wooho";
</code></pre>
