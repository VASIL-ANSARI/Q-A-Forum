<p>Like <strong>Lemak</strong> said, you can't pass temporary tables around like this.  You either need to have a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188279%28v=sql.90%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Linked Server</a> and copy the data directly into the table, or you need to export the data and import it into the table using SSIS.</p>
