<p>You can use <code>NOT EXISTS</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT E.Lname 
FROM EMPLOYEE E
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                  FROM DEPENDENT D
                  WHERE E.Ssn = D.Essn 
                    AND E.Sex = D.Sex
                    AND D.Relationship IN ('Son','Daughter')
                 )
</code></pre>

<p>This will only return records from the <code>EMPLOYEE</code> table, so no multiple records returned.</p>

<p>Edit: Noticed the relationship options included 'spouse'.</p>
