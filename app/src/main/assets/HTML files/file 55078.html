<p>I'd argue that triggering validation from within the data access layer is both bad design and a fundamentally bad idea. Doing so basically means that all code that handed you down the instance to save (and fail eventually) and that instance has been broken (in an invalid state) all the time. If that hasn't caused some intermediate business logic to fail, fingers crossed!</p>

<p>This approach usually works for <em>very</em> simple CRUD scenarios as basically no intermediary can fail if e.g. a field is <code>null</code> but shouldn't be etc. But as soon as you start to add some logic in between those errors will already break your logic (e.g. something expecting an email address to be of the correct format, being not null etc.).</p>

<p>I'd rather recommend to build a strong domain model that fundamentally prevents objects from getting into invalid state and adding a mapping layer <em>very</em> close to where the user input is received so that you basically discover missing validations by exceptions being thrown from that mapping step.</p>

<p>JSR-303 can then be used in the layer accepting the potentially tainted user data. But it's definitely something you should not use in your domain model.</p>
