<p>Ok, I think I got it.  The problem is that the triangle's container does not have the z-index applied.</p>

<p>Try changing the style of col1 div to this:</p>

<pre><code>.col1 {
float: left;
width: 20%;
min-width: 12em;
padding-top: 1em;
position: relative;
z-index: 9999;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if that does the trick.</p>
