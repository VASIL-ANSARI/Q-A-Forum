<p>Normally the way you achieve this is to include <code>path/to/file.txt</code> as a resource in <code>B.jar</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, include <code>Guava</code> 19.0 as a compile time dependency in your Maven project (it looks like you're using Maven).  The following code works for me:</p>

<pre><code>// pom.properties is bundled in guava-19.0.jar.
URL resource = Example.class.getResource("/META-INF/maven/com.google.guava/guava/pom.properties");
System.out.println(resource.toString());
</code></pre>
