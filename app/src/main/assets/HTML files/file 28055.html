<p>This must work for you. I tested in my local mysql database with the data you provided and it worked.</p>

<pre><code>select dth.toy_id, dth.created_date as start_date, 
       ifnull((select min(dth2.created_date) from dog_toy_history dth2 where dth2.created_date &gt; dth.created_date and dth2.dog_id='2'),'2013-09-01') as end_date 
       from dog_toy_history dth
       where (dth.created_date between '2013-07-01' and '2013-09-01') and dog_id='2' ORDER by start_date;
</code></pre>

<p>I will give some explanation for those who are not very familiar with mysql:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the inner select brings the <strong>created_date</strong> field of the next toy if existent. This will represent the <strong>end_date</strong> of the current toy.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ifnull(exp1,exp2)</code> specifies a default if a next toy is inexistent. In this case the <strong>end_date</strong> will be the end date from the input.</p></li>
</ul>
