<p>I don't know what your specific issue is, but I figure that if you use all the tools available to you for debugging, you'll be able to find your issue easily.</p>

<p>For development, you should always up your <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting" rel="nofollow">error reporting</a> level to <code>E_ALL ^ E_STRICT</code>. You can find this setting in your php.ini file. <code>E_STRICT</code> specifically will help identify interoperability and compatibility issues, and is not included in <code>E_ALL</code> until PHP 5.4, <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php" rel="nofollow">according to the manual</a>.</p>

<p>You may also want to use Netbeans and XDebug, which should allow you to step through your code line by line, which will simplify debugging immensely. There is a guide for setting up these tools here: <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/debugging.html" rel="nofollow">Debugging PHP Source Code in the NetBeans IDE</a></p>
