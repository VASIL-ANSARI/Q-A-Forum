<p>In my opinion a different approach would be better. When the user clicks an item, display a spinner or something to let the user know an operation is going on, then do your long-running <code>choose_seat()</code> in the background. If it fails, then change the radio button to non-active and set it to be insensitive (since you now know it doesn't work.)</p>
