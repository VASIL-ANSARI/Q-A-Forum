<p>Seesaw is a gem found in the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rails-oceania/" rel="nofollow">Rails Oceania Rubyforge Project</a> that provides this kind of functionality to mongrel clusters.  However, the project may be suffering from some bit-rot not havain had a release since 2007.  Still worth a look even just to pinch the ideas :)</p>
