<p>Something is not right in your code. ! </p>

<pre><code>return redirect(reverse('frontend.views.user')) # not working
</code></pre>

<p>You told that you redirect. But redirecting to where ? <code>'frontend.views.user'</code> will get you to the same page but again with different request object. Make your view redirect to another function or use the working one <code>render</code> with <code>request</code>.</p>
