<p>I started a blank project and copy-pasted your code into it and it works fine.  I know you said you set your device orientation, but did you do that in your project settings?  That's the only problem I can think of.  Select your project, general tab, and under Deployment Info, there's a "Devices" drop-down box.  Select iPad and make sure "Landscape Left" and "Landscape Right" are the only two checked.  My guess is that the project thinks it's supposed to be starting in portrait mode, so it's stretching your 768-tall image vertically to 1024 at start; then when your app determines that it's in landscape orientation, it just rotates that stretched image accordingly, which would result in the image being cut off.</p>
