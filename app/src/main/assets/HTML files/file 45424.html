<p>Every part of this looks like it could be simplified and solved by setting the <code>UIToolbar</code> as the <code>UITextview</code>'s <code>inputAccessoryView</code>. This will attach the toolbar to the keyboard as it animates up and down. If you want it to remain at the bottom of the view in the View Controller you can overwrite the <code>inputAccessoryView</code> of the View Controller and then add this method to your View Controller's implementation file:</p>

<pre class="lang-objective-c prettyprint-override"><code>- (BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder {
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>
