<p>First, you seem to be learning opengl 2, I would suggest instead learning a newer version, as it is more powerful and efficient. A good tutorial can be found here <a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/</a></p>

<p>If i understand this correctly, you read in an initial state and draw it, then continuously read in the pixels on the screen, update the array based on the game of life logic then draw it back? this seems overly complicated.
The reading of the pixels on the screen is unnecessary, and will cause complications if you try to enlarge the rects to more than a pixel.
I would say a good solution would be to keep a bit array (1 is a organism, 0 is not), possibly as a 2d array in memory, updating the logic every say 30 iterations (for 30 fps), then drawing all the rects to the screen, black for 1, white for 0 using glColor(r,g,b,a) tied to an in statement in a nested for loop.
Then, if you give your rects a  negative z coord, you can "zoom in" using glTranslate(x,y,z) triggered by a keyboard button.</p>

<p>Of course in a newer version of opengl, vertex buffers would make the code much cleaner and efficient.</p>
