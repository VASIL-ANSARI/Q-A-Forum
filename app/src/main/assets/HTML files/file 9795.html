<p>The difference is in the version of IIS and Scott's examples are all for IIS 7.x</p>

<p>I'm in the same boat, I wish it wasn't so but unfortunately that's the limitation with the old version.</p>

<p>I've just tried to locate the original reference re admin on IIS6 but I can't seem to find it. Hopefully someone will dig it up.</p>
