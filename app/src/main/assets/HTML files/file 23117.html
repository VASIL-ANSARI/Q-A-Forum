<p>There is no IAreaShape class in the GLES2-Anchor branch. You are probably mixing some older libraries. Try downloading sources again. Note that your PhysicsBox2D extension must be from GLES2-Anchor branch too. Also, you should not add any jars to buildpath. You should see only:</p>

<ul>
<li>Android X.Y.Z</li>
<li>Android Dependencies</li>
</ul>

<p>And add libraries in the "Android" part of your project configuration.</p>
