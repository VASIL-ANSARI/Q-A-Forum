<p>Each time when you try to check new position, you have to loop through all elements in the list and check if they are checked. If the number of checked elements equals maximum number of checked elements, then you don't check pressed position. I think there is no other way to do it. Check the multipleChoiceView documentation. I think that this solution is the most appropriate here.</p>

<p>Here you have some example but it is in JavaScript:

<p>You can also disable other checkBoxes:
