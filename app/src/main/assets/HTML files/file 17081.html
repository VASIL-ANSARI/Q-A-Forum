<p>The positions in each view are associated with the positions on the bottom bar of the Tab Bar Controller. If you reorder that bar you will reorder your views. You can reorder them by drag and drop on your interface builder. </p>

<p>In your example just select Home in your Tab Bar Controller and drag it to the first position.</p>

<p>If you have problems dragging and dropping try to select first your Tab View Controller or exit your XCode and open it again (like @thepumpkin1979 and @Rick pointed out).</p>
