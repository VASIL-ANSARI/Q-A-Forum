<p>Maybe I'm not getting what you want, but it sounds like you want a simple update query? If so, this should do it:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE CSEReduxResponses 
SET approveddate = '2014-03-02'
WHERE response_id = 76
</code></pre>

<p>How the date is displayed depends on your language settings, and can be altered when you issue your query, so if you want <code>March 03, 2014</code>instead of <code>2014-03-02</code>you can control it in the query.</p>
