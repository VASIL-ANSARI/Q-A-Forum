<p>You can use the modulo to deduct 24 from numbers when they're greater than 23.</p>

<pre><code>$start_time = 9;
$end_time = 2;
for( $i = $start_time; $i % 24 != $end_time; $i++ )
{
    echo $i % 24;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you need to be careful with this; if <code>$end_time</code> is greater than 23 it will be stuck in an infinite loop.</p>
