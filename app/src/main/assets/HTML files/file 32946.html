<p>I use <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/" rel="nofollow">WiX</a> to install applications and it has support for creating these registration entries using a tool in it's suite called Heat.  It has a bit of a learning curve but I've found it to be an awesome installer suite.  It's free and it's widely used.</p>

<p>If your looking for a simpler solution you could just create a batch file like you say to register/unregister the dll(s) manually and to install/uninstall files.</p>
