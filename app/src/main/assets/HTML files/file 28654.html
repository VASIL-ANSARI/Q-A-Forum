<p>The error is due to the semicolon, however, this still wont' do what you want.  You are hiding the element immediately and then passing the result of <code>hide</code> into <code>setTimeout</code>.  YOu want to instead do this:</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function(){
    $("#fsForm1585007").hide();
},8000);
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, you are passing a function, which, when invoked will hide your element.</p>
