<p>This is a very valid question. Looks like the methods are limited, but I found some pretty promising info on this guys blog: <a href="http://www.pocketmagic.net/programmatically-injecting-events-on-android-part-2/" rel="nofollow">PocketMagic article</a>. He's a developer on Google Code, and I've used some of his stuff in the past. So, it looks like you can inject mouse pointer events kernel-level thru adb, by writing to <code>/dev/input/eventXXX</code>, with X being each input method attached to the device. He has created a library to interface with the kernel, and also an installable app that may solve all your needs. However, if you need a pure adb solution, you can probably inspect his code to figure out the process of determining which alias to write to and what his adb commands look like.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
