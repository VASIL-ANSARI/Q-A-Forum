<p>Without you posting the whole code it's hard to debug. However a few things that could be wrong come to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You don't notify the JTable that the data has changed by calling:</strong> <code>.fireTableDataChanged()</code></li>
<li><strong>You don't update the frame with:</strong> <code>.repaint();</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>.revalidate();</code></li>
<li><strong>You update your file, but do not read the file updates or otherwise update the change to your JTable.</strong></li>
</ol>
