<p>Recently I resolved this issue. The problem was that the method: </p>

<p><code>private synchronized static void reloadTree(final JTree tree, final MVAFilteredTreeModel treeModel)</code></p>

<p>was executed within its own thread appart the EDT. The solution was to move this method call into a <strong><code>SwingWorker</code></strong> instance, so that the rendering of nodes is done by the EDT.</p>
