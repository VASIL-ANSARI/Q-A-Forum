<p>While I can't recommend anything specific: Whatever app you find that will install and run in either a Windows or Linux virtual machine (or in a Windows VM in a Cloud Service, if the install can be automated and quick), should be ok. Just make sure whatever library you use doesn't rely on any specific GPU (since Azure doesn't offer GPU support today).</p>

<p>I saw another answer recommending a CLR procedure to process the images. I really wouldn't recommend that, as you're now stressing the CPU of your SQL Server, and that's not something that can easily be scaled out to multiple servers. And if you choose to use Windows Azure SQL Database, you won't have CLR as an option. You're better off placing processing in, say, a Cloud Service worker role, where you can scale out to any number of instances, and you can then use an Azure Queue to instruct the workers to perform specific comparisons / processing.</p>
