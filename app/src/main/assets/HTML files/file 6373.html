<p>I don't know a very short way, but I would use something like this (as qick hack to get an impression):</p>

<pre><code>  try {
    // this is a new frame, where the picture should be shown
    final JFrame showPictureFrame = new JFrame("Title");
    // we will put the picture into this label
    JLabel pictureLabel = new JLabel();

    /* The following will read the image */
    // you should get your picture-path in another way. e.g. with a JFileChooser
    String path = "C:\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\Sample Pictures\\Koala.jpg";
    URL url = new File(path).toURI().toURL();
    BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(url);
    /* until here */

    // add the image as ImageIcon to the label
    pictureLabel.setIcon(new ImageIcon(img));
    // add the label to the frame
    showPictureFrame.add(pictureLabel);
    // pack everything (does many stuff. e.g. resizes the frame to fit the image)
    showPictureFrame.pack();

    //this is how you should open a new Frame or Dialog, but only using showPictureFrame.setVisible(true); would also work.
    java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {

      public void run() {
        showPictureFrame.setVisible(true);
      }
    });

  } catch (IOException ex) {
    System.err.println("Some IOException accured (did you set the right path?): ");
    System.err.println(ex.getMessage());
  }
</code></pre>
