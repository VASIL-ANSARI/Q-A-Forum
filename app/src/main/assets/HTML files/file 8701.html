<p>The blog you are referring to talks about the sizes, not startup times.</p>

<p>If you are writing a real desktop application, you shouldn't worry about the size or bootstrap time implications of adding another API. Just look at the size of the installs and start times of Eclipse (Java) or Microsoft Word (native).</p>
