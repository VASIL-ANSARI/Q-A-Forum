<p>Think about what the height of the inner layout should be. Right now it is <code>wrap_content</code> and contains a <code>TableLayout</code> (with no rows) with its height also set to <code>wrap_content</code>. There doesn't seem to be anything in that inner layout giving it a height dimension, so that may be why it is not being displayed.</p>

<p>Trying the following will make your layout visible:</p>

<pre><code>    LinearLayout.LayoutParams innerLayoutParams = new LinearLayout.LayoutParams(300, 300);
</code></pre>

<p>More usefully, you can try adding something with a real width/height to the <code>TableLayout</code>.</p>

<p>Also consider writing your layout in XML to <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout.html" rel="nofollow">better separate your application logic and the presentation</a>.</p>
