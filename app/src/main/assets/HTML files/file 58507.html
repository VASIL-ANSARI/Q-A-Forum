<p>When you call <code>scanf</code> with the <code>%s</code> format specifier, it expects a pointer to an array of characters.  What you're passing is the address of a single character.  So it writes past the memory location of that variable into whatever happens to be next to it.  This invokes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" rel="nofollow">undefined behavior</a>.</p>

<p>You need pass a character array to <code>scanf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>char folderpath[256];
printf("enter the path : \n");
scanf("%s",folderpath);

...

d = opendir(folderpath);
</code></pre>
