<p>Here's an order N method, best described by an example.</p>

<p>Suppose your number is x.</p>

<p>To find 3 consecutive 1 bits, start with the n = 7. (That's 0b111.) Compute x &amp; n. If that is x, then you have 3 consecutive 1 bits at the end of your number.</p>

<p>If not bitwise shift n to get 0b1110. Compute x &amp; n again.</p>

<p>Continue until you've reached (and tested) the most significant 1 bit in x.</p>

<p>There are perhaps more efficient ways, for example, overlaying 0b1110111 which will require fewer shifts but a more complicated expression for success.</p>
