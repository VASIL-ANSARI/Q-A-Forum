<p>I'm using the Yahoo User Interface library Grids <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssgrids/" rel="nofollow">http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssgrids/</a> for all my positioning needs. 
Takes half a minute to set up, and as long as you're familiar with elementary school fractions it takes two minutes to master. 
Seriously.</p>

<p>Basically what you want to achieve is something like this,
and <strong>keep in mind you need to set a pixel width on your outermost container</strong>, ms-bodyareacell for instance, if you're using a vanilla v4.master.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;div class="yui3-g"&gt; //the yui3-g is a grid container
    &lt;div class="yui3-1-4" id="doc1"&gt; // yui3-1-4 fills 1/4 of the avaliable width
        //document 1 goes here
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="yui3-1-4" id="doc2"&gt;
        //document 2 goes here
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="yui3-1-4" id="doc3"&gt;
        //document 3 goes here
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="yui3-1-4" id="doc4"&gt;
        //document 4 goes here
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This way all the document instances can have the same class name (yui3-1-4), and will wrap if there's more than 4.</p>

<p>YUI grids have seriously taken a lot of pain out of gridding and positioning items on web pages in general, and for me SharePoint in particular. I've used it on several public facing web sites, as well as numerous intra- and extranet implementations.
Hope it works out for you.</p>
