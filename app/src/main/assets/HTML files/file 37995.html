<p>Yes, to pass anything from the first layer to the third (using isolate scope and the other techniques you want) you would need to pass it from each to the next.</p>

<p>However, since your parent has no repeats (it's a singleton) you may want to consider moving this out to a service. That's almost always the right choice for shared material anyway, since services are singletons by default, they're injectable (easily testable) and they'll clean all this up. The service doesn't even really need to do anything, just expose a <code>this.clipboard=...</code> value that the directives can reference. Then just inject the service into each directive and you're done.</p>
