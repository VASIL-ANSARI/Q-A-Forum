<p>Python scripts are interpreted as you go. So when the interpreter enters <code>__init__()</code> the class variable <code>A</code> isn't defined yet (you are inside it), same with <code>self</code> (that is a different parameter and only available in function body).</p>

<p>However anything in that class is interpreted top to bottom, so <code>class_var</code> is defined so you can simply use that one.</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    class_var = 'Hi'
    def __init__(self, var=class_var):
        self.var = var
</code></pre>

<p>but I am not super certain that this will be stable across different interpreters...</p>
