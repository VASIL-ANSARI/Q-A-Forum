<p>I am betting it is this line:</p>

<pre><code>zip.AddFile(myOtherList[x]); 
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, it has to find the zip file in question. The fact you are reusing the exact same object makes this harder to debug, so I would consider moving into its own routine and feeding the name of the zip and the file paths to zip in a single zip file to the routine. You then create a new zip and add files rather than reuse the same zip object.</p>
