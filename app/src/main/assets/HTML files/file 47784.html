<p>Actually, you've answered your question. Of course, queries using navigation properties are much more convenient, than queries with <code>join</code>s.</p>

<p>Concerning <code>Include</code>s - overusing of <code>Include</code> is mostly analogue of overusing of <code>join</code>, because <code>Include</code> is at least <code>join</code> and, optionally, something else. Do not write queries with tens of <code>Include</code> calls, and there won't be performance hit.</p>
