<p>The issue was <code>System.Mail.SmtpException</code>.</p>

<p>This exception was being thrown since the network was not able to connect or resolve the smtpserver (smtp.gmail.com)</p>

<p>Because of this, the email was not sent and there was still an error. </p>

<p>So I just used</p>

<pre><code>try {
  // send the email
} catch (System.Mail.SmtpException e) {
  // error message
}
</code></pre>
