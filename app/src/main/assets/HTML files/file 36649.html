<p>Oh, there is serious problems with your views:</p>

<h2>First:</h2>

<pre><code>class ListView(generic.ListView, slug, id)
</code></pre>

<p>should be</p>

<pre><code>class ListView(generic.ListView)
</code></pre>

<p>see <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance" rel="nofollow">python inheritance</a>.</p>

<h2>Second:</h2>

<p><code>slug</code> and <code>id</code> must be class members of your view so you can redefine you view like this:</p>

<pre><code>class ListView(generic.ListView):
   template_name = 'entertainment/index.html'
   context_object_name = 'latest_article_list'
   slug = None
   id = None

def get_queryset(self):

    return Entertainmentblog.objects.order_by('-posted')[:25]
</code></pre>

<h2>Third:</h2>

<p>Youre naming a derivate class as its parent. I don't know the implications of doing this, but surely, isn't a good practice.</p>

<h2>Finally:</h2>

<p>The error you're getting is becouse the view returned by <code>views.DetailView.as_view()</code> (remember <code>DetailView</code> is your derived class) don't receives the arguments you are passing through url. Check your url, I can see in the error that is complaining about and argument <code>(u'what-is-happening',)</code> but there is no <code>id</code>. It should be something like, for example, <code>(u'what-is-happening', '4')</code> </p>
