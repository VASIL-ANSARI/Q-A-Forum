<p><code>%f</code> is not the right formatting specifier to print out <code>myClock1</code> as <code>clock_t</code> is likely not <code>double</code>. You shouldn't assume that <code>clock_t</code> is <code>double</code>. If you want to print <code>myClock1</code> as a floating point number you have to manually convert it to <code>double</code>:</p>

<pre><code>printf("Task %d clock has been set to %f\n", i, (double)myClock1);
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, use the macro <code>CLOCKS_PER_SEC</code> to turn <code>myClock1</code> into a number of seconds:</p>

<pre><code>printf("Task %d clock has been set to %f seconds\n", i,
    (double)myClock1 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, your subtraction in the scheduler loop is wrong. Think about it: <code>clock()</code> grows larger with the time, so <code>Tasks[i].LastTick - clock()</code> always yields a negative value. I think you want <code>clock() - Tasks[i].LastTick</code> instead.</p>
