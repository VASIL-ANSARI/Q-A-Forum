<p>Try uploading the icon somewhere on the web, and link it to that image url. I remember having issues with accessing a background-image on local machine, but if I was trying to link it from the web, I had no problems. I think <a href="http://www.iconj.com/favicon_hosting.php" rel="nofollow">this</a> should do the trick. Didn't use it though.</p>
