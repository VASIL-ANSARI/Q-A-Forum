<p>The thing that you are looking for is an inline view. An inline view is a subquery in <code>from</code> clause. Unlike subqueries in <code>select</code> and <code>where</code> clauses, you cannot refer to the other tables in your <code>from</code> clause, but you can join the result of the inline query with the tables in your main query.</p>

<p>In your case it would be:</p>

<pre><code>select offer_id, offer_name, total_offers_sold
  from table_name t1
       inner join (select offer_id, total_offer_changed
                     from table_name
                    where whatever...
                   ) t2
            on t1.offer_id = t2.offer_id
 where whatever_the_other_conditions
;
</code></pre>

<p>But, in real world I would simply try to do something like</p>

<pre><code>select offer_id, offer_name, total_offers_sold, total_offer_changed
  from table_name
 where whatever_the_conditions
;
</code></pre>
