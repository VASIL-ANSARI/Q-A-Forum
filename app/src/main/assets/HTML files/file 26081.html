<p>The answer to my problem can be found here - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11423725/why-cant-i-instantiate-this-fragment-on-android">Why can&#39;t I instantiate this Fragment on Android?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Figured out the issue.... my MainActivity.java file was using:</p>
  
  <p>import android.support.v4.app.Fragment; and my MainFragment.java file
  was using:</p>
  
  <p>import android.app.Fragment; So there was a mismatch. I am using ICS
  4.0 and higher as my lowest API version. Changing everything to import to the v4 API solved my issue</p>
