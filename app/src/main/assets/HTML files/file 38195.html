<p>You can store data or communicate from IntentService onHandleIntent() directly. You don't need to run it in separate thread, unless you want reading bluetooth to continue ASAP.</p>

<p>Handling everything in an infinite loop smells. Also keeping service alive depends on few factors. If IntentService dies, it won't be restored because by default IntentService.onStartCommand implicitly returns START_NOT_STICKY, or START_REDELIVER_INTENT if you call setIntentRedelivery(true) on this service. Check Service <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html" rel="nofollow">javadoc</a> for more info.</p>

<p>If you can scan bluetooth periodically then I would consider kind of scheduler. For that you would probably need to implement Service, not IntentService and handle background thread yourself. Alternatively, you could use a Timer. These are more hints, not ready solution. Since you asked about direction, I assume you will investigate solutions yourself.</p>

<p>Depending on handled data you could separate DB operations and network to separate services. Think about them as modules which are decoupled. You will benefit maintaing this code in the future and in case one service goes down due to any reason, the rest will keep working. It depends on data size because it's not a good practise to push heavy data between service/activities(data is serialised and deserialised every time it is sent).</p>

<p>If DB is just a buffer/queue then maybe use it directly after reading bluetooth data. In other words queue data for sending. Create second service for HTTP communications. Don't push entire data to second service, just inform it about(knock the door :)) and let HTTP service access DB by itself. I would wrap DB in ContentProvider and access it from services. </p>

<p>There are probably different techniques out there too, but that's what I thought about it in the first place.</p>
