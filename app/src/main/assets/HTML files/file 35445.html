<p>This isn't likely the answer you want to hear, but the easiest way to do this is to use a <code>ListView</code> instead of a <code>GridView</code>. You have 2 distinct row types, 1 element and 2 element. Use standard <code>ListView</code> conventions to have two different row types present.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, create a new <code>Adapter</code> that extends one of the list adapter classes, override <code>getView(int, View, Viewgroup)</code> so that it returns the correct view based on position (the first argument), and then have it return the correct view for each item in your list. You'll have to manage the relationship between entries in the list and whether they're wide or normal, but that shouldn't be too big of a deal.</p>
