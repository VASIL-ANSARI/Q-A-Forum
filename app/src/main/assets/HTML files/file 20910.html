<p>I recently had a problem with similar symptoms and I was adding a subview over and over again else where in my code whenever I committed a certain action. Maybe you are doing something similar? When your touches end, are you doing something else to your flipped content? You probably need to remove the subviews being added <strong>IF that is your problem</strong>. </p>
