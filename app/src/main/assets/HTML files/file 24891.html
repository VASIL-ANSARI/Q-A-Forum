<p>Think about how you use an actual logic gate.</p>

<p>You normally have two inputs, one output, and a black box between. It doesn't matter whether it's a NAND, AND, OR or anything else - the interface looks identical. All logic gates look the same. If you have a circuit which takes different logic gates, you could plug any of them into it and get different behaviour.</p>

<p>Your interface naming is therefore part of the problem. This isn't a NAND or AND with an implementation, it's a LogicGate which can be implemented as a NAND or AND.</p>

<p>If you do that, it also becomes obvious that the AND gate can't just rely on the implementation of whatever gets passed to it. It needs either actual NAND gates, or some other way of making it work.</p>

<p>DI is appropriate when the thing using its collaborators can trust them completely, and doesn't need to know about their implementation. That isn't the case here - and there might be other ways of getting the AND gate to work - so don't use DI.</p>

<p>If there's anything which uses a logic gate without caring about its implementation - just trusting that it's doing the appropriate job, whatever it happens to be at the time - <em>then</em> you can use DI.</p>
