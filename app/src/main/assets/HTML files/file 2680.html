<p>Firstly, great question--I didn't know about that feature of named scopes! The following works for me:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  add_activate = lambda do
    define_method "activate" do
      each { |i| i.update_attribute(:active, true) }
    end
  end

  named_scope :inactive, :conditions =&gt; {:active =&gt; false}, &amp;add_activate
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can pass the <code>add_activate</code> block as the last argument to any named scopes that need the <code>activate</code> method.</p>
