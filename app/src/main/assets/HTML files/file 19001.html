<p>Inside your second loop you could add this code at the end.</p>

<pre><code>if (!isset($sums[$salesPerson-&gt;team])) {
    $sums[$salesPerson-&gt;team] = 0;
}
$sums[$salesPerson-&gt;team] += $salesPerson-&gt;target;
</code></pre>

<p>It builds an array with the teams as the key and the sum of targets from anyone in that team. After the loop ends, you can use the value of <code>$sums</code>.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, kindly tell me the value of <code>var_dump($sums)</code>.</p>
