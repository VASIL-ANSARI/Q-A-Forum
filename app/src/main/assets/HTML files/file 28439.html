<p>How about pickling the list output rather than outputting it as a plaintext representation? Have a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> for your version: it's basically a way to write Python objects to file, which you can then read from Python at any point to get identical objects.</p>

<p>Once you have the file open that you want to output to, the outputting difference will be quite minor, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>import pickle

my_list = [[1, 2], [134, 76], [798, 5, 2]]
with open('outputfile.pkl', 'wb') as output:
    pickle.dump(my_list, output, -1)
</code></pre>

<p>And then just use the following way to read it in from your second program:</p>

<pre><code>import pickle
my_list = pickle.load(open('outputfile.pkl', 'rb'))
</code></pre>
