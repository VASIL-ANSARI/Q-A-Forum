<p>It set up a page in .NET to test this. It contained a button that added 1K of garbage to the Viewstate and then printed out it's current size in bytes. I was able to grow the viewstate to over 100K both in Safari on iOS 6 and 7 without any ill effects. This was the same regardless of whether I had viewstate set to break itself up into smaller chunks using maxPageStateFieldLength or not.</p>

<p>However, I was still able to get the page to throw invalid viewstate exceptions under iOS 6 with heavy use of the browser back button. This is likely due to Safari mobile too aggressively caching and using old requests. This particular bug appears to have been mitigated in iOS 7 though. It now in some cases brings up a dialog box asking if you want to resubmit the page. The bad viewstate error is then not triggered.</p>

<p><strong>So it appears that there is no limitation in request size per se</strong>. A combination of this and other factors are required to trigger the invalid viewstate exceptions under Safari mobile and .Net.</p>
