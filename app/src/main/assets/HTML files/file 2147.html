<p>First, remove the $ in front of results... I assume that was a typo.
Next, replace</p>

<pre><code>$results = url.match("[\\?&amp;]v=([^&amp;#]*)");
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>results = url.match("[\?&amp;]v=([^&amp;#]*)")[1];
</code></pre>

<p>match() will return an array if there is a successful match. You're currently getting the entire array. What you want is the second element of the array (<code>match()[1]</code>) which is what is inside your capturing parentheses.</p>
