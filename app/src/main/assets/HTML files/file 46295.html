<p>Is this always just fetching one row? At least it looks like it, and if that's the case you could just use variables with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>declare @price decimal(10,2) = 0, @payment decimal(10,2) = 0

SELECT 
    @price = SUM(order.quant * item.itprice ) * ( 100 - order.percent ) / 100)
FROM
    item 
    inner join order 
        ON order.iditem = item.id 
WHERE
    order.idclient = 1 

SELECT 
    @payment = SUM(amount)
FROM   
    payed 
WHERE
    idcom = 1

select @price - @payment
</code></pre>
