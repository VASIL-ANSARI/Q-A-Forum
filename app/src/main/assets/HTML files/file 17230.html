<p>You may try with Hibernate <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.6/javadocs/org/hibernate/ScrollableResults.html" rel="nofollow">ScrollableResults</a>, I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A result iterator that allows moving around within the results by
  arbitrary increments. The Query / ScrollableResults pattern is very
  similar to the JDBC PreparedStatement/ ResultSet pattern and the
  semantics of methods of this interface are similar to the similarly
  named methods on ResultSet.</p>
