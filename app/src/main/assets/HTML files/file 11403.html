<p>I'm not entirely clear on what your exact problem is, but an R-Tree or interval tree would not work well in 20 dimensions.  That's not a huge number of dimensions, but it is large enough for the curse of dimensionality to begin showing up.</p>

<p>To see what I mean, consider just trying to look at all of the neighbors of a box, including ones off of corners and edges.  With 20 dimensions, you'll have 3<sup>20</sup> - 1 or 3,486,784,400 neighboring boxes.  (You get that by realizing that along each axis a neighbor can be -1 unit, 0 unit, or +1 unit, but (0,0,0) is not a neighbor because it represents the original box.)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but you either need to accept brute force searching, or else analyze your problem better and come up with a cleverer solution.</p>
