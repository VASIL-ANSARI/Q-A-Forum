<p>Generally, to increase performace avoid creating unessesary objects and dont do anything you dont have to. For example you create one useless local texture in DrawMap(), also for single call of method PlaceTile you create 3 new vectors, while you need one.etc. also note, these are only <strong>minor</strong> improvements.<br/>
Another ways of speeding up might be using buffers(not sure what is default for XNA)<br/>
But most importantly, parallelize wherever you can.</p>
