<p>First, proper object oriented design should inform the decision to make a method/field static.  </p>

<p>Second, in a web application, where requests are all handled on separate threads, you have to be very careful how you use static methods/fields.  If your static method maintains any state across invocations(by using a static field to keep a count, for example), you can run into threading issues.  This happens because one request might invoke the static method, and then be stopped in the middle of execution by another thread that invokes the method.  If the first invocation modified a common resource, but did not finish, the second invocation might corrupt the progress of the first execution.</p>
