<p>Solved. </p>

<p>I uninstalled CUDA drivers and the JDK. Rebooted and installed Java 8 build 91, instead of build 92. </p>

<p>And it worked. However I still do not know if it was something wrong with my CUDA installation, or if it was the JDK.</p>

<p>But if anyone have similar problems, please give it a try. </p>
