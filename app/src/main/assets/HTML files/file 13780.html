<p>It looks like Feedzirra is using sax-machine for xml parsing which is based on Nokogiri, so its not likely you gaining that much performance gain using it instead of pure nokogiri approach. Where it could be helpful is working with the host it self. you can fairly easy check the headers and not pull the file over and over again if there were no change in it</p>

<p>Most likely you are getting the empty response because it times out. </p>
