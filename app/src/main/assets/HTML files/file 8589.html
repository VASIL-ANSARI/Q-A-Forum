<p>You might want to look at <a href="http://dozer.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Dozer</a>, a bean mapper that uses reflection to map beans based on field names. It gives you some protection against changes because you can always specify mappings manually if one class changes but you want to keep the mapped class the same.</p>
