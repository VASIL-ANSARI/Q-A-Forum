<p>I get the feeling that this question is designed with the expectation that you would initially instinctively do it the way you have. However, I believe there's a slightly different approach that would be faster.</p>

<p>You can produce all the numbers that contain the number 13 yourself, without having to loop through all the numbers in between. For example:</p>

<p>2 digits:
13</p>

<p>3 digits position 1:
113
213
313 etc.</p>

<p>3 digits position 2: 131
132
133 etc.</p>

<p>Therefore, you don't have to check all the number from 0 to n*9. You simply count all the numbers with 13 in them until the length is larger than N.</p>

<p>This may not be the fastest solution (in fact I'd be surprised if this couldn't be solved efficiently by using some mathematics trickery) but I believe it will be more efficient than the approach you have currently taken.</p>
