<p>PHP can't determine the inbound links of a page through some trivial action.  You either have to monitor all incoming visitors and check what their referrer is, or parse the entire internet for links that point to that site.  The first method will miss links not getting used, and the second method is best left to Google.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the outbound links from a site is doable.  You can read in a page and analyze the text for links with a regular expression, counting up the total.</p>
