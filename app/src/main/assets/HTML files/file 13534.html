<p>You'll need to find an appropriate layout, and FlowLayout probably isn't the way to go.</p>

<p>I had pretty good luck with GridBayLayout for this kind of thing.</p>

<p>But I also ended up writing my own layout manager for one unique task I encountered.  Wasn't particularly hard.</p>

<p>And in fact, just plain ol' GridLayout would work if ALL you need are buttons in a grid.  Would be easier, too.</p>
