<p>Assuming <code>time</code> is in a time format, then the following should do what you want:</p>

<pre><code>select date, maketime(hour(time), 10 * floor(minute(time)/10), 0) as time,
       avg(value)
from rawdata 
group by date,  maketime(hour(time), 10 * floor(minute(time)/10), 0)
order by date, time;
</code></pre>
