<p>Which div?</p>

<p><code>leads-wrap</code> won't centre because it is an <code>inline-block</code> not a <code>block</code>, so it is influenced by the <code>text-align</code> property of its containing block.</p>

<p><code>leads-ticker-wrap</code> and <code>leads-total</code> won't centre because (a) they are floating left and (b) you haven't set auto margins on them.</p>
