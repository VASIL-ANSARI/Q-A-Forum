<p>Is it POST or GET?</p>

  <p>Why Ajax request, using the GET method, cannot be cached in Opera?
  Please look at this small test:</p>
  
  <p><a href="http://www.karapuz.by/media/js/ajax-GET-caching-test.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.karapuz.by/media/js/ajax-GET-caching-test.html</a></p>
  
  <p>It seems that Opera (mine is 10.10), in contrast to IE, FF, GC, and
  Safari, is not caching the ajax response, even if it is explicitly
  told to do that. Any ideas?</p>

<p>And the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It now seems that the problem is in the jQuery library.</p>
  
  <p>I made another test
  <a href="http://www.karapuz.by/media/js/ajax-GET-caching-test2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.karapuz.by/media/js/ajax-GET-caching-test2.html</a> , it uses
  more low level XHR object, not the jQuery's "ajax" as it was in the
  first test. And now Opera is fine!</p>
