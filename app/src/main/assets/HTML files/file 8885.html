<p>I'm not sure about Sass (although I'd recommend using scss over sass files) - but with Haml, all you need to do is have the haml gem listed in your Gemfile, and have <code>haml</code> instead of <code>erb</code> in your view file names. For example: <code>index.html.haml</code> - and that should just work.</p>
