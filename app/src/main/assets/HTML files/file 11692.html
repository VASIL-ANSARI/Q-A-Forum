<p>1.)You have used apple reachability class,to check the network status,You can use that there is no issue with that,your app won't get rejected due to this.</p>

<p>2.)You have used BSForwardGeocoder for geocoding,I think there are no private api calls in this,but do check that is there any private api call.if there would be no Private api call.
There is no issue.So your app won't be rejected.</p>

<p>3.)You are using Views and showing your own arrows to pop and push,but you are not using any navigation controller.Thats fine,thats your own way to handle the views.That won't reject your app.</p>

<p>So cheers and go ahead,but do check that you dont use any private api call in your app.
as that is the maximum reason.</p>

<p>Hope This Will Help You........!</p>
