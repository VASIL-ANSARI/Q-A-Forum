<blockquote>
  <p>A long, as far as I know, is 8 bytes. Is this correct?</p>

<p>No, this is not correct.  The C and C++ specifications only state that long must be greater than or equal to 32 bits.  <code>int</code> can be smaller, but on many platforms, in C and C++, <code>long</code> and <code>int</code> are both 32 bits.</p>

<p>This is a very good reason to <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/integer">prefer fixed width integer types</a> such as <code>int64_t</code> if they're available to you and you're using C99 or a framework which provides you an equivelent type.</p>
