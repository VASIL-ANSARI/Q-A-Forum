<p>When you prefix an attribute with a double underscore, Python uses '<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables-and-class-local-references" rel="nofollow">name mangling</a>' to access the attribute.  This means it will store the attribute on the class in the format: <code>_&lt;class name&gt;__&lt;attr name&gt;</code>.  In your example <code>self.__label</code> will be stored as <code>self._B__label</code> because you set it in the B class method. But when you try to use the attribute in the A class it converts <code>self.__label</code> into <code>self._A__label</code> and finds that it isn't set.</p>

<p>The use case for double underscores is when you want to ensure that your variable is always on your class even if a subclass derives your class. Because what could happen is that the subclass redefines your variable to something else, using double underscored variables makes this that much harder.</p>
