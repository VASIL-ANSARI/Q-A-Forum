<p>Create the index on <code>b (id_anunciante)</code> for this to work faster.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>You don't need the <code>OUTER JOINs</code> here.</p>

<p>Rewrite your query as this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  a.*, c.id
FROM    a
JOIN    b
ON      b.id_anunciante = a.id
JOIN    c
ON      c.id = b.id_rubro
WHERE   a.id = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT  a.*, 1
FROM    a
WHERE   EXISTS
        (
        SELECT  NULL
        FROM    c
        JOIN    b
        ON      b.id_rubro = c.id
        WHERE   c.id = 1
                AND b.id_anunciante = a.id
        )
</code></pre>
