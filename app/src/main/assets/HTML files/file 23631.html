<p>In Meteor, scripts placed in the <code>/lib</code> directory load before everything else. I'd recommend grabbing the latest version of Three.js from <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/zipball/master" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/zipball/master</a> and dropping it in there.</p>
