<p>Not sure exactly what you're asking, but I THINK you're having problems reading PEM files.  The JPA doesn't directly support the PEM format.  You have two options, either convert them to DER encoded files (you can use openSSL to do this) or the you can use the bouncy castle API to read (or write) PEM files.  the class you'd be interested in is called PEMReader (and maybe also PEMWriter).  <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/docs/pkixdocs1.4/org/bouncycastle/openssl/PEMReader.html">Here is the Javadoc</a> on the bouncycastle website.</p>
