<p>I don't quite understand your problem, maybe you want the icon to appear right of the boxes?</p>

<p>If this is the case, maybe you should give those  containing the icon a float:right property, instead of the left one they have now.</p>

<p>Something like this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/t56xX/5/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/t56xX/5/</a>.</p>

<pre><code>th span span {
    float:right!important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The !important is needed because as of now, the float:left property is inline in the s, so it won't get overwritten by the new one without using the important keyword.</p>
