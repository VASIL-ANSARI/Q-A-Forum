<p>The behavior you're talking about is implemented as Rack middleware, which processes the incoming request before it gets to your controllers.</p>

<p>This middleware is what acts on the list of parsers enabled for different mime types.  You can patch this behavior by re-opening it if you want to add custom rules for when different parameter parsing logic is used on a given request.</p>
