<p>From what we can see in the question, it seems that you are attempting to create an instance of your form, but then calling the <code>Show</code> method on a different instance, <code>frm_cart</code>. </p>

<p>That in itself is surely wrong. Quite likely <code>frm_cart</code> is not initialised, hence the segmentation fault. </p>

<p>But the creation is also broken because you called the constructor on an instance rather than a class. The oldest mistake in the book. </p>

<p>You then call <code>Free</code> immediately after <code>Show</code> which also rather negates the utility of your code. </p>

<p>I expect that you should remove the <code>frm_cart</code> variable and write:</p>

<pre><code>Tfrm_cart.Create(...).Show;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, swallowing exceptions is bad at the best of times, but is an gross error in a constructor. When a constructor raises an exception that means that the object has not been properly created. Attempting to continue as if the problem never happened is just postponing the pain. </p>
