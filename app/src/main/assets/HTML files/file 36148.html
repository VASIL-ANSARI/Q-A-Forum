<p>My guess is that you added the TestFairy dependency in the repository closure of you app only.  There should be another repositories block for the buildscript, in my project it is in the root gradle file and looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:0.12.+'

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>This lets you define repositories for the build dependencies and app dependencies apart from each other.</p>
