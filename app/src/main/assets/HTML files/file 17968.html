<p><code>group</code> is a keyword (part of <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/group-by-functions.html">GROUP BY</a>) in MySQL, you need to surround it with backticks to show MySQL that you want it interpreted as a table name:</p>

<pre><code>RENAME TABLE `group` TO `member`;
</code></pre>
