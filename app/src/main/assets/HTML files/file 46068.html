<p>Decompiling is a non-trivial task, and the code you might get will be far from what you put in. It also cannot recreate project files and structure etc. The time you will need to make a usable thing out of it (if even possible) will be tremendous.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to learn your lesson (i.e. backup, or even better with a remote git repository) and start over again. You won't be starting from scratch in your head, and the rewrite should get built quicker and cleaner.</p>
