  <p>Is that ok? I can't tell if its consistently working. What is considered the category name? Is it "Additions", or the combination, "ListItem+Additions".</p>

<p>Yes, it is ok.</p>

<p>Both the categories have same name: <code>Additions</code>, but one is a <code>List</code>'s category, and other is a <code>ListItem</code>'s category. So there is no clashing of names. This is true even if you would have put both the categories declarations in same file.</p>
