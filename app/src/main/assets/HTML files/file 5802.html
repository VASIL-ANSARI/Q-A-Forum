<p>If I understand the question correctly, I'd go with the Table-Valued Parameter. Otherwise I'd think the list of parameters would quickly become unmanageable. You wouldn't want to end up with something like:</p>

<pre><code>insert into YourTable
    (col1, col2, ..., colN)
    values
    (@Row1Col1, @Row1Col2, ..., @Row1ColN),
    (@Row2Col1, @Row2Col2, ..., @Row2ColN),
    ...
    (@RowMCol1, @RowMCol2, ..., @RowMColN)
</code></pre>
