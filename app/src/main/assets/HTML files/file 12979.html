<p>I executed your code and I confirm it's working fine.</p>

<p>Make sure <strong>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</strong> points <strong>exactly</strong> to your keystore file.
I put my keystore file at the root of my project.
Perhaps try absolute path to your keystore.</p>

<p>Make sure the -D parameters are set as JVM params, not Program options (in your IDE).</p>

<p>Good luck, you're about to make it work.</p>
