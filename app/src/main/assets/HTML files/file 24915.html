<p>Its more like caching images, common database querys</p>

<p>For instance say your site has a lot of articles and each article has categories. And say you dont change categories very often, then using a cached result of a query of the categories table is preferable then doing the query. this is a simplified example.</p>

<p>Another example is with images, if your site needs like thumbnailed version of user photos that they have uploaded instead of having php use the GD library to rescale the image and etc just save a version of that thumbnail version and use it instead of running through the GD code again.</p>
