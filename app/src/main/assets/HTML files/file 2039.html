<p>It might be that you need to register the COM DLL using</p>

<pre><code>regsvr32.exe /i dllname
</code></pre>

<p>Try that first perhaps and see if that makes a difference.</p>

<p>EDIT: Don't know if you use this, but COM Explorer might be able to help you too. Try <a href="http://com-explorer.en.softonic.com/" rel="nofollow">the trial</a> version to if it helps you with this problem.</p>

<p>EDIT: I've been trying to find out more about the error code, and the best I could find is <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/201234" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which clarifies that it must be the DLL which is not registered.</p>
