<p>You do not need the <code>if valid?</code> declaration there because after_create gets called after the record has already been validated (and created).</p>

<p>What do you mean your application is telling you otherwise?</p>

<p>Also, for the callback methods, you should use something like:</p>

<pre><code>after_create :call_my_method

private

def call_my_method
  # Do cool stuff
end
</code></pre>
