<p>Did you try to delay that call to "document-ready"? Maybe your DOM isn't fast enough or in your code you are having the same IDs ;)</p>

<pre><code>    $(function(){
            tinyMCE.init({ mode: "none", theme: "simple" });
            tinymce.execCommand("mceAddControl", false, "myTextArea");
    });
</code></pre>
