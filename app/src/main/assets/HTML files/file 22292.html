<p>You can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history" rel="nofollow"><code>pushState</code></a> to achieve this.</p>

<p><a href="http://robin.castlin.se/galleri" rel="nofollow">Here's an example of my own site</a> using it for browsing given images; no reloading occurs. I've also added support for each gallery image and it's loaded url, so that you can share the url with anyone without problems. The fallback is that if <code>pushState</code> is not supported, you will simply browse as you always do.</p>
