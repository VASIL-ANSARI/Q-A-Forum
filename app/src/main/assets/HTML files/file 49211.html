<p>Sounds like <code>memcache</code>  is what your looking for. It can hold variables like PHP objects or base types and give them as well an expiration date. Just google for the memcached extensions for PHP and look over here: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.memcache.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/class.memcache.php</a>.</p>

<p>Furhermore, it can be accessed via TCP and has some failover capabilities. AWS is offering a service compatible with the memcache API calling it <code>ElastiCache</code></p>
