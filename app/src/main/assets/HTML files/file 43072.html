<p>First of all, if you are beginning with Rails I would recommend not to go against the conventions that the framework already puts up for you.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you want the pages which just have no DB connectivity and just for static UI, you can do something like this:</p>

<p><code>$ rails generate controller Pages home contact somepage</code>
which will create a <code>pages</code> folder inside <code>/app/views/</code> of your project with .erb templates for the home, contact, somepage </p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
