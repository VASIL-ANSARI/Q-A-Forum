<p>PFFiles aren't in the same class hierarchy as NSURL, so they can't be cast to NSURL. Instead, you need to get get the url string from the url property of the PFFile:</p>

<pre><code>func grabSong () {
    var songQuery = PFQuery(className: "Songs")
    songQuery.getObjectInBackgroundWithId(iDArray[SelectedSongNumber], block: {
        (object: PFObject?, error : NSError?) -&gt; Void in

        if let audioFile = object?["SongFile"] as? PFFile {
            let audioFileUrlString: String = audioFile.url  //This might be actually be a String?, I don't remember.
            let audioFileUrl = NSURL(string: audioFileUrlString)!
            AudioPlayer = AVPlayer(URL: audioFileUrl)
            AudioPlayer.play()
        }
    })
}
</code></pre>
