<p>To use sounds in your app, you will either need to create these sounds yourself, or purchase sound effects from a number of different websites. Being that your application is sandboxed, you cannot access the SMS send / receive sounds <em>(for example)</em>. I also doubt Apple will allow you to "steal" their sounds for use inside your application. Try searching for free sound effects, <a href="http://www.grsites.com/archive/sounds/" rel="nofollow">One Example</a>.</p>
