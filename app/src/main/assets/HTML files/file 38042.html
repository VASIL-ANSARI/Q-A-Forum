<p>If you refresh the page it will need to reconnect, i dont think there is a way around it.</p>

<p>I would recommend not using page-load to navigate between pages, but to build a single page application.
If you cannot do that in any way, maybe you can have your application in a frame, and the outer html will have the socket. that could work.</p>
