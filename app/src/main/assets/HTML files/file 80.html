<p>OK, are you sure that is wise? I am picturing two scenarios here:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a default button on the form, which is "clicked" when enter is pushed".</li>
<li>There is no default button, and you want the user to have to press enter, regardless.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these raise the same questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any validation that is taking place on the text?</li>
<li>Why not create a user control to encapsulate this logic?</li>
<li>If you know the enter button is being pushed and consumed fine, how are you having problems with <em>TextBoxName.Text = string.Empty</em> ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, as a polite note, can you please try and break up your question a bit? One big block is a bit of a pain to read..</p>
