<p>You might want to do this in two parts - your API should specify that it works with only integers - perhaps the method which processes the grades will accept Integer arguments only. The parser of the String can specify in its Javadocs what it does when the argument passed to it is not an integer. You client should also validate that the input is an integer (maybe within the valid range). If the user input is incorrect, then maybe it can display a usage manual.</p>
