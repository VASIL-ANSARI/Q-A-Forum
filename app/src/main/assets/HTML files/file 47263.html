<p>It's hard to figure out exactly what's wrong from your code. You can try to take some steps to debug that portion of it its causing the problem.
What I would do is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start by removing all complex features. Simply draw an plain triangle with default shaders. If you don't see it either the setup is wrong or the camera doesn't look at where you are drawing the triangle.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see a triangle try enabling your shader. If the triangle disappears then the problem in in the shader code.</p></li>
<li><p>If you still see the triangle try loading the object. Dump some data about it like the bounding box (min max values of X, Y, Z). It could be that the scale is off, or the origini is not centered.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you manage to figure out where the problem is you can update the question and get better answers to it (or ask another question).</p>
