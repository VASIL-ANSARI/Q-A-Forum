<p>It's implementation defined whether an implementation provides relaxed pointer safety (what you seem to want) or strict pointer safety (pointers remain valid only when <code>safely derived</code>). As you've implied, you can call <code>get_pointer_safety</code> to find out what the policy is, but the standard provides no way to specify/change the policy.</p>

<p>You may, however, be able to side-step this question. If you can make a call to <code>declare_reachable</code> (passing that pointer value) before you hide the pointer, it remains valid until a matching call to <code>undeclare_reachable</code> (and here "matching" means calls nest).</p>
