<p><em>Even though the question is about not using a library I 'am taking this opportunity to show how easy it is to use a library than the user thinks</em>. </p>

<p>Its better to use pre-built libraries and stop reinventing the wheel. You can use <strong>curlcpp library</strong>. Its a wrapper for libcurl. Using this library HTTP requests can be made easily. Learning curve is also less and it provides C++ style access which makes it more comfortable to work with.</p>

<p><strong>The following code is taken from their gitHub page - <a href="https://github.com/JosephP91/curlcpp" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/JosephP91/curlcpp</a></strong></p>

<p>It makes a simple <strong>GET request</strong> to Google and retrieves the HTML response. You can use this example to hit apis too.</p>

<pre><code>#include "curl_easy.h"
#include "curl_exception.h"

using curl::curl_easy;
using curl::curl_easy_exception;
using curl::curlcpp_traceback;

int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
    curl_easy easy;
    // Add some option to the curl_easy object.
    easy.add&lt;CURLOPT_URL&gt;("http://www.google.it");
    easy.add&lt;CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION&gt;(1L);
    try {
        // Execute the request.
        easy.perform();
    } catch (curl_easy_exception error) {
        // If you want to get the entire error stack we can do:
        curlcpp_traceback errors = error.get_traceback();
        // Otherwise we could print the stack like this:
        error.print_traceback();
        // Note that the printing the stack will erase it
    }
    return 0;
}
