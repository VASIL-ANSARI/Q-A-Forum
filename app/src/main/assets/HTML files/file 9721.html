<p>the jQuery object is an object which has </p>

<ul>
<li>a length property</li>
<li>numeric properties which reference the items from the select (0,1,2,3...)</li>
<li>bindings to jQuery functions</li>
<li>additional jQuery properties</li>
</ul>

<p>The length and numeric properties allow the object to respond like an array.  You can run it in a <code>for</code> loop or use functions like <code>map</code> or <code>each</code> on it.</p>

<p>I would recommend using your browser's debugger or Firebug and inspect a jQuery object.  That will teach you a lot about how it is structured.</p>
