<p>If the maximum values aren't too large to store the complete set of possibilities in memory (and it won't take forever to generate them), <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow"><code>random.sample</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.product</code></a> can be used effectively here:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
import random

def make_random_cities(num_cities, max_x, max_y):
    return random.sample(list(itertools.product(range(max_x+1), range(max_y+1))), num_cities)
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>product</code> of the inputs gets too large though, you could easily exceed main memory; in that case, your approach of looping until you get sufficient unique results is probably the best approach.</p>

<p>You could do samples of each <code>range</code> independently and then combine them together, but that would add uniqueness constraints to each axis, which I'm guessing you don't want.</p>

<p>For this specific case (unique numbers following a predictable pattern), you could use a trick to make this memory friendly while still avoiding the issue of arbitrarily long loops. Instead of taking the <code>product</code> of two <code>range</code>s, you'd generate a single <code>range</code> (or in Py2, <code>xrange</code>) that encodes both unique values from the <code>product</code> in a single value:</p>

<pre><code>def make_random_cities(num_cities, max_x, max_y):
    max_xy = (max_x+1) * (max_y+1)
    xys = random.sample(range(max_xy), num_cities)
    return [divmod(xy, max_y+1) for xy in xys]
</code></pre>

<p>This means you have no large intermediate data to store (because Py3 <code>range</code>/Py2 <code>xrange</code> are "virtual" sequences, with storage requirements unrelated to the range of values they represent, and <code>random.sample</code> produces samples without needing to read all the values of the underlying sequence).</p>
