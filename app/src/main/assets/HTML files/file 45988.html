<p>why not make use of the cascading part of cascading style sheet?</p>

<pre><code>h1{
    text-decoration:none;
}

.underline h1{
    text-decoration:underline;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Applying the class "underline" to any parent element would do the same thing that it looks like you're trying to describe above.</p>

<p>You could add or remove the underline class with js, or set it statically on elements you want affected.</p>
