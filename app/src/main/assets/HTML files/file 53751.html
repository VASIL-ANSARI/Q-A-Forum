<p>There is currently not a mechanism to retrieve the refresh token within Mobile Services. This is something about to be enabled for App Service Mobile Apps, but as of right now it is not available through the basic LoginAsync(âaadâ) flow. This article talks about <a href="http://www.hasaltaiar.com.au/how-to-best-handle-aad-access-tokens-in-native-mobile-apps/" rel="nofollow">How to Best handle AAD access tokens in native mobile apps</a> and would do help.</p>

<p>If you need a better refresh support, and if you are using the .NET backend, then you can certainly use <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-ios-adal-sso-authentication/" rel="nofollow">ADAL</a>. It has an overload for LoginAsync which additionally accepts the access token (as part of a JSON object, under the key âaccess_tokenâ). This allows the client to handle the refresh action.</p>
