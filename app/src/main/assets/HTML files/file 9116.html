<p>No, there isn't a better way - when you invoke a multicast delegate, the result is just the result of the final delegate. That's what it's like at the framework level.</p>

<p>Multicast delegates are <em>mostly</em> useful for event handlers. It's relatively rare to use them for functions like this.</p>

<p>Note that <code>Delegate</code> itself isn't generic either - only <em>individual</em> delegate types can be generic, because the arity of the type can change based on the type. (e.g. <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Action&lt;T1, T2&gt;</code> are unrelated types really.)</p>
