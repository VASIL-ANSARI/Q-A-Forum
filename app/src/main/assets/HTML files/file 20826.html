<p>You haven't said which disk you'd like to write to. You could conceivably write the output to a folder on the service, and expose the folder through a file share. Your service would then return the path to the (temporary) file on the server back to the client.</p>

<p>I presume you're talking about a legacy ASMX service? They have problems with the serialization creating multiple copies of the request and response messages. Try using "Add Service Reference" on the client instead of "Add Web Reference".</p>
