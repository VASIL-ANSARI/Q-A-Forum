<p>Depending on your version of <code>react-router</code> how to exactly access and change this might differ but the gist should be the same.</p>

<p>You're currently using a hash history. This means your url's will be built using a hash. An other option is the use the browser history. This enables the clean urls <code>www.example.com/about</code>.</p>

<pre><code>import { browserHistory } from 'react-router'
render((
  &lt;Router history={browserHistory }&gt;
    &lt;Route path="/" component={Layout}&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/about" component={About}/&gt;
    &lt;/Route&gt;
  &lt;/Router&gt;
  ),
</code></pre>

<p>Ps. If above doesn't work please consult the docs for react-router and the version you are using. They've had some API changes and package changes in this department (the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/history" rel="nofollow">history</a> package is effectively powering this behavior).</p>
