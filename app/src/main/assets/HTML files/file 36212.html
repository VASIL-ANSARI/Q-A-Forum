<p>I'm presuming you mean epsilon in the sense of the error in the value. I.e <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon">this</a>.</p>

<p>If so then in Java it's referred to as ULP (unit in last place). You can find it by using the <code>java.lang.Math</code> package and the <code>Math.ulp()</code> method. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#ulp(double)">javadocs here</a>.</p>

<p>The value isn't stored as a static member because it will be different depending on the double you are concerned with.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> By the OP's definition of epsilon now in the question, the ULP of a double of value 1.0 is 2.220446049250313E-16 expressed as a double. (I.e. the return value of <code>Math.ulp(1.0)</code>.)</p>
