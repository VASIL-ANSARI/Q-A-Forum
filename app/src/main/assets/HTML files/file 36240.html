<p>You can get all the values in a <em>list</em> on each row.  Perhaps this is what you want:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    t1.sam_time, 
    t2.hos_id,
    (select group_concat(t1.STAT_VALUE) from table_1 t1 where t1.ID = 6 ) as col_1,
    (select group_concat(t1.STAT_VALUE) from table_1 t1 where t1.ID = 24 ) as col_2,
    (select group_concat(t1.STAT_VALUE) from table_1 t1 where t1.ID = 125 ) as col_3,
    (select group_concat(t1.STAT_VALUE) from table_1 t1 where t1.ID = 143 ) as col_4
from table_1 t1 join
     table_2 t2
     on t1.entity = t2.hos_id;
</code></pre>

<p>You should also learn to use proper <code>join</code> syntax, which uses the <code>join</code> keyword and the <code>on</code> keyword for the conditions between tables.</p>
