<p>Okay, it's gotten a lot more clear than this. My problem initially was that I didn't understand how rails handled forms, and if it could receive information on fields that weren't connected to the database. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html</a> helped a lot, so here's how my controller looks like now : </p>

<pre><code>class FindNumbersController &lt; ApplicationController

    def new
        @user = current_user
    end

    def create
        @user = current_user
        render 'find_numbers/show'
    end

    def show
        @user = current_user
        client = Twilio::REST::Client.new(@user.twilio_account_sid, @user.twilio_auth_token)

        search_params = {}
          %w[in_postal_code near_number contains].each do |p|
            search_params[p] = params[p] unless params[p].nil? || params[p].empty?
        end

        local_numbers = client.account.available_phone_numbers.get('US').local
        @numbers = local_numbers.list(search_params)    


    end

end
</code></pre>

<p>I still have a problem with the show action, but it's outside of the scope of this question. </p>
