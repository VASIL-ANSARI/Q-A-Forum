<p>The method thread.join <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/join.html" rel="nofollow">allows</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>one thread to wait for the completion of another. If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing,</p>

<pre><code>t.join();
</code></pre>
  
  <p>causes the current thread to pause execution until t's thread terminates. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not related to synchronization, but only to sequence of steps. </p>

<p>If you have <strong>only two threads</strong> and you wait the reader thread waits the end of writer thread with method join, this can be used as a mechanism of synchronization, but it is not.</p>
