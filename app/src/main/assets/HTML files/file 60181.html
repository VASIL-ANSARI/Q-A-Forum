<p><code>[   ]</code> is always a character class, which means that at one position, you can match <em>one</em> character. The "negation" in your example is in fact probably not even doing what you thing it does. </p>

<p>What you probably want to match is <em>either the beginning of a string, the end of a sentence, or a dash with two spaces around</em>, so just replace it with <code>(^|[.?!]| - )\b((why|how)...etc)</code>. You will need some post processing of the result, as JavaScript does not support look-behind assertions as far as I know.</p>
