<p>There are various libraries you <em>can</em> use, including <a href="http://commons.apache.org/codec/" rel="nofollow">Apache Commons Codec</a>. Personally though, I prefer the API of this <a href="http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/base64/" rel="nofollow">public domain implementation</a>, which is also pretty speed (which I guess may be important on a mobile device). That's also a single Java file, which makes it pretty easy to integrate. The same page lists some other options too.</p>

<p>EDIT: Of course, if you can use the built-in one, that's even easier still, in terms of integration :)</p>
