<p>See <strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6337021/871050">this</a></strong> answer for how to use <strong>bcrypt</strong> to hash passwords. It's more secure than yours because it allows for deliberate slow-down of the hashing algorithm (so if anyone tries to brute force, they would be limited to 1M iterations per second or so, instead of 1B, which is the difference between hours and years).</p>

<p>Also, (unrelated to security), you should be using PDO's named placeholders, instead of the unnamed ones (<code>:placeholder</code> and not <code>?</code>).</p>

<p>Moreover, you might want to build a complete <code>User</code> object and return that, it will be easier to work with (assuming you have one, which you should!).</p>
