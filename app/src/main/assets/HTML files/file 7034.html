<p><code>-setValuesForKeysWithDictionary:</code> isn't smart enough to recognize that the value of the key "bar" should be an instance of <code>Bar</code>. It's assigning an <code>NSDictionary</code> to that property. Thus, when you ask for the property "name," the dictionary can't field that request. However, an <code>NSDictionary</code> does know how to handle <code>-valueForKey:</code>, so it happens to work in that case.</p>

<p>So you need to use something smarter than <code>-setValuesForKeysWithDictionary:</code> to populate your objects.</p>
