<p>I had a similar issue, for me it turned out to be a problem with ruby. I have installed a different version of Ruby with RVM and installed the rails gem with this other version of Ruby.</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 2.2.2

gem install rails
</code></pre>

<p>I would not recommend this solution as a sustainable one, but I couldn't solve this in a different way and at least it will get you going again.</p>
