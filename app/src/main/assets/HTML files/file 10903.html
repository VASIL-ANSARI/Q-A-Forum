<p>If you want to access the config options that were passed to a particular Component, then you can access these from <code>this.initialConfig</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to get a list of all possible config options that could be passed, then this can't really be done from within ExtJS framework itself. Basically you are limited by the fact that not all config options are listed in prototype - many which default to undefined are just checked for programmatically.</p>

<p>You can extract this data from Ext JS doc-comments using <a href="https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck" rel="nofollow">jsduck</a> to export the docs in JSON format, from which you can filter out the config options.</p>
