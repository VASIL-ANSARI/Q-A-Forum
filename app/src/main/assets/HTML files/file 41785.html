<p>I don't have an explicit answer for you because there are quite a few things that can go wrong with sqlite. </p>

<p>The main thing I can see is that you are not initialising <code>databasePath</code>. This needs to be a path to the .db file e.g. ~/Desktop/myDatabase.db.</p>

<p>1) I assume that you only want to process the <code>statement</code> once and you are actually inserting it 3 times. you need to check the value of <code>rc</code> i.e. only call <code>sqlite3_step</code> once and then put <code>rc</code> into the <code>if</code> statements : </p>

<pre><code>int rc =sqlite3_step(statement);
        if(rc == SQLITE_DONE){
            NSLog(@"success");
            NSLog(@"tried to enter %@" , insertSQL);
        } else {
            NSLog(@"%@", insertSQL);
            NSLog(@"Error %s while preparing statement", sqlite3_errmsg(_gameFile));
        }
</code></pre>

<p>2) Check the return value of <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> for success.</p>

<p>3) You neeeeed to normalise your statements (<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html" rel="nofollow">documentation for sqlite3_bind</a>), otherwise you will run into problems when your users enter wildcard characters e.g. "?" or statements like "DROP"</p>

<p>4) Have you considered using Core Data. It is sooo much easier (although not ideal for everyone's needs I know).</p>
