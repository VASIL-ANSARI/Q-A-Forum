<p>You must redirect the output </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a program is started with this function, in order for it to continue running in the background, the output of the program must be redirected to a file or another output stream. Failing to do so will cause PHP to hang until the execution of the program ends.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php</a></p>

<p>So on UNIX it would be eg</p>

<pre><code>shell_exec($command . ' 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; out.log');
</code></pre>
