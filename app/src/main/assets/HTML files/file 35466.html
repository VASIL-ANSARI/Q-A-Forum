  <p>In my application I am using ActionBarSherlock with a split ActionBar, so I cannot use the built in MediaRouteActionProvider (at least not to my knowledge) that is in the Google Cast SDK.</p>

<p><code>MediaRouteActionProvider</code> is in the <code>appcompat_v7</code> library project, not the Cast SDK.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-mediarouter" rel="nofollow">I forked <code>MediaRouteActionProvider</code> and created a version that works using the native API Level 11 action bar</a>. You could do the same thing to create one that works with ActionBarSherlock, at least in principle. I know of no reason why this would not work -- if it works with the native action bar and the <code>appcompat_v7</code> backport, it should work for ActionBarSherlock.</p>
