<p>Problem is you are adding a new <code>JList</code> on <code>actionPerformed()</code> and you have not added the list to the container.</p>

<pre><code>lchannels = new JList(vt);   
</code></pre>

<p>Well you don't need to add a new list on selection, all you need is to update the list model itself on selection.</p>
