<p>When you define a plugin as <code>$.fn[pluginName]</code>, that makes it a method on jQuery objects. If you want it to be an ordinary function rather than a method, you should define <code>$[pluginName]</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$[pluginName] = function (options) {
    ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>However, this doesn't make sense for a plugin that does <code>this.each(...)</code> -- if you don't apply it to any elements, what do you expect <code>this</code> to refer to?</p>
