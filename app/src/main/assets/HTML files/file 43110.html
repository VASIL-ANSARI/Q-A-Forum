<p>It seems likely that Doctrine is still thinking that the Ekino 'User' is still an entity, rather than using yours exclusively.  I'm not familiar with Ekino. If it uses Annotation based configuration, you might have to create your own AnnotationDriver subclass and have it filter out the Ekino classes you don't want.</p>

<p>It's actually quite fun to play around in the lower-level code of the ClassMetadata, but do so at your own peril.</p>
