<p>This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing">slicing</a>. <code>A a = B();</code> creates a copy which is of type <code>A</code>. All information about its source being <code>B</code> is forgotten. The only way to exploit polymorphism is through references or pointers (or mechanisms that allow compile-time polymorphism, like templates or function overloading for example).</p>
