<p>I just run into exactly the same problem yesterday. And I think I found answer in the javadoc of Service.stopSelfResult(int startId) method.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you may end up processing IDs out of order (such as by dispatching them on separate threads), then you are responsible for stopping them in the same order you received them.</p>
</blockquote>
