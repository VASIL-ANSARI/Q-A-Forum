<p>Try it and see :) It should be OK with just UIViews but there might be an issue on older phones with framerate.</p>

<p>Failing that, openGL would be the way forward - have a look at cocos2d (http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/) which makes accelerated 2d work pretty easy.</p>

<p>Though if you really want the perspective effect, you will probably have to go all the way into openGL proper.</p>
