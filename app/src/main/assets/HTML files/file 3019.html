<p>I'm a little confused, but I think the easiest way to do this will be in Interface Builder.  I'm assuming you have used the template for the view based application available in xcode.  Open MainWindow.xib in interface builder, and drag a new UIScrollView into the window, resizing and positioning it as you please.  Then add a UIView to the new UIScrollView by dragging one on top.  Then, add your text and images to this UIView.  If you want to access these objects programatically, you will have to create an IBOutlet instance of the specific object, and then synthesize it in your .m file.</p>
