<p>The ImageView can be moved/edited as soon as the Layout has been loaded. You can add a listener to the ImageView in order to check when it's loaded and then move/edit the View. To do this you need to add a GlobalLayoutListener to the ViewTreeObserver of a View. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>imageView.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(new OnGlobalLayoutListener() {
        @Override
        public void onGlobalLayout() {
            //do something with the ImageView like move it.
         }
    });
</code></pre>
