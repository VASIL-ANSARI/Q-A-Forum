<p>You may use <code>outfile</code> and afterwards ftp the file to the local host or pass the result of a normal query to some sed/awk to convert it to csv?</p>

<p>What I found is:
<code>mysql -umysqlusername -pmysqlpass databasename -B -e "select * from \`tablename\`;" | sed 's/\t/","/g;s/^/"/;s/$/"/;s/\n//g' &gt; mysql_exported_table.csv</code> </p>

<p>Besides that, we're going with the (s)ftp solution.</p>
