<p>Your info.plist seems to be formatted incorrectly</p>

<p>Ensure that the url scheme is nested under an item (an array to be exact) called "URL Schemes" </p>

<p>This array should contain all possible URL Schemes that can launch your app</p>

<p>See the attached image for a better explanation of URL Schemes</p>

<p>Also, the "URL identifier" should be your bundle identifier: ex. com.mycompany.myapp
This should match the identifier you provide on your provisioning profiles</p>

<p>hope this helps!</p>
