<p>I like <a href="http://www.mbunit.com/" rel="nofollow">MbUnit</a>, er, <a href="http://www.gallio.org/" rel="nofollow">Gallio</a>.  Most importantly to me is having good tools support inside Visual Studio.  For that I use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html" rel="nofollow">Resharper</a>, which has an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mbunit-resharper/" rel="nofollow">MbUnit test runner</a>.  A lot of folks seem to like <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/overview.aspx" rel="nofollow">TestDriven.NET</a> as their test runner as well.</p>
