<p>I noticed a few things and have a few suggestions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Can I ask why you have 3 segues to the same view? That may have something to do with it as it is trying to navigate which segue is the one required as there are multiple connections to the same cell by the image you've attached.</p></li>
<li><p>Have you tried removing all segues and then reconnecting just one at a time and testing whether it works each time? </p></li>
<li><p>I also see that the segue connected and highlighted is called <code>showRouteDetail</code> yet your <code>prepareForSegue</code> code has <code>showTourDetail</code>. Change that to suit the code also. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>My suggestion would be have a separate segue and view for <code>New Route</code>. This will help with not only saving data cleanly but displaying existing data in it's own view. I see often on <code>Stackoverflow</code> people who are double saving the same data, or saving it two times and one comes up blank when they only mean to save once. Also, are you sure your segue is connected to the cell and not the UIImage or labels? </p>

<p>Finally replace some code with this:</p>

<pre><code>NSIndexPath * indexPath = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow];

TourDetailTableViewController * tourDetailViewController= segue.destinationViewController;

//assuming you are using fetchedResultsController method to load your data in table view
SkiTour *selectedTour = (SkiTour*) [[self fetchedResultsController] objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];

tourDetailViewController.tourID =selectedTour.objectID;
</code></pre>

<p>These are just some simple checks and changes. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE BASED ON NEW DETAILS</strong></p>

<p>If you have a button overlapping the <code>MapView</code> it would be better to programmatically swap views than to have a segue connected. To do this add this code to the correlating Button:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction) viewMapButton: (UIButton *)sender{

    //create access to the next view
    NSString * storyboardName = @"Main";
    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:storyboardName bundle: nil];
    UIViewController * vc = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"ViewMap"];

    //this will perform a push segue so that navigation bar still exists and can respond
    [self.navigationController pushViewController: vc animated:YES];  

}
</code></pre>
