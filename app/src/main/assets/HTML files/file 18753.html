<p>You seem to be missing an important point; the hardware you are connecting actually stays entirely remote from the iOS perspective - even if it was connected via TCP/IP via a local wifi hotspot.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSURLConnection_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">NSURLConnection</a>, that is an iOS system component that allows you to remotely connect and transmit data via TCP/IP in both directions. </p>

<p>Your first task will be finding a proper interface for your Python driven hardware. I would strongly suggest you to use some kind of an HTTP-interface.</p>
