<p>Andy,</p>

<p>I have replicated this exact functionality and have realized that the Validators must be set in order for the field to be treated, although I have noticed that the Boolean Filter would return 1 as a string and not true, and null for false but I will be diving deeper at a later time. Please try to set NotEmpty validators for the rest of the fields.</p>
