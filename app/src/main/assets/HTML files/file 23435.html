<p>Try 'DD-MON-YY' format to map to '28-MAY-13'</p>

<p>'MM' maps to the month number.</p>

<p>EDIT: SQL can figure out to use the correct format in to_date; it automatically converts 'DD-MM-YY' to 'DD-MON-YY' when it sees the input string is in '28-MAY-13' format. to_char does not make any assumptions, however; so it is trying to compare '28-05-13' to '28-MAY-13'</p>

<p>EDIT2: An added note is that DUAL can only ever return one row; so you could just do </p>

<pre><code> SELECT sysdate FROM DUAL
</code></pre>

<p>Dan Bracuk has some good points about date comparison; when possible keep them in date format. Use trunc(DateTime) if only the day matters and not the time; this is usually necessary if you use '=' but often not necessary if you do check for BETWEEN</p>
