<p>Normally the return type of an assignment operator is <code>Vector&amp;</code>, but <code>const Vector&amp;</code> is acceptable if you don't want people making funky assignment chains <code>(((v1 = v2) = v3) = v4)</code>. Move assignment and copy assignment are both "assignment". It would be unexpected for one assignment operator to have a different return type than the other, so whichever one you pick, you should stick with.</p>

<p>It would be VERY weird to return <code>Vector&amp;&amp;</code>. Just because you used the move assignment operator does not mean your object is magically an rvalue. You'd have to specifically cast it, and then it would be possible to accidentally move back out of that instance.</p>

<pre><code>void some_function(Vector);
Vector get_some_Vector();

Vector f;
some_function(f = get_some_Vector()); //oops f is empty now
</code></pre>
