<p>Put the EF model and its generated classes in a separate project, reference that project from the DAL project, and then you can choose what you expose from the <code>public class DataService</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, if you expose entities from your EF model, and DataService is a regular .NET class instead of a WCF service, then your client will also need to reference the EF project...</p>

<p>If you really want to hide the entities from the client, the client is not allowed to use them at all, and you'll have to provide other ways for the client to read/write data (such as DTO's that you create in a separate project or in the DAL project).</p>
