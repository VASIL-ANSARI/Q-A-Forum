<p>For plotting in Python, I'm a big fan of Matplotlib (<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/</a>) which is essentially a more user-friendly wrapper built on top of Pylab (<a href="http://www.scipy.org/PyLab" rel="nofollow">http://www.scipy.org/PyLab</a>).  It's really powerful and has a TONS of documentation and examples.  It doesn't sound like your charts are very complicated, so you probably won't have to dig too deeply into the package; I think the development gets hairier the deeper into the API you get, but that's probably true of most packages.</p>

<p>I happened to end up using the Tkinter backend, but matplotlib also supports QT, WxPython and others.  I'm not a huge fan of Tkinter or WxPython and probably would've used QT instead given the choice, but it's nice that all the options are there.  I've used matplotlib on both Linux and Mac OS X with a lot of success.</p>

<p>As a side note, here's an interesting related SO post on plotting in WxPython if you decide to go that route:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/457246/what-is-the-best-real-time-plotting-widget-for-wxpython">What is the best real time plotting widget for wxPython?</a></p>
