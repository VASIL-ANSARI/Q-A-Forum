<p>I can see at least one mistake: </p>

<pre><code>res.send(/factorial + i)
</code></pre>

<p>isn't in any known way of sending an answer, and probably is the cause of the error . In fact the errro is telling you that you send an invalid result code (45), probably becuase interprets the first char of your response (/) as return code, as yor're not providing the correct response headers</p>

<p>Also, except the ddd(num) call is something magic you algorythm for calculating a factorial isn't correct. Supose you send a 5, (result should be <strong>5*4*3*2*1 =120</strong>). Then</p>

<ul>
<li><p>loop pass it retuns 1</p></li>
<li><p>loop pass it retuns 10  </p></li>
<li><p>and exits because i is currently bigger than 5</p></li>
</ul>

<p>a numerically working  version could be:</p>

<pre><code>app.post('/factorial', function(req, res) {
   var num=req.body.numero;
   dd(num);  // &lt;&lt; dont know what it does

  function fact(n) {
    if (n &lt; 2) return n
    else return n*fact(n-1)
  } 
  var result = fact(num)
  ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>For correctly send the result, you should read the related docs. Too long to answer here</p>
