<p>Generally speaking if your application is single threaded, you're not going to get much use out of the lock statement. Not knowing your application exactly, I don't know if they're useful or not - but I suspect not. Further, if you're application is using lock everywhere I don't know that I would feel all that confident about it working in a multi-threaded  environment anyways - did the original developer <em>actually</em> know how to develop multi-threaded code, or did they just add lock statements everywhere in the vague hope that that would do the trick?</p>
