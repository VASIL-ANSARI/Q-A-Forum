<p>Use for example the developer console of Chrome (or some other tool) to see what the call to your PHP script actually returns (because <em>"<code>null</code> or something"</em> is a bit vague.)</p>

<p>Then at some point log the contents of the <code>people</code> property to see whats actually in it. I doubt that this property is really <code>null</code>. Presumably its something like <code>""</code> or <code>[]</code> (or even <code>"null"</code>).</p>

<p>If <code>people</code> is indeed null, then your code works fine. One can verify this with a small test element that only contains the two templates and sets the <code>people</code> property directly in the <code>created()</code> function.</p>

<p>In all other cases it depends. If the empty case is an empty array, you could write for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;template if="{{people.length &gt; 0}}"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>&lt;template if="{{people.length == 0}}"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To your question regarding the non-json response error: it depends again. If you parse the JSON content with <code>JSON.parse()</code> yourself, then it will throw an exception in case of an error. If you use <code>core-ajax</code>, its current implementation catches the error, logs a warning and returns the XHR response text. So you may want to extend this element and overwrite the <code>jsonHandler()</code> function. Or use <code>core-xhr</code> and implement the JSON parsing yourself.</p>

<p>The best way to handle errors is to always return a valid JSON response (with properties like <code>"error"</code> or <code>"message"</code>) and use HTTP status codes.
