<p>My best guess is that your stylesheet is not loaded. 
are you sure "../css/bootstrap.css" is the right path? 
you are moving one level down to localhost and then looking for the folder css</p>

<p>Open the developer console by hitting F12, move to the timeline tab and inspect the request of your css file.</p>

<p>There is no other magic that Visual Studio does to your css!</p>
