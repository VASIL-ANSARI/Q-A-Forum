<p>Assuming you don't want to use any of resources that might fit your description "libraries like Boost".  The simple answer is to write your own subset of one, with just the operations you need.
If 32 hex digits is enough, then simplest would be to create your own 128 bit unsigned int and code a divide by 10 function (producing quotient and remainder) for that 128-bit int.  You really don't need any other functions and divide by 10 is pretty easy.  Converting up to 32 hex digits to 128 bit int is trivial and generating decimal output from a series of divide by ten is trivial.
If you want essentially unlimited size, then it is likely simpler to represent a decimal number as a string of digits and write a routine to multiply that by 16 and add in another digit.  That would never be the efficient solution, just likely easier to code for your purpose and unlimited size.</p>
