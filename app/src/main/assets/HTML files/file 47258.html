<p>With what you posted, it looks that Spring just does what you asked it to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>you correctly declare a DispatcherServlet in you web.xml, and explicitely give it a xml config file</li>
<li>the dispatcher servlet is mapped to <code>/</code>, meaning that the application should be able to serve directly resources (jsp, css, images) not under WEB-INF</li>
<li>in the xml config file, you only declare an <code>InternalResourseViewResolver</code> - <strong>no controller declaration</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When you hit the submit button, browser posts a request to <code>/current_path_of_jsp/hello.html</code>. But as you forgot the <code>&lt;mvc:annotation-driven /&gt;</code> (as already noted by M. Deinum in comment), the <code>@RequestMapping</code> annotation has not been processed by Spring.</p>

<p>BTW : you did not show either whether you controller <strong>class</strong> is annotated with <code>@Controller</code>, <code>@Component</code>, or <code>@RequestMapping</code> ...</p>
