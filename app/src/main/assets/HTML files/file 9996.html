<p>The main issue with your code is that you simply aren't defining the class of WebRupee on the span element.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="container"&gt;

&lt;span class="WebRupee"&gt;Rs.&lt;/span&gt; 5000

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In response to other parts of the question...</p>

<p>the id container isn't required for the class, all it is setting is the width and margin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What actually the difference between
  .rupee and #rupee??</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.rupee is a class and #rupee is an ID</p>
