<p>Found some information on  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28729854/oledb-oledbconnection-resizing-form-bug">OleDb / OleDbConnection resizing form (bug?)</a> which helped me solve the issue.</p>

<p>It is kind of a microsoft issue, but the problem in my case was that i had installed 
2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23734" rel="nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23734</a> as it is needed to open connections to access databases on 64bit computers, but just having that causes the resize issue and provides no errors or feedback into the issue, and as i am not directly changing the size anywhere in my form, it becomes really confusing and hard to debug.</p>

<p>However I also found out that also installing Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable (32bit)
 found at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=13255" rel="nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=13255</a> fixes the resize issue that occurs when opening the database.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps other people in the future who are also attempting to load and save data to an access database.</p>
