<p>Not sure about the <code>return ID;</code> 
I would have returned <code>*yytext</code> which contains your token in a <code>char*</code>.
You can actually take a look at this simple <a href="http://www.epaperpress.com/lexandyacc/index.html" rel="nofollow">calculator example</a></p>

<p>About your issue, you may need to create/implement a list of <code>char*</code> to store each of your input token during the parsing, and then check if the current one belongs to the list. As this requires more work, the examples above (and on all the website) should help.</p>
