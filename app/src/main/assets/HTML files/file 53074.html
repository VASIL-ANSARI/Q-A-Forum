<p>Best way would probably be to use a conditional statement, since as you said you are checking for a non unique value and thus cannot use ON DUPLICATE KEY:</p>

<pre><code>IF EXISTS (SELECT id_code FROM table2 WHERE id_code = 'code from table1') THEN
    UPDATE table2 SET status = 'new status' WHERE id_code = 'code from table1';
ELSE
    INSERT INTO table2 (id_code, status) VALUES ('code from table1', 'new status');
END IF;
</code></pre>

<p>The only caveat here is that control structures are only valid in stored procedures, so you will need to put this in a stored procedure or a trigger. </p>
