<p>Practical Implementation sources are little bit available for SCORM over the Internet, few may disagree from my point, but I really found it hard while discovering for SCORM2004. </p>

<p>I am sharing my knowledge with you(hopefully someone may add to it to increase the availability of content for the topic).</p>

<p>Basically you will came across 3 things when looking for SCORM.</p>

<ol>
<li>LMS (Learning Management System)</li>
<li>RTE (Run Time Environment)</li>
<li>SCORM Content or package</li>
</ol>

<p>LMS can be written in any language(PHP,C#,Ruby etc).</p>

<p>RTE can be consider as a player for playing the SCORM package.</p>

<p>If you have a SCORM package(with the object name I am assuming its on SCORM2004) then in your RTE you need to make sure that this object should be located in a window that is a parent of the SCO or a parent of the opener window of the SCO. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>As per the comment you can create an RTE in C#/PHP etc using the concept -</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;RTE For playing SCORM Package&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;frameset framespacing="0" border="0" rows="0,*"&gt;
    &lt;frame src="YOUR_API_FILE.EXTENSION" name="API_1484_11"&gt;
    &lt;frame src="YOUR_CONTENT_PATH.EXTENSION" name="course"&gt;
&lt;/frameset&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
