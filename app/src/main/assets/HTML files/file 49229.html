<p><a href="https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController/" rel="nofollow">SWRevealViewController</a> offers some customization options</p>

  <p>documented in the SWRevealViewController.h header file.</p>

<p>It seems as though the <em>frontView</em> is the part with "WatchKit" in your example and the <em>rearView</em> is the menu.</p>

<p>In that case, you might be able to use <code>setFrontViewPosition</code> with the value <a href="https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController/blob/master/SWRevealViewController/SWRevealViewController.h#L158-160" rel="nofollow"><code>FrontViewPositionLeftSide</code></a>, which gives the <em>frontView</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>// Left position, front view is presented left-offseted by rightViewRevealWidth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that does not work, you could also try <code>FrontViewPositionLeftSideMost</code>, which gives the position</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>// Left most position, front view is presented left-offseted by rightViewRevealWidth+rigthViewRevealOverdraw</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub>I did not have the setup at hand to try this.</sub></p>
