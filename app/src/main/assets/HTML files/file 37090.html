<p>After a discussion in the comments, I determined that you were attempting to render a page after a <code>post</code> form submission that amends the database. It is perfectly possible to re-read your new database state and render it in a post operation, but it is inadvisable, since browsers cannot refresh the page without asking you if you wish to run the operation again. This does not make for a good user experience, especially in relation to using the back/forward buttons.</p>

<p>The reason for this behaviour is that post operations generally modify the database. They are used for example in credit card purchases or profile amendments where some change in the state of the server is expected. Thus, it is good practice to execute a new round-trip to the server, after the write operation, to change the page method from <code>post</code> to <code>get</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>header()</code> call I linked to will do this, and will resolve your rendering problem too.</p>
