<p>You need to retrieve the exterior or interior Linear Ring and feed these into numpy. You can then easily slice the coords. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>from shapely import geometry
import numpy as np

# lets create an example polygon
p = geometry.Point(0,0)
poly = p.buffer(100)

# you need to get the coordinates of the exterior (shell)
# pass these into a numpy array
shell_coords = np.array(poly.exterior)
print(shell_coords)

# you can do the same for interior (holes) as well

# then slice and dice to your heart's content
print(shell_coords[:,:1])
print(shell_coords[:,1:2])
</code></pre>
