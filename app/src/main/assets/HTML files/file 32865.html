<p>In the general case, using a <code>Mutex</code> with asynchronous code is wrong. Normally, I'd say you should use something like <a href="http://nitoasyncex.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=AsyncLock" rel="nofollow"><code>AsyncLock</code> from my AsyncEx library</a>, and if you want a separate lock per file, then you'll need a dictionary or some such.</p>

<p>However, if your method is always called from the UI thread, then it will work. It is not very efficient, but it will work.</p>
