<p>In c++, the value for a condition being true or false is determined by being non 0 (true) or 0 (false).</p>

<p>The above loop would continue iterating as long as cnt is NOT 0. It will terminate when cnt becomes 0.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>To clear an important point here, it is the value 0 that terminates the loop. If for some reason, <strong>cnt already starts with a negative value, the loop will never terminate</strong></p>
