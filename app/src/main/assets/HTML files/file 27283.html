<p>You need to distinguish between the actual type and the declared type. In your case, although you instantiate a <code>cocktail</code>, you are referencing it as a <code>Drink</code>, which does not expose any properties. </p>

<p>To access the properties defined in the <code>cocktail</code> class, you need to type-cast your reference:</p>

<pre><code>((cocktail)order.Drink).AlcoholContent = 4;
</code></pre>
