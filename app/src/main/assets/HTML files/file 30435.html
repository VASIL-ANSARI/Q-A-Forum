<p>Reading from StandardOutput isn't like reading from a file that has a definite endpoint. A StreamReader hooked to StandardOutput can reach EndOfStream (meaning all available output has been read) before the process exits. </p>

<p>ReadLine however, will wait until data is available or the stream is closed. When the stream is closed, ReadLine will return null.</p>

<p>Rewriting your main loop to use the blocking I/O of ReadLine as the wait condition:</p>

<pre><code>    string standard_output;
    while ((standard_output = myProcess.StandardOutput.ReadLine()) != null) 
    {
        if (standard_output.Contains("xx"))
        {
            //do something
            break;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
