<p>Not sure this is what you need, and I don't have that much experience with DFP, but I just ran into a similar problem that I solved by managing the size of the iframe manually. Maybe this can help you too.</p>

<p>The DFP API has an event you can listen to that lets you know that the ad has finished rendering, upon which I would suggest you change the iframe properties to be full width, and a whatever height would work for the placement.</p>

<p>Assuming you have jQuery on your page, this can be done quite easily. After setting up the DFP plugin (calling <code>defineSlot</code> etc.) you can add a listener for this event like so:</p>

<pre><code>googletag.pubads().addEventListener('slotRenderEnded', function(){
  var $adFrame = $('#id-of-the-iframe');
  $adFrame.css({width: '100%', height: '500px'});
});
</code></pre>

<p>This is outlined in DFP docs <a href="https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-gpt/reference#googletag.events.SlotRenderEndedEvent">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>EDIT: After posting I realized that the code example I posted is from the DFP GPT library. Perhaps you are not using this. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11218194/dfp-post-rendering-callback">This SO question</a> has a link to a library that someone has created to listen to events that DFP fires. Perhaps you can use that and use the technique I described?</p>

<p>Again - hope this helps :)</p>
