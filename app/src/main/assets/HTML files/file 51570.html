<p>ODP.NET, Managed Driver does not yet support data integrity algorithms:</p>

<p>This leads to the TNS-12599: TNS:cryptographic checksum mismatch error in your database alert log which in turn causes various client side errors such as ORA-12570: Network Session: Unexpected packet read error or ORA-12537: Network Session: End of file.</p>

<p>This can be fixed by changing database side SQLNET.ORA parameters, such that checksums are not REQUIRED:</p>

<p>sqlnet.crypto_checksum_client = ACCEPTED</p>

<p>sqlnet.crypto_checksum_server = ACCEPTED</p>

<p>(This answer was provided during the 12.1.0.2 timeframe. As time passes, you should check to see if a newer release supports this feature)</p>
