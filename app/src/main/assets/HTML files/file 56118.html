<p>When you create a flex container (<code>display: flex</code> or <code>display: inline-flex</code>), it comes with several default settings. Among them are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>flex-direction: row</code> - flex items will align horizontally</li>
<li><code>justify-content: flex-start</code> - flex items will stack at the start of the line</li>
<li><code>flex-wrap: nowrap</code> - flex items are forced to stay in a single line</li>
<li><code>flex-shrink: 1</code> - flex items are allowed to shrink</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the last two settings.</p>

<p>Your three divs are forced to remain in a single line. Hence, their combined width is limited to the width of the container.</p>

<p>Also, they are allowed to shrink, which prevents them from overflowing the container. This also limits their width.</p>

<p>To apply whatever width you want to each flex item you can override these initial settings with:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>flex-wrap: wrap</code> - now there's more space because flex items can break to new lines</li>
<li><code>flex-shrink: 0</code> - now there's more space because flex items will not shrink and can overflow their container if necessary</li>
</ol>
