<p>Looks like I might have to do something like this.</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO ChatArchive (MsgId, MsgText, Filtered, LastFetched) SELECT MsgID, MsgText, Filtered, LastFetched FROM ChatCurrent WHERE ID &lt;= (SELECT MAX(ID) from ChatCurrent) - 500;
DELETE FROM ChatCurrent WHERE MsgId &lt;= (SELECT MAX(MsgId) FROM ChatArchive);
</code></pre>

<p>500 here being the number of rows I want to remain in the system. The alternative is to store the list of MsgIds somewhere (in VB) and construct the second query from that.</p>
