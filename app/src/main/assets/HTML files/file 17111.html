<p>It's <code>true</code> in your case, as <code>true</code> is the second operand of <code>||</code> (so-called 'short-circuit or') operator. The common rule is...</p>

<pre><code>var x = a || b; // = a (and b won't be evaluated), if it's a truthy value, b otherwise
var y = a &amp;&amp; b; // = a (and b won't be evaluated), if it's a falsy value, b otherwise.
</code></pre>
