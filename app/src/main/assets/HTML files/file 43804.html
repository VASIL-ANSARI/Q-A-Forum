<p><code>dynamic_cast</code> here is no different from <code>static_cast</code>, and the compiler found that the user code is trying to access a protected base, which is illegal. <code>dynamic_cast</code> does not hide or postpone any compile-time error. If a cast can be determined illegal at compile-time, the compiler will never generate any code and rely on you to check that the cast is actually incorrect at run-time.</p>
