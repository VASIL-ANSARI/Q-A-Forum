<p>You probably learned this <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/oop4.constructor.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for PHP 4.</p>

<p>As you already know, in PHP 5 documentation (<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>) it is stated that if no __construct() is used or inherited, the old syntax kicks in as a fallback:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For backwards compatibility, if PHP 5 cannot find a __construct() function for a given class, and the class did not inherit one from a parent class, it will search for the old-style constructor function, by the name of the class. Effectively, it means that the only case that would have compatibility issues is if the class had a method named __construct() which was used for different semantics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the old syntax should still be valid, as PHP 5.4.11. There is no explicit plan for deprecation, right now, even if it's foreseeable.</p>

<p>Anyway, when (and if) they will be dropped, this feature will be dropped too as there is no way to reproduce it with the __construct() syntax.</p>
