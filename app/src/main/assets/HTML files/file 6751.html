<p>It appears that your play_video() will not return until the end of the video</p>

<p><code>
while (mp.isPlaying());
</code></p>

<p>yet you call this from onCreate().  onCreate runs on the UI thread and so must return very quickly or the application will be unresponsive - some of the things you have requested may not even begin to occur until after onCreate() returns.  You need to start the video and then return.  Set up other events to activate on its completion, or have a separate thread that monitors it.</p>
