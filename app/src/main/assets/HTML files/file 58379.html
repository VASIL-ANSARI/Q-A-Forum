<p>You're calling <code>Fit()</code>, so you're explicitly asking the panel to fit its contents, but you don't specify the min/best size of this contents anywhere (AFAICS, there is a lot of code here, so I could be missing something).</p>

<p>If you want to use some minimal size for the panel, just set it using <code>SetMinSize()</code>.</p>
