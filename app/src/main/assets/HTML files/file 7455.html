<p>Truth be told, that <code>IBOutlet</code> is a bit confusing. But there are some issues here one of which is cell reuse. </p>

<p>Since the cells are reused, you shouldn't rely on text retaining their values and rather you should store what the typed in <code>textFieldDidEndEditing:</code> method. Maintain an array for the values entered or not entered (using <code>[NSNull null]</code> singleton). In <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> method, if you see an existing text value set the text field's text to that value. This way you can counter the cell reuse effect.</p>

<p>Another issue is with the outlet <code>StreetName</code>. When the cells are created, I am guessing <code>StreetName</code> will point to the correct text field but what happens when the cells are reused. <code>StreetName</code> would be pointing to the text field of the last cell that was created and as a result all assignments you do in <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> are incorrect for reused cells. It would be a lot easier if you create a custom subclass of <code>UITableViewCell</code> where you will do <code>cell.myTextField.text = [textFieldStrings objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];</code>.</p>

<p>As a side note,</p>

<pre><code>StreetName.delegate = self;
StreetName.tag = indexPath.row;
tableViewCellFields[indexPath.row] = StreetName;
[StreetName setInputAccessoryView:keybdToolbar];
</code></pre>

<p>The first and last line are something you only need to do once while creating the cell.</p>
