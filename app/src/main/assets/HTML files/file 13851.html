<p>The best way is to not put any text value for it. For example, if it is an element the value would be <code>&lt;Element/&gt;</code>. Notice the open tag closes itself. You can read about the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/el_element.asp" rel="nofollow">nillable</a> element incase you need to build an schema definition (XSD) for it.</p>

<p>Attributes on the other hand don't support nillable type. Personally the way I do it is to not put the attribute at all. In an XPath expression <code>\\Element[not(@value)]</code> finds Element that doesn't have a <code>value</code> attribute. This allows you to differentiate between null and empty string.</p>
