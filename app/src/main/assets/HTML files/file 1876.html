<p>Of course you can write a marker interface. A marker interface is generally just a Interface with no methods at all (so any class could implement it).</p>

<p>You seem to think that marker interfaces have some magical properties that do something on their own. That's not the case. Instead some <em>other</em> code can react on the presence of the marker interface on some object and act differently when a class implements it. But the marker interface itself <strong>doesn't do anything</strong> .</p>
