<p>In your main class, you already used <code>fopen</code> to get a file handle for the file you want to read from, and you passed it as an argument to <code>createWordReader</code>. You probably just want to save the file handle in the WordReader struct, so that you can use it in future calls to <code>fread</code> when you want to read data from the file.</p>

<pre><code>reader-&gt;file = fileToRead;
</code></pre>
