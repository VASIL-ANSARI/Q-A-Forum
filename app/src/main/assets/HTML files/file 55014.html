<p><strong>When you have the simulator open.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Click and hold down your app icon</li>
<li>When you seen the icons shaking and "X" in their Top Left, Click to delete it</li>
<li>Do the same for any other App Icons you may have showing in the Simulator Home screen</li>
<li>In Simulator menu at top - Click "HardWare" -- "Home" to stop icons shaking</li>
<li>In same menu Click "HardWare" -- "Reboot" (Wait for this to complete)</li>
<li>Quit Simulator from its menu "Quit Simulator"</li>
</ol>

<p>(nb: when using device to run app, I would delete it from app as well)</p>

<p><strong>Then Go back to Xcode</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>click in to menu "Product" -- "Clean"</li>
<li>Quit Xcode and open up again</li>
<li>Run Simulator on the iPhone Simulator Size you just cleaned out (above)</li>
</ol>

<p>I've tried to simulate the issue you're having but unable to, however, when I have any issues on running my apps, the above seems to work. </p>

<p><em>[ Sometimes Xcode can be a bit slow, so I tend to wait a few seconds to confirm it / Xcode has actioned it, as I sometimes used the keyboard too fast for it to keep up.]</em></p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
