<p>It sounds like you're saving the script, not actually executing it.  The button you're looking for is the Execute button (or perhaps just hitting the F5 key) - it will run the script that you have written. </p>

<p>If that script includes the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186755.aspx" rel="nofollow">CREATE FUNCTION</a> statement, and your code is valid, then it will create a new function. </p>

<p>Once you have finished creating your function, right-click on the 'Functions' folder in Object Explorer and choose 'Refresh'. </p>
