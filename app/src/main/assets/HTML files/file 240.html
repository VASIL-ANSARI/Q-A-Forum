<p>I would start <a href="http://www.csharp-examples.net/restart-windows-service/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  It shows how to start and stop services in C#</p>

<p>A sample to start is is</p>

<pre><code>public static void StartService(string serviceName, int timeoutMilliseconds)
{
  ServiceController service = new ServiceController(serviceName);
  try
  {
    TimeSpan timeout = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(timeoutMilliseconds);

    service.Start();
    service.WaitForStatus(ServiceControllerStatus.Running, timeout);
  }
  catch
  {
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tested services mostly through console app, simulating what the service would do.  That way my unit test is completely automated.</p>
