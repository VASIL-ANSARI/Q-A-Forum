<p>This feature of array derefernce was introduced in PHP 5.4. Therefor you cannot use it on a PHP 5.3 Production server.</p>

<p>There are at least two solutions. One is the idea of upgrading your PHP version on the server (good idea).</p>

<p>The other one is just a change in the code base:</p>

<pre><code>$tmp_logged = $this-&gt;users_model-&gt;get_logged();
$param['info'] = $tmp_logged[0];
</code></pre>
