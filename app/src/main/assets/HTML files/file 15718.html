<p>From our discussion , the inference can be had that it is a view-base application.So, you will have to add and remove subview from superview as per requirement and for that you will to create a class that keeps a track of the views.Also, instead of presenting the view modally you can have it added as subview like:-</p>

<pre><code>[self.view addSubView:viewController.view];
</code></pre>

<p>you can use <code>bringSubViewToFront</code> to bring it to the top.See this <a href="http://mobiledevelopertips.com/open-source/ios-open-source-uiview-category-to-manage-z-order-of-views.html" rel="nofollow">Link to manage it</a></p>
