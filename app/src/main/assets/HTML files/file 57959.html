<p>I don't know whether you still require this information or not. We've seen something similar, which was resolved by upgrading Docker.</p>

<p>Not knowing the cause of the issue caused me to do a little digging, and I found this:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/20661" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/20661</a></p>

<p>In a nutshell, it has something to do with docker attempting to resolve an ipv6 dns before trying to do the same for ipv4. Have a read. You may understand it better than I did.</p>

<p>I hope it helps you.</p>
