<p>Ok, here is the answer that I found (also, some clarifications to the comments from Terry Gardner comments)</p>

<p>My sysadmins gave me user A ("system" user, that can connect and browse the LDAP). The user that will connect to my application would b user F (final user). When asked about samples to configure my jboss, they redirected my to the BrowserLdapModuleLogin (BLML).</p>

<p>Turns out, BLML works by doing an initial connection with user A, for retrieving user F data (full LDAP "name").</p>

<p>After that, a new connection is setup using user F connection data to validate user/password and retrieve the groups (<code>memberOf</code> attribute) to which it belongs. Until this point, all works as it should (at least with our setup).</p>

<p>The trouble began when I did setup the option to just get the "CN" value (instead of <code>CN=value,OU=organization....</code>). By setting up this option, the module tries again to login <strong>as user F</strong> into the roles tree to get the attribute. But it happens that F does not have permissions to do so.</p>

<p>As the module was provided by our IT people and I am new to LDAP, I assumed I was just setting up something wrong, and I did not want to change anything in the code. In the end, it happens that in the system that uses it, this module was used only for authentication; the roles were extracted from another DB and I have been forced to code around this issue.</p>

<p>Sorry for the annoyances...</p>
