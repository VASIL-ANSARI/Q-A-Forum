<p>When you get fresh input for the password, due to it being invalid, you don't reset your counter <code>c</code> to zero to start the checking process from scratch again.</p>

<pre><code># After this block
password= raw_input ()
numbercharacters=len(password) 
# Reset your counter to zero
c = 0
character=password[c]
</code></pre>

<p>You can also simply for your character check for digits with either </p>

<pre><code>while not character.isdigit():
# or 
while character not in '0123456789':
</code></pre>
