<p>I'm sure that is there a small mistake somewhere in the Data Douce configuration.</p>

<p>Is your test connection working fine in Websphere data source ?</p>

<p>Is your J2C entries are correct ?</p>

<p>Also to take note you should be running on Websphere context to get the datasource from Websphere.</p>
