<p>There is no problem with your code except you call <code>this.Invalidate();</code> instead of <code>pb_bitmapImage.Invalidate()</code>. Otherwise that works fine.</p>

<p><code>this.Invalidate(true);</code> also should work, but that will trigger unnecessary repaint to all children. So just use <code>pb_bitmapImage.Invalidate()</code>.</p>

<p>Actually Rectangle will be drawn when picturebox repaints, you need patience to see that :) </p>
