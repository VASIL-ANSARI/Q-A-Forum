<p>Firstly, you should initialize your Panel inside your <code>onCreate()</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>Panel p = null;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE);
    p = new Panel(this);
    setContentView(p);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, I do not understand <em>why</em> you are doing a sleep in your <code>onTouchEvent()</code> handler. Try taking that out, and things should speed up, especially if you think that may be the cause!</p>
