<p>First, notice that you can't run the command <code>./cake</code> from the root of your CakePHP installation directory--the item called "cake" there is a folder, and can't be executed.  The console executable is located at <code>[installdir]/cake/console/cake</code>.</p>

<p>When using bake, you'll want to do it from your app folder.  If you've done much work already, it might be wise to first back up the app folder.  Then, from your CakePHP installation folder, do</p>

<pre><code>cd app
../cake/console/cake bake
</code></pre>

<p>and you should be all set.</p>
