<p>You have to check if Text length is not 0. The <code>Text.Remove</code> function's first argument in your handler gets -1 as first parameter. This causes the exception to be thrown, because this is not a valid index. You should wrap the entire method body in a <code>if ( remainTxt.Text.Length &gt; 0 )</code> block</p>
