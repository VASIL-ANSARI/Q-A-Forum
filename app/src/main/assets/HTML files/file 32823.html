<p>From 5.2.7 / 7:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If T is "pointer to cv void," then the result is a pointer to the most
  derived object pointed to by v. Otherwise, a run-time check is applied
  to see if the object pointed or referred to by v can be converted to
  the type pointed or referred to by T.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So using <code>dynamic_cast&lt;void*&gt;(o)</code> you get a pointer to the first byte of the most "derived" object (if <code>o</code> is polymorphic).</p>

<p>The code the compiler generates for <code>dynamic_cast&lt;void *&gt;(...)</code> is something like:</p>

<pre><code>static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(dynamic_cast&lt;most_derived_type *&gt;(...))
</code></pre>

<p>This property is often used for serialization.</p>
