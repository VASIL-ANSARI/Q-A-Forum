<p>All you have to do to allow spaces as well is to add a space to the character pattern where you have <code>[A-z]</code>.</p>

<p>So it becomes:</p>

<pre><code>pattern="[A-z ]{3,}"
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Note, however, that this will prevent other types of white space characters. I assume this is what you want, since you're being quite restrictive with the rest of the character set, but it's worth pointing out that non-breaking spaces, carriage returns, and other white space will be blocked in the above. If you want to allow them, use <code>\s</code> instead of just a space: this will match any white space character.</p>

<p>Finally, it's worth pointing out that the standard alphabet is often insufficient even for plain English text. There are valid English words with accents, as well as apostrophes and other punctuation. You haven't specified what the field is being used for, so I'll assume this is not an issue, but I felt it was worth pointing out nevertheless.</p>
