<p>To resize an image you can use the image encoding APIs in WinRT, namely that in Windows.Graphics.Imaging. I suggest you look at scenario 2 of the Simple Imaging Sample (<a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Simple-Imaging-Sample-a2dec2b0" rel="nofollow">http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Simple-Imaging-Sample-a2dec2b0</a>) which shows how to do all manners of transforms on an image. Changing the dimensions is included there, so it'll just be a matter of chopping out the parts you don't need.</p>

<p>I have a discussion about all this in my free ebook, <a href="http://aka.ms/BrockschmidtBook2" rel="nofollow"><em>Programming Windows Store Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 2nd Edition</em></a>, in Chapter 13, section "Image Manipulation and Encoding". In there I try to separate out the main steps in the process into something a little more digestible, and provide an additional sample.</p>

<p>The process of encoding can look rather involved (lots of chained promises), but it's quite straightforward and is exactly what an email program would do to reduce the size of attached images, for instance. In any case, you should end up with another StorageFile with a smaller image that you can then pass to the uploader. I would recommend using your Temporary app data for such files, and be sure to clean them up when the upload is complete.</p>
