  <p>What's the best way to give the library this Context?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pass a <code>Context</code> into the methods exposed by your library that need a <code>Context</code>. This is what the Android SDK does in places.</p>

<p>Or, change your library to expose objects, not static methods, and have the objects hold an instance of <code>Context</code> (supplied to the constructor or factory method that created the instance).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have my library classes extend Application, and call getApplicationContext()</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can call <code>getApplicationContext()</code> on a <code>Context</code>, you would just do that, without needing to subclass <code>Application</code>.</p>
