<p>The problem with the first section is</p>

<pre><code>puts -------
</code></pre>

<p>You probably meant to enclose the dashes in quotes, to make it a string.</p>

<p>The <code>=&gt;</code> (hashrocket) operator is only used when declaring a new hash (for example <code>{"a" =&gt; 1}</code>) but your second bit of code is using it outside of that context ( I'm not sure what you were trying to do so can't really suggest anything). There's a few other things that don't make sense too - you're comparing string literals at the bottom , and I suspect that the precedent of || and &amp;&amp; won't do what you want, whatever that is</p>
