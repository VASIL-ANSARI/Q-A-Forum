<p>Iâd advise you against emulating that Railscast. Itâs from 2008 and things have changed a lot since then. Writing Javascript on the server for execution on the client is passÃ©; the whole <code>JavascriptsController</code> idea feels cringeworthy to me.</p>

<p>Instead, you could have the âHide this messageâ link trigger an AJAX request on the client side that tells the server to stop showing the announcement, waits for a <code>success</code>-type response, and removes the message itself.</p>

<p>I made a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/5hYAp/" rel="nofollow">fiddle</a> that shows a basic version of this. Note that it fakes the server response to the AJAX request, but all your application would have to do is return an HTTP success code.</p>

<p>If your application is simple this would suffice, but eventually these jQuery events sprawl out of control and may call for a client-side framework like backbone.js to keep track of things.</p>
