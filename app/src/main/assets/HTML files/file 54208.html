<p>If you want to show the date in different format, you can change the FormatString of the control that is displaying the date value (for example XRLabel). Set the FormatString to your desired date format (for example "{0:dd-MM-yy}")</p>

<p>If you need to change the value (not the format) of the report parameters, you can do it using the XtraReport event "ParametersRequestSubmit".</p>

<p>Regards. </p>
