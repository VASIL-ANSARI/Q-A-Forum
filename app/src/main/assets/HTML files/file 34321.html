<p>Android Studio isn't the same as IntelliJ, and you don't tend to use global libraries the way you do there. Many libraries you need are available via the Maven Central repository, and you can have the build system download the correct version on the fly, instead of forcing you to maintain library jars by hand.</p>

<p>If you need to add a dependency to a common library, try the Modules > Dependencies > + button > Library dependency, and search for what you need.</p>

<p>If your dependency isn't on Maven Central, then you'll need to copy its jar archive into your project by hand. Android Studio doesn't presently have an equivalent to IntelliJ's global library feature.</p>
