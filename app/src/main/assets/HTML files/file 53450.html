<p>To eliminate duplicate rows, we need to use <code>Group by</code> clause in the query (e.g. <code>group by pt_test_man_order</code>). Also, if we need to select a specific value of a field from group then, we need to use the inner query as explained in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/example-maximum-column-group-row.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> documentation.</p>
