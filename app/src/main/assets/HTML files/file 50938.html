<p>Python evaluates "boolean" expression starting by left to right, if any conditions fails and transform the whole expression in <code>False</code> or <code>True</code>, python stop the evaluation and returns the value.</p>

<p>So if <code>request.user</code> is <code>None</code>, the whole expression is <code>False</code>, then python returns <code>False</code> and skip <code>request.user.is_authenticated()</code> evaluation. So, you won't get "attribute error" exception.</p>

<p>Note:
If <code>request</code> object has not <code>user</code> attribute, you will get an attribute error, but <code>request</code> object always on that step has an object or <code>None</code>. But, not always that object has <code>is_authenticated()</code> method.</p>

<p>This behaviour is called <a href="http://cis.poly.edu/cs1114/pyLecturettes/short-circuit-eval.html" rel="nofollow">short-circuit-evaluation</a></p>

<p>Also, the method is named "has_permission", so,  is better to return a <code>boolean</code> saying if the current user if exists it has permission  than raising an exception. Also, using try/except block, how are you sure that the raised exception is because <code>request.user</code> does not exists? even when you catch the correct exception, you needed at least 6 lines to representing 1. </p>

<p>Also in python</p>

<pre><code>1 and 2 == True
</code></pre>

<p>Even when <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> are not <code>"booleans"</code>. So, it does not matters if <code>request.user</code> is not a "boolean", its about to check if <code>request.user</code> exists and is not <code>None</code>. </p>
