<p>NHibernate manages all the database connections itself. It opens and closes the database as it sees fit, but you can try to call Session.Disconnect to get it to disconnect from the ADO.NET connection.</p>

<p>However ... if you have Connection Pooling enabled, which is normally the 'default' connection behavior, the connection will only be returned to the connection pool, not released, and it will still show as a connection, so you would have to clear the connection pool. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not know if you can do this directly thru NHibernate, but you can use a SQLConnection object to issue a ClearPool or ClearAllPools call ... </p>
