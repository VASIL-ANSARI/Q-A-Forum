<p>Did a little testing (modified the sample code from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb671200.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb671200.aspx</a>) and from my experimenting I found that the performance hit comes from calling EventRecord.FormatDescription().</p>

<p>When I only had a call to EventRecord.ToXml() I was able to pull remotely from a server on the LAN over 4300 events in 25 seconds at about 170 events/sec. When I added a call to EventRecord.FormatDescription() the performance dropped to almost 1.5 minutes to read all 4300+ events and about 52 events/sec.</p>

<p>I apologize this may not be the answer that you want but my advice would be if you don't need to call EventRecord.FormatDescription() it will increase performance quite a bit.</p>
