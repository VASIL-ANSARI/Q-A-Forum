<p>So I figured this out, and there are a couple of factors here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There isn't a login function for SoapClient, the login I was calling is a call as defined in the WSDL</p></li>
<li><p>The various magento API methods are not defined in the WSDL, you provide an argument resource method to method defined as <code>call</code> by the WSDL.  This created a bit of confusion because using <code>$client-&gt;call()</code> seems to invoke <code>call</code> as defined by the SOAP_Client class, so I need to use <code>$client-&gt;call('call')</code> to invoke the SOAP method <code>call</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The final code ended up being:</p>

<pre><code>$method = 'catalog_product.info';
$args = array($product_id);

$client = new SOAP_Client($wsdl, true);
$session_id = $client-&gt;call(
    'login',
    array(
        'username'=&gt;$username,
        'apiKey'=&gt; $pasword
    )
);
$ret = $client-&gt;call(
    'call',
    array(
        'sessionId'=&gt;$session_id,
        'resourcePath'=&gt;$method,
        'args'=&gt;$args
    )
);
</code></pre>
