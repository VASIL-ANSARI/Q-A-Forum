<p>First create an instance of FreshJuice class:</p>

<p><code>FreshJuice fj = new FreshJuice();</code></p>

<p>Now you can access the variable <code>a</code> .</p>

<p>But if you set your variable as <code>private int a=10;</code>  Then you can't access that  still. That's why it is good practice to use getter and setter methods to access those private variables.</p>
