<p>I believe there is no way to add disabled button in a UIActionSheet. From the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/UIActionSheet_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">class reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the UIActionSheet class to present the user with <strong>a set of
  alternatives for how to proceed with a given task</strong>. You can also use
  action sheets to prompt the user to confirm a potentially dangerous
  action. The action sheet contains an optional title and one or more
  buttons, each of which corresponds to an action to take.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the button is disabled, it should <em>not</em> be added into the UIActionSheet in the first place since it is not an alternative on how to proceed with a given task.</p>
