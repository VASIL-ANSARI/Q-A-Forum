<p>That seems to be a gradle build. Therefore you don't have a pom.xml. Check which repos are defined in your build.gradle (look for a repositories{} block). I guess what you'll find is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want gradle to use your local maven repository you can just tell him:</p>

<pre><code>repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  mavenLocal()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Be aware that you can define different repos for your gradle build-plugins and for the build itself! The first one is located at the buildScript block while the second one is a toplevel element.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
