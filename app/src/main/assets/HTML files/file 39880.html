<p>The division by <code>1.</code> has no effect that I can discern.  Any type promotions that it might otherwise require are already required by the <code>-1.</code> in the dividend.</p>

<p>It is conceivable that on some specific platforms the division triggers some kind of desired behavior when the dividend has an exceptional value (i.e. an infinity or NaN), but that would be highly platform-specific.</p>

<p>It is also conceivable that the division is a holdover from some earlier version of the code where it actually had some effect.</p>

<p>Either way, your translation appears to be equivalent to the Fortran version, <strong>EXCEPT</strong> that nothing in what you presented justifies changing function <code>alpha()</code>'s first argument from <code>i</code> to <code>i+1</code>.</p>
