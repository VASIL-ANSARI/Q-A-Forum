<p>1- The <em>android:background</em> attribute use no scaling when displays an image, so the image will not fit the parent size.
2- In your main xml file (the one contains the listView itself) you might put the listView with a fixed width, so not the whole area of the item will be displayed might be a part of it hidden.</p>

<p>** My advice to use an <strong>ImageView</strong> inside the <em>relativeLayout</em> of the item which fits the item and in this <strong>ImageView</strong> set the image in <em>android:src</em>  not in <em>android:background</em>   and use the <em>scaleType="fitXY"</em>, by this way the <strong>ImageView</strong> will be responsible for resizing your Image to fit the ImageView which already fits your Relative Layout.</p>
