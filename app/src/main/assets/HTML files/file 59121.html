<p>The stream "object" is a reference to a instance of a stream. Whether the stream is open or not is part of its state. The close function is a function that runs in the objects state and thus will not affect references to it.</p>

<p>The reference will stay non-NULL until you set it null, but the stream's state is closed meaning that you cant use it anymore.</p>
