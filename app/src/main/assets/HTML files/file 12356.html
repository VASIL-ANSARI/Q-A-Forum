<p>You should use <code>equals()</code> to compare Java strings:</p>

<pre><code>if (name.equals(u.getElement()))
{
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>Comparing strings using the <code>==</code> operator compares the references, which in most cases isn't the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Also, the "not found" logic is misplaced. It should probably be placed outside the loop (with an appropriate <code>if</code> condition).</p>
