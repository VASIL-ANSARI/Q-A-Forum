<p><strong>STOP</strong> storing and parsing <code>dates</code> as <code>VARCHAR</code>. Store Dates in <code>DATETIME</code> or <code>DATE</code> datatype instead of <code>Varchar</code> which will help you to avoid all these conversion's </p>

<p>Now coming back to the problem, You are trying to compare <code>Varchar</code> between <code>Varchar1</code> and <code>Varchar2</code> which not same as <code>Date</code> between <code>Date1</code> and <code>Date2</code>. </p>

<p>Convert the <code>CREATEDATE</code> to <code>datetime</code> and compare with dates in <code>Between</code> clause</p>

<pre><code>;WITH job
     AS (SELECT *
         FROM   (VALUES (Cast('04 Feb 2016' AS VARCHAR(50))),
                        (Cast('04 Mar 2016' AS VARCHAR(50))),
                        (Cast('04 Mar 2016' AS VARCHAR(50))),
                        (Cast('04 Mar 2016' AS VARCHAR(50))),
                        (Cast('04 Mar 2016' AS VARCHAR(50)))) cs (CREATEDATE))
SELECT CREATEDATE
FROM   job
WHERE  CONVERT(DATETIME, CREATEDATE) BETWEEN Getdate() - 25 AND Getdate() 
</code></pre>
