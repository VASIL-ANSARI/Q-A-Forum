<p>I have run into this problem before, having multiple parentheses in a statement makes regex pretty difficult. You could tokenize the string and treat the parentheses as one token. To handle the nested parentheses have a variable called parenCount or something and start it 1 when you find the first left parentheses. Then Everytime you find a left parentheses <code>parenCount++</code> and when you find a right <code>parenCount--</code>. Then you know if the statement is incorrectly stated or you logic is wrong if <code>parenCount&lt;0</code></p>
