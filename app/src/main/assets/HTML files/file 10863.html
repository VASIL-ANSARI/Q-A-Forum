<p>Well, reading and writing the input and output should be a no brainer (you open the file, read/write and then close it when you're done with it).</p>

<p>The trick is to get those pesky strings sorted. 
The way I look at strnig sorting is an array of arrays sorting. The first array-level is an iteration over all the structs while the second is an iteration over all the letters of a name (note that some names are longer then others)<br>
1. First you sort the first column - all the first letters<br>
2. Then all the sub-columns - within each first letter group you sort the second letter<br>
3. Repeat 1&amp;2 until you run out of letters to sort.</p>

<p>The sorting of an array of letters is the same as sorting an array of byte (AKA chars), and if you're working with an algorithm like bubble sort, working on a sub array is seamless.</p>

<p>Hope this idea helps</p>
