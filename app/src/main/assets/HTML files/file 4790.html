<p>Following up on @elmt's comment, you should create migrations using the command in your rails root directory:</p>

<pre><code>script/generate migration &lt;your_migration_name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So in your case that would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>script/generate migration add_xyz_to_users
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a filename of the form <code>db/migrate/20101122183814_add_xyz_to_users.rb</code>. That's where you should add your migration. If the filename is not named correctly, the migration will not run.</p>
