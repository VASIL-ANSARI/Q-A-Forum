<p>Your question is unclear.</p>

<p>I assume that you're adding a click handler to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags by writing <code>$('a.whatever').click(function() { ... })</code>, then adding new <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags to the document.</p>

<p>When you write <code>$(...).click(...)</code>, it only adds handlers to the elements that were found by the <code>$(...)</code> at the time you added the handler.  It will not apply to any elements you add later.</p>

<p>You're probably looking for jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/live/" rel="nofollow"><code>live</code></a> method, which will handle an event for <em>all</em> elements that match a selector, no matter when they were created.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>$('a.whatever').live('click', function(e) { ... });
</code></pre>
