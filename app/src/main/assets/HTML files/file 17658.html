<p>The <code>None</code> here is a default value for <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow"><code>dict.get()</code></a> telling python what to return if the key does not exist. It is a little superfluous in this case, as <code>get()</code> defaults to <code>None</code> for the second parameter.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>get(key[, default])</p>
  
  <p>Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. 
   If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this
   method never raises a KeyError.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it directly equivalent to <code>states.get('Texas')</code> which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    state = states['Texas']
except KeyError:
    state = None
</code></pre>

<p>So in this case, where you are then simply checking if <code>state</code> doesn't evaluate to <code>True</code>, it's pointless, it'd be better to simply do the try/except and perform the action you want on the exception (unless for some reason you are getting back other values you are also filtering out, such as empty strings, which seems unlikely).</p>

<p>The Python docs are detailed but clear, so in situations where you don't know what an argument is, check the docs.</p>
