<p>It looks like it was indeed a XSS issue and Firefox was blocking the <code>onload</code> call. I can't still understand why the http network request was actually being done and the <code>onreadystatechange</code> was being called with the <code>DONE</code> readyState.</p>

<p>I changed the URL to another one in the same domain, and now it works in Firefox (after some cache-related false attempts) and in Chrome. It still does not work in IE8, despite the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms536942%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">official docs</a> say it is supported. I've found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5418498/813951">this SO answer</a> which states otherwise. It looks like the <code>onload</code> function is a more modern convenience method and the old way of checking the result is using <code>onreadystatechange</code> instead.</p>

<p>I guess I'll accept this answer as the solution unless a more detailed answer is provided.</p>
