<p>Right... I fixed this myself. </p>

<p>Apparently location.url() will not do a full refresh as seen in the documentation. </p>

<p><a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/" rel="nofollow">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/</a>$location</p>

<p>However you need to add the dependency $window and use the below code to make the page do a full page reload. </p>

<p>window.location.href = path + 'assessment';</p>
