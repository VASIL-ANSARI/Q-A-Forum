<p>There is no value in leaving the group stuff in your migration now that it is gone from your project.  I'd just edit the migration, drop everything from the db and migrate from scratch.  There isn't even a reason to comment it out (you are using version control right?)</p>

<p>Also, I believe the "rails way" with migrations is spelled "Arrrrgh!"</p>
