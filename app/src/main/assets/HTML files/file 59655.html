<p>It might be that you are using <code>keyboard.nextLine();</code>. In your code outside the while loop make sure that you are always using <code>.nextLine()</code> and nothing else.</p>

<p>Reasoning: If you use <code>.next()</code>, it'll only consume one word so the next time you call <code>.nextLine()</code>, it'll consume the end of that line. </p>
