<p>The flavor of a run-time library is specified in the compiler switch /M...</p>

<p>For dynamically linked CRT, it should be <strong>/MD</strong> for release config, and <strong>/MDd</strong> for debug. I would check that first, by looking into:</p>

<p>Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library</p>

<p>[added]
The Depends tool has a "Profile" command (Profile -> Start Profiling), where you can see a run-time information for dynamically loaded DLLs. Hope that will point you to the offender.</p>
