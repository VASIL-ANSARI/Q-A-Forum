<p>You are returning an empty list from your <code>get_queryset</code> method, so no objects are being returned in the list view and a specific object cannot be retrieved by the <code>pk</code>.</p>

<p>You appear to be doing a lot of unrelated things in your <code>get_queryset</code> method, and they are probably contributing to this issue. You shouldn't be doing any serialization there, DRF will handle that for you later. And you should be doing filtering in the <code>filter_queryset</code> method, or passing that off to DRF to do. You also can't return any responses from that method, only a queryset.</p>
