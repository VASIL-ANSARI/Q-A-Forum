<p>Whilst you can store your selected items in a Bundle with <code>onSaveInstanceState</code>, they have to implement the <code>Parcelable</code> interface.</p>

<p>If you don't want to be bound by what you retain, consider using a headless fragment. </p>

<pre><code>public class RetainedFragment extends Fragment {

    // data object we want to retain
    private MyDataObject data;

    // this method is only called once for this fragment
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // retain this fragment
        setRetainInstance(true);
    }

    public void setData(MyDataObject data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public MyDataObject getData() {
        return data;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can find out more <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, it explains why the use of headless fragments is preferable to just setting the "configChanges" attribute.</p>

<p>PS. as a general rule of thumb, only use <code>setRetainInstance(true)</code> for fragments that don't display a view!</p>
