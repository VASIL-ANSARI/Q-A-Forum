<p>This isn't exactly 100% an answer, but that specific library relies heavily on the <code>replace</code> directive flag, which has since been deprecated <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/eec6394a342fb92fba5270eee11c83f1d895e9fb" rel="nofollow">see here</a>. I downloaded the source and removed the replace flag on each directive, then with a few modifications to the css was able to achieve this.

<p>The css changes were on <code>.bc-calendar--days, .bc--calendar--days</code> <code>width : 50px; display: inline-flex;</code>. </p>
