<p>With auth.inMemoryAuthentication() you only define a user and its credentials.
If you want to use those, you must tell Spring Boot not to create its own defaults. Spring Boot's defaults are "user" and the password it displays in the console when you run the application.
You set your own default credentials inside application.properties file, like this:</p>

<pre><code>security.user.name=user
security.user.password=password
management.security.role=USER
</code></pre>
