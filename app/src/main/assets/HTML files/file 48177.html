<p>You can put <code>env</code> in the capture list using <code>[env]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong>, this is a <strong>very</strong> bad idea. The captured <code>env</code> is only valid for a particular thread. If your lambda is ever called on a different thread then the result will not be defined.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> capture the <code>JavaVM*</code> pointer in your lambda (which you can get from the passed <code>env</code>), and use <code>AttachCurrentThread</code> to retrieve an appropriate <code>env</code> within the lambda.</p>
