<p>Have you tried</p>

<pre><code>.Replace("&amp;quot;", @"""")
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: outside of a GridView (I'm using LinqPad)</p>

<pre><code>string xxx = "sd&amp;quot;fd";
Console.WriteLine(xxx.Replace("&amp;quot;", @""""));
</code></pre>

<p>returns: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sd"fd</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it's still appearing as \" then the battle is with the gridView - I haven't used one for ages but I'd be tempted to try and get the data right before binding to the grid, rather than looping through the rows and cells afterwards. </p>

<p>Edit2:
I was going to say it could be the the debugger escaping the quotes but I'm days behind on this one. Good spot @Rawling. At least it's now solved :)</p>
