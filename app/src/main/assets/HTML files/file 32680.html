<p>I found an answer by "Martin Davis" <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/postgis-users/kdWJRt0PYKc/SubzGr2ceZAJ" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This occurs because the geometries are invalid, and the current
  intersects algorithm used in JTS/GEOS has kittens when invalid
  geometries are used as input.  The core dump thing is unfortunate (and
  obviously got fixed in later versions).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, the same invalid data caused a core dump in PostGis v1.5, but raises an exception in v2.0</p>
