<p><strong>Update:</strong> NDK r9b added support for building libraries with -mhard-float.  See <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html" rel="nofollow">the NDK page</a>.</p>

<p>(Original answer follows.)</p>

<p>There's no easy way to do it.  The compiler would need to know per-method what calling conventions to use, and there's no "soft fp" attribute.  You could write (or generate) wrapper functions that convert between calling conventions, but that's awkward and annoying.</p>

<p>If you have a library that uses float, but doesn't have any functions that take float as arguments, and doesn't call out to external functions that take float (e.g. libc utility functions) -- essentially a black box that doesn't appear to an external viewer to use float at all -- then you should be able to build with "hard fp".</p>
