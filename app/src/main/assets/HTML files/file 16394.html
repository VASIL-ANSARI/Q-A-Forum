<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#value-def-generic-family" rel="nofollow">Generic font family names aren't supposed to be quoted</a> as they are considered keywords, not strings.</p>

<p>My guess is that either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Linux Mint contains a font family called "serif", which Chrome is using when you quote the name as a string in your CSS; or</p></li>
<li><p>It <em>doesn't</em> contain such a font, in which case Chrome falls back to some other system font that can either be the default serif font assigned to the browser or something else entirely.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It does not <em>directly</em> fall back to that default serif font <em>solely based on the word "serif"</em>. In other words, it's not interpreted the same as the unquoted keyword <code>serif</code>.</p>
