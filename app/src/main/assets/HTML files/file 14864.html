<p>The order of your handlers matter.  /.* matches every URI, hence you typically want that at the end.  Try the following ...</p>

<pre><code>handlers:
- url: /images
  static_dir: images

- url: /.*
  script: myscript.py
</code></pre>

<p>Also, make sure your image files are under the directory images as you specified in static_dir.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
