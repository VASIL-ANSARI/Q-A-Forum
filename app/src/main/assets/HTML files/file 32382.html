<p>You're looking for <a href="http://restkit.org/api/latest/Classes/RKConnectionDescription.html" rel="nofollow">foreign key connections</a>. This allows RestKit to search for managed objects with an existing identifier such that they can be reused rather than new objects created.</p>

<p>You need different objects for each ref, the objects need to have the ref value as a variable, the variable should be set as the unique identifier and the different objects should have relationships to each other.</p>
