<p>This happens when you try to execute the app from Eclipse while you're editting an XML file. It tries to compile the XML file instead and fails miserably, producing the .out.xml file.</p>

<p>It's a simple fix, just delete the .out.xml file in question, and make sure you're editing a .java file when you go to compile (or you can set the target in Build Configurations).</p>

<p>edit: Oh, and welcome to StackOverflow!</p>
