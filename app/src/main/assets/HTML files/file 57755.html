<p>First of all; thanks for the downvotes! Totally deserve it:D </p>

<p>As said in the original question, there are many similar questions on SO without good/accepted answers. I am posting my way to resolve it here in case it might help someone who, like me, are new to angular.</p>

<p>Secondly, Phil's comment about using un-minified version of angular during development is useful as it gives better error messages.</p>

<p>Thirdly, use a browser with better develop tool when learning or developing. This is partially why I got into this error without any clue how to fix it.</p>

<p>Finally, the real reason why I got this error is because I am opening the <code>index.html</code> file directly from a browser (Microsoft Edge, for some reason Chrome developer tool can't be open after an upgrade). In Edge, it only throws the error saying <code>Error: $compile:tpload</code>. Whereas if I use Chrome Canary, it throws two errors and the first errors saying <code>xmlhttprequest Cross Origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, https...</code> This makes sense when I am opening the html file directly from a browser. This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27742070/angularjs-error-cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-protocol-schemes">post</a> has a number of good answers to resolve this.</p>

<p>In short, two ways to solve this: a) use a local server e.g. http-server if you have node.js install to render the html 
b) Use <code>ng-template</code> directive to include the templates by adding the templates inside script tags in the index.html e.g. this is what I added to index.html for my case</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/ng-template" id="main.html"&gt;
        This is {{name}} 
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/ng-template" id="second.html"&gt;
        This is {{name}} 
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then when configuring the routing, simply use the template id e.g. </p>

<pre><code> app.config(function ($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider.when('/', {
            templateUrl: "main.html", //NOTE: use included template id
            controller: 'mainCtrl'
        })
        .when('/second', {
            templateUrl : 'second.html',
            controller : 'secondCtrl'
        })
        .otherwise({redirectTo : '/'});
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Then everything will work just fine when opening the html directly from a browser. For more information how this works see the official angular <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$templateCache" rel="nofollow">doc</a></p>
