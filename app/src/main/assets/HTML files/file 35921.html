<p>Ok, No proper answer so far. After struggling for lot of time, I just did further more research into struts2 jquery plugin it seems this plugin has lot of problems then solutions.
Any ways for this question: You need to make sure you are returning http code which is not equal to 200. This could be achieved by overriding default Exception handler interceptor and set the value to anything more than 400. I am setting it to 400 (Bad Request) then struts2 jquery plugin identifies it has error else it always treats it has success response though actually there was error raised in the back end. Once you raise the error you can have OnErrorTopics and process the response accordingly.</p>
