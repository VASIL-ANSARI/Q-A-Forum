<p>As far as I know </p>

<p>1 . ipa file size mostly depends on the Images size. </p>

<p>2 . So try to ask your designers to reduce the image for saving the memory or try to use the .jpg files for images except for splash screens,icons. No need to worry about the xib files .</p>

<p>3 . There is no need to worry about the size while releasing the app . Only issue is takes some time to download from the iTunes.</p>
