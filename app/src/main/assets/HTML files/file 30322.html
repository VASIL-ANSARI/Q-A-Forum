<p>My humble recommendation: try and see. One loop solution saves arithmetic operations around increment and test of i. Two loops will probably profit of better cache optimization, especially if arrays are aligned to memory pages. In such case each access may cause a cache miss and cache reload. Personally, if the speed really matters I would prefer two loops with some unfolding.</p>
