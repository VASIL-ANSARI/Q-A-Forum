<p><code>$q.all</code> is meant only to resolve when <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promiseall" rel="nofollow">all of the promises you pass it</a> have been resolved. It's good for, say, Only displaying your dashboard once all 4 widgets have loaded.</p>

<p>If you do not want that behavior, that is, you'd like to try to show as many columns as could successfully be resolved, You'll have to use a different method.</p>

<pre><code>loadedColumns = []

getCols = (columns) -&gt;
  for col in columns
    willAdd = addColumn(col) # add column needs to store columns in the "loadedColumns" area, then resolve
    willAdd.then buildUI
    willAdd.catch logError


# Because this method is debounced, it'll fire the first time there is 50 ms of idleness
buildUI = _.debounce -&gt;
  // Construct your UI out of "loadedColumns"
, 50
</code></pre>
