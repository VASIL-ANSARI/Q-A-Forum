<p>I have a doubt about your design.  Does your action return JSON in case of success and redirect to a JSP in case of error?  This doesn't sound fit to me, if you are already making a javascript ajax call it will not matter if you send a redirect with your http response.</p>

<p>I suggest you just return a JSON error code in event of an error and then deal with it properly in the client side (maybe a nice jQuery dialog popping up with an error message?)</p>
