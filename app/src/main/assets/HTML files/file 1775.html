  <p>Why the order by makes so massive difference and how to optimize it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>ORDER BY</code> needs to sort the resultset which may take long if it's big.</p>

<p>To optimize it, you may need to index the tables properly.</p>

<p>The index access path, however, has its drawbacks so it can even take longer.</p>

<p>If you have something other than equijoins in your query, or the ranged predicates (like <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> or <code>BETWEEN</code>, or <code>GROUP BY</code> clause), then the index used for <code>ORDER BY</code> may prevent the other indexes from being used.</p>

<p>If you post the query, I'll probably be able to tell you how to optimize it.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Rewrite the query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  *
FROM    View_Product_Joined j 
LEFT JOIN
        [dbo].[OPR_InventoryRules] irp
ON      irp.ID = j.skuid
        AND irp.InventoryRulesType = 'Product'
LEFT JOIN
        [dbo].[OPR_InventoryRules] irs
ON      irs.ID = j.NodeSiteID
        AND irs.InventoryRulesType = 'Store'
CROSS APPLY
        (
        SELECT  TOP 1 *
        FROM    OPR_PriceLookup pl
        WHERE   pl.siteID = j.NodeSiteID
                AND pl.skuid = j.skuid
                AND pl.RoleID IN (-1, 13)
        ORDER BY
                pl.RoleID desc
        ) pl
WHERE   SiteName = N'EcommerceSite'
        AND Published = 1
        AND DocumentCulture = N'en-GB'
        AND NodeAliasPath LIKE N'/Products/Cats/Computers/Computer-servers/%'
        AND NodeSKUID IS NOT NULL
        AND SKUEnabled = 1
ORDER BY
        NodeOrder ASC
</code></pre>

<p>The relation <code>View_Product_Joined</code>, as the name suggests, is probably a view.</p>

<p>Could you please post its definition?</p>

<p>If it is indexable, you may benefit from creating an index on <code>View_Product_Joined (SiteName, Published, DocumentCulture, SKUEnabled, NodeOrder)</code>.</p>
