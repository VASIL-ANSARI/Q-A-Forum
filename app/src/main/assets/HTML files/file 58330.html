<p>create a file camed "gradle.properties" set your desired properties in it  and put it in ".gradle" folder (where your gradle is installed)</p>

<p>in linux ".gradle" is normally in "/home/[]your_user_name]/.gradle"</p>

<p>then in android view of project structure of all your project this file will appear with the name "gradle.properties (Global Properties)"</p>

<p>UPADATE:</p>

<p>if you want a global script file rather than properties file you can use init script. create a file named "init.gradle" and put it in the same directory.</p>

<p>your init.gradle content would be like:</p>

<pre><code>allprojects {
buildDir = "whatever directory you want"
}
</code></pre>
