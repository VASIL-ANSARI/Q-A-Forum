<p>Javascript doesn't really have "associative arrays". <code>{}</code> returns a JavaScript <strong>object</strong>, which can have named properties and also a <strong>prototype</strong> which allows objects to inherit properties from other objects.</p>

<p>So performance will not be quite like that of a Hash table, since properties may be inherited from their prototype objects and searching for a given property by name may require traversing up the prototype tree before it is found.</p>

<p>This blog post may also provide some insight:</p>
