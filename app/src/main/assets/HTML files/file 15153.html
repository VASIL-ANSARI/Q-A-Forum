<p>I would let MVC generate the link for you: </p>

<pre><code>url: '@Url.Action("Method1", "Home")?lparam1=' + encodeURIComponent(1) + ... 
</code></pre>

<p>If your JS in an external file, you could set a global variable with the URL in your page and let the external file read it. Also, if your VS and IIS urls are different, you can give you site a Virtual Directory name in the project properties so that it matches your IIS directory, or better, yet, just have your project use IIS instead of Cassini (the built-in web server).</p>
