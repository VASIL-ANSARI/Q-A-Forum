<p>Arrays are <em>not</em> bounds checked by default in C++, regardless of whether they are statically or dynamically allocated. I used to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoundsChecker" rel="nofollow">BoundsChecker</a> for this with Visual C++. On Linux there is also valgrind, which is nice.</p>
