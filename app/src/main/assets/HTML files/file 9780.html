<p>I'll go right out and say it - manually editing the .class file is probably not the best idea. I mean, it can't really be that hard to recompile your program. Plus, if you just rename the class inside the original source, then your source will actually match the class file (why not?). And if you don't have the source, I'm sure you find a decent decompiler (just google it - there seems to be a few good ones). This would allow for easier renaming of classes.</p>

<p>However, if you <em>really, really</em> want to directly manipulate your compiled code, you might want to check out the <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/doc/faq.html#Q6" rel="nofollow">ASM</a> project. I believe it allows you to do what you want (though it seems a little complicated to me, and it would involve creating an external java program, just like you don't want).</p>

<p>If you're still bent on manually altering the .class file, then may I recommend you to <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html" rel="nofollow">The JAVA Virtual Machine Specification</a> (specifically chapter 4), where you can get all the yummy details of .class files.</p>
