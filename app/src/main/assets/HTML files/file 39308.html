<p>ImÂ´getting the same problem with that method, using visual studio.
The problem is not on trim.. the problem is with "WriteAllText" that allways add a space at the end of the file.</p>

<p>This seems kind of a bug in .net framework, you canÂ´t do anything to solve it with that method.
Instead of WriteAllText, try to use his siblin method To write in binary, you just need to get the binarys from your string and then save it.</p>
