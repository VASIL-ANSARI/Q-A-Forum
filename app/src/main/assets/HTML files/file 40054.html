<p>One solution could be to extend the existing devise models and controllers to also handle a token based authentication system. Based on the request type <code>html</code> or <code>json</code>, the app can choose to authenticate a user either by the authentication token and email or a combination of <code>username/email</code> and password. 
The authentication token could could be saved on the client side and reset only when the user logs out. 
I was recently working on the same problem and found these sources to be extremely useful. </p>
