<p>try the following</p>

<pre><code>print(i, end=' ')
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: If you want to print 10 numbers per line, you can do something like this</p>

<pre><code>if i%10==0:
    print('')
</code></pre>

<p>This will add a new line after every 10 numbers. (Note: This is assuming that <code>i</code> is the loop variable which is incremented once in every iteration)</p>
