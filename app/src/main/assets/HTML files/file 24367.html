<p>I take it you are using Jersey for your REST framework? </p>

<p>I think this is basically saying that since the Servlet has now constructed the Request object, Jersey now cant tell the difference between form parameters and query string params. </p>

<p>See this for some details: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STANBOL-437" rel="nofollow">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STANBOL-437</a></p>

<p>This begs the question - is this actually causing you an issue or are you just worried about the warning message?</p>
