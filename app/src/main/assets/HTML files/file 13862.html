<p>From the stack track reported in Eclipse, it seems a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> was initialized and is being thrown, Did the application you wrote ran into any problems?</p>

<p>Have you set breakpoints in constructor of the class?  you was not able to step into the constructor at all?</p>

<p>Were you using <code>Class.forname()</code> or import to introduce the class to JRE?   </p>
