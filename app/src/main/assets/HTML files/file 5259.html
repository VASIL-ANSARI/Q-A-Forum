<p>Essentially the only way to deal with this is to have a webserver running on localhost and to serve them from there.</p>

<p>It is insecure for a browser to allow an ajax request to access any file on your computer, therefore most browsers seem to treat "file://" requests as having no origin for the purpose of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same Origin Policy</a>"</p>

<p>Starting a webserver can be as trivial as <code>cd</code>ing into the directory the files are in and running:</p>

<pre><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</code></pre>
