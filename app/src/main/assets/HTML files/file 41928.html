<p>If you mean is there a way to CRUD Tenant objects, there isn't any because there isn't any such thing as a tenant object.  It's simply a string that operates as a discriminator in the database.  You need to pass in your own tenant string.</p>

<p>If you mean creating a user there isn't much too it.  You have to implement a RavenDB Repository. (see here <a href="https://github.com/brockallen/BrockAllen.MembershipReboot/tree/master/samples/NoSql/BrockAllen.MembershipReboot.RavenDb" rel="nofollow">Sample RavenDb implementation</a>), then simply call the create method on the UserAccountService</p>

<pre><code>        var securitySettings = new SecuritySettings
        {
            AllowLoginAfterAccountCreation = true,
            MultiTenant = true,
        };

        var config = new MembershipRebootConfiguration&lt;HierarchicalUserAccount&gt;(securitySettings);
        var repository = new RavenUserAccountRepository("");

        var uas = new UserAccountService&lt;HierarchicalUserAccount&gt;(config, repository);

        var userAccount = uas.CreateAccount("tenant_id", "username", "password", "test@test.com");
</code></pre>
