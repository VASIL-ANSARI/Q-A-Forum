<p>If it's a number, convert it to a string before hand, if it is a string you can do:</p>

<pre><code>positionArray = [];
binary.split('');

for (i = 0; i &lt; binary.length; i++){
  if (binary[i] == "1"){
    positionArray.push(i);
  }
}

return positionArray;
</code></pre>

<p>What i'm essentially doing is converting the string to an array (or number to a string to an array) of characters and then going through each entry to find the positions of each '1'.</p>

<p>Not sure you can do it this way with numbers, which is why I suggested converting it to a string before hand. It's just a rough solution and I bet there are much better ways of doing it but hope it helps.</p>
