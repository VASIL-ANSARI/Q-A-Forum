<p>That depends on how you define "expected". It's not how Apple intends it to work, but you're not the first person to run into this problem. In practice, yeah, it's expected at least some of the time.</p>

<p>A couple of things you should check:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does this condition persist even if you quit and re-launch the app? It could be that the instance is getting deleted but that your app isn't updating its UI properly. That would make it appear that the object was still there, until you relaunched the app.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a look at the "did import" notification you receive from iCloud. It should contain object IDs for inserted, updated, and deleted instances. Make sure it correctly indicates which object(s) have been deleted on the receiving end.</p></li>
<li><p>Check out your object handling to make sure you're not somehow holding on to the object that should have been deleted, or re-creating it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But keep in mind, if you're using Core Data with iCloud, <strong>you are asking for trouble</strong> and you may not be able to fix this. Core Data's iCloud integration is still not all that reliable. Expect problems, potentially too severe to fix.</p>
