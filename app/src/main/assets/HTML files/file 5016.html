<p>In general, they should be the same.  (With <em>the same</em> defined as close enough that it will never ever matter)</p>

<p>I would very strongly argue that you should encode your intent (i.e. having the static vs non-static-ness defined by whether this is a <strong>class</strong> constant versus an <strong>instance</strong> constant) rather than some arbitrary "performance enhancement"</p>

<p>If you find that this is a significant performance problem (and only AFTER you measure it!), I would classify it as a compiler / JVM defect and put the workaround (Swapping its static-ness) in place, with a comment indicating why.</p>
