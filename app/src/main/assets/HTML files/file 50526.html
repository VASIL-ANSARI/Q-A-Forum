<p>Your arrays aren't equal, by the standard used by arrays for determining equality. The standard used by arrays for determining equality is that two separately created arrays are <em>never</em> equal.</p>

<p>If you want separately created collections with equal elements to compare as equal, then use a collection type which supports that.</p>

<p>I recommend <code>HashSet&lt;T&gt;</code>, in your case <code>HashSet&lt;string&gt;</code>. It doesn't provide the <code>GetHashCode()</code> and <code>Equals()</code> behaviour you want directly, but it has a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb335475%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>CreateSetComparer()</code></a> method that provides you with a helper class that <em>does</em> give you hash code and comparer methods that do what you want.</p>

<p>Just remember that you cannot use this for a quick equality check. You can only use this for a quick <em>inequality</em> check. Two objects that are not equal may still have the same hash code, basically by random chance. It's only when the hash codes aren't equal that you can skip the equality check.</p>
