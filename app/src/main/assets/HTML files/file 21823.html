<p>You simply put the condition in the query:</p>

<pre><code>select *
  from table1
 where ( @city &gt; 0
         and column1 &lt; @city )
    or @city &lt;= 0 
</code></pre>

<p>Be warned though; this <em>can</em> confuse the optimizer slightly which might make your first query less performant. As with everything test before implementation.</p>
