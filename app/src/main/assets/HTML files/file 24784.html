<p>Main method should be static so you can't call non static methods from static method.</p>

<p>change checkSomething to static.</p>

<p>if main method is not static then we need to create instance to call the main method. To create instant again we need to excute some code! Thats why I think this starting point <code>Main</code> make Static.</p>
