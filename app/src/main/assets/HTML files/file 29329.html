<p>Your solution looks good. Actually, the only thing Android client needs to pass to web service is authentication token. With that authentication token you can do anything, of course with the permissions user granted. So, the Android client must ask user for the permissions your web service will use.</p>

<p>For your 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No. You should send FB authentication token one time only. After web server can retrieve user's info from FB, you can save these info to DB (within a simple User model) and then create session with your own authentication engine (cookies, API token, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>No. You don't need to register the web service as a FB app. As I mentioned above, with FB authentication token you can do many things. You can also see the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/publishing/" rel="nofollow">Facebook Graph API</a></p></li>
</ol>
