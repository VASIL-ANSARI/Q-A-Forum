<p>It becomes a mess after a while, but you can give CSS directives precedence over subsequent directives using <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/css/f/blcssfaqimportn.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>!important</code></a>.</p>

<pre><code>.nav li a:hover{ color:#00f !important; }
</code></pre>

<p>Since you mention the property being crossed off in firebug, I suspect this is your issue.</p>
