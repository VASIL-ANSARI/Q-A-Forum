<p>No to both questions. You could code something (like how app.config allows sections to be imported, or how xslt handles includes/imports), but this is not inbuilt onto any XML spec and would not match the existing schema. You'd have to do everything yourself, basically.</p>

<p>If you really wanted to go this route, writing a custom XmlReader that recognised a specific element (in a specific xmlns) and silently merging at that point - would perhaps be the beat choice.</p>
