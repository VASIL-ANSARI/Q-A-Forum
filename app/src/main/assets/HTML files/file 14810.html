<p>What if your array consisted of C structs of the form:</p>

<pre><code>struct slot {
  int type;
  char *data;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have an array that can contain arbitrary types of data, as long as you can represent them as pointers-to-char.</p>

<p>This isn't, of course, how Python does it; the point is that there doesn't have to be any connection between how your application handles data and how your implementation language handles data.</p>
