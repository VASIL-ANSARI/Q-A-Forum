<p>There are a few issues with the code. </p>

<ol>
<li>You are adding both NSURL and name string to the photos array but when reading you are expecting all of them to be photos. 
I would recommend create a data structure called Photo which contains</li>
</ol>

<p>@interface PhotoClass :NSObject</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSURL *url;

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *price

@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *photo;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>That way you can do the following when parsing your data.</p>

<pre><code>PhotoClass *current = [PhotoClass alloc];
current.name = [item objectForKey:@"name"];
current.url = [item objectForKey:@"url"];
current.price = [item objectForKey:@"price"];
current.photo = [item objectForKey:@"photo"];

// Add to array
[photos addObject:current];
</code></pre>

<p>And then when you are ready to display use the url from each PhotoClass object.</p>

<p>The next issue in your code is with the image view setup. First of all You will need to create as many ImageViews. each one needs to be offset to the other can be visible behind that image. Plus the image view seems to be getting set in many diff ways. Is that just a typo? : </p>

<pre><code>for (PhotoClass *photo in photos)
{

    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(),^{

        UIView *dView = [[UIView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(50,50,258,229)];

        // The frame of each of the frames needs to be offset a little .. 
        // so you need to figure out how to calculate that for each image.
        UIImageView *imageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
        imageView.image = [UIImage imageWithData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:photo.url]];
       [dView addSubview:imageView];
       [self.view addSubview:dView];
    ....

    }];
}
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of the loop you should have as many image views in view as objects in photos. </p>
