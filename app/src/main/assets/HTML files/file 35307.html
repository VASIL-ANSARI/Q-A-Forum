<p>I believe you need to get the number of distinct animals for each food, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.foodID
      ,NAME
      ,b.qtyperday * 7 AS "weekly consumption"
      ,COUNT(DISTINCT animalID)
       AS "animals eating this food"
      ,AVG(( b.qtyperday * 7) / COUNT(DISTINCT animalID))
       AS "average consumption"
FROM food a, feed b
WHERE a.foodID = b.foodID
GROUP BY foodID
</code></pre>

<p>But for further help I think you need to post some sample data and some expected outputs.</p>
