<p>Hmm really hard and not a good thing i think but : </p>

<pre><code>var app = angular.module('MyApp', []);

console.log(app._invokeQueue[0][2][1]);
</code></pre>

<p>_invokeQueue is an array if you do that for each entry getting the [0][2][1] you'll see the name of each provider in your module.</p>

<p>If you lok the _invokeQueue alone you'll see a lot of things that you'll like the name of the provider like below but his type too (directive, controller, ...);</p>

<p>But you feel that this is a tricky thing not a good thing a really bad practice but anyway really fun.</p>

<p>Don't use it in production !</p>
