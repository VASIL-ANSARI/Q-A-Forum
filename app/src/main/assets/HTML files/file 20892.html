<p>Weak reference is used when you need to break a reference cycle. In the example you show, there is no reference cycle. But I assume you want to keep the <code>passedPerson</code>. </p>

<p>You could use weak references to <code>man</code> and <code>women</code> and keep a strong reference on the <code>passedPerson</code>. Then you can nil out the <code>passedPerson</code> as you are finished with them.</p>
