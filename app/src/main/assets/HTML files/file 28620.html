<p>Yes, you can. <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/deployingApplet.html">This page</a> shows how to do it (well, most of it; you also need <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/html.html">this page</a>). There are two main steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put the <code>Permissions</code> and <code>Codebase</code> attributes in your manifest file:</p>

<pre>Permissions: sandbox
Codebase: *.myserver.com</pre>

<p>These new attributes were introduced in Java 7 Update 25 and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/no_redeploy.html">are discussed here</a>. The first page linked above just shows <code>Codebase: myserver.com</code>, but most sites are going to want the wildcard above. (I don't know if the <code>Codebase</code> attribute is required for sandboxing the applet, but it seems like a good idea for most signed applets anyway.)</p>

<p>Then use that manifest file when building your jar, like:</p>

<pre>jar cvfm YourJarFile.jar your_manifest_file.txt classes_and_such</pre>

<p>Those attributes will wind up in the MANIFEST.MF file in the jar, which tells the Java runtime to keep the applet sandboxed.</p></li>
<li><p>In your <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag, you have to specify the <code>permissions</code> param, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/html.html">as discussed here</a>:</p>

<pre>&lt;applet code='yourAppletClass' archive='YourJarFile.jar'>
    &lt;param name="permissions" value="sandbox">
&lt;/applet></pre>

<p>Without this second step, a signed applet requesting sandboxed permissions in the jar but not the tag is prevented from being run with a dialog box titled "The Application Cannot Be Run" giving "Reason: JAR manifest requested to run in sandbox only."</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you do both steps above, the user gets a much more reassuring message (and presumably the applet remains sandboxed):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This application will run with limited access that is intended to protect your computer and personal information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and if they check the relevant checkbox trusting the publisher and location, they don't see it again when they next open their browser and run your applet.</p>
