<p>This is not really an answer but a fix.. I registered the <code>onConsoleMessage</code>, <code>onError</code>, <code>onResourceError</code> and <code>onResourceTimeout</code> events and noticed and error which indicated that the function was not initialized properly.</p>

<p>I used</p>

<pre><code>load_gantt = function(a = 'default_a', b = 'default_b'){ /* ... */};
</code></pre>

<p>but PhantomJS does not get along with this... It has to be without the default values. I don't know why but it works now.</p>

<pre><code>load_gantt = function(a, b){ /* ... */};
</code></pre>
