<p>I have been looking for a bundle myself, but haven't found one yet. Seems to me you have to bundle them manually if you want to have them all in one js. file.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was thinking about creating a grunt task (or similar) to fetch all dependencies and merge them into one file. I know you want to use a CDN, but just wanted to share that thought.</p>

<p><em>update</em><br>
For anyone interested in the latter, just came across this <a href="https://github.com/vijeysrc/grunt-fetch-from-cdn/">grunt-fetch-from-cdn plugin</a>. Haven't tried it myself yet, but looks interesting.</p>
