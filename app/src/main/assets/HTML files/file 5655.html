<p>It's been awhile since I've had to use qmake (long live <a href="http://cmake.org/" rel="nofollow">CMake</a>!), but can't you just set the <code>INCLUDEPATH</code> variable in your <code>.pro</code> file, i.e., do something like:</p>

<pre><code>INCLUDEPATH += ./sources
INCLUDEPATH += ./headers
INCLUDEPATH += ../utils/include
# (etc, etc.)
</code></pre>

<p>Then just point the entry in your <code>SOURCES</code> var at the <code>sources</code> folder like so:</p>

<pre><code>SOURCES = sources/one.cpp \
          sources/two.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>It's not clear to me why you're using <code>TEMPLATE = subdirs</code>.  It doesn't seem like it should be necessary in your case. Can't you just use <code>TEMPLATE = app</code> (or <code>TEMPLATE = lib</code>) and be done with it?  Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>QT += dbus
TEMPLATE = app
TARGET = example

INCLUDEPATH += ./sources

SOURCES += sources/one.cpp \
           sources/two.cpp
</code></pre>
