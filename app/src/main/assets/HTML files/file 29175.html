<p>As @Smit says, and per your <code>NullPointerException</code></p>

<p>You've never actually initialized your <code>WebDriver</code> object, and you're attemting to cast a null object, to JavaScriptExecutor.</p>

<p>Depending on what sort of browser you want to use, you are able to do..</p>

<pre><code>WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); // etc...
</code></pre>

<p>Also, why are you attempting to use 2 driver objects? You should only have 1.  Keep your object named <code>driver</code>.</p>
