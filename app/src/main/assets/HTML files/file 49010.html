<p>Multiple things are missing from your code.</p>

<p>1 - Make sure you start the job server before submitting any jobs. Call <strong>startJobServer()</strong> on the jobCollection on the server.</p>

<pre><code>Jobs = JobCollection( 'jobQueue' );

if ( Meteor.isServer ) {
  Jobs.allow( {
    admin: function ( userId, method, params ) {
      return true;
    },
  } );
  Jobs.startJobServer();
}
</code></pre>

<p>2 - You need to implement the processing of the job. A job is nothing more than a label with data attached scheduled to run at a certain point in time. The handler implements the job logic. In your case you would need something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var workers = Job.processJobs('jobQueue', 'insertItems',
  function (job, cb) {
    insertData = job.data;
    // do anything with the job data here.
    // when done, call job.done() or job.fail()

    job.done(); // when done successfully
    job.fail("with reason or error"); //when failing

    // Be sure to invoke the callback
    // when work on this job has finished
    cb();
  }
);    
</code></pre>
