<p>If you get a <code>SocketTimeoutException</code> on a socket you're otherwise planning to re-use for another request, close it and <em>don't</em> reuse it for another request. Get rid of all that shutdown and read code inside the catch handler and just close the socket. THen you can't possibly get the 'wrong response' for a subsequent request on the same socket.</p>

<p>If you're getting lots of timeouts, your timeout is too short. Typically it should be double the expected service time for the request concerned.</p>
