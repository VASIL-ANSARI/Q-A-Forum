<p>Yes, this is possible.  I can confirm I have done this successfully on iOS.  A couple of tips to get it running in the background:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get this working in the foreground first.</p></li>
<li><p>You only have 5 seconds of background running time after entering/exiting a region, so make sure your web service returns quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Add NSLog statements to your callbacks to figure out what is and is not completing in the background.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If the above does not help, post your code in the callback.</p>
