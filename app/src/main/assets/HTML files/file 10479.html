<p>Briefly - no. </p>

<p>If you can decrypt/extract any string from your apk, potentially anyone with enough knowledge may look through your code and re-cosntruct the algorithm you use to extract those strings. And then extract them by herself.</p>

<p>Of course you may use some tricks to make it harder. What tricks can be used is actually up to you, Android doesn't provide any by default (AFAIK).</p>
