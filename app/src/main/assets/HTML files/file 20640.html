<p>The jQuery.form plugin uses <code>multipart/form-data</code> encoded request when uploading a file which a classic ASMX web service cannot understand. You could replace your web service with a generic ASHX handler (<code>IHttpHandler</code>) which would allow you to handle any request format. Or even better if you don't want to get as low-level as handlers you could use some of the new frameworks such as ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET WEB API, WCF, ServiceStack, ... which all will happily handle <code>multipart/form-data</code> encoded requests.</p>
