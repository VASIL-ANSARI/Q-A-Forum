<p><strong>Requests to the server:</strong> Looking at the source code, it looks like the server's handler function is not called until the request is complete, regardless of whether or not it is sent in a chunked fashion.  So you're out of luck there.</p>

<p><strong>Server responses:</strong> The server response can be sent in a streaming fashion, but you need to voluntarily yield control in the handler thread for this to work (e.g. by calling <code>gevent.sleep()</code> after each chunk).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>gevent</code> does not seem to provide a way to wait for a given chunk to finish sending before starting on the next chunk, so if you generate data faster than it can be sent you may run into memory issues.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that the above information refers to <code>gevent&lt;1.0</code>, which uses the <code>libevent</code> library, and is not applicable to more recent versions of <code>gevent</code>.  The current version of <code>gevent</code> no longer includes an <code>http</code> module so the question is moot.</p>
