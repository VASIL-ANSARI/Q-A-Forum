<p>You receive the error because you're trying to access an iVar as a property. Access it as iVar and the problem goes away.</p>

<p>Edit: an instance variable is accessed either via self->someVariable, or directly as someVariable, assuming there is no other local variables named someVariable. The arrow notation is needed as self represents a pointer, thus if your class is MyClass, self has the type *MyClass. A property on the other hand can be accessed as self.propertyName.</p>
