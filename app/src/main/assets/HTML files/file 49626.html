<p>It's not a nice way to do it but you could use <code>globals</code> for this.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def updateDict(dict, value):
...     a = globals()[value]
...     dict[value] = a
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; response = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; error = "some error"
&gt;&gt;&gt; updateDict(response, 'error')
&gt;&gt;&gt; response
{'error': 'some error'}
</code></pre>

<p>I'd seriously consider if you need to do this though. It's not nice and I doubt it'd work too well (if at all) across modules.</p>
