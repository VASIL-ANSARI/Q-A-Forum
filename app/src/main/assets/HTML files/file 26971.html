<p>just don't SUM(onsitedate). If I understant your question corretly</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
 a.username,
 DatePart ('q', a.[onsitedate]) AS [qtr],
 COUNT(b.[onsitedate]) onsitedate_count,
 SUM(a.onsitehours)
FROM clocktable a
  join (SELECT username, [onsitedate])
        FROM clocktable GROUP BY username,[onsitedate]) b
    on a.username = b.username
WHERE a.onsitedate BETWEEN #2013-01-01# AND #2013-12-31#
GROUP BY a.username, DatePart('q',a.[onsitedate]), b.onsitedate_count
ORDER BY a.username, DatePart('q',a.[onsitedate]) 
</code></pre>
