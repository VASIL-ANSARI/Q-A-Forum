<p><code>id1</code> and <code>id2</code> are actually <code>NSString</code>s, even if they are casted to <code>id</code> and passed to your function (this approach is useful because you can define your <code>compare</code> function in order to sort custom objects). </p>

<p>It doesn't make sense to call <code>stringValue</code> on a string (and, in fact, <code>NSString</code> do not have a member function named <code>stringValue</code>).</p>

<p>To work with strings just cast  back to <code>NSString</code>s.</p>

<pre><code>NSString *s1 = (NSString*) id1;
NSString *s2 = (NSString*) id2;
</code></pre>

<p>This is not strictly necessary (you can even work directly with <code>id1</code> and <code>id2</code>) but casting will avoid you to get compiler warnings (also it's a clearer code).</p>
