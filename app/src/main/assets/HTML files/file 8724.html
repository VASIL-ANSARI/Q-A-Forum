<p>You can think and plan as long as you want, but you won't know for certain what's best until you try, benchmark, and compare your options. That said, it certainly sounds like you're definitely on the right track.</p>

<p><em>composite key</em><br>
Your "country-city-name" composite key appears to be in the most useful order, since it's ordered from broadest to narrowest selection criteria. I'm sure you did this intentionally, as a composite key's values can only be used from left to right. Because <em>name</em> does not come first in that index, you'd need a separate key for just <em>name</em>, as you noted.</p>

<p><em>index values of</em> NULL<br>
According to <a href="http://imysql.cn/docs/High_Performance_MySQL/0596003064/hpmysql-CHP-4-SECT-1.html#hpmysql-CHP-4-ITERM-1329" rel="nofollow">imysql.cn</a>, "allowing NULL values in the index really doesn't impact performance." That's simply stated as an aside without data or reference, so I don't know how/if they'd proven that.</p>

<p><em>splitting the table</em><br>
If there's a lot of other data mixed in with the restaurant records, sure, it could slow things a bit. If you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_%28database_architecture%29" rel="nofollow">shard</a> the table into identically-structured "restaurant" and "other" tables, you could still easily query their combined data if necessary with a simple UNION. Unless you have an idea of the data/slowdown to expect, I'd prefer to avoid sharding the table unless necessary, at least for the sake of simplicity/uniformity.</p>

<p>Are there any foreseeable queries that current indexing wouldn't account for, such as a city without the country? If so, be sure to index appropriately to cover all foreseeable cases. You didn't mention it, but I assume you'll also have an index on <em>genre</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ultimately, you need to generate lots of test data and try it out.</em> (Determine how much data you could eventually expect, and generate <em>at least</em> triple that much test data to put the system through its paces.) From what you've described, the design sounds pretty good, but testing may reveal unexpected issues, places where you'd benefit from different indexing, etc. With any issue found, you'd have a specific goal to accomplish rather than simply pondering all what-if scenarios.</p>
