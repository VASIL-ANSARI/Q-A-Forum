<p>The simplest solution to your problem is to make sure that all objects are valid when you add them to the store. Collect the information you need to create a valid object first, and only then add a new object along with all the required information.</p>

<p>Also, consider carefully whether you need to require all the properties that you currently do. If you have two entities that each have a relationship to the other, do you need to require both relationships? Could you make one of the relationships optional? That can help you avoid a chicken and egg problem where it's impossible to add objects for either entity because none of the other type exist yet.</p>
