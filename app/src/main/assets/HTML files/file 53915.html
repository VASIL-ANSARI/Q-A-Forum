<p>This should be easy. To do that, you need to remember what functions you used before. Your algorithm should work like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an array [0, 1, 2, 3]</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6274339/how-can-i-shuffle-an-array-in-javascript#6274381">Shuffle it</a>.</li>
<li>Run your functions according to the shuffled order.</li>
<li>When your shuffled order is empty, repeat from step 1.</li>
</ol>
