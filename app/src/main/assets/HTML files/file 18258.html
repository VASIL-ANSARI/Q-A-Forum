<ul>
<li>CSS shapes,</li>
<li>text in a <em>safe zone</em> in a CSS shape and</li>
<li>text in CSS shapes where text will fill available space as much as possible </li>
</ul>

<p>are three very different beasts!</p>

<p>The shapes you refer to are made with one constraint: a single element is used. This leads in some cases to 0x0 px elements with background-color entirely applied onto pseudo-elements. Obviously your text won't display properly in these cases and you'll have to redo entirely these shapes with other methods.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://html.adobe.com/webstandards/cssregions/" rel="nofollow">CSS regions</a></strong> has been proposed by Adobe to W3C. Just wait a few years for standardisation and implementation :)</p>

<p>During this long wait, Tantek Celik and Eric Meyer who played with blank divs ~10 years ago (example: <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/curvelicious/demo.html" rel="nofollow">http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/curvelicious/demo.html</a> ) are still relevant.<br>
Provided you want to achieve designs that will explode when <em>larger text</em> is selected by users in IE8 or with a single level of zoom text in Firefox. Though with fluid sizing in <code>em</code> maybe?</p>

<p>I'd use <strong>SVG</strong> if I was forced to style text into such complicated shapes.</p>
