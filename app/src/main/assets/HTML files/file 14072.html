<p>I figured out how to do it in a semi nice manner. 
because the list of stored input values that appears is not part of <code>$(document)</code> and i couldnt find the name for the element (i dont think it has a name you can just turn it off with <code>autocoplete="off"</code>) it was challenging but possible.
I simply made a function that executes every time you hover in to the document</p>

<pre><code>$(document).hover(function() {

if(!isWhitespace($("#inputId")){
//blur label
}


},function(){});  
</code></pre>

<p>This works
even when you move your mouse out of the browser and use the keyboard to select an item from the stored value list.</p>

<p>If anybody finds a better solution feel free to respond </p>
