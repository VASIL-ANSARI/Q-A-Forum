<p>OK So what's happening is that Semantic UI is overriding your custom style:

<p>As you can see your custom CSS is crossed out in chrome developer tools.</p>

<p>You have two choices</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" rel="nofollow">Make your CSS Selector more specific</a></li>
<li>Include <code>!important</code> after your style e.g.  <code>border:1px solid red !important</code>;</li>
</ol>

<p>Option 1 is more preferable. I've made a JSFiddle here with an <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/40y2kvL6/" rel="nofollow">example</a>. By adding <code>red-border</code> I've made the style more specific than the Semantic UI CSS.</p>

<p>When you find your CSS does not seem to be working, use the dev tools to see if it shows up, and if it does what is overriding it.</p>
