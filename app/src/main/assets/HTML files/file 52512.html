<p>So I found a chrome browser plug-in that is allowing me to accomplish what I want.</p>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija" rel="nofollow">Custom JavaScript</a></p>

<p>I'm performing the new window opening with JS on my site and with the plugin I can create custom scripts to run on specified websites. So Custom JS is performing the click for me. </p>

<p>Its a bit of a hack but its giving me the result I need. </p>
