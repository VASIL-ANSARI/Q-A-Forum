<p>You cannot bind table- or column names in your prepared statement, just values.</p>

<p>You would have to check the <code>$stat</code> value against a white-list and insert it directly in the sql statement.</p>

<p>By the way, you can tell <code>mysqli</code> to throw exceptions so that you don't have to check the return value of every database call manually. Just add this before you open your database connection:</p>

<pre><code>mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);
</code></pre>
