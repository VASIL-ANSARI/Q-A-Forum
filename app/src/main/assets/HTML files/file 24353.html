<pre><code>img {
    border: 0 none;
    height: auto;
    max-width: 100%;
    vertical-align: middle;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the CSS for img from bootstrap.  The image is always going to be sized at 100% of the width of its containing block, with the height keeping in proportion.  But this is not the case when the image is absolutely positioned and the containing element is statically positioned.</p>

<p>So change your CSS so that the containing element for those images is not statically positioned:</p>

<pre><code>.chapter1 {
    border: 30px;
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
    position: relative;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:
Bad explanation on my part of bootstrap's rule for img.</p>

<p>This is better:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of just rendering at its native width and overflowing its containing box, the image would render at its native dimensions as long as its width didnât exceed the width of its container.</p>
</blockquote>
