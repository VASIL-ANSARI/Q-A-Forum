<p>Because I was completely new to this I didn't had a clue that I needed to initialise and populate the list. Thx to @dellywheel for pointing me in the right direction!</p>

<p>Here's the working code:</p>

<pre><code>    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public ActionResult Create([Bind(Include = "ReservationId,ArrivalDate,LeaveDate,CampingSpotId,UserId,PersonsAmount,FacilityType,FacilityPrice")] Reservation reservation, int[] SelectedFacilities) 
    {
        //Instantiate our facilities list!
        reservation.FacilitiesList = new List&lt;Facility&gt;();

        foreach (int facId in SelectedFacilities)
        {
            var facType = _facilityrepository.GetFacilityType(facId);
            var facPrice = _facilityrepository.GetFacilityPricePerDay(facId);
            reservation.FacilitiesList.Add(new Facility { FacilityId = facId, FacilityType = facType, FacilityPrice = facPrice} );
        }

        _reservationrepository.Add(reservation);
        return View() //code omitted 
    }
</code></pre>
