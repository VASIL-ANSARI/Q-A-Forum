<p>As to why it happened:</p>

<p>first the parser reads <code>items + 1</code>, so fine and dandy, it's <code>4</code></p>

<p>then it concatenates with <code>' - '</code>, so now you have <code>4 -</code></p>

<p>then it sees <code>+ items</code>, at this moment, you are dealing with <code>String</code>, so it concatenates with 3 (as <code>items</code> is 3), so you have <code>4 - 3</code></p>

<p>then you have another concatenation with <code>3</code>, but the left operand is a <code>string</code>, so the right operand is type casted into <code>String</code> as well, so you have <code>4 - 33</code></p>

<p>To achieve what you want, you need to enclose the inner operations:</p>

<pre><code>$('#div').html((items + 1) + ' - ' + (items + 3));
</code></pre>
