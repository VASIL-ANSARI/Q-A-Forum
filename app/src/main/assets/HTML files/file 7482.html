<p>If the number is too big for a 32 bit variable, then you either use more bits (either by storing in a bigger variable, or using multiple variables) or you give up precision and store it in a float.  Since Y can be MAX_INT, by definition you can't multiply it by a number greater than 1 and still have it fit in a 32 bit int.</p>
