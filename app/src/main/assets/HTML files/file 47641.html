<p>There seems to be a script doing something on the 'load' event so I just delayed the value change in the input fields by 500 ms </p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function(){

                    //Set "Title" to sever name that was highlighted on rightclick
                    var title = document.getElementsByName("title");
                    title[0].value=selectedText;
}, 500);
</code></pre>

<p>not very elegant but gets the job done</p>
