<p>Although this is purely aesthetic, the red labeling of frameworks and products is a common issue with Xcode. They are marked red because the file that this item refers to does not exist.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <code>File Inspector</code> in the Xcode window at the right. Below <code>Identity and Type</code> it says <code>Full Path</code>. This points to a build folder that probably doesn't exist or at least does not contain <code>libRestKit.a</code>.</p>

<p>Now set the <code>Location</code> to <code>Relative to Group</code>. Usually, this fixes the problem, because it will now look in the correct build folder, taking into account the target and active schema.</p>
