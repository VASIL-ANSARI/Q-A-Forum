  <p>I did capitalize the Admin to reflect that</p>

<p>What do you mean by that? The admin role should be capitalized in the <code>authorization_rules.rb</code> file as the <code>role_symbols</code> method seems to be working and is returning <code>[:Admin]</code> as an array of user roles. You can see that in the log:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>(roles [:Admin], privileges [:show], context :companies)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the current user has the roles specified, but needs at least one of the listed privileges to access the context/resource. So your <code>authorization_rules.rb</code> has to have a capitalized role <code>:Admin</code>.</p>
