<p>It seems that you put <code>)</code> at wrong position. Shouldn't it be like following?</p>

<pre><code>def teams_by_event(request, shorthand):
    code = TeamsByEvent.objects.filter(shorthand=shorthand)
    raw_query = '''SELECT event_name, team_number
                   FROM teams_by_event
                   WHERE team_number IN (
                   SELECT team_number FROM teams_by_event
                   WHERE shorthand = % s)''' % [code]

    for event in TeamsByEvent.objects.raw(raw_query):
        print (event.team_number, event.event_name)

    return render(request, 'event-info.html', {'info': info})
</code></pre>
