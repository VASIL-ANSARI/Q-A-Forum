<p>In your function <code>-(BOOL) matrixTest</code> you insert strings. This is perfectly fine. But when you print the values in your grid array, you specify "%3g". "%g" prints, as far as I remember, a float or a double, and will not work when your values are strings. If you substitute %g with %@, it should work.</p>

<p>Regarding the variables containing width and height of array: you have not provided your implementation of how you set these variables, so it is impossible to know what the problem is.</p>

<p>As a side note, you have some other errors as well. in <code>-(void) imprimirMatriz</code> you have the line <code>NSMutableArray *temp = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];</code>, but you later on assign <code>temp</code> to something else. This causes a memory leak. Alloc/init is not neccessary when you assign a variable to something from an NSArray.</p>

<p>As an answer to your comment: you can only insert objects into an NSMutableArray (or NSArray for that sake). When you write <code>[myArray addObject:1]</code>, you try to insert a primitive integer. Primitives (int, bool, char, float, double and so on) are not objects, and therefore cannot be inserted into an NSArray or NSMutableArray. Instead, you can insert an int by wrapping it in an instance of NSNumber. The following line will work: <code>[myArray addObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1]];</code>. You can also have floats and other types in an NSNumber object.
