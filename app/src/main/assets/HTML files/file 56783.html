<p>The matching of first method <code>TMember</code> and second method <code>TSourceCollection</code> is of equal value for any type that satisfies the <code>where TSourceCollection : IEnumerable&lt;TMember&gt;</code> condition.</p>

<p>The type <code>TMember[]</code> is a more detailed type match for <code>byte[]</code> compared to <code>TMember</code>. So this should be the point where the second method scores better than the first. Consequently, this 'better' match outrules the fact, that method two has more generic parameters.</p>
