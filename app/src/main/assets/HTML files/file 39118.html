<blockquote>
  <p>Facebook doesn't notify you that a previously issued access token has
  become invalid. Unless you have persisted the <strong>expiry</strong> time passed to
  your App along with the access token, your app may only learn that a
  given token has become invalid is when you attempt to make a request
  to the API. Also, in response to certain events that are
  security-related, access tokens may be invalidated before the expected
  expiration time.</p>
