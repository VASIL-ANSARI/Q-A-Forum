<p>You should use a Backbone.Model . If your model is already a Backbone.Model, just use <code>model.set( anObjectWithTheChanges )</code> and that will trigger a <code>change</code> event in the model.</p>

<p>Then, just add some code in your view's <code>initialize</code> function to listen to the changes in your model. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>this.listenTo( this.model, 'change', this.render);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>render</code> is the method in your view in charge of the refresh.</p>
