<p>I didn't try this, but I would do it like this:</p>

<p>After getting the bool from CGRectIntersectsRect, multiply this overlapping UIImageView x and y by the width and height of it.</p>

<p>And since you can't use frame property after changing the transformation, you will need to multiply the width and height by 1.5 for the maximum amount of rotation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warning: If the transform property is not the identity transform, the
  value of this property is undefined and therefore should be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might move some view father than other, but you will be certain all views will be moved outside the UIImageView's frame.</p>

<p>If you try it and it doesn't work, post some code and I will help you with it.</p>

<p>EDIT: For views that their x,y less than your UIImageView's x,y you will need to subtract the offset.</p>
