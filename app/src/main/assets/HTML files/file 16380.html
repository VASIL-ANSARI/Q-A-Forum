<p>It seems to be the delay before a response that was causing the problem.  I used this guide <a href="http://phplens.com/phpeverywhere/?q=node/view/254" rel="nofollow" title="this guide">Easy Parallel Processing in PHP</a> to set up a multi-tasking php configuration.  This way I have a script that just counts and echos the elapsed seconds while the other one does the job processing.  The problem is now resolved.  </p>
