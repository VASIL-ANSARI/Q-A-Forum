<p>Your are getting the 'year' value as an <code>int</code> like this </p>

<pre><code>int year = DatePicker.getYear();
</code></pre>

<p>So when you create your bundle you need to pass this year value like this - </p>

<pre><code>bundle2.putInt("akey2", year);
</code></pre>

<p>Where as you are creating a new String <code>String value = "year";</code> and using that. That is why you are getting null values in other fragment. You want the actual <code>int</code> value of the year not the String "year" itself.</p>

<p>Also you can put as many values as you want like - </p>

<pre><code>bundle2.putInt("akey2", year);
bundle2.putInt("akey3", day);
</code></pre>
