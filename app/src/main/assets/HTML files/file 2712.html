<p><code>(void)0</code> (+<code>;</code>) is a valid, but 'does-nothing' C++ expression, that's everything. It doesn't translate to the <code>no-op</code> instruction of the target architecture, it's just an empty statement as placeholder whenever the language expects a complete statement (for example as target for a jump label, or in the body of an <code>if</code> clause).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> (updated based on Chris Lutz's comment)</p>

<p>It should be noted that when used as a macro, say</p>

<pre><code>#define noop ((void)0)
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>(void)</code> prevents it from being accidentally used as a value like</p>

<pre><code>int x = noop;
</code></pre>

<p>For the above expression the compiler will rightly flag it as an invalid operation. GCC spits <code>error: void value not ignored as it ought to be</code> and VC++ barks <code>'void' illegal with all types</code>.</p>
