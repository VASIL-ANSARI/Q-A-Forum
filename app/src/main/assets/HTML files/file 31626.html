<p>To find IP-addresses you can use python module <code>netifaces</code>,
but to del them you need to run <code>ip</code> anyway.</p>

<p>Direct translation of your script to Python looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>for line in subprocess.Popen(
              ["ip", "addr", "show", "dev", "eth0"],
              stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0].splitlines():
  if 'inet' in line:
     subprocess.Popen(["ip", "addr", "del", line.split()[1], "dev", "eth0"])
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you need to add different error checks and exception handling to make your code stable.</p>
