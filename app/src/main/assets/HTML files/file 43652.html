<p>You can't access the <strong>Node</strong> class from outside because it is declared <strong>private</strong> inside your <strong>LZWBinTree</strong> class. If you want to make it accessible, change the access modifier. From:</p>

<pre><code>private:
    class Node{ ...
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>

<pre><code>public:
    class Node{ ...
</code></pre>

<p>Once you do that, you can create instances of your node class by accessing it through the class it is in, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>LZWBinTree::Node n;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not quite sure how dynamic allocation can help you in this case.</p>
