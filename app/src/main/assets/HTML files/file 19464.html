<p>You aren't terminating your strings. You need to add the null-terminator: <code>\0</code>, after the last character for each line.</p>

<p>In your first loop, you determine enough space for the longest line, including a newline character.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you want to <em>keep</em> the newlines in your input array, just add 1 to <code>max_char_per_line</code>, and add the null-terminator after the newline character when you finish each line in your second loop.</p></li>
<li><p>If you <em>don't</em> need the newline in your input array, instead simply use that space for the null-terminator.</p></li>
</ul>
