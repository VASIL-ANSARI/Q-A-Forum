<p>In a web browser(Chrome), declaring the variableÂ iÂ outside of any function scope makes it global and therefore binds to <strong>window</strong> object. As a result, running this code in a web browser requires repeatedly resolving the propertyÂ within the heavily populatedÂ window namespace in each iteration of theÂ for loop.</p>

<p>In <strong>Node.js</strong> however, declaring any variable outside of any functionâs scope binds it only to the <strong>module</strong> scope (not theÂ windowÂ object) which therefore makes it much easier and faster to resolve.</p>

<p>We will get more or less same execution speed when we wrap the above code in function. </p>
