<p>I figured out my own problem but thought it would be good to post the answer in case someone else has the same problem.  The problem was that I only had one browser, Chrome, on my device and it was, of course, registered for the http scheme.  Since it was the only one, my device treated it as the preferred app for all http schemes.  My scheme was more selective by designating a host.  The solution was to download another browser so that none were user preferred, then when Google was navigating to <a href="http://tennisrecruiting.net" rel="nofollow">http://tennisrecruiting.net</a>, my app was listed for selection.  I still don't get a transfer or selection when my mobile website is entered into Chrome but that is not surprising.</p>
