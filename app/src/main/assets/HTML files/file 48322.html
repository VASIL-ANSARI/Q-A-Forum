<p>It looks like the first environment I was testing on ran Groovy 2.4 and the second runs Groovy 2.1.  The execute statement I was using didn't exist until after 2.1</p>

<p>Instead, I used the .rows() function to return a GroovyRowResult which I parsed for the information I needed, instead of accessing it directly in the .execute() closure.</p>
