<p>Your stored procedure GetTotalProductWcnCrashes calls itself in a endless loop. How did you generate this stored procedure. </p>

<p>Having a general look at your stored procedure you only need the first select statement the rest of the stored procedure seems like some auto generated code from the SQL Management Studio when you select a stored procedure to execute. For some reason that was saved on top of your stored procedure.</p>

<p>Your stored procedure should be something like this instead. But bear in mind I dont your database.</p>

<pre><code>USE [Reports]

<p>Please bear in mind I dont have the database this example I put up might not be right but for sure your stored procedure is not correct and calls itself contentiously up to the maximum 32 nested call count.</p>
