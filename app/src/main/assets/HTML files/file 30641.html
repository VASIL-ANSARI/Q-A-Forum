<p>There are a few types of request params in CakePHP 3.0. Let's review them:</p>

<p><strong>The Query String</strong>: are accessed with <code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;query()</code>, are not passed to controller functions as arguments and in order to make a link you need to do <code>Html-&gt;link('My link', ['my_query_param' =&gt; $value])</code></p>

<p><strong>Passed arguments</strong>: The special type of argument is the one that is received by the controller function as an argument. They are accessed either as the argument or by inspecting <code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;params['pass']</code>. You Build links with passed args depending on the route, but for the default route you just add positional params to the link like <code>Html-&gt;link('My link', ['action' =&gt; view, $id, $secondPassedArg, $thirdPassedArg])</code></p>

<p><strong>Request Params</strong>: Passed arguments are a subtype of this one. A request param is a value that can live in the request out of the information that could be extracted from the route. Params can be converted to other types of params during their lifetime.</p>

<p>Consider this route:</p>

<pre><code>Router::connect('/articles/:year/:month/:day', [
  'controller' =&gt; 'articles', 'action' =&gt; 'archive'
]);
</code></pre>

<p>We have effectively created 3 request params with that route: <code>year</code>, <code>month</code> and <code>day</code> and they can be accessed with <code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;year</code> <code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;month</code> and <code>$this-&gt;request-&gt;day</code>. In order to build a link for this we do:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;Html-&gt;link(
  'My Link',
  ['action' =&gt; 'archive', 'year' =&gt; $y, 'month' =&gt; $m, 'day' =&gt; $d]
);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that as the route specify those parameters, they are not converted as query string params. Now if we wanted to convert those to passed arguments, we connect this route instead:</p>

<pre><code>Router::connect('/articles/:year/:month/:day',
  ['controller' =&gt; 'articles', 'action' =&gt; 'archive'],
  ['pass' =&gt; ['year', 'month', 'day']]
);
</code></pre>

<p>Our controller function will now look like:</p>

<pre><code>function archive($year, $month, $day) {
  ...
}
</code></pre>
