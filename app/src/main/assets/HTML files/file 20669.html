<p>It seems that if you start refreshing programmatically, you have to scroll the table view yourself, say, by changing contentoffset</p>

<pre><code>[self.tableView setContentOffset:CGPointMake(0, -self.refreshControl.frame.size.height) animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>I would guess the reason for this is that it could be undesirable to scroll to the refresh control when user is in the middle/bottom of the table view?</p>

<pre><code>self.tableView.setContentOffset(CGPoint(x: 0, y: -refreshControl.frame.size.height), animated: true)
</code></pre>
