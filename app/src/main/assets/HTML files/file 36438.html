<p>Since <code>i</code> is multiplied by <code>n</code> in each iteration, there would be <code>4</code> iterations, and assuming that each iteration does a constant amount of work, the time complexity would be <code>O(1)</code>.</p>

<p>In the first iteration <code>i = 1</code>.<br>
In the second iteration <code>i = n</code>.<br>
In the third iteration <code>i = n^2</code>.<br>
In the fourth iteration <code>i = n^3</code>.<br>
Then i reaches <code>n^4</code> and we exit the loop.</p>
