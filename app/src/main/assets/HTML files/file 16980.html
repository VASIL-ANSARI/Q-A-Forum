<p>The objects are being cached by the IOStreams.  To fix this, create a deep clone on the server prior to sending the object back.  When the client pulls the object from the stream, it will have a different instance id and it will actually deserialize and instantiate the object on the client side.  </p>

<p>Fun stuff.</p>
