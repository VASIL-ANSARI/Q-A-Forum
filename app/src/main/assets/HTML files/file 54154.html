<p>I believe that you are using an embedded version of maven.</p>

<p>There are two items you need to check:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check if the options in Eclipse are selected as screen bellow</li>
</ol>

<p>The second approach is to select an external installation of maven.</p>

<p>Take a look in the screenshot bellow. I'm using an external installation of maven.</p>

<p>In the second approach maven will read the settings.xml of external installation.</p>
