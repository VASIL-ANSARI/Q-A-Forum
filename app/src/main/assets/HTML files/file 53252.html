<p>The problem with your approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>true randomness/crypto is hard, you should try to use tested existing solutions instead of implementing your own.</li>
<li>Randomness isn't guaranteed - while 'unlikely', there's nothing preventing the same string to be generated more than once.</li>
</ol>

<p>A better solution would be to not reinvent the wheel, and use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/uuid.html" rel="nofollow">uuid</a> module, a common solution to generating unique identifiers:</p>

<pre><code>import uuid

tag = uuid.uuid1()
</code></pre>
