<p>The reason why both position 0 and 5 are called is because it's a recyclerView. It recycles your views. If you want to only notify the view which as been checked, you should probably create an array of booleans with the size equal to the size of the adapter you are using. You can then change the value from your heart pressed method</p>

<pre><code>public void onHeartPress(View imgB,int pos)
{
    Log.d("Postion",pos);
     yourArray[pos] = true;
     // if you want to change the others to false;
     for(int i = 0; i &lt; yourArray.length(); i++{
           if( i != pos ){
           yourArray[pos] = false;
            }} 
    notifyItemChanged(pos)
}
</code></pre>

<p>your adapter</p>

<pre><code>public void onBindViewHolder(final ViewHolder holder,  int position)
    {
         if(yourArray[position])
       Log.d("Postion",position);
    }
</code></pre>
