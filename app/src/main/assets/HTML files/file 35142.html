<p>I have come up with a working solution.  It is not very elegant as it requires an eval.  So I first create a new variable (alldata) to the data I want to access, and then I create an empty dictionary datastruct, then I loop over all the members of data and assign the arrays to the appropriate key in the dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>alldata = impdat.root.data
datastruct = {}
for names in impdat.rood.data.__members___:
    datastruct[names] = eval('alldata.' + names + '[0][:]')
</code></pre>

<p>The '[0]' could be superfluous depending on the structure of the data trying to access.  In my case the data is stored in an array of an array and I just want the first one.  If you come up with a better solution please feel free to share.  </p>
