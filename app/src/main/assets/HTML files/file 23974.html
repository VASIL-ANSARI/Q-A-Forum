  <p>What I want to avoid is leveraging the SQL Reporting Services as I've run into nothing but problems with this utility. </p>

<p>What sort of issues? I've used SSRS extensively, like anything it has got some negatives here and there, but with experience you learn what they are and how to avoid them.</p>

<p>I would advocate that you use SSRS for this project, it's a no-brainer. You get it for free, and it does everything you're asking for and more.</p>

<p>The approach I've used in the past is to carefully analyze the business requirements for each report and identify the commonalities in layout and parameters between them, then create a template report with the common features and themes which is then tailored for each specific report. A rule-of-thumb I use is it takes on average three days to fully develop one complex report (this includes data retrieval and shaping as well as the actual report layout).</p>

<p>With SSRS you could also implement the ReportBuilder feature which allows users to create their own reports - a great selling point for management. SSRS can also be used to generate reports from Analysis Services as well as standard OLTP databases.</p>
