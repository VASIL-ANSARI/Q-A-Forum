<p>The flow of your program is off. You're getting 3 words from the scanner without even checking if it has more data (though this is mostly just a different issue). Then within the while loop, you simply always break at the end without going over more words from your constitution file. Also I doubt you want the println statement to be over there, because it should probably only print once you have the final result, not while you're still counting.</p>
