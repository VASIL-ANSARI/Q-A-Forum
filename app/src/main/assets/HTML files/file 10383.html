<p>strange. that's should work. it might be a a bug in ZF framework. maybe it's trying to convert the function name into a camel case function name with variables.</p>

<p>Try to use the magic function directly by calling:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;_client-&gt;__call('list-all', array('param1' =&gt; $param1))
</code></pre>
