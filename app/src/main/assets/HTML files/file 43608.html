<p>Unfortunately there is indeed a bug in MSW makefiles with missing dependencies of the various libraries on <code>setup_h</code> target. It should be safe to do <code>make setup_h</code> first and then <code>make -jN</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could build using configure as explained in this old but still valid <a href="http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2011/06/choosing-gcc-for-building-wxwidgets.html" rel="nofollow">post</a>, then just <code>make -jN</code> works perfectly fine.</p>
