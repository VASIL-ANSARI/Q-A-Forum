<p>Many IDEs use a front-end syntax checker that is different than their back-end compiler. Eclipse Kepler (released June 2013) is mostly up-to-date with C++11 syntax, although some things like alignment support and the interaction with in-class initializers and default constructors might not be fully supported (yet). Similary, C++14 features like <code>decltype(auto)</code> will work if the back-end compiler is called with <code>std=C++1y</code> but will not be recognized by the front-end syntax checker.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this is not unique to Eclipse, also Visual C++ Intellisense is sometimes running behind (especially in CTP versions) the actual compiler, causing the red squiggly lines. </p>
