<p>Depends. If your threads will mainly search through the lists without modifying them, it may be worthwhile to implement a reader/writer-lock. There's no reason to prevent other threads from reading the information as long as none of them modifies it. If however, the most common operations involve modifying the lists or the information in them, there may not be much to gain, so a simple lock/do operation/unlock scheme should work just as well.</p>
