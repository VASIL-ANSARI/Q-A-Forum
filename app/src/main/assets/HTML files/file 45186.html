<p><strong>There are lots of ways other than PHP to do this.</strong> It's really about preference.</p>

<p>Some of your choices are <strong>PHP</strong>(duh), <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>.</p>

<h1>Installing PHP is relatively easy on a Mac.</h1>

<p>The thing is with running PHP is that it's a Server-Side language, which means that you need a server to process the files before you can view it in your browser.</p>

<p>This may be different from how you are viewing your website right now(I'm guessing you're just opening the files in your browser of choice).</p>

<p><strong><em>Have a look at <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" rel="nofollow">MAMP</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>RubyMine is an IDE, which means that it's primary use is just for you to code in. As long as you create a project in the folder where your HTML and PHP reside you will be fine.</p>

<p>Using RubyMine is in now way exclusive to coding and you could use a texteditor if you wanted too.</p>

<p>As for the part about a search feature on your website; I suggest you do some googling on "PHP MySQL search" and choose a tutorial/guide of your choosing.</p>
