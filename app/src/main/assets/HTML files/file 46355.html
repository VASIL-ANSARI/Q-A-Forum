<p>There many situations, and many resolutions. You can create php, ruby, python and etc. script to copy data and fix foreign key relations.
<br/>
or just :</p>

<ol>
<li>create temporary table, lets say we have table and table_tmp</li>
<li>insert whole data from second table to table_tmp</li>
<li><p>copy new data from table_tmp to table:</p>

<p>INSERT INTO table VALUES (SELECT * FROM table_tmp WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM table));</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3.1 or copy whole data from table_tmp to table:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO table (field, names, except, id, field) VALUES (SELECT field, names, except, id, field FROM table_tmp);
</code></pre>

<p><br/><br/></p>

<p>** of course it's better to have some uuid field to keep unique identificator and have relations using this field to avoid having problems with foreign keys</p>

<p>** if any additional requirements needed plz write in comments I'll try to add solution</p>
