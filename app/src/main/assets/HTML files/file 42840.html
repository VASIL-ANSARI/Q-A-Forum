<p>To parse between the datafields of Datasources, setting the FirstRecord and LastRecord properties alone would not work.</p>

<p>You'd need to use ActiveRecord to change the position of the datasource, and navigate through subsequent records.</p>

<p>Refer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14960266/mailmerge-with-visto-how-to-get-each-record-of-mailmerge-datasource-datafields">this</a> SO answer to parse.</p>
