<p>Windows has a set of functions designed for this, the central one is <code>UpdateResource</code>.</p>

<p>MSDN also has an example: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648008(v=vs.85).aspx#_win32_Updating_Resources" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648008(v=vs.85).aspx#_win32_Updating_Resources</a></p>

<p>However, you can't do this on a running program.  You may put the code to scramble the resource content into a separate EXE, or a DLL spawned with RUNDLL32.exe.</p>
