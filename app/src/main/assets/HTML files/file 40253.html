<p>An alternative to using <code>after_cancel</code> is, you could use an additional global value to track whether the loop ought to continue.</p>

<pre><code>should_continue_animating = True

def animate():
    forward()
    if should_continue_animating:
        root.after(1000, animate)

def stop():
    global should_continue_animating
    should_continue_animating = False
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Bonus design tip: it may be useful to make all of your functions into the methods of a single class. Then you would have <code>self.current_image</code> and <code>self.should_continue_animating</code> instead of global values. This would be a good design choice if you want to animate more than one image at once.</p>
