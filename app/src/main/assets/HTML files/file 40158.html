<p>I suspect the for-loop and the counter inside it and the way you create a n ew instance of the thread.
I would do it that way.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 1; i &lt;= logfile.getTotalLines(); i++) {
    t = new Thread(threadFile, "logFile_Thread_" + i);
    t.start();
}

static Runnable threadFile = new Runnable() {

    public void run() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        ++currentLine;
        timer.schedule(new timedTask(), (long)  
        logfile.getFileHash().get(currentLine).getTimeStampInMilli());
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Because the counter in the for-loop, will get always its maximum value wihch will be applied to all the  Timertasks. in other words, if yu have a loop for 5 iterations the counter will get its maximum value depending on how the counter was initalised and then this counter values you use it to parse a specific datat from your file which means you alwas get the value frm the last line then apply it to the timerTask</p>
