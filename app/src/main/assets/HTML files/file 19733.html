<p>It really depends on what you are doing inside of your stored proc. Simply by using stored procs, you are not immune to SQL Injection. Conversely, by using variables in your LINQ to Entity code, you are safe from SQL Injection because the query is parameterized correctly there as well. Unfortunately, full text indexing is not supported in Entity Framework, so you will need to resort to procs or functions to use them for performance concerns. I wouldn't say that it is necessarily more "elegant" than a LINQ generated query however.</p>
