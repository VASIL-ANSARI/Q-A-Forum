<p><strong>Edit:</strong> re-written after comments. Some feedback would be good, to see if we're going in the right direction!</p>

<p>Have you looked at the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-intersect-key.php" rel="nofollow">array_intersect_key()</a> function? You should be able to do:</p>

<pre><code>$common = array_intersect_key(index['jeff'], index['seka']);
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a new array with just the keys (and values from 'jeff') of those pages common to Jeff and Seka. You can supply any number of additional arrays to the function, which will allow you to search for (for example) five different terms together and only retrieve pages which contain all five.</p>

<p>Your return array will contain a key for each page. Each key's value will come from the first argument in the <code>array_intersect_key()</code> call ("jeff", in my example). In other words, a subset of the <code>index['jeff']</code> array is returned.</p>

<p>If you want to retrieve the positions of other terms on each page, you can either repeat the search with different terms at the start (don't: quite inefficient) or loop through the keys in your returned results (you can get an array of the keys with <code>$pages = array_keys($common);</code>) and use this as in index to the arrays for each of the other terms.</p>
