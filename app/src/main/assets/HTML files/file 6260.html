<p>MySQL does allow aliases in the Having clause. You would need to use:</p>

<pre><code>HAVING cc = 3
</code></pre>

<p>not </p>

<pre><code>HAVING COUNT(cc) = 3
</code></pre>

<p>in order to filter the results to only include rows which have a <code>cc</code> value of 3 though. I'm actually quite unsure though why <code>HAVING COUNT(cc) = 3</code> would return any results at all.</p>
