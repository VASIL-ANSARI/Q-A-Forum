<p>Short Asnwer</p>

<p>Your <code>shcedulerTreadPool</code> will pick first 5 tasks and put other 5 tasks to queue. Then When one of the currently busy threads exit next task will be scheduled to this thread</p>

<p>In other words</p>

<p>Your <code>schedulerTread pool</code> holds every second exactly 5 threads.Tasks are submitted to the pool via an internal queue, which holds extra tasks(for you everything above 5 tasks currently runing) whenever there are more active tasks than threads.</p>

<p><strong>To asnwer your question</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>First 5 tasks are picked</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever threads finishes task new task from queue is assigned to it</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat until there are tasks in internal queue </p></li>
</ol>
