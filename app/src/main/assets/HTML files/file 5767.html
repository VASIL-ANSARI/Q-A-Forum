<p>I think the best way this time is still the use of a flash-player which can interact with javascript, so you don't need to embed a sound-file a couple of times, you simply can play the sound if you want to.    </p>

<p>If some day  HTML5 is supported enough by all browsers, it would be easier using the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>-element and its play/pause methods.</p>
