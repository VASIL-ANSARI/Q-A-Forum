<p>The shortest example I can give you is if you want a list of all animals</p>

<pre><code> List&lt;Animal&gt; Animals = new List&lt;Animal&gt;();
 Animals.Add(new Cat());
 Animals.Add(new Dog());
</code></pre>

<p>If you have ever created a project using Winforms, you will have already used something similar since all controls derive from <code>Control</code>. You will then notice that a Window has a list of controls (<code>this.Controls</code>), that allows you to access all child controls on a window at once. I.E to hide all controls.</p>

<pre><code> foreach(var control in this.Controls)
      control.Hide();
</code></pre>
