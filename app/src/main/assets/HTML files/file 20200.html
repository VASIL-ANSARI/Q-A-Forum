<p>The problem are the non-literal format strings in the assertions. Change them to:</p>

<pre><code>STAssertNotNil(res, @"%@", desc);
STAssertNotEquals(@"", res, @"%@", desc);
</code></pre>

<p>Format strings are a common security issue. When they are not visible to the compiler it cannot check them. In your case they've been hidden in <code>desc</code>.</p>
