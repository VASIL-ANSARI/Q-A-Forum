<p>No, this doesn't bind to the field <strong>esplicitly</strong>, it binds to the field, by using a <code>static resource</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Binding Source={StaticResource ints //StaticResource !!
</code></pre>

<p>You can define a static resource whatever you want (basically) and bind to it. If you want to bind <em>directly</em> to your class, you need to use <code>properties</code> as documentation suggests.</p>
