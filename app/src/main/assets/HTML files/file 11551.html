<p>So your PhotoEditViewController is creating and presenting a PreviewFrameViewController.</p>

<p>Then in its viewDidLoad, your PreviewFrameViewController is creating <strong>its own</strong> PhotoEditViewController and setting that instance's delegate to itself.</p>

<p>So you've got <strong>two</strong> PhotoEditViewControllers now, and the first one still has no delegate. (Which leads to the question of why you needed the delegate pattern here to begin with?)</p>

<p>The most direct way to do what you seem to want is this (in your PhotoEditViewController):</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)previewPicture:(id)sender{

    PreviewFrameViewController* prvc = [[PreviewFrameViewController alloc]init];
    [prvc passImage:imageView.image];
    [prvc passMainText:mainText.text withSubText:subText.text];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:prvc animated:YES];

    // You could have set self.delegate here, but I'm not sure why you need that now
    // but if for some reason you do: self.delegate = prvc;

    // and if you aren't using ARC: [prvc release];

}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that makes sense?</p>
