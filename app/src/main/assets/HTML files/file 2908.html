<p>Basically you're going to create new (empty) DNN modules and paste in your existing code. It's not that hard to convert a standalone ASPX page to a DNN module.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can get the current user's login name from the DNN environment</li>
<li>DNN modules are User Controls (.ascx) and don't know anything about the rest of the page.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have your modules, editors (users) will be able to drop into pages as desired. (If you don't need that capability, then you don't need DNN.)</p>

<p>Does that help?</p>
