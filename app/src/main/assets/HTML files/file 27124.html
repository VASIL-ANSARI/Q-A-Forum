<p>Correct.</p>

  <p>The paragraph mentions "intensive or blocking operations", but doesnât mention an ANR error, it mentions performance.</p>

<p>Feel free to file a bug report at <a href="http://b.android.com" rel="nofollow">http://b.android.com</a> to get them to improve this portion of the documentation. :-)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the Service run by default in the background of the main thread?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lifecycle methods of a <code>Service</code>, such as <code>onCreate()</code> and <code>onStartCommand()</code>, are called on the main application thread. Some services, like <code>IntentService</code>, will provide you with a background thread (e.g., for <code>onHandleIntent()</code>), but that is specific to that particular subclass of <code>Service</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and eventually you would get an ANR error. </p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best practice (but not necessarily, if the service is doing light work) would be to start a new Thread within the Service, now the Activity and the Service are using their own threadâs resources. Then you could close your activity, but Android keeps the service thread alive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, yes. Here, "light work" should be less than a millisecond or so. Also, some things that you might do are naturally asynchronous (e.g., playing a song via <code>MediaPlayer</code>), so it may be that the <code>Service</code> itself does not need its own thread, because something else that it is using is doing the threading.</p>
