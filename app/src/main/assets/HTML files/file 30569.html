<p>One possible solution, depending on if you are doing server side programming, is to submit the data in the code behind.  </p>

<p>After submitting the data to your code that handles the form submission.  Your code passes the values to the third party instead of having the third party be the form submission location.  Since you are handling the form submission with your code, you are free to redirect the user as you please.  </p>

<p>If you aren't doing server side programming, I'm not sure if there is a way to hide the form submission location from the user.  </p>
