<p>Your syntax is correct although there's no reason you couldn't catch by reference to avoid unnecessary copying of the exception object:</p>

<pre><code> catch(const std::exception &amp; error_)
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Check that the exception thrown actually derives from <code>std::exception</code>.</li>
<li>The PPL will only allow exceptions to propagate once all the threads have completed, could you have a thread which is still running preventing you from seeing the exception?</li>
</ol>

<p>For debugging purposes, you could add an extra catch block:</p>

<pre><code>catch(...)
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Unknown exception" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just to check if you are getting any kind of exception thrown, however I wouldn't leave this in production code because there's no way to usefully do anything with the exception.</p>
