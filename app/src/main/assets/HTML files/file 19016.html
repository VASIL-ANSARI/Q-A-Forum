<p>What's the Exception? First thing I've noticed is that you're creating SessionFactory on every form submit request. Session factory should be created only once on app initialization and on every request you should only obtain hibernate session. </p>

<p>Look at the HibernateUtil class from your tutorial. It creates singleton class for SessionFactory.</p>
