<p>I think what you want is <code>cos(x*pi)</code> instead of <code>cos(x/pi)</code>. That way you get a function of similar shape that is [-1,1]-periodic. So simply redefine</p>

<pre><code>def en(k):
    return -2*cos(pi*k)
</code></pre>

<p>Your expression to transform <code>k</code> into <code>k2</code> can be more simple written as <code>k2 = [i*pi for i in k]</code>. This is called a "list comprehension" and your code would look much nicer with some of them (maybe reduced to 4-5 lines). </p>
