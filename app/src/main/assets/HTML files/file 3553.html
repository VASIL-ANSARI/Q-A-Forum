<p>I think a pure SQL solution would invlolve using a subquery to gather the counts from the comments table having the entries table as the driver.  Something like the following should "loop" over the entries table and for each row perform the subquery (that may be the incorrect terminology) and update the comment count to be that of the corresponding counts off of the auxillary table.  Hope that helps!</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE   entries ent
   SET   comment_count =
         (SELECT   COUNT ( * )
            FROM   comments cmt
           WHERE   cmt.blogentry_id = ent.id)
</code></pre>
