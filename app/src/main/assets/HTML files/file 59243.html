<p><code>number1</code> isn't defined until you create it - you can't pass it to another function while defining it. Seems like you need a simpler function that gets the <strong>name</strong> you want to assign to:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    number1 = getNumber('number1')
    number2 = getNumber('number2')

def getNumber(name):
    return input('Enter the value of ' + name))
</code></pre>
