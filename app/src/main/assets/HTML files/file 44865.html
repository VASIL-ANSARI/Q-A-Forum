<p>I finally found the real problem. It was not because of the prints (removing them improved performance a bit, but not significantly) but because of a thread that was using a shared lock. This lock was shared over multiple CPU cores causing the whole thing being very slow.</p>

<p>It even got slower the more cores I added to the executing VM which was very strange...</p>

<p>Now the new bottleneck seems to be the APScheduler... I always get messages like "event missed" because there is too much load on the scheduler. So that's the next thing to speed up... :)</p>
