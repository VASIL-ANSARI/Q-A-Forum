<p>If you have to combine the two results you could try using <code>UNION</code>.</p>

<p>Your query would end up looking something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM (
SELECT bso.ID AS order_item_id, bsd.NAME AS order_item_name, 'shipping' AS order_item_type, bso.ID AS order_id FROM bso LEFT OUTER JOIN bsd ON bso.DELIVERY_ID = bsd.ID WHERE bso.ID IN (255, 810)
UNION
SELECT bsb.ID AS order_item_id, bsb.NAME AS order_item_name, 'line_item' AS order_item_type, bsb.ORDER_ID AS order_id FROM b_sale_basket bsb WHERE bsb.ORDER_ID IN (810, 255)
) aux ORDER BY order_id;
</code></pre>
