<p>Double-dash comments require a following space.</p>

<p>WRONG:</p>

<pre><code>--97: Description
</code></pre>

<p>RIGHT:</p>

<pre><code>-- 97: Description
</code></pre>

<p>Re your comment:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE A.attribute_set_id IN (70,71)
AND A.entity_id=26179' 
</code></pre>

<p>You have a stray single-quote at the end of your WHERE clause on line 30 of the query.  The SQL parser counts lines from the start of the SQL statement, not from the start of your file.</p>

<hr>

<p>The only place where <code>Image</code> occurs is here:</p>

<pre><code>ON A.entity_id=H.entity_id
AND H.attribute_id =106 --Image
</code></pre>

<p>This is another case where you need a space after the double-dash comment.  </p>

<p>There also appears to be one more such case earlier in the query:</p>

<pre><code>ON A.entity_id=C.entity_id AND C.attribute_id=105 --Description
</code></pre>

<p>I tested the query against some empty tables, and once I corrected all the comments by adding spaces, the query worked.</p>
