<pre><code>&lt;Label Content="{Binding Name, Source={StaticResource LocStrings}}"
      HorizontalAlignment="Stretch" Margin="4" Name="label2"  Background="Blue" 
      VerticalAlignment="Top"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Have you tried to just enter some text in the Content and checked the <strong>binding output</strong>, maybe there is something wrong with your binding. Because it works just fine here.
Note that I set <strong>HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"</strong> instead of left, which will make the label use all the horizontal avaliable space. If you don't have anything bound your label will be invisible in your case above, you may use this in combination with the output to figure out what's likely wrong with your binding as stated by others, like  Sriram Sakthivel and PoweredByOrange. For helping you with that, we need a bit more information :)</p>

<p>Hope it helps,</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
