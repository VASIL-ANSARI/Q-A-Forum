<p>I don't think it would be a good idea to directly expose your entity in this way. You should create a DTO and pass that to service and then convert DTO to entity and save it in DB.</p>

<p>Reason is that the EF classes aren't designed for serialization. They would have lot of extra information which you won't need to send to server</p>
