<p>Yes, The plot does end at the middle of the last bin.  This probably is not correct.</p>

<p>However, no matter what, it isn't going to be 2.0, for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, the endpoint is rarely going to perfectly match the last sample, because it is divided into <code>NFFT</code>-length segments with an overlap of <code>noverlap</code>, which is unlikely to perfectly fit into the length of the signal unless you very carefully pick the signal length, segment length, and overlap.  </p>

<p>And even then, it is never going to go to 20.0, because numpy <code>arange</code>, as with other python ranges, excludes the last value.  So <code>t.max()</code> is <code>20.0-dt</code>, which is 19.9995.  Again, this is just a different convention than what MATLAB uses.</p>

<p>Using MATLAB 2014b and the spectogram function, I ran it with the same parameters as the matplotlib example, making sure to take into account the end point of the range.  I get the same time points as with matplotlib.</p>
