<p>What you need is to convert a sequence of symbols (numbers, operation on numbers, parenthesis) into a tree structure, that represents the calculation expressed by your sequence of symbols. Such a thing is exactly the job of a ''parser'' You might want to have a look at simple parsers like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser</a>
Those are simple to code, and you can compute the parsing tables with a pencil and paper. </p>
