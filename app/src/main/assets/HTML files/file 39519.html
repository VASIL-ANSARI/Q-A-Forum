<p>You are trying to attach a SQL Server 2008 R2 database (version 661) to a SQL Server 2008 Express instance (version 655). You cannot downgrade your DB. You will need to either upgrade your instance to SQL Server 2008 R2 - or copy the data from the R2 DB to a 655 version DB. I would upgrade your instance if I were you.</p>
