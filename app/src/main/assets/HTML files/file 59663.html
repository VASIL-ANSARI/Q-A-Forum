<p>This is because the hash you expected (aba1..) is the md5 hash of <code>k + m + x</code> while the hash you got (958a..) is the md5 hash of <code>k + m + padding + x</code>.</p>

<p>The length extension attack lets you generate a hash <code>h2 = md5(k + m + padding + x)</code> based on only knowing the hash <code>h1 = md5(k + m)</code> and the length of the message <code>l = len(k + m)</code>. However, as far as I know, it doesn't let you get rid of the padding between the messages, so you're left with some garbage in between.</p>
