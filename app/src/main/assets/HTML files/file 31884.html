<p><code>distutils</code> has no functionality for downloading, or even verifying, prerequisites; its <code>install_requires</code> is only there for documentation.</p>

<p>If you want that, you need the third-party library <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools" rel="nofollow"><code>setuptools</code></a>.</p>

<p>Most people already have <code>setuptools</code>, and hopefully <code>pip</code>, and will be using them to install your package anyway (assuming you plan to distribute over PyPI), but if you include the <code>setuptools</code> bootstrap, it will take care of installing <code>setuptools</code> if needed to install those dependencies.</p>
