<p>Can you give any more information? Are you sure the problem is the user is being redirected? And if so, are you sure the user is being logged in correctly? If you need to, try using pry to figure out which step is failing. If the user is getting to the edit page, you can just use inspect element to make sure "user[name]" is the correct input, but I think that's right.</p>
