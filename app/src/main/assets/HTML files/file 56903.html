<p>You don't need mutable list for that (avoid using mutable structures unless there is a real reason why you have to). Assuming the <code>pg.pins</code> is a <code>Stream</code> and that the data is sorted by date (that your question seems to be implying), something like this should do what you want:</p>

<pre><code> val (after, before) = pg.pins.flatten
   .takeWhile { js =&gt; (js \ "createdAt").as[Date].before(end) }
   .partition { js =&gt; (js \ "createdAt").as[Date].after(start) }
</code></pre>
