<p>I've recently begun the same kind of process, and am using <a href="http://beanstalkapp.com" rel="nofollow">Beanstalk</a> for svn hosting.</p>

<p>There are two nifty features in the paid accounts (start at $15pm i think):</p>

<ul>
<li>deployment allows the user to create ftp targets for staging and production servers, which  can be deployed at the click of a button (inc specifying a revision and branch)</li>
<li>webhooks allow the user to set up a url that is called on each commit/deploy, passing across things like revision number, description and user. This could be used to update docs, run unit tests and update changelogs.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are other hosted or self-hosting svn servers with these two features, but beanstalk is the one i have experience of and it's working very, very well</p>

<p>There's also an API, which I imagine could be used to integrate deployment further in to your process.</p>
