<p>The object is destroyed once, as you can see from the pointer values. You also see the destruction of another object. This object is a copy of the original. </p>

<p>By passing the object by value, the <code>copy-constructor</code> is invoked. Since this constructor does not print something, you do not see it in your output.</p>

<p>Add it to the class definition: </p>

<pre><code>MyClass(const MyClass &amp; other) { std::cout &lt;&lt; "MyClass Copy-Cons " &lt;&lt; this &lt;&lt; " from " &lt;&lt; &amp;other &lt;&lt; std::endl;}
</code></pre>

<p>And it should appear:</p>

<pre><code>MyClass Cons 0x7fff1beee7ee
MyClass Copy-Cons 0x7fff1beee7ef from 0x7fff1beee7ee
MyClass Dest 0x7fff1beee7ef
MyClass Dest 0x7fff1beee7ee
</code></pre>

<p>The copy is created when you enter <code>Func()</code>. The copy is destroyed when it goes out of scope. This happens when you exit <code>Func()</code>. Finally, the original is destroyed when you exit the <code>main()</code> function.</p>
