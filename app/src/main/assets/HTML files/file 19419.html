<p>OK Guys, with Cyborgx37's ideas, I have changed the calling method on the parent form as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>private void showSplashScreen()
{
    // Instantiating SplashScreen.  'using' to allow proper release of resources
    using ( SplashScreen splash = new SplashScreen() ) {
        // Displaying SplashScreen
        splash.ShowDialog();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This now releases resources correctly.   however, I cannot see why the timer closing the child form allows for proper disposal of resources and the button click closing does not. I have even looked at the IL code and the two methods are using the same code. Any ideas?</p>
