<p>No, that's perfectly legitimate and totally Standard. If you want to use a static variable in a templated class, there's no way you could possibly define all possible instantiations of it- those types may not even be nameable and therefore specializable. Hence, it's very necessary that template classes can have static variables defined for all possible uses.</p>
