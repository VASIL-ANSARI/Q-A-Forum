<p>Without knowing more about the design of these tables, some of this is speculation. </p>

<p>What it sounds like you want to perform is a <code>JOIN</code>. For example, if you have one table that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>StateId, StateName
</code></pre>

<p>and another table that looks like</p>

<pre><code>EmployeeId, EmployeeName, StateId
</code></pre>

<p>and you want to end up with a result set that looks like</p>

<pre><code>EmployeeId, EmployeeName, StateId, StateName
</code></pre>

<p>You would perform the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Employee.EmployeeId, Employee.EmployeeName, Employee.StateId, State.StateName
FROM Employee
INNER JOIN State ON Employee.StateId = State.StateId
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a resultset but doesn't update any data. Again, speculating on your dataset, I'm assuming that your version of the Employee table might look like the resultset:</p>

<pre><code>EmployeeId, EmployeeName, StateId, StateName
</code></pre>

<p>but with <code>StateName</code> in need of being populated. In this case, you could write the query:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE Employee
SET Employee.StateName = State.StateName
FROM Employee
INNER JOIN State ON Employee.StateId = State.StateId
</code></pre>

<p>Tested in SQL Server.</p>
