<p>I have the same problem in a webview (phonegap).</p>

<p>What I found is that the log messages seem to be related to the blinking cursor of a focused textarea. </p>

<p>I have jquery running in the webview and if I do </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$('textarea').get(0).blur();</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the log messages stop.</p>

<p>That code tells the textarea to stop being focused, and so the cursor stop blinking and so do the log messages (wich seem to flow at the same rate as the blinking of the cursor).</p>

<p>The messages stop also when tapping outside of the textarea, while tapping in the textarea restart the messages.</p>

<p>I know this is not a proper solution, but I hope it can be a hint in the right direction.</p>
