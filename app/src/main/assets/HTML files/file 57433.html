<p>Based on what I have observed on 9.0.2, the connection is closed after one minute when it is not needed.  To leave the connection open would needlessly drain the battery.</p>

<p>A connection is needed when:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>DatbaseReference.setValue()</code> is executed.</li>
<li><code>Query.addListenerForSingleValueEvent()</code> is executed</li>
<li>A <code>ValueEventListener</code> or <code>ChildEventListener</code> has been added and not removed</li>
</ol>

<p>After a connection has been closed, one of the listed events will cause it to reopen.  For events 1 and 2, the connection will close again after one minute.  When a listener has been added (not for single value), the connection remains open until the listener is removed.</p>
