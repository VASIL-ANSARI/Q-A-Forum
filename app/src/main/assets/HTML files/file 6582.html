<p>OleDbTransaction class is made just for that.  You can create one by calling BeginTransaction on your OleDbConnection object then Commit or Rollback up to your scenario</p>

<pre><code>using (var transaction = cn.BeginTransaction()) {
  //Do Stuff here using the connection
  transaction.Commit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The transaction will be rolled back at dispose if no commit has been called.</p>
