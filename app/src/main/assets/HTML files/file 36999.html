<p>Yes, you always have to specify the method return type. The reason you have to do so is because Java is <strong>strongly and statically typed</strong>, which means that the compiler has to know the types of all expressions during compile time.</p>

<p>What you see what looks like a method with no return type is actually a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html" rel="nofollow">constructor</a> for the class, using it you can create an instance of your class.</p>
