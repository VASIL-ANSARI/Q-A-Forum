<p>I'm sorry to say that there's not any remotely easy way to do this. You'll have to write a lot of code and abuse Reflection like it's going out of style. These are your options as far as I can see:</p>

<h3>Generic method</h3>

<p>The DbContext is <strong>not</strong> getting serialized and passed over WCF. So that will leave you with either a POCO Entity object to create, update or delete or a nice long expression tree representing a query. You then have to figure out what DbContext it belongs to, instantiate said DbContext, figure out what DbSet it belongs to, and use it on the DbSet all via reflection.</p>

<h3>Code generation</h3>

<p>You will still need a lot of reflection to pull out all the DbContexts and DbSets but once you have those, generating methods for all of them should be a breeze. You'll have a lot more flexibility as to what conventions you can apply to different operations. The downside is that there will be a lot of code there and it might get a little hard to manage unless you find some way to break it up into different namespaces.</p>
