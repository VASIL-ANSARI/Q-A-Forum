<p>Use ajax for portions of the page that needs to update, not the entire thing.  For that you should use templates.</p>

<p>When you want to still preserve the back button for your various state changes on the page, combine them with # achors to alter the url (without forcing the browser to issue another GET).</p>

<p>For example, gmail's looks like this:</p>

<p>mail.google.com/#inbox/message-1234</p>

<p>everything past the # was a page state change that happened via ajax.  If I press Back, I'll go to the inbox again (again, without another browser GET)</p>
