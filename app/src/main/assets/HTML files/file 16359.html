<p>Sure, you probably just need to give the Model different data, as long as the types of each set are the same.   If the empty cart / show all courses has a different type, you can also tell the framework to show a different View that corresponds to the "All Courses" model.</p>

<p>I have no idea how your object models are set up but here's a hack idea if both sets are collections of Course objects:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult ShowCourseId(int StudentId)
{
    var studentCourses = (from c in course.vwCourse
                          where c.StudentID == StudentId
                          group c by c.CourseID into g
                          select g.FirstOrDefault()).ToList();

    if(studentCourses  == null || !studentCourses .Any())
    {
        studentCourses  = (from c in course.vwCourse
                           group c by c.CourseID into g
                           select g.FirstOrDefault()).ToList();
    }

    ViewData.Model = studentCourses;
    return View();
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is the type that the first query gives back? Is it a collection of Courses ?</p>
