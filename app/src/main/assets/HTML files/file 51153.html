<p>When working with Maven, all resources should be placed under <code>src/main/resources</code>. By resources, I mean every file that should be packaged into the final JAR, i.e. every file that should be present in the classpath.</p>

<p>Since you are using <code>Class.getResourceAsStream()</code> to access your images, they must reside under that folder.</p>

<p>As such, you should move your resources under <code>src/main/resources</code>. The final location for the image would be: <code>src/main/resources/openchannel_dynamic_downloader/resources/images/openChannelPlaceholderIcon.png</code></p>
