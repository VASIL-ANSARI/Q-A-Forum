<p>I would offload the work to some sort of <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html" rel="nofollow">service</a>. Services have the benefit of running in the background without interacting with the application. You would still need to create another thread to do the work. When the download is finished, it will simply destroy itself. </p>
