<p>This is going to be a long shot, but this behavior can be triggered by keeping references to the HttpServletRequest (for example storing the HttpServletRequest instance in the session) which prevents Tomcat from recycling the ServletRequest object.</p>

<p>Without recycling of the instance, the "is parsed" flag (which indicates that the query parameters are parsed) is never reset, resulting in Tomcat not processing the URL on the next request leaving you without any query parameters.</p>
