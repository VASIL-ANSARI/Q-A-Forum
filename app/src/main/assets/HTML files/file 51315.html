  <p>But the thing my hitboxes don't have a depth notion (z-axis), it's a 2D game....So my question is how should i manage this</p>

<p>Just because it's a 2D game (and by that I mean the camera is projecting some world from <em>x</em>D to 2D) <strong>doesn't mean your scene has to be in 2D</strong>.  Because your cards can overlap one another <strong>your scene has depth</strong> and so it is 3D.</p>

<p>Once you realise this, hit detection of objects in your 3D scene are trivial.</p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<ol>
<li>shoot a ray from the mouse, inverse projected into the scene</li>
<li>test to see which objects it hits</li>
<li>take the first object closest to the origin</li>
</ol>
