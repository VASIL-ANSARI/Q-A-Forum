<p>You could use a few regular expressions to accomplish the same task:</p>

<pre><code>import re

# Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space
# Example: "One Two  Three    Four!" -&gt; "One Two Three Four!"
sentence = re.sub(' +', ' ', sentence)    

# Surround each instance ; : ( ) â and " with spaces
# Example: '"Hello;(w)o:râld"' -&gt; " Hello ;  ( w ) o : r â ld "
sentence = re.sub('([;:()â"])', ' \\1 ', sentence)

# Insert a space before each instance of , 's 're and 'll
# Example: "you'll they're, we're" -&gt; "you 'll they 're , we 're"
sentence = re.sub("(,|'s|'re|'ll)", ' \\1', sentence)

return sentence
</code></pre>
