<p>I finally solved my issue. On the classpath, the file is named <code>/ares/file1.xml</code> while in my code I was calling the file <code>/ares/file1.XML</code>. Did you notice the uppercased <code>XML</code>?</p>

<p>On Windows, there is no difference since filenames are case insensitive.
On Linux, it fails because filenames ARE case sensitive.</p>

<p><strong>Final thought, when you code on a platform different from the target platform prefer lower case filenames</strong>.</p>
