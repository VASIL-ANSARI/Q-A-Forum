<p>Yes, there is a better way to run that function - this is what a lot of HTML5 games use:</p>

<pre><code>Window.requestAnimationFrame()
</code></pre>

<p>This tells the browser that you're doing an animation and want to run the function again ASAP. It will run it the next time it paints the screen.</p>

<p>This is faster and overall makes for a higher framerate, as well as performance (as <code>setTimeout</code> is not very accurate).</p>
