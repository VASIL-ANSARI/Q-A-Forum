<p>You may try either prepending your jar in the classpath or <strike>by using an endorsed directory</strike>.</p>

<p>The former: </p>

<pre><code>java -Xbootclasspath/p:youJarHere.jar  ..... 
</code></pre>

<p>And the effect is, to load first the classes you have in yourJar, even overriding core classes. </p>

<p><strike>The later form is to place in your <code>$JAVA_HOME/lib/endorsed</code> directory the classes/jars, it has a similar effect. </strike></p>

<p>I haven't used any of these for a couple of years, but I used them once to replace a core class ( something in the CORBA package or something like that ). </p>

<p>Give it a try and let us know if it worked.</p>
