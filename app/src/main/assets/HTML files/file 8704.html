<p>I have one theory that always seems to trip people up with many-to-many collections.  The problem is that in memory, the associations are made in two places.  Both in the car's addons list and in the addon's cars list.  In the database, there isn't such a duplication.</p>

<p>The way JPA providers get around this is through the mappedBy attribute.  Since you have mappedBy on the car's addons list this means that the relationship is actually controlled by the addon's cars list (confusing I know).</p>

<p>Try adding the following:</p>

<pre><code>addon1.setCarCollection(new ArrayList&lt;Car&gt;());
addon1.getCarCollection().add(car);

addon2.setCarCollection(new ArrayList&lt;Car&gt;());
addon2.getCarCollection().add(car);
</code></pre>

<p>before you persist the car.</p>
