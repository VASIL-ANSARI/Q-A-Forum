<p>it does not matter what name you give to FK column name. Django figures it out that it is a ForeignKey and appends <code>_id</code> to the field. So you do not need <code>_id</code> here. I think this is good enough</p>

<pre><code>stat_type = models.ForeignKey('beta.StatTypes')
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Itâs suggested, but not required, that the name of a ForeignKey field
  (manufacturer in the example above) be the name of the model,
  lowercase. You can, of course, call the field whatever you want. </p>
