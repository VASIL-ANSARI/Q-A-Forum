<p>The error is because you are calling a field <code>test</code> which is not static, and is not annotated with <code>@Shared</code>. I'm not 100% sure what you're trying to do will work even if you add the <code>@Shared</code> annotation.</p>

<p>What I would do is move the common test logic to helper functions. These are functions which do not use the spock when/then blocks, but instead simply use <code>assert</code>. Put these helper functions into a super class and have all Specifications which will use it extend that class. Then you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class AutomaticSpec extends BaseSpec{

  def "This is a test"(){
     when:
       def x = some value
     then:
       super.helperFunction(x) //super not needed here, just for clarity
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the base spec:</p>

<pre><code>public class BaseSpec extends GebReportingSpec{
    def helperFunction(x){
      assert x == some condition
      true
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this setup you should be able to use common logic in multiple tests.</p>

<p>EDIT: The helpers should use assert instead of returning false for failure, in order to keep spock's fancy error reporting.</p>
