<p>You simply have two OneToMany associations. You just need to use joins in your query, as described in the <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.6/reference/en-US/html_single/#queryhql-joins" rel="nofollow">Hibernate documentation over HQL</a>.</p>

<pre><code>select book from Author author 
left join author.books assign
left join assign.book book
where author.name = :name
</code></pre>

<p>The second query is the same, except you just want the book names:</p>

<pre><code>select book.name from Author author ...
</code></pre>

<p>Side note: you shouldn't name your collection of Assigns <code>books</code> or <code>authors</code>: it's very confusing. Name it <code>assigns</code>.</p>
