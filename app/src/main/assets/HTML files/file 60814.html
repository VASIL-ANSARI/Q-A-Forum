<p>When you click a product on that web page, it loads the new content in with JavaScript and updates the visible URL in the address bar using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries" rel="nofollow">HTML5 History APIs</a>.</p>

<p>From the above MDN article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This will cause the URL bar to display <a href="http://mozilla.org/bar.html" rel="nofollow">http://mozilla.org/bar.html</a>, but won't cause the browser to load bar.html or even check that bar.html exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" rel="nofollow">single-page applications</a>. Since the actual loaded page doesnât change, the WebView callback for page loads isnât called.</p>

<p>In case you know precisely what kind of HTTP request you want to intercept, you could use the <code>shouldInterceptRequest</code> callback that gets called for each request. Itâs likely that the web application loads some data from an API, for example when a product is shown, which you could then detect.</p>

<p>If detecting this isnât possible, but youâre in control of the web application, you could use the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview.html#BindingJavaScript" rel="nofollow">Android JavaScript interface</a> to invoke methods within the Android application directly from the web page.</p>

<p>If youâre not in control of the loaded page, you could still try to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21552912/android-web-view-inject-local-javascript-file-to-remote-webpage">inject a local JavaScript file</a> into the web page and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4570093/how-to-get-notified-about-changes-of-the-history-via-history-pushstate">observe when the history APIs are used</a>, then call methods in your Android application over the JS interface. I tried observing these events in Chrome with the method described in the previous link and it seems to work fine.</p>
