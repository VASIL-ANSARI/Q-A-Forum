<p>Everything in NSB is unidirectional on purpose for a <a href="http://nservicebus.com/ArchitecturalPrinciples.aspx" rel="nofollow">whole host of reasons</a>.  In order to notify your clients that they need to do something you could poll a view model to see if there is work to be done on some interval.  The Saga would be responsible for inserting/updating the right rows for the UI to pick up on.  Once the UI is complete you can use NSB to Send() a message back to the Saga.  If this is a web UI, check out the AsyncPages sample in the download.</p>

<p>Another way to do this would be to push a message to the client, assuming that messaging is installed along with the client.  You will need to create some kind of message pump in the background.  Again, once work is complete, a simple Send() will do.</p>
