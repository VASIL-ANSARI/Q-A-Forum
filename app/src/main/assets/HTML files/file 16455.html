<p>You didn't tell what was not working when the <strong>emulator</strong> was not running so I'll guess the problem is (assuming that <code>adb devices</code> shows your devices as online) you haven't specified the <em>serial number</em> in you ant command line as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ ant -Dadb.device.arg="-s 0123456789" test
</code></pre>
