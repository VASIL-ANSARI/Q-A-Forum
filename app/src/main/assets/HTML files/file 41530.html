<p>I tried your query with my own account. It looks you issue is with the skills field.</p>

<p>You can see in the LinkedIn API <a href="https://developers.linkedin.com/documents/profile-fields#skills" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> that skills are made up of a skill, and each skill has a name. If you only want the name returned the proper way to ask for it is
<code>skills:(skill:(name))</code>, whereas your request asks for <code>skills:(name)</code>.</p>

<p>Here is an updated request for you:</p>

<pre><code>GET https://api.linkedin.com/v1/people/~:(first-name,last-name,headline,location:(name),skills:(skill:(name)),educations:(id,school-name,field-of-study))?format=json
</code></pre>
