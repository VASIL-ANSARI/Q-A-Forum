<p>I can't tell if you're doing this or not but make sure you're sharing the post page and not the index page.</p>

<pre><code>href="www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=&lt;%= @post.url %&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>The og tags in the head won't update without reloading the page, so you'll have to point Facebook to each post's unique url.</p>
