<p>This may work, but something along the line of:</p>

<pre><code>set @total_rows = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE Birth between 1980 and 1985);

SELECT language, percentage
FROM (
    SELECT language, concat(count(language)/@total_rows, "%") AS percentage 
    FROM table WHERE Birth between 1980 and 1985
)
</code></pre>
