<p>Just thought I'd add another possibility to your investigation...  I have not used either of those controls but have used Farpoint's <a href="http://www.fpoint.com/netproducts/spreadnet/spreadnet.aspx" rel="nofollow">Spread</a> control.  It is very easy to use, especially unbound and is very stable.  We've used it on a number of projects and love it.  </p>
