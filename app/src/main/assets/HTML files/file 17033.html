<p>When I have had to implement solutions such as this I would either create a template called 'Site settings' and inherit it from the homepage (or create a item using this template) and then write some extension methods for the Site class. Storing the ID of the settings item in the Web.config is something I usually prefer to avoid to I usually just attach the template to the homepage.</p>

<p>That way I can end up with the following.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%=Sitecore.Context.Site.Settings.AnalyticsCode()%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This particular extension method would first look at the context item to see if the 'Analytics code' field is populated, if it is not then I grab the homepage and get the field from there instead.</p>

<p>This method of course allows you to expand with a number of handy extension methods available from your context site or context item.</p>
