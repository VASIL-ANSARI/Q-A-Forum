  <p>Are screen readers really so primitive that they would read text that isn't even displayed on the screen?</p>

<p>What you have to remember is that any HTML parser doesn't read the screen - it reads the source markup. Whta you see on the screen is the browser's attempt to apply CSS to the source code. It's irrelevant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could probably even identify parts of the page that are menus or table of contents, and give some sort of easy way for those parts to be read exclusively or skipped over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could, if there were a standard for such a thing.</p>

<p>I'm not very hot on the <em>limitations</em> of screen readers, however I've read a lot about them not being ideal. The best thing I can reccommend is to put your source in order - how you'd read it. </p>

<p>There are a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_ref_aural.asp" rel="nofollow">set of CSS properties</a> you should also look at for screen readers.</p>
