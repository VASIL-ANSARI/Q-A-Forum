<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong> To change the startup orientation from the initial Portrait mode, you need to edit your info.plist file. Add an entry for "intial interface orientation" and set the value that you want.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong> You can also try this in your navigation controller as a subview to the window and orientation notifications are only sent to the first subview in "window".</p>

<pre><code>//.m file
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {    
    // Hide status bar
    application.statusBarHidden = YES;
        // --- Add the view controller's view to the window and display.
    [window addSubview:viewController.view];
    [viewController.view addSubview:navigationController.view];
    [window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>
