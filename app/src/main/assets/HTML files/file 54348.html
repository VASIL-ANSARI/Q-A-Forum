<p>However,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or should I write the code sync and then convert it at a later date?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's likely easier, and does get away from the issue entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And would it be considered technical debt?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By definition it is, though:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You may need to have synchronous calls well into the future anyway, to support that case, so you will already have that technical debt, you're just dealing with it.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>do</strong> have that technical debt already. You said, "but the calling code is not currently written in async". There, that's your debt, already there.</p></li>
<li><p>If the sync and async versions mirror each other (very common) and you place the methods next to their twins, it can be easy to do most changes to each at the same time.</p></li>
</ol>
