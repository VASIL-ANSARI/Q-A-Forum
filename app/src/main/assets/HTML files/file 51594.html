<p>Method and UnboundMethod types expect that the bind target must be subclass of the original class where you have referenced the method. However the Method has a <code>#to_proc</code> method implemented and with that, you can get rid off the 'same class type' constraint.</p>

<p>You have to use <code>#send</code> method, as <code>#define_method</code> is private (you cannot call it directly).</p>

<pre><code>class A
  def hoge ; "hoge" ; end
end

class B ; end

hoge = A.new.method(:hoge)

B.send(:define_method, :hoge_in_b, &amp;hoge) #converting to proc

b = B.new
puts b.hoge_in_b
</code></pre>
