<p>The credit should really go to both JeremyCook and Quentin for pointing me in the right direction.</p>

<pre><code> $(exiting_list).find('li').each(function(e,li){
    var id = $(li).find('span').prop('id');
    var name = $(li).find('span').html(); // &lt;--- This is the problem. Must be .text()
    arr_list.push(new brand(id,name));
 });
</code></pre>

<p>What I did wrong was that I used <code>.html()</code> and the text was returned in HTML format. Changing this to <code>.text()</code> solved my problem.</p>
