<p>Briefly,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You don't need .properties , you can use <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-loading-yaml" rel="nofollow">yaml</a> with spring boot, it's more readable.Single yaml file is enough for your configuration,because yaml uses indents, so you can distinguish  parameters easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Single Application class is fine, because you won't execute only core module.</p></li>
<li><p>There are lots of <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-starters" rel="nofollow">starter</a> dependencies and their <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html" rel="nofollow">configurations</a>  , you can speed up in projects.</p></li>
</ol>
