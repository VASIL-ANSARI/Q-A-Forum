<p>Consider using the <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/06/Don-t-Build-Blobs-Construct-Them" rel="nofollow">Blob constructor</a> instead. That way, it is easier to load your image over AJAX, and you don't need to have it inline, which might be the problem here (maybe it's too big?). And you don't need to base64 encode anything.</p>
