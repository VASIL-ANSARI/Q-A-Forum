<p>It looks like the javascript is only being run once, when the document loads, and not re-evaluate afterwards. If this is the only problem, you should see the correct behaviour if you are in full screen then load the page. To fix this you will have to make a function out of your code and call it every time the window is resized. Using jQuery, you can do this using an anonymous function:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
$(window).resize(function() {
    if((window.fullScreen) || (window.innerWidth == screen.width &amp;&amp; window.innerHeight == screen.height)) {
        $("html").css("overflow", "hidden");
    } else {
        $("html").css("overflow", "auto");
    }
});

$(document).ready(function(){
    $(window).resize();
    // trigger the function when the page loads
    // if you have another $(document).ready(), simply add this line to it
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This binds the function to the resize event handler and you should see correct results! If that works it will be a <em>much</em> nicer and robust way of doing it.</p>
