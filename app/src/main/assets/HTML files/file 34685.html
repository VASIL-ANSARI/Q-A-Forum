<p>The problem isn't using GCD, the problem is that cells don't work like that. You have a tableview with lots of rows. Having tableview rows is cheap, cells are not cheap. Therefore, iOS will reuse the same cells again and again. It only needs as many cells as you can see on the screen, not as many as you have rows. </p>

<p>So in your asynchronous code, do <em>not</em> try to load a cell and set the image. Instead, store the image in the data model, and tell the tableview to redraw the line of the tableview that has changed. </p>
