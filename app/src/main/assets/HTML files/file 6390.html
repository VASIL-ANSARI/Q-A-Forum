<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management" rel="nofollow">Memory management</a> is not something that you can easily visualize while you are programming.  Instead, it refers to how your program is allocating and freeing memory while it is running.  Many debuggers will provide a way to halt a program while it is running and view information about the dynamic memory that it has allocated.  You can plan your classes and interfaces with proper memory management techniques, but it's not as simple as "hit this button for a chart of your memory usage".</p>

<p>You can also implement something like <a href="http://www.flipcode.com/archives/How_To_Find_Memory_Leaks.shtml" rel="nofollow">this</a> to keep track of your memory allocations and warn you about anything that your program didn't free.  A garbage collector can free you from some of the hassles associated with memory management.</p>
