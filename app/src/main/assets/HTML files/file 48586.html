<p>The easiest solution may be to simply use HTML event attributes (instead of <code>addEventListener</code>), such as <code>&lt;a onclick="dostuff();"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code>, because the attribute should be preserved during 'cloning'. <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/2r9t5cpg/5/" rel="nofollow">See this fiddle</a> (tested in Firefox 40) for an example.</p>

<p>Letting the code in the onclick attribute interact with your userscript may be be a little difficult <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10828021/1288130">because it runs in a different JavaScript environment</a>. Luckily there's plenty of possible workarounds, depending on your exact needs.</p>
