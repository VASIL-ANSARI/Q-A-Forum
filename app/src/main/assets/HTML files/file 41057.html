<p>As you pointed out, you need to share the existing calendar with the service account</p>

<pre><code>&lt;paste-your-account-here&gt;@developer.gserviceaccount.com
</code></pre>

<p>(You can find the account in question under the credentials tab in Google Developers Console, it's called 'EMAIL ADDRESS')</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
