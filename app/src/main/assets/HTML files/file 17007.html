<p>Your anonymous function, the one inside the setInterval, is waiting the same amount of time (your delay) to run initially. You can either: </p>

<p>1) change the anonymous function into a named function, and run that once before executing your interval </p>

<p>2)Run these lines before the setInterval method. Just to emulate that the code inside the anonymous function once.</p>

<pre><code>   el.addClass(classes[3]);
   ql.addClass(classesb[3]);
</code></pre>

<p>You can look inside this fiddle, and see some solutions I have provided.</p>
