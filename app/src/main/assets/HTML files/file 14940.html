<p>Once you go async, you can never go back.  From there you only really have access to the async's callback.  you can ramp up the complexity of this and do some threading &amp; waithandles but that can be rather a painful endeavor.</p>

<p>Technically, you can also sleep the thread when you need to wait for the results, but I don't recommend that, you may as well do a normal http request at that point.</p>

<p>In C# 5 theyhave async/await commands that will make it easier to get the results of the async call to the main thread.</p>
