<p>In general you don't want to make tests conditional on each other. They should be able to run independently and in any order. At the point when you start coupling your tests together it's going to start making failures harder to debug.</p>

<p>The Given I just uploaded "spec/fixtures/kitten.jpg" as my avatar is doesn't need to be an exact duplicate of the first cuke. You could just as easily just create the file on the file system and any needed models in the Cucumber step. You already know the upload part works so you don't need to do the full upload before the crop for the second example.</p>

<p>Or, alternatively, you could make a single step that contains:</p>

<pre><code>Given I follow "Upload picture"
When I attach the file "spec/fixtures/kitten.jpg" to "user_avatar"
And I press "Upload"
</code></pre>

<p>And re-use that in the specs. That way, you can test the landing page and the flash in the first test and the cropping in the second. The values of the flash and the landing page don't matter for the second test.</p>
