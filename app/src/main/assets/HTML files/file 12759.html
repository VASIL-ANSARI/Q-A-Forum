<p>Only exists one mainloop in <code>gtk</code> at the same time, that is, <code>gtk.main</code> enters into a new level and <code>gtk.main_quit</code> exists from that level.</p>

<p>Usually, what you'd need to do is is a create worker thread that keeps working in parallel and updates the widgets when it gets new information. However, according to the problem you describe, I believe you just need to monitor a file for changes with <code>gio</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>monitor = gio.File(filename).monitor()
monitor.connect('changed', file_changed_cb)
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever the file changes a signal will be emitted and the <code>file_changed_cb</code> callback method will be executed. There you can update the widgets to match the new information from the file that is being monitored. However, note that if your callback method takes too long to complete, your application might look unresponive, then you have to go for the thread strategy.</p>
