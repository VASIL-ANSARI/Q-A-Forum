<p>Months in the <code>Date</code> constructor are 0-indexed, so 0 is January, 1 is February, etc. and moreover the parameters can overflow (<code>new Date(2017,11,32)</code> is actually 
<code>Mon Jan 01 2018 00:00:00</code>). So in your example the dates are in fact:</p>

<pre><code>new Date(2017,1,31)
Fri Mar 03 2017 00:00:00
new Date(2017,2,10)
Fri Mar 10 2017 00:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore the result is correct.</p>
