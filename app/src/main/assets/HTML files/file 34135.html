<p>The issue you experience to be random can easily be caused by the Rails/Ruby autoloading. The order files get loaded are unguessable sometimes. Combined with using the wrong file name for your class or putting it into the wrong directory may lead to this issue.</p>

<p>You don't get the exception if you explicitly require the file your class is defined in before referencing the class itself. If you reference first Rails try to find the according file in the load path. If it cannot find it, it raises.</p>

<p>Please double check your file names and have a look at the <code>$LOAD_PATH</code> variable. <code>app/workers</code> should be included.</p>

<p>An easy test to start with is to run <code>rails console</code> and simply access <code>MediaAnalyzer</code>.</p>
