<p>A common "pitfall" when it comes to moving your (compiled or not) project to your web host from your local machine is that the web host may not have the same configuration as your project/local/development machine.</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure you have all the assemblies in your /bin folder</li>
<li>if you somehow created assemblies (dlls) for each file, then make sure all of them are copied to your web host</li>
<li>Your web host will (likely) have different security settings than your own machine while you are debugging. You're working on <strong>full trust</strong> locally/in Visual Studio, while most, if not all web hosts will likely be using <strong>medium trust</strong>. So a good rule of thumb while developing in Visual Studio is to set your <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tkscy493.aspx" rel="nofollow"><strong>web.config to medium trust</strong></a> to avoid pitfalls "at the last moment" - particularly if you don't have a dedicated machine at your web host.</li>
<li>just because you have .Net 4 on your machine, doesn't automatically mean your web host has it. You can bin deploy the assemblies you need - in VS 2010 <code>right click</code> your project and select <code>"Add Deployable Dependencies"</code> - this will add all the necessary dlls you need in your /bin folder. Yes, you will likely not need all of them, but unless/until you're fairly comfortable in choosing which one should or shouldn't be deployed, you'll have to trust Visual Studio....</li>
<li>I'm hesitant to add this, but still - ask your web host what verison of ASP.Net/.Net Framework they support. It sounds funny but trust me, I'm hosted on one of the largest and well known/trusted web hosts out there and to this day, I have to contact support (but their support is "fanatical" - clue to who it is) to have my web site/s set to ASP.Net 4 (they <em>support it</em> but an extra manual config is needed by their personnel).</li>
</ul>
