<p>After testing out various methods, it seems there is no way faster than the others.  I'm saving each image after creating it, so that I can release it from memory.</p>

<p>Process goes:</p>

<p>Take camera data. --> Run data through filters. --> Take output image and convert to CGImageRef. --> Save that and release.</p>
