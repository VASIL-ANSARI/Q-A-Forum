<p>You're spending tons of time creating and then repeatedly searching (on every line!!!) that monstrous <code>list</code>. Just read the first file line by line and skip every other. You can either do this with a toggling flag, or just check if the line number is divisible by two (clearer, in my opinion).</p>

<pre><code>for i, line in enumerate(file):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        newfile.write(line)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> in response to your edit: your question is now "how to copy arbitrary lines from a file?" That depends an awful lot on how those arbitrary lines are defined. The answer still is definitely <strong>not</strong> to use a list of "wanted" line numbers, because searching that list takes a long time, and you'll have to search it on every line.</p>

<p>If the goal is essentially to be able to pick random lines from the file, you could use something similar to your current setup, but using <code>set</code> instead of <code>list</code> to make your lookup fast. A <strong>general-case</strong> proof-of-concept solution might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>import random

# Pick 5000 random lines
wanted_lines = set(random.sample(range(200000), 5000)) # Use a set!
for i, line in enumerate(file):
    if i in wanted_lines: # average-case O(1)
        newfile.write(str(line)+'\n')
</code></pre>
