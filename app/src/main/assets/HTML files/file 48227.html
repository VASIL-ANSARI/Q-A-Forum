<p>I experienced many CSS issues when working with the Booster extension before, re-installing it following those steps fixed them for me at that time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Get <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/374/yiiboilerplate-setup-a-professional-project-structure-in-seconds/" rel="nofollow">YiiBoilerplate</a>
  and unzip it somewhere, it's created by the same guys at clevertech
  and using the booster extension by default.</li>
  <li>Go to {unzipped}backend/views/layouts/ and grab main.php,
  column1.php and column2.php</li>
  <li>create a new theme in your webapp under the /themes folder (I called
  it 'booster')</li>
  <li>Copy the three files from (3) into themes/booster/views/layouts In
  your main.php add 'theme' => 'booster' as a top-level entry of the
  array (I put it first)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That was @TeacherT solution that worked out for me after posting <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14468373/yiibooster-theme-not-working">this Stackoverflow question</a>, other solutions has came out later and seemed to solve the CSS issues to other users, so you may try them too.</p>
