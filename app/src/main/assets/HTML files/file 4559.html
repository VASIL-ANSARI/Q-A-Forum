<p>It would be nice to get a few more details about what your app does before we can provide a more informed recommendation. I'll make a few assumptions anyway to see if it helps...</p>

<p>Firstly, when dealing with BOOL properties in Coredata, it is important to remember that they are actually saved as NSNumbers so keep that in mind when you need to test their values and make sure you are using the right methods.</p>

<p>Assuming the data in your ListViewController is being populated by CoreData and your data model defines an entity "Entity" with an attribute of type BOOL called "favourite", here's what you can try:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

       NSManagedObject *entityObject = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath];
       if (![entityObject.favourite boolValue]) {
            entityObject.favourite = [NSNumber numberWithBool:YES];
            [self.yourToggleButton setSelected:YES]; // this assumes your checkbox is a UIButton and you want its view to be updated to checked when your BOOL == YES
        }
        else {
            entityObject.favourite = [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO];
            [self.watchListButton setSelected:NO];
        }
</code></pre>

<p>The above assumes you have a fetchedResultsController taking care of the data fetching from your CoreData database too. If not I strongly recommend you check out one the tutorials from Apple (CoreData Books and CoreData Recipes) to understand how they work as it will make your life much easier - NSFetchedResultsController make it pretty straight forward to keep your data syncronised between different views which is something you are going to have to consider specially because you are allowing different attributes to be edited in different view controllers.</p>

<p>I hope this helps but feel free to ask any additional questions if you need to.
Cheers,
Rog</p>
