<p>Turns out the problem wasn't gradle at all. The problem was IntelliJ.</p>

<p>It got it's knickers into a proper twist!</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br />
 1. Close the project in IntelliJ<br />
 2. Delete the .idea directory<br />
 3. Delete all .iml files and any other IntelliJ cra-useful files<br />
 4. Open project in IntelliJ, choose same directory. Problem disappears.<br /></p>
