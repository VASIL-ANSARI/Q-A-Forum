<p><code>org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.jpql.tools.spi.IManagedTypeProvider</code> is in
<code>org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.jpql_2.6.1.qualifier.jar</code> in my build (2.6.1 branch from git) but you already have it there. Maybe try to create new library in NetBeans containing all those JARs and use it instead this one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I'm leaving on vacation now but I can have a look at this closer next week. We may update EclipseLink to 2.6.0 in master branch of NetBeans.</p>
