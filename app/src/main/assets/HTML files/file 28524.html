<p>The current version doesn't support treatNulls property. You can add null points to a Line series and they will just be skipped. The next maintenance release will include the treatNulls property that will allow you to choose between:</p>

<p>"<em>skip</em>": it doesn't draw the point but the line segment between the points before and after the null point is still drawn.</p>

<p>"<em>dontPaint</em>": the point isn't drawn and neither the segment linking the points next to it.</p>
