<p>I tried it with openpyxl 2.3.5 and got the following</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
  /usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/openpyxl/worksheet/worksheet.py:350:
  <strong>UserWarning: Call to deprecated function or class get_highest_row (Use
  the max_row property).</strong>   def get_highest_row(self):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as you are using 2.4 they probably removed it from there as it was deprecated already in 2.3.5.  </p>

<p>EDIT: In the <a href="http://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/2.4/api/openpyxl.worksheet.worksheet.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for 2.4 this method is not mentioned any longer </p>
