<p>The two âoverloadsâ aren't in the same scope. By default, the compiler only considers the smallest possible name scope until it finds a name match. Argument matching is done <em>afterwards</em>. In your case this means that the compiler sees <code>B::DoSomething</code>. It then tries to match the argument list, which fails.</p>

<p>One solution would be to pull down the overload from <code>A</code> into <code>B</code>'s scope:</p>

<pre><code>class B : public A {
public:
    using A::DoSomething;
    // â¦
}
</code></pre>
