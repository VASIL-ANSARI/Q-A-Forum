<p>Here's how to do it in bash from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>psql -qtAc "CREATE TABLE my_table (word text);"
for word in $(&lt;my_file); do psql -qtAc "INSERT INTO my_table(word) VALUES ('$word');"; done
</code></pre>

<p>assuming of course that every word in the file is an entry in the table</p>
