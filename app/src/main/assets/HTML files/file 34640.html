<p>Basically you would have to use JavaScript's <code>scrollLeft()</code> and <code>scrollTop()</code> methods on link click to take them to certain areas of the page. Be careful about this though. It can be quite slow on some devices if you have a lot of content.</p>

<p>For dragging certain objects on the page (or for dragging the entire page itself), you'll want to use a library like <a href="http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/" rel="nofollow">Hammer.js</a>. You can bind a drag event to a certain element or to the page itself and then use <code>scrollLeft()</code> and <code>scrollTop()</code> to control the page.</p>

<p>To "show" movement as you scroll, use jQuery's <code>animate()</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>$(window).animate({ scrollTop: $(document).height() }, 5000);
</code></pre>
