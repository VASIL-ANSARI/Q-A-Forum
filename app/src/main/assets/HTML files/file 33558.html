<p>As I answered in your other question already: Indendation...!</p>

<p>Your pygame.display.update() is outside the while loop. This means that it is not called until the while loop has finished and that's not going to happen here, therefore the display is just never ever updated.</p>

<p>Indend the pygame.display.update() to the level of screen.blit(background,(0,0)) and it will work just fine.</p>
