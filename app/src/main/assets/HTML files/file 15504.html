<p>Why would you include a "back" button if you don't have multiple views? What exactly will you navigate "back" to?</p>

<p>"The net" is correct, you need a <code>UINavigationController</code> to house a "back" button which would pop a view to the previous view.</p>

<p>Other than a UINavigationController, you could use a UIToolbar and set a button to the left hand corner and give it the title of "Back" to simulate the native appearance âÂ but this would be misleading and pointless.</p>

<p>I don't use PhoneGap, but I am sure there is a way to simulate a NavigationController and manually place a button there. I'm also sure it won't be shaped like a back button either (with the pointy end).</p>
