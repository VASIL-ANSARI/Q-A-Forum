<p>Once you make an element "position: absolute;" its space is no longer taken into consideration when the page is generated. That is why your paragraph text and header text overlap. The best way to avoid this is to add padding to the bottom of your blockquote element to make the article large enough to accommodate the space the header requires.</p>

<pre><code>blockquote {
    padding-bottom: 100px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The issue with this solution is it isn't very dynamic if you have multiple headers of different sizes.</p>
