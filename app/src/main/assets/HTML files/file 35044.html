<p>A way of installing many python packages, amongst which scikit-learn, without needing root priviledges is to install it locally</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py install --user
</code></pre>

<p>which will write information to <code>~/.local</code>.</p>

<p>A second option is</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py develop
</code></pre>

<p>which will compile in place and place a symbolic link in <code>/Users/*****/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/</code>. You may have to <code>sudo</code> and you may have to delete the old <code>sklearn</code>.</p>

<p>A third, more explicit way of doing this is to place the symbolic link yourself, which will require surgical, but very localized use of <code>sudo</code> for placing the link and removing the old scikit learn.</p>

<p>Assuming you cloned into <code>~/scikit-learn/</code></p>

<pre><code>cd ~/scikit-learn
make in
cd /Users/*****/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
sudo mv sklearn sklearn_
sudo ln -s ~/scikit-learn/sklearn sklearn
</code></pre>
