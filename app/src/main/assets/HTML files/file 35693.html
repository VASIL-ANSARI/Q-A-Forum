<p>I believe your <code>getId()</code> is returning an <code>Integer</code> instead of <code>int</code>.</p>

<p><code>Integer</code> is the wrapper class for <code>int</code> primitive type.  If you compare object reference using <code>==</code>, you are comparing if they are referring to same object, instead of comparing the value inside.  Hence if you are comparing two <code>Integer</code> objects reference, you are not comparing its integer value, you are simply checking if that two reference is pointing to same <code>Integer</code> object.</p>

<p>However, if you use a primitive type to store that value (e.g. <code>int a = ....getId()</code>), there is auto-unboxing happening, and that wrapper object is converted to primitive type value, and comparing primitive type values using <code>==</code> is comparing the value, which do the work you expect.</p>
