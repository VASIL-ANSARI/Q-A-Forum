<p>You are saving too often. Try saving in batches, say after 500 or so inserts. </p>

<p>Also, try switching of the undo manager of the context for this operation. Assuming you have a child context that you can discard:</p>

<pre><code>context.undoManager = nil
</code></pre>

<p>Also, your GCD code is quite complicated. Have you looked at the <code>performBlock</code> and <code>performBlockAndWait</code> APIs of <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code>?</p>
