<p>I think the problem is that you forgot to fetch the data from cursor. You wrote 
<code>final String text = ("txtUserChoice");</code>
and you should write like
<code>int index = cursor.getColumnIndex(choic);</code>
<code>final String text = cursor.getString(index);</code>
and make cursor and choic variable as instance member.</p>
