<p>From what I know of ezSQL (via it's wordpress pendant) I would consider Doctrine as well as too much for the moment because it's a complete data mapper for the database whereas you might be more looking to how to move away from your recent use of ezSQL which I think is a good idea.</p>

<p>Bascially you might be interested in a data-access abstraction layer. That could be <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php" rel="nofollow">PDO</a> as it's build in into PHP. Even if you don't need to change the database server, it will give you defined interfaces how to query and access the data.</p>

<p>As you build the site from scratch, I can suggest you consider using some lightweight framework. A good introduction in my eyes is <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/from_flat_php_to_symfony2.html" rel="nofollow">When Flat PHP meets Symfony</a> which shows how a webapp can generally benefit from patterns and a flexible design.</p>
