<p>No. You should define your class as <code>class Bunch(object)</code>, but continue to refer to <code>self.__dict__</code>.</p>

<p>You only need to use the <code>object.__setattr__</code> method while you are defining  the <code>self.__setattr__</code> method to prevent infinite recursion. <code>__dict__</code> is not a method, but is an attribute on the object itself, so <code>object.__dict__</code> would not work.</p>
