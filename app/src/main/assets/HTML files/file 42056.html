<p>You have different number of columns indeed. The last <code>UNION</code> number of column is only one column seleccted, where the first select you had selected 5 as following:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO email_queues (queueid, queuetype, ownerid, processed, recipient)
    SELECT DISTINCT 323,                -- These are five columns
                    'export',
                    1,
                    0,
                    subscriberid
    FROM
    (
       ....
    ) AS T1
    WHERE subscriberid NOT IN (... )
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT subscribers.subscriberid AS subscriberid -- This where is the error, only one column selected
    FROM email_list_subscribers AS subscribers
    JOIN email_lists AS lists ON lists.listid = subscribers.listid
    AND lists.listid IN (33)
    WHERE subscribers.listid IN (33)
      AND ((subscribers.emailaddress LIKE '%v%'))
</code></pre>

<p>You have to modify it like this in order to make it works:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO email_queues (queueid, queuetype, ownerid, processed, recipient)

                'export',
                1,
                0,
                subscriberid
FROM
(
   SELECT DISTINCT subscribers.subscriberid AS subscriberid
   FROM email_list_subscribers AS subscribers
   JOIN email_lists AS lists ON lists.listid = subscribers.listid AND lists.listid IN (34)
   WHERE subscribers.listid IN (34)
     AND ((subscribers.emailaddress LIKE '%a%'))

     AND ((subscribers.emailaddress LIKE '%kim%'))
) AS T1
WHERE subscriberid NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT subscribers.subscriberid AS subscriberid
                           FROM email_list_subscribers AS subscribers

                            AND lists.listid IN (37, 34)

                             AND ((subscribers.emailaddress LIKE '%a%'
                                  OR subscribers.emailaddress LIKE '%kim%'))
                          )
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT -- You have to add these in order to make the query works
  323,

  0,

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: You can also move that query inside the subquery, something like this</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO email_queues (queueid, queuetype, ownerid, processed, recipient)
