<p>One solution would be to create another class called CopiedBuildingMaterials, which then contains two instances of BuildingMaterials: the original and the copied versions.</p>

<pre><code>class CopiedBuildingMaterials{
   BuildingMaterials original;
   BuildingMaterials copied;
}

class BuildingMaterials {
   Date creationDate;
   int bricks;
   int sand;
}
</code></pre>
