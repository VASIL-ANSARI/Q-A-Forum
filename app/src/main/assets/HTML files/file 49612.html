<p>This is the rationale for avoiding singletons from the same <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Ri-singleton" rel="nofollow">guideline collection</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I.3: Avoid singletons</p>
  
  <p>Reason</p>
  
  <p>Singletons are basically complicated global objects in disguise.</p>
  
  <p>Example</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>class Singleton {
    // ... lots of stuff to ensure that only one Singleton object is created,
    // that it is initialized properly, etc.
};
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are many variants of the singleton idea. That's part of the problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My analysis of the intentions of the author:</p>

<p>Simpler is better. If disguising global objects in singletons doesn't solve the problems of global objects - like the guideline above implies - then there is no use in complicating the code by the use of the disguise.</p>
