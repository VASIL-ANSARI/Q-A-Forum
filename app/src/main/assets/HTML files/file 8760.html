<p>I think you'd want:</p>

<pre><code>$('#follow_form').html("&lt;%= escape_javascript(render('users/unfollow')) %&gt;");
$('#followers').html('&lt;%= "#{@user.followers.count} followers" %&gt;');
</code></pre>

<p>The Prototype "$" function is a short-cut to "document.getElementById()" (sort-of; it's a little more complicated on IE).  For jQuery, you have to use a CSS-like selector syntax.  Then, the ".update()" function in Prototype is for accessing "innerHTML" with some extra cleanup behavior, and jQuery's ".html()" is similar.</p>
