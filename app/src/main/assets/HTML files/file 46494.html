<p>No, in any context something like</p>

<pre><code>int i=i;
</code></pre>

<p>is a bad idea, since the second <code>i</code> is the same object as the first, and still not initialized.</p>

<p>If you'd insist you could do something like</p>

<pre><code>int tmp=i, i=tmp;
</code></pre>

<p>to have the effect that you want.</p>
