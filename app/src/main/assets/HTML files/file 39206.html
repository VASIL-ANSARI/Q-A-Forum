<p>The docs for <code>LocationRequest.setInterval()</code> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This method sets the rate in milliseconds at which your app prefers to receive location updates. If no other apps are receiving updates from Location Services, your app will receive updates at this rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you're not receiving calls to <code>onLocationChanged()</code> as frequent as you've stated must be because there are other apps receiving updates from Location Services.</p>

<p>I recommend you check if you have other apps utilizing Location Services and try closing them to see if you start receiving updates at your desired rate.</p>
