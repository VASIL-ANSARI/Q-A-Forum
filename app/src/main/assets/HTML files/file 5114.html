<p>I don't think you can trigger default browser events... </p>

<p>that in mind use an <code>array</code> to store ever keystroke of a particular time. e.g.</p>

<p>if i type "hello world " which in a second or if i continuesly keep typing keep recording the characters. when the users stops typing more than a second then push it to an array that way u have more control of the changes. </p>

<p>another thing is that this is a bad feeling. but im sure that 26 and 122 does not stand for ctrl + z most likely it's for the z it self or the control.</p>
