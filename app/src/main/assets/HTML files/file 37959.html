<p>Depends on your database system and programming language. A pure SQL solution can get pretty ugly (especially if you need to support update and insert).</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO tableB(rowid, concatCol)
    (SELECT rowid, objectIdA+'_'+objectIDB FROM tableA)
</code></pre>

<p>Would work if + is the concatenation operation (Oracle uses <code>||</code> I think) and if the second table is empty (and if rowid is actually insertable). If the columns are nullable you can use your RDBMS function for <code>CASE</code> to differentiate between the case you need to add second row and separator or skip both.</p>
