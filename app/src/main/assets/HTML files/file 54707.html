<p>You should not be using a static variable to hold the callback listener in your <code>RecyclerAdapter</code>. This means each <code>RecyclerAdapter</code> will always have the same callback listener when you want each one to have its own.</p>

<p>That is why you are experiencing this issue. <code>RatedFragment</code> and <code>PopularFragment</code> are both using a <code>RecyclerAdapter</code>. When you click an image the callback from your <code>RatedFragment</code> will be called even when viewing the <code>PopulareFragmnet</code>.</p>

<p><code>RatedFragment</code> is then not adding the extra you are looking for which is causing the <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>

<p>To fix this remove static from mListener in the <code>RecyclerAdapter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>private OnClick mListener;
</code></pre>

<p>Then remove static also from the definition of the <code>ViewHolder</code> class so it becomes an inner class and can access the listener directly:</p>

<pre><code>public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder
       implements View.OnClickListener {
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this you will still have to fix the <code>RatedFragment</code> since it will show the same <code>DetailsFragment</code> without the extra you are currently requiring.</p>
