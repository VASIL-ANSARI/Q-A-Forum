<p>You can use the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_hour" rel="nofollow">hour</a> method:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM visits WHERE HOUR(time_in) &gt;= 11 AND HOUR(time_in) &lt; 16
</code></pre>

<p>You will need a function to substract the time. If you know the date you should use a between function with date and time. So the MySQL index will be used aswell. With this method <code>HOUR</code> it will not use the index and if the query will be heavy it will take a short period.</p>
