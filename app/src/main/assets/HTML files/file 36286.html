<p>I think the problem is that you call geolocation from javascript code (in the function <code>updateView()</code>). The moment you put the application in the background, executing of javascript code will stop (and so will calling of <code>updateView()</code> function). The only thing working when the application is in background is the service you launched.</p>

<p>So what you probably want to do is alter native android code of <code>MyService</code> class and  call the geolocation inside service's <code>doWork()</code> function (something similar to what they did here, but instead of log you will do geolocation: <a href="https://github.com/Red-Folder/Cordova-Plugin-BackgroundService/blob/master/2.9.0/MyService.java" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Red-Folder/Cordova-Plugin-BackgroundService/blob/master/2.9.0/MyService.java</a>):</p>

<pre><code>public class MyService extends BackgroundService {
    ...
    @Override
    protected JSONObject doWork() {
        //geolocate and store the results to FTP using native java code
        return result;
    }   
    ...
</code></pre>
