<p>Well, you can resolve dns-name to IP.</p>

<ol>
<li>While PHP can't do this, you can create a test file on your server. After that you fetch request for his file. According OSI model, DNS client will resolve DNS name->IP, after that you will have IP in your HTTP headers, because your real query depend on IP of server.</li>
<li>Low level. Windows and Linux both have an API for resolving DNS name -> IP. So you can use their functions in C++ to get IP without test file. </li>
<li>Or you can construct DNS message: DNS-message => UDP-datagram => IP-package. After you send it to DNS-server and wait for answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your DNS-server IP you can find in your config.</p>
