<p>Rate limiting is not a concern of your queue system, much less of SuckerPunch that is not designed to handle advanced delaying/queuing stuff, it just moves asynchronous jobs to a thread from a thread pool.</p>

<p>If you really want to have rate limiting, use a real queue system like Sidekiq, and put some actual code to work.</p>

<p>Sidekiq Enterprise supports it natively: <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Rate-Limiting" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Rate-Limiting</a>
Sidekiq-throttler seems to provide the same functionality: <a href="https://github.com/gevans/sidekiq-throttler" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/gevans/sidekiq-throttler</a></p>

<p>But you can also just delay execution (so pre-emptively limiting the rate), by enqueuing jobs at specific times in the future (each executing 4 minutes after the other) or enqueuing just one job that executes itself (doing next outstanding request) and enqueues itself again with 4 minutes delay.</p>

<p>As always with open source, check the code and decide by yourself.</p>
