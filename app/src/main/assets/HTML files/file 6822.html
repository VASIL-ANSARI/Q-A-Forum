<p>I haven't played with this recently so I'm not sure that these "hacks" will still work but Nicolas Seriot had come out last year with a series of examples that show how much access a developer can have in an iPhone app. He released a project called "SpyPhone" that shows these examples, one of which, I believe, does what you're asking for.</p>

<p>Here are slides from a talk he did on it: <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/23739469/iPhone-Privacy-from-Nicolas-Seriot" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/23739469/iPhone-Privacy-from-Nicolas-Seriot</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
