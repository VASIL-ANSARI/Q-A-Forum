<p>Can I suggest this official Facebook API instructions for integration for iOS:</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/ios/build/" rel="nofollow">iOS Tutorial - Facebook API (press here!)</a></p>

<p>add some more of your code, also a suggestion:
Put your INITILIAZTION of the Facebook class IN the App Delegate and reference your Facebook class using the App Delegate singleton inside another file</p>
