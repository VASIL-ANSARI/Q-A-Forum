<p>It depends on the computer and the operating system that you are using, but usually this will be just pointless. </p>

<p>Lots of software nowadays is 64 bit. That means in practice that malloc will <em>never</em> fail, unless your size argument is ridiculously wrong, like an uninitialised variable, or (size_t) -1 which happens to be about 17 billion Gigabyte. What happens is that your application will start swapping like mad if you exceed the available RAM, and at some point the user can't take the slowness anymore and kills your application. So even checks for malloc failure are often pointless as long as you make sure your app crashes if it fails and doesn't go off doing stupid things, for security reasons. </p>

<p>As an example of code seriously using this approach, take MacOS X / iOS code, where many essential functions have no way to notify you if they run out of memory. </p>

<p>Now if you have a situation where you can't find the memory to allocate a small data packet, what are the chances of the application as a whole surviving this and doing anything meaningful? Nil? </p>
