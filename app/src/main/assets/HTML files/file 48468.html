<p>The best way to do this is to take a screen shot of the control, apply a blur to it, and then show that image over the top of the original control. This is how the yahoo weather app does it and its how google suggest you do things like this.</p>

<p>Render script does bluring fast. I've also got some code, but it's not currently at hand right now.</p>

<p>These might help:</p>

<p>I've also read that there are methods built into Android that do this, but the API isn't public so we cannot use it... which sucks.</p>
