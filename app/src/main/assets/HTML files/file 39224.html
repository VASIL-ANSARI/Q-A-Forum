<p>There are three problems here:</p>

<p>1) The latest Numba (version 0.14) does not support jitting classes or class methods (jitting classes was lost in the 0.12 refactor, but will probably be added back soon).</p>

<p>2) There is no void decorator (although it's possible this existed in a previous version - I don't remember).</p>

<p>3) The function signature isn't specified correctly in the jit decorator. It should be something like: @jit(void(float_[:,:], int_[:], int_)) for a function that takes a 2d float array, a 1d int array, and an int, and returns nothing. You could also specify it as a string: @jit('void(f4[:,:], i4[:], i4')</p>
