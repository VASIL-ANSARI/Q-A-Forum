<p>Bookmarklets are scripts run <em>by the user</em>. Yes, they can do all of the things you mentioned (limited in the same way that any other code in the page you inject them into is limited), but only when the user triggers them. They are indeed script injection, but script injection <em>by the person in charge of the machine</em>. The user can do at least as much, and really quite a lot more, by opening the browser's developer's tools.</p>

<p>But answering the question you actually asked: No, I don't think any new restrictions have been put on bookmarklets in the last several years.</p>
