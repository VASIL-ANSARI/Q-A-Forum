<p>You need the <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client" rel="nofollow">Google API Client for PHP</a>, which is a library to connect to different Google services including Google Fusion Tables.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/php/start/get_started" rel="nofollow">"Getting Started" page</a>, which explains how to use the library. Some time ago, I created <a href="https://github.com/metaodi/GFTPrototype/tree/master/examples/php" rel="nofollow">some PHP examples</a>, but I'm not sure if they are still working. But maybe they help you to head in the right direction. </p>
