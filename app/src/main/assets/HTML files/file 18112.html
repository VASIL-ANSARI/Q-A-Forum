<p>From what I can see, this API only supports GET requests.  I could be wrong, though.</p>

<p>Have you looked at gems like <code>rest_client</code> (<a href="https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client</a>)?  I'm not sure I really follow the code you put up.   If <code>rest_client</code> doesn't work for you, try a more general HTTP client like HTTParty (<a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty</a>).</p>
