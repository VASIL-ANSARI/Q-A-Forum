<p>I think the Intellisense error message is not directly related to boost and xlw.</p>

<p>If you are using VS2010, please have a look at the following link:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5077631/why-is-intellisense-unavailable-for-c-cli">Why is Intellisense &quot;Unavailable for C++/CLI&quot;?</a></p>

<p>You should still be able to use boost and compile even without Intellisense.</p>
