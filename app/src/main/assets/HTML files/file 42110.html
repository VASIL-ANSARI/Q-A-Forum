<p>Yes, you should be inheriting the base class to all other classes that will include <code>webdriver</code>. And, oh yea don't forget to use </p>

<pre><code>PageFactory.initElements()
</code></pre>

<p>to initiate all the page elements. 
And, if I understood your question well then Page Object Model is the approach you should be taking. The implementation can different depending on the way you want. One of the best examples on how to implement this can be found <a href="http://peternewhook.com/2010/09/automated-testing-pageobjects-webdriver/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
