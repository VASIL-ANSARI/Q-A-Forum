<p>Oh, duh, I figured it out five minutes after posting.  I needed to add a foreign_key to my User model, like this:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  # omitting attr_accessibles
  # omitting validations
  has_and_belongs_to_many :projects #writers assigned to the project
  has_and_belongs_to_many :projects, join_table: "disclosed_users_projects" #users who have been disclosed on the project
  has_many :deliverables, foreign_key: "owner_id"
end
</code></pre>
