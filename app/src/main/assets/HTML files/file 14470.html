<p>You can't access it because it becomes part of the tables controls collection, much like you can't directly access a <code>TextBox</code> in the column of a GridView.</p>

<p>You have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a regular HTML table instead</li>
<li>Use the <code>FindControl()</code> method to access the <code>GridView</code> in code-behind</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>For editing the control at design-time, it might be more efficient to go into the source view (markup) instead of dragging it in and out of the container. It will save you having to move it all the time, and you might find that it's faster than using the properties window; I know I find it much faster to edit the markup.</p>
