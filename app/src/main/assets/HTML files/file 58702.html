<p>Finally Resolved the issue, the endpoint that was getting used was different than the url where the wsdl was located.Managed to override the same with the URL that had the wsdl and it worked.(Point to note,i was using a dynamic URL to locate wsdl).Below is the code to set endpoint .</p>

<pre><code>BindingProvider bp = (BindingProvider) port;
Map&lt;String, Object&gt;req_context_map=bp.getRequestContext();
bp.getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, my_url);
</code></pre>

<p>Cheers.</p>
