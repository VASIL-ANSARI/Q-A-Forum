<p>switch is just a sort of <code>if x == y</code> with y being any of the matching cases.</p>

<p><code>case (strpos($field, '_term'))</code> would result in a -1 if match is not found or the point where "_term" was found (0 through string length -1 ) and not the field name.</p>

<p>If you're looking to catch anything with there phrase "_term" in the field do</p>

<pre><code>$matches = array();
if(preg_match('/(.+)_term$/', $field, $matches)) {
    $field = $matches[1];
}
</code></pre>

<p>this will replace the field value "address_term" or what ever "something_term" to just "address" or "something"</p>
