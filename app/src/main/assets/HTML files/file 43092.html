<p>You can create a local database using Entity Framework, which saves the database file on the local filesystem, which you can push to your version control server to share with your colleagues. If you decide to deploy the database, you can <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13521141/4699710">generate an sql script</a> that you can run on the production database. You can do so by connecting to the local database using SQL Management Studio. You will just need to modify the connection string of the published application after deployment.</p>
