<p>I Had the same issue on Xcode 7. 
I solved it by editing the build settings of the project (the one which includes the framework).</p>

<p>By setting the <strong>Framework Search Paths</strong> field to <strong>$(PROJECT_DIR)</strong> or to the path to the directory that contains the .framework file it should help Xcode finding the module.</p>
