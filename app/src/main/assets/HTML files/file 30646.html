<p>As the ng-click action to change the active style is executed before scrollTo (with $anchorScroll), I realized active style was overwritten when $anchorScroll executes, because it reload the page and the controller. So, what I did is to store the active style in a service and load it when controller reloads. Then works perfectly.</p>

<p>My controller:</p>

<pre><code> .controller ('AboutCtrl', function ($scope, $location, $anchorScroll, AboutService) {              

        var setActiveClass = function() {

            $scope.whatIsItStyle = "";
            $scope.howIsPossibleStyle = "";
            $scope.teamStyle = "";

            if ($scope.step == "whatIsIt") {
                $scope.whatIsItStyle = "active";
            } else if ($scope.step == "howIsPossible") {
                $scope.howIsPossibleStyle = "active";
            } else if ($scope.step == "team") {
                $scope.teamStyle = "active";
            } 
        }; 

        $scope.step = AboutService.getStep();       
        setActiveClass();       


        $scope.setStep = function(step) {               
            $scope.step = step;
            AboutService.setStep(step);
            setActiveClass();
        };                              
    })
</code></pre>
