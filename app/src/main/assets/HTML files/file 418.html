<p>You should have the native wrapper written in Objective C. This wrapper could contain really few lines of code (like, 10) necessary to create a WebView and navigate it to the given address in the internet (where your application resides). But in this case your application should be a full-featured web application (I mean, use not only the JavaScript, but also some HTML for markup).</p>
