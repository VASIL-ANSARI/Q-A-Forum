<p>I've set up a test script here: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/74874/test_scripts/object.html" rel="nofollow">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/74874/test_scripts/object.html</a></p>

<p>If you open up Firebug/Web Inspector, you'll see that the <code>SetParam</code> method is in-fact, not defined. I don't know what it's supposed to do, but it's not defined in either case. If you're trying to add <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> tags to your embed, you could use the DOM API to do that. There is some code in the test script that does that, but I'll paste it here anyway:</p>

<pre><code>var obj_signer = document.getElementById('signer');

var obj_p = document.createElement('param');
    obj_p.id = "myp2"; 
    obj_p.name = "TextToBeSigned";
    obj_p.value = "some value ...";
    obj_p.setAttribute('valueType', 'ref');
obj_signer.appendChild(e);
</code></pre>

<p>Or be faster using jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$("#signer").append("&lt;param id='myp2' name='TextToBeSigned' value='some value ...' valueType='ref'&gt;&lt;/param&gt;");
</code></pre>
