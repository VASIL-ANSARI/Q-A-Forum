<ul>
<li><p><code>Ember.Controller</code> is the simplier controller class. As you can see <a href="http://goo.gl/7NUqD" rel="nofollow">in the Ember.Controller source code</a>, it's just an object with a target (usually the router), and a store, and inherit <code>Ember.ControllerMixin</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Ember.ObjectController</code> is an ObjectProxy, as you can see <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/83542a629c214f1a9e89dcf8b9388e48ae2ba4e8/packages/ember-runtime/lib/controllers/object_controller.js#L23" rel="nofollow">in the ObjectController source code</a>: when its content is set, all getters/setters are delegated to its content. So the ObjectController is used for manipulating one item.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Ember.ArrayController</code> acts like the ObjectController: its a proxy, but for an Array, as you can see <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/83542a629c214f1a9e89dcf8b9388e48ae2ba4e8/packages/ember-runtime/lib/controllers/array_controller.js#L57" rel="nofollow">in the ArrayController source code</a>. So the ArrayController is used for manipulating an array of items.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Ember.ControllerMixin</code> just has few methods for handling view <code>{{outlets}}</code>, as you again can see <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/83542a629c214f1a9e89dcf8b9388e48ae2ba4e8/packages/ember-views/lib/system/controller.js#L17" rel="nofollow">in the Ember.ControllerMixin source code</a> (note that the code here reopens the ControllerMixin)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And you've right, <code>Ember.ArrayController</code> and <code>Ember.ObjectController</code> aren't inherited from <code>Ember.Controller</code>, but they all extend the <code>Ember.ControllerMixin</code> described above.</p>

<p>I suggest you to read <a href="http://trek.github.com/" rel="nofollow">Advice on &amp; Instruction in the Use Of Ember.js by Trek</a>, this article is not especially about controllers, but you'll learn a lot of thing, and understand how they work (outlets, for example).</p>
