<p>PHP can only process code and send output to the browser. jQuery runs strictly in the browser and will either be executed when the DOM loads it (ie, when PHP sends it and the browser receives/processes it) or when the document has finished loading (usually preferable).  To do the latter use this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
   $(document).click(function(e) { 
   if (e.button == 0) {
    // was the left button
    alert('clicked'); 
   }
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm making the assumption your code is correct because it isn't extremely clear what you're trying to do.  But that might shore up some of your problems.</p>
