<p>To be entirely clear, it's only included in python 3.3 (which I'm so happy to have learned, thank you!).</p>

<p>Otherwise, the pattern you could use is</p>

<pre><code>from mock import patch

with patch.object(CommandServer, 'runSQL') as runSQL:
    class res(object):
       rowcount = -1

    runSQL.return_value = res

    p = Process()
    p.process()

    for c in runSQL.call_list:
        assert c[1].lstrip().startswith('insert into') is True
</code></pre>

<p>But this would cover all cases, not just cases where you are sending <code>'insert into'</code>. This might give you a hint as to where to look, but otherwise, I don't think what you're looking for is exactly possible with mock.</p>
