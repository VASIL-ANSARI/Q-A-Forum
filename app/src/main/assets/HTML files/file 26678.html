<p>You just can't do that type of check with a function. In order to pass the variable, it needs to exist, so it will fail before your code can run.</p>

<p>When you call it on the undeclared variable, you're attempting to resolve the value of the identifier in the argument position.</p>

<pre><code>//     v----resolve identifier so it can be passed, but resolution fails
isset(foo);
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, it doesn't exist, so the <em>ReferenceError</em> is thrown.</p>

<p>JavaScript doesn't have pointers, so there's nothing like a <code>nil</code> pointer that can be passed in its place.</p>
