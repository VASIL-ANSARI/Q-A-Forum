<p>Suppose your maximum length is 5.. </p>

<pre><code>int maxLength = 5;
String jsonReturnedData = "Hello World"
</code></pre>

<p>Before inserting it into the TextView directly, </p>

<pre><code>jsonReturnedData = jsonReturnedData.substring(0, maxLength) + "\n" + jsonReturnedData.substring(maxLength, jsonReturnedData.length());
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how are you going to fix the maxLength? You have to check using trial and error for different screen sizes. The code below will give you your devices screen size, all you have to do is check from AVD or physical device to fix actually where you want to fold/put new line in your String...</p>

<pre><code>int screenSize = getResources().getConfiguration().screenLayout &amp;
    Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_MASK;

String toastMsg;
switch(screenSize) {
    case Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_LARGE:
       toastMsg = "Large screen";
       break;
    case Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_NORMAL:
        toastMsg = "Normal screen";
        break;
    case Configuration.SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_SMALL:
        toastMsg = "Small screen";
        break;
    default:
        toastMsg = "Screen size is neither large, normal or small";
}
Toast.makeText(this, toastMsg, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps. Cheers!</p>

<p>[PS: Funny thing, I wrote one switch-case block yesterday and it was not working properly (always going inside default block), I was wondering what was wrong with my code, when I was writing for your question, I have finally understood what I missed. :p] </p>
