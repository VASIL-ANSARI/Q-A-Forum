<p>Look, to make it work you added to application.css <a href="https://github.com/markmcconachie/normalize-rails#usage" rel="nofollow">these lines</a>:</p>

<pre><code>*= require_self
*= require normalize-rails
*= require_tree .
</code></pre>

<p>And middle line just requires <code>normalize-rails.scss</code> file that you can found in gem's <a href="https://github.com/markmcconachie/normalize-rails/tree/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets" rel="nofollow">vendor/assets/stylesheets</a> directory.</p>
