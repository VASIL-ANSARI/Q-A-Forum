<p>You are not calling your methods in a Thread at all. You are actually calling it out of the Thread. </p>

<p>In order for it to be called within the thread, the method should be passed within ThreadStart.</p>

<pre><code>ThreadStart ts_A = new ThreadStart(function_A);
</code></pre>

<p>Then calling t_A.Start would run the function_A in a thread. You can find more information on ThreadStart here <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadstart%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadstart%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>Having said that, your method should look like this.</p>

<pre><code>private void Start_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {       
   ThreadStart ts_A = new ThreadStart(function_A);
            if (c_A.Checked)
            {
                t_A = new Thread(ts_A);
                t_A.Start();

            }

               ThreadStart ts_B = new ThreadStart(function_B);
            if (c_B.Checked)
            {
                t_B = new Thread(ts_B);
                t_B.Start();

            }
     }
</code></pre>
