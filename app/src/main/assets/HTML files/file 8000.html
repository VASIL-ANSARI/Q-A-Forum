<p>Your compiler's include path probably doesn't include /usr/local/cuda/include/. The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is actually there to tell the compiler/runtime environment where to find shared object files. There are two ways (that know of) to fix this:</p>

<p>1) Most compilers accept a flag that specifies an addition to the include path; for gcc, it's -I, so</p>

<pre><code>gcc -I /usr/local/cuda/include [code files, more options, etc]
</code></pre>

<p>will tell gcc to look for includes in /usr/local/cuda/include, in addition to the system include path</p>

<p>2) Link the OpenCL header files into your system include path (usually /usr/include/).
Something like:</p>

<pre><code># ln -s /usr/local/cuda/include/CL CL
</code></pre>

<p>executed from within the directory /usr/include should work.</p>

<p>If after fixing this problem, you have a problem like the following:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lOpenCL
</code></pre>

<p>then you might want to look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4161195/how-to-get-opencl-working-on-an-ati-radeon-card/4424806#4424806">this question</a>.</p>
