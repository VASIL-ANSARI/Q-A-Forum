<p>You can use the canvas in Internet Explorer using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/" rel="nofollow">this library</a>.  There is also <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5-now/" rel="nofollow">this library</a> for doing the same with HTML 5 in general and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/canvas-text/" rel="nofollow">this one</a> for drawing text on a canvas.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-canvas/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a canvas library for GWT (which of course gets compiled to javascript).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/" rel="nofollow">Here is a library</a> to add svg support to older browsers.</p>
