<p>Are you using size classes? 
Check that the first frame that you get and use, is really the frame that you would expect after the view was presented. If you are using Xib for example, the frame before and after "viewDidApear" are diffrent with every screen size.</p>

<p>Secound, use "clipToBounds" to make sure the graph is not drawing out of your bounds that is set.</p>

<pre><code>self.lineChart.clipsToBounds = YES;
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck</p>
