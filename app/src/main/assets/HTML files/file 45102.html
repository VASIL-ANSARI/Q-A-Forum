<p>Nowadays Whatsapp authorizes you to use the app simply by sending your phone a text message. If your phone's SIM card has the same number as you entered, Whatsapp automatically takes the code from the text message and authorizes your phone. If not, you still have to get to the phone that uses that phone number and enter the verification code.</p>
