<p>Could you define the need for using the same <code>SqlDataSource</code>? If they are two different pages and it sounds like two different uses why not use two different <code>SqlDataSource</code>? The pages are separate anyhow, your not going to be able to share an object on one with the other.</p>

<p>I would suggest you look at adding a data layer to your application for database interaction and binding your data to the datagrid at request time. That way you build your database interaction once and reuse that over different pages.</p>

<p>The other option is you simply use two <code>SqlDataSource</code>s and copy/paste them to both the pages. If your trying to make a selection or some sort of criteria apply to your second page then consider using query strings and <code>QueryStringParameter</code>s in your <code>SqlDataSource</code>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Edit: Pop this in App_Code somewhere, pass in your specific usage requirements.</p>

<pre><code>Public Shared Function GetData(connString As String, command As String, Optional params As SqlParameter() = Nothing) As DataTable
    Dim conn As New SqlConnection(connString)
    Dim da As New SqlDataAdapter(command, conn)
    Dim dt As New DataTable
    da.SelectCommand.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure
    da.SelectCommand.CommandTimeout = 6000 '6 seconds.
    If Not IsNothing(params) Then
        For Each p As SqlParameter In params
            da.SelectCommand.Parameters.Add(p)
        Next
    End If
    Try
        conn.Open()
        da.Fill(dt)
        Return dt
    Catch ex As Exception
        Throw ex
    Finally
        conn.Close()
    End Try
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Then bind the datatable to your gridview, not sure how your outputing to file.</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub BindData(gridview As GridView, data As DataTable)
    gridview.DataSource = data
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>You can now re-use the database interaction from the code behind:</p>

<pre><code>Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
   BindData(MyGridView,GetData(ConnectionStrings(connName).ConnectionString, _
                 "dbo.SomeSprocOrOther", _
                 New SqlParameter(){New SqlParameter("paramName","paramValue")})
End Sub
</code></pre>
