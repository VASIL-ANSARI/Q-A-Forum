<p><code>LinearLayoutManager</code> doesn't support absolute scrolling, it just passes it through to the <code>RecyclerView</code>, which also doesn't support it.  What it <em>does</em> support is scrolling to a specific position in the dataset (<code>scrollToPosition()</code>), by a certain amount horizontally or vertically (<code>scrollHorizontallyBy()</code>, <code>scrollVerticallyBy()</code>), or to a position plus an offset (<code>scrollToPositionWithOffset()</code>).</p>
