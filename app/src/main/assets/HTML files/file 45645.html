<p>Until ClojureScript is self-hosted (implemented in ClojureScript rather than Clojure), Java is needed as well as Node/NPM.  However, David Nolen said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvF-GZI20L4&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLZdCLR02grLrKAOj8FJ1GGmNM5l7Okz0a">his April 20, 2015 talk at Clojure West</a>, relatively little work remains before the compiler can be bootstrapped in itself.  [The talk may be interesting to watch for other reasons as well.]  So this may change in the not-too-distant future.</p>
