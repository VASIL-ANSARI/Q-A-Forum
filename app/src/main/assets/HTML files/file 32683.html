<p>The offending line is this:</p>

<pre><code>PyType_Slot *slots; /* terminated by slot==0. */
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that with this line, "slots" is a keyword by default in Qt. In order to use that variable name in other projects, you will need to use this in your project file:</p>

<pre><code>CONFIG += no_keywords
</code></pre>

<p>For details, see the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/signalsandslots.html#using-qt-with-3rd-party-signals-and-slots" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using Qt with 3rd Party Signals and Slots</p>
  
  <p>It is possible to use Qt with a 3rd party signal/slot mechanism. You can even use both mechanisms in the same project. Just add the following line to your qmake project (.pro) file.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>CONFIG += no_keywords
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>It tells Qt not to define the moc keywords signals, slots, and emit, because these names will be used by a 3rd party library, e.g. Boost. Then to continue using Qt signals and slots with the no_keywords flag, simply replace all uses of the Qt moc keywords in your sources with the corresponding Qt macros Q_SIGNALS (or Q_SIGNAL), Q_SLOTS (or Q_SLOT), and Q_EMIT.</p>
