<p>I don't think there can be a one-solution-fits-all answer here: how tests are identified is going to be framework-dependent to a great extent. Once you're into frameworks like shoulda, it's near-enough impossible to identify all tests without executing them, consider the case where you have <code>should</code> requirements within a loop, for example.</p>

<p>Listing all tests as they're executed would be a matter of digging into the framework code for the point where the individual tests are identified/generated and extracting the information needed.</p>

<p>I'd be interested to learn if (and how) I'm wrong, though...</p>
