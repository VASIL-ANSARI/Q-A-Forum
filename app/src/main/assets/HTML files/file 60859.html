<p>After some additional research, using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/307020#bookmark-3" rel="nofollow">System.Security.Cryptography</a> is a very poor choice because Windows already has a builtin mechanism involving RSA encryption called <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537361(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">Code Signing</a>. Signing your code allows users to know where code comes from and if it has been <strong>tampered with</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762153(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">ShellExecute</a> is a much better choice than CreateProcessAsUser because it can handle <code>ERROR_ELEVATION_REQUIRED</code> exceptions by using UAC. Most users <em>and developers</em> hated (and probably still do) when Vista came out with this but I highly encourage you to watch <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/UAC-What-How-Why" rel="nofollow">UAC - What. How. Why.</a> where both the Project Lead and System Architect of UAC explain why it was needed and how it has increased security. </p>
