<p>I think you should rethink your class design.</p>

<p>There are two solutions to your problem</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pull the <code>onEvent</code> method up into your super class as non-abstract method with empty body. Then you can override in subclasses only where appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce an interface - let's call it <code>EventHandler</code> - that declares the method <code>onEvent</code>. Implement this interface in your subclasses where appropriate. Then either change your list to be a list of <code>EventHandler</code> objects or leave it as is and use <code>instanceof</code> to check if an object is an <code>EventHandler</code> in your iteration.</p></li>
</ol>
