<p>In its simplest form you can dispense with <code>lastRequest</code> and do:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)sendRequestToURL:(NSString *)url withPostData:(NSString *)postData withPage:(int)page sortBy:(NSString *)sort completionBlock:(void (^)(NSDictionary *))completion {

    if(![FooNetworkManager isReachable]){
        dispatch_time_t delay = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, NSEC_PER_SEC * 10);
        dispatch_after(delay, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){
            [self sendRequestToURL:url withPostData:postData withPage:page sortBy:sort completionBlock:completion];
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>in this way you're simply capturing the passed parameters in the block. So you need to be careful that capturing mutable objects, if you have any, is acceptable...</p>

<p>You should also have some way to cancel the retry, or perhaps a maximum number of attempts, or even an exponential back off time in between attempts.</p>
