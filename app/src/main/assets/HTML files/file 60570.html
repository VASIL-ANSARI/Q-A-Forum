<p>You'll need to use a concatenation operator to concatenate your <code>%</code> wildcard to your column <code>product_tree.manufacturer</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Product_Tree.col0,Product_Tree.col1,Product_Tree.col2,Product_Tree.col3,Product_Tree.Model_Number,Product_Tree.Manufacturer 
FROM Product_Tree 
JOIN Product ON Product.model_number LIKE '%' || Product_Tree.MODEL_NUMBER || '%' 
AND Product.manufacturer LIKE '%' || Product_Tree.MANUFACTURER || '%';
</code></pre>

<p>I'm guessing that this query is inside a script and is quoted using single quotes <code>'</code> which is why you have single quotes all over the place in here. If that's the case then your quoted SQL statement would be: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT Product_Tree.col0,Product_Tree.col1,Product_Tree.col2,Product_Tree.col3,Product_Tree.Model_Number,Product_Tree.Manufacturer 
FROM Product_Tree 
JOIN Product ON Product.model_number LIKE ''%'' || Product_Tree.MODEL_NUMBER || ''%'' 
AND Product.manufacturer LIKE ''%'' || Product_Tree.MANUFACTURER || ''%'';
</code></pre>
