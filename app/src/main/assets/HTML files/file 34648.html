<p>My normal though process when I see something like this would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the firewall off, or is port 443 open? (iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT would be the command to open it on most Linux distros). If yes...</li>
<li>Is Apache actually listening on 443? (netstat -a will show you your listening ports). If yes...</li>
<li>Is the browser trying to connect to a subdomain (like www). Adding the following to your config would help: serveralias *.mydomain.com</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I would check your apache logs for any possible errors.</p>
