<p>There are two types of products:  managed in-app products and subscriptions. </p>

<p>If its a <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/es/google/play/billing/billing_integrate.html#Subs" rel="nofollow">subscription</a> rather than a managed in-app product, you should query for active subscriptions, use the <code>getPurchases</code> method, with the product type parameter set to "<code>subs</code>".</p>

<pre><code>Bundle activeSubs = mService.getPurchases(3, "com.example.myapp",
                   "subs", continueToken);
</code></pre>

<p>The call returns a Bundle with all the active subscriptions owned by the user. Once a subscription expires without renewal, it will no longer appear in the returned Bundle.</p>
