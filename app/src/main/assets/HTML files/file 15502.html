<p>Write tests who make sense.</p>

<p>For example, in a MVC application the business logic is in the Model, so you can test the Model in your unit tests. You can also test the controller using the real Model and mock/stub when you need. And you can write tests who uses the View. You can test everything, in many combinations.</p>

<p>Try to start with tests in the Model layer and measure the coverage of the tests. Try to be very pragmatic :)</p>
