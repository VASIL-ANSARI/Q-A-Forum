<p>The key to dealing with a large number of beacons is to create a region with wildcards for the major and minor, so any combination will be matched.  This way you can use as single region to monitor for all your beacons under the same UUID:</p>

<pre><code>CLBeaconRegion *beaconRegion = [[CLBeaconRegion alloc] initWithProximityUUID:commonUUID identifier:@"commonRegion"];
</code></pre>

<p>The above assumes you can make all stores have the same UUID for their beacons.  If you cannot, you can add more UUID-based regions, but you are limited to 20 total regions by iOS.</p>

<p>You will also need to range for beacons if you use this technique, so you can read the actual major and minor identifiers on each beacon.  Your code shows you are doing this anyway.  The logic for taking action on a specific beacon would go inside the ranging callback.</p>
