<p>I would go maybe with making the 2 persons for the <code>Marriage</code> explicit with a composite key:</p>

<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>@Entity @IdClass(MarriageId.class)
public class Marriage {
   @Id Person person1;
   @Id Person person2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm unsure about the exact syntax for JPA, but you get the point. :)</p>
