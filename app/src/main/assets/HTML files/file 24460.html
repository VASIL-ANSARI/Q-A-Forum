<p>I dont think thats very much possible. You can use <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/iOS/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITextChecker_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">UITextChecker</a> or you can use some open source sdks like <a href="http://www.lexicontext.com/" rel="nofollow">Lexicontext</a>. Also may be you can link to some online dictionaries. </p>
