<p>Well after updating the appium server to 1.6.0 beta 3, the issue was resolved. Now I'm on the stable 1.6.0 version and I'm facing a whole different problem. The app I'm testing is in Landscape mode and I cannot have appium clicking or tapping on any of the elements.</p>

<p>Did anyone hear this issue?</p>
