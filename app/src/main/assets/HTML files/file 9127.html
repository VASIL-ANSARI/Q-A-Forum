<p>That sounds like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation" rel="nofollow">Hungarian Notation</a> to me. </p>

<p>In principle it sounds like a good idea but I'm honestly not sure there are good reasons for it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Self commenting / documenting code - this should be possible without putting types in the variable names;</li>
<li>An IDE should also provide support for seeing what type a variable is without putting it in the variable name (e.g. Eclipse can do this)</li>
<li>I don't know that this is really an advantage. </li>
</ul>

<p>One problem with Hungarian Notation that you don't mention is that if you refactor code, you have to change all the variable names as well. There are plenty of examples on The Daily WTF where variables are named 'strSOMETHING' or 'intSOMETHING', even though the types are defined as something else.</p>

<p>In general, IMO the case for using Hungarian Notation is pretty flimsy and generally I wouldn't recommend making it a policy.</p>

<p>(If this isn't exactly what you are talking about, I apologise!)</p>
