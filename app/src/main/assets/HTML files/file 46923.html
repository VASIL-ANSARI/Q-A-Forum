<p>It looks like your addStaff() function only adds to the table in the frontend. If I may point out, the C# is executed server side, and so, the rows added by your javascript do not exist at the time when your C# is looking for them.</p>

<p>Like Florian Gl suggested, you could include an ajax submit in your addStaff() function, that also sends whatever row the javascript displays in the table in the browser, to the C# in the backend. Once you have the data in your C#, you can proceed with sending the email or can even opt to save a database...</p>
