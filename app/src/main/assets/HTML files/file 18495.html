<p>A variable name can not be the result of an expression unless you use <code>eval</code>, which you don't want to do, or unless it's a global variable. </p>

<p>If you need dynamic naming, you should use an object, and name its properties dynamically. This is also how globals can be dynamically created.</p>

<pre><code>var xyz = "test";

//global

window[xyz] = "abc";

alert(test);    // "abc"

// object property

var myData = {};
myData[xyz] = "abc";

alert(myData.test);    // "abc"
</code></pre>
