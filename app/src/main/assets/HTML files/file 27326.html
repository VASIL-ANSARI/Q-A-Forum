<p>Finally... Got it working.. Didn't understand exact issue but I made two important changes. I'm not sure which change made it working..
1. I uninstalled my old ruby &amp; rails that was installed from railsinstaller. Installed just ruby for my OS (64 bit which i was not able to choose while installing from railsinstaller). Then I installed rails, sqlite3 separately. 
2. Another important change I did is in GemFile.lock . I think this did the trick. I kept both of following lines</p>

<pre><code>bcrypt-ruby (3.0.0)
bcrypt-ruby (3.0.0-x86-mingw32)
</code></pre>
