<p><strong>ItÂ´s not!</strong></p>

<p>When an Android-APP was uninstalled there is an INTENT coming up. </p>

<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_PACKAGE_REMOVED" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_PACKAGE_REMOVED</a></p>

<p>So every other App might be able to recognize your app beeing uninstalled but not your app itself. </p>
