<p>Automating this inside mySQL may be possible using <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/triggers.html" rel="nofollow">triggers</a> but that is complex and requires mySQL 5. </p>

<p>Wouldn't it be an option to do the logic in PHP? Adding a query to update database B whenever database A is updated?</p>
