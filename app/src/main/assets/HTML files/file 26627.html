<p>Instead of using constants, you should use the language array, which was meant for this purpose. Look at: <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/language.html" rel="nofollow">http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/language.html</a></p>

<p>Once you create your language files, you load them in your controller, as such:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;lang-&gt;load('welcome_page', $lang_from_session_or_db);
</code></pre>

<p><code>$lang_from_session_or_db</code> should vary based on the user's language, so you would store this in a session variable, or in the database, depending on your project.</p>

<p>You can then access those vars using:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;lang-&gt;line('language_key');
</code></pre>

<p>Because where you place your variables will vary based on language, you may want to look into the printf family of functions.</p>
