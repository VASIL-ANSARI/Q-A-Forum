<p><code>@Autowired</code> annotation is used when you want to autowire a bean. <code>@Autowired</code> is not limited to setter. It can be used with a constructor and a field as well. If you use <code>@Autowired</code> annotation on a field, that field will be autowired with bean having matching data type.</p>

<p><code>@Required</code> checks if a particular property has been set or not. If a field has been annotated with <code>@Required</code> annotation and that field is not set, you will get <code>org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanInitializationException</code>.</p>

<p>Edit: As pointed by 'kryger': field annotated with <code>@Autowired</code> is effectively also <code>@Required</code> (unless you explicitly set its parameter required to false).
eg:</p>

<pre><code>@Autowired(required=false)
private ObjectType objectType;
</code></pre>

<p>For a field that has been annotated <code>@Autowired</code>, if bean with matching data type in not available, <code>org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException</code> is thrown.</p>
