<p>Microsoft Research published quite an extensive paper on the subject, called <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=64525" rel="nofollow">To Blob Or Not To Blob</a>.</p>

<p>Their synopsis is:</p>

<p><em>Application designers often face the question of whether to store large objects in a filesystem or in a database. Often this decision is made for application design simplicity. Sometimes, performance measurements are also used. This paper looks at the question of fragmentation â one of the operational issues that can affect the performance and/or manageability of the system as deployed long term. As expected from the common wisdom, <strong>objects smaller than 256K are best stored in a database</strong> while objects larger than 1M are best stored in the filesystem. Between 256K and 1M, the read:write ratio and rate of object overwrite or replacement are important factors. We used the notion of âstorage ageâ or number of object overwrites as way of normalizing wall clock time. Storage age allows our results or similar such results to be applied across a number of read:write ratios and object replacement rates.</em></p>
