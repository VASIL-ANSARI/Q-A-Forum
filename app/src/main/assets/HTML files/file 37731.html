<p>If you put a try...except around the main function to print any exceptions, you get the following error message:</p>

<pre><code>ascii codec can't encode character u'\u2019' in position 12: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<p>So this is an encoding issue - some character in the second title is not in the ASCII range, which python/Geektool is using as the default encoding. You can get around this by encoding the title string explicitly with <code>.encode('utf-8')</code>.</p>
