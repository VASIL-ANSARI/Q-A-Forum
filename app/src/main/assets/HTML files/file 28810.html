<p>I've found a problem in your javascript code. As you may know, unordered list tag should be block by default and you are trying to make it inline in your js code (after hiding). Just try to change your showObjDiv function to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function showObjDiv(obj) {
    if (document.getElementById) { 
        document.getElementById(obj).style.visibility = 'visible';
        document.getElementById(obj).style.display = 'block';
    } 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>It should work just fine after that.</p>
