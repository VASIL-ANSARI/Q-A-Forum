<p>You can use the <code>display_errors()</code> method to show you what's not working correctly:</p>

<pre><code>if(!$this-&gt;upload-&gt;do_upload('pan_card'))
{
    echo $this-&gt;upload-&gt;display_errors();
    exit;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I generally have issues with the upload class. The <code>allowed_types</code> always seems buggy on my installation of CodeIgniter. If I specified a list of allowed file types, it always comes up with an error saying the uploaded file type isn't allowed.</p>

<p>I would suggest changing it to this:</p>

<pre><code>$config = array(
    'allowed_types' =&gt; '*',
    'upload_path' =&gt; $upload_path . '/'
);
</code></pre>

<p>Check to see if that works. </p>
