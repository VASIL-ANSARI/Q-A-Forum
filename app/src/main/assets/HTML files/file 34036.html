<p>This won't exactly answer your question, but I'm putting it as an answer anyway because I think it addresses what people were asking you about in your previous question.</p>

<p>In this particular instance, it really sounds as though you want a string. Yes, I know the values are, ultimately, numerical (integer, it seems) values, but when you are working with something like MVC, you have to remember that the models that are being used by your view do not have to match the models that are part of your business logic. I think you're running into this issue because you are attempting to mix the two.</p>

<p>Instead, I would recommend creating a model (a ViewModel) that is specifically for the View that you are displaying to the end user. Add the various data annotations to it that will help validate the STRING that makes up the Price. (You could easily do all the validation you want via a simple <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.regularexpressionattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow">regular expression data annotation</a>. Then, once the model is actually submitted to your controller (or whatever other data is submitted to your controller) and you know that it is valid (via the data annotation), you can then convert it to an integer that you want for the model you are using with your business logic, and go on using it as you would (as an integer).</p>

<p>This way, you avoid having all this unnecessary complexity that you have been asking about (which does have a solution, but it doesn't really fit the mindset behind MVC) and allows you to achieve the flexibility you are looking for in your view with the stringent requirement in your business logic.</p>

<p>Hopefully that makes sense. You can search the web for ViewModels in MVC. A good place to start out is the <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-3" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET MVC tutorials</a>.</p>
