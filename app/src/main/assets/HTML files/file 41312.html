<p>Are you getting results for the query and it's not sorting? Or are you not getting results at all?</p>

<p>Try this: </p>

<pre><code>@orders = Order.where("hotel_user_id = ?", cookies[:hotel_id_for_login_user]).order("#{params[:sort]} ASC").paginate(:per_page =&gt; 5, :page =&gt; params[:page])
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>maybe your sort condition either needs to be a symbol or put in quotes</li>
<li>The "where" part of your query didn't set a condition</li>
<li>It's not safe to put in a user-provided variable directly into your conditions string because of potential SQL injection. </li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that helps!</p>
