<p>For working with Web Browser SSO profile you need to have AssertionConsumerService url on your server. I think you can use javascript on server side, but you can't use  Web Browser SSO only with user web browser. You need to have some url on your server for that. You can read more about SAML 2.0 here <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#samlv2.0" rel="nofollow">https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#samlv2.0</a>. Also wiki contains some good images about SAML protocol <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0</a>
