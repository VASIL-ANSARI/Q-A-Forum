<p>Matplotlib doesn't show the plot until you tell it to, unless you're in "interactive" mode.</p>

<p><em>Short Answer</em>: Call <code>plt.show()</code> when you're ready to display the plot.  </p>

<p>This starts the gui mainloop of whatever backend you're using, so it is blocking.  (i.e. execution will stop until you close the window)</p>

<p>If you want it to show up automatically without stopping execution, you can turn on <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/shell.html">interactive mode</a> either with <code>plt.ion()</code> or by using <code>ipython --pylab</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, using <code>--pylab</code> mode in ipython will import all of numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and a few other things into the global namespace.  This is convenient for interactive use, but teaches very bad habits and overwrites functions in the standard library (e.g. <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, etc).</p>

<p>You can still use matplotlib's interactive mode in ipython without using "pylab" mode to avoid the global import. Just call <code>plt.ion()</code></p>

<p>Matplotlib's default <code>TkAgg</code> backend will work in interactive mode with any python shell (not just <code>ipython</code>).  However, other backends can't avoid blocking further execution without the gui mainloop being run in a separate thread. If you're using a different backend, then you'll need to tell <code>ipython</code> this with the <code>--gui=&lt;backend&gt;</code> option.</p>
