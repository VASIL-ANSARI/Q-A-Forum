  <p>Can I specify at runtime the path for a data-bound value? In XAML, I'd expect to see something like this, but it is wrong:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
     &lt;Label Content="{Binding Path={Binding CustomerPath}}"/&gt;
     &lt;Button Width="20" Height="20" FontWeight="Bold" Content="Ã"/&gt;
 &lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Binding is already wrong. If your <code>ListBox's ItemsSource</code> is <code>Customers</code> and you want to bind to it's content then just use <code>{Binding Path=CustomerPath}</code>. The answer to your question is yes, you can specify at runtime the path for a data-bound value. You'll have to load each <code>Template</code> for the <code>ListBox</code> then set the <code>bindings</code> at runtime.</p>

<p>Pseudo code: </p>

<ol>
<li>Load item template </li>
<li>Get the label control </li>
<li>Set the binding to what the caller sets the property to bind it to </li>
</ol>

  <p>How can I instruct the ListBox to be able to work with an unknown data type, but be able to choose the path for the data-bound value?</p>

<p>Binding will call <code>ToString()</code> on the <code>class</code> that it is bound to. So if your binding was correct and assuming you have <code>Customer</code> as object</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Label Content="{Binding .}"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you did not override the <code>ToString()</code> of the <code>Customer</code> object it'll show the default ToString() but if you do then that'll be the one that will be shown in the <code>Label</code>. This is an ugly solution just to substitute it for your <code>DisplayMemberPath</code> that was given by the <code>ListBox</code></p>

<p>Ideally, I would do the setting the binding at runtime rather than creating an interface not just because of what you said but succeeding objects that will be used for this control will have to implement that interface.</p>
