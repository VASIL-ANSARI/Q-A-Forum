<p>SQLite has no pivot functions; you have to do this in two steps.</p>

<p>First, get all possible tags:</p>



<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT _id, Name
FROM Tags
ORDER BY Name;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, using the returned data, construct a query that looks up each possible tag for each key:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT Key,
       (SELECT Value
        FROM Values
        WHERE Key_ID = Keys._id
          AND Tag_ID = 111
       ) AS Tag_111,
       (SELECT Value
        FROM Values
        WHERE Key_ID = Keys._id
          AND Tag_ID = 222
       ) AS Tag_222,
       ...
FROM Keys;
</code></pre>
