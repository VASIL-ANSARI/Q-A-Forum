<p>The jQuery prepend method will prepend what you give it to all elements matching the selector:</p>

<p><code>$('.picker__header')</code></p>

<p>This will prepend to both <code>.picker__header</code>s it can find every time it is fired. By putting it in the render callback, it is being called for every time a datepicker is rendered. Twice, therefore, because you have 2 datepickers.</p>

<p>The best thing would be to prepend in a callback that is only called once, or to increment a counter on the render callback. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>var dateCounter = 0;

...

onRender: function () {
    dateCounter++;
    if (dateCounter === 2) {
        $('.picker__header').prepend(...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But there are lots of ways to do this. Maybe there's something in the pickadate.js API that might be more elegant?</p>
