<p>When using AutoLayout, views instantiated in storyboards with constraints have their <code>translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints</code> property set to <code>false</code>, in contrast to views instantiated programmatically. This is because interface builder expects constraints to fully specify the layout of that view.</p>

<p>To modify your frame/bounds/center manually, set this property to <code>true</code> in code. This will make the view's layout behave in a way similar to how things worked in the days before AutoLayout, so be aware that any constraints you specify on the view may conflict or behave unexpectedly if you just specify this property when you <em>actually</em> want it to be laid out using constraints.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you first consider whether what you actually want to do is specify your label's position through AutoLayout constraints. These days, it is rare that you actually want to specify a position manually, as you have done above.</p>
