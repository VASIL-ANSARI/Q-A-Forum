<p>You don't need to set the paths separately for clang code completion to work.
You just need to re-build (i.e. clean follow by build) your project once.</p>

<p>If everything is done properly, you should see in CodeLite's build log lines similar to:</p>

<p><code>codelite-cc g++ ...</code> (or <code>codelite-cc clang++...</code>)
The <code>codelite-cc</code> utility will collect the search paths (and macros and other flags) passed to the compiler and will pass them back to CodeLite, so it will pass it to libClang for getting the proper code completion for your code.</p>
