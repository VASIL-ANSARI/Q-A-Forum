<p>Depends on where you are doing your validation.  If you are doing it server side with jquery you can add e.preventDefault to the check if it is invalid and the button click won't fire until your conditions are met.  If you are doing server side validation using attributes then you can check model state like</p>

<pre><code>if (ModelState.IsValid){
}else{
}
</code></pre>

<p>and if the model state is valid (the data passes all the checks) run one set of code.  If the model state is invalid then just return view to go back to where you started and pass a message with whatever failed for the user.  Hopefully this helps.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>just saw the edit on your comment.  For an ajax call you will want to use prevent default.</p>

<pre><code>$('.SubmitButton').on('click', function(e){
   $.ajax({
      //your call
      success: function(result){
          if(result.false){
              e.preventDefault();
              alert(result.message);
          }
      }
   });
});
</code></pre>

<p>so if the call is successful the submit call will go through.  If it is false then jquery will stop the button click and you can then display a message or do something else.</p>
