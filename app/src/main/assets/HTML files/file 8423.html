<p>However few other team members have the top most function do the error handling. Now which one would be good?</p>

<p>It depends, say if some cleanups are needed in every functions when the function it called fails, that way you might want to return back in a phased manner.</p>

<p>Multiple returns are usually to be avoided for it makes the source code less readable and hard to understand. As a personal choice i like to have my functions single entry point and a single exit point.</p>
