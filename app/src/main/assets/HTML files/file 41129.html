<p>maybe try to join the tables and then do conditions on it. maybe something like this?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT o.selling_company_id
     , o.rfp_id
     , o.id
     , o.vendor
     , if(c.id is not NULL, 1, 
            if(o.vendor = '', '0', '0.5')
       ) as 'Vendor Mult'
FROM company_d.offer o
LEFT JOIN company.SellingCompanyTable c ON c.companyName = o.vendor
</code></pre>
