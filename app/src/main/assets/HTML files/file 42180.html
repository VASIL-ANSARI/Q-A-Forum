<p>What you are describing is the built-in behavior for VoiceOver and can't be changed on a per-app basis.  </p>

<p>If you want to modify the order elements are focused, look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIAccessibilityContainer_Protocol/" rel="nofollow"><code>UIAccessibilityContainer</code></a> protocol for iOS 7 or <code>accessibilityElements</code> property of <code>NSObject</code> for iOS 8.  If you don't want to implement either of those, you can also simply set <code>accessibilityElementsHidden</code> to <code>YES</code> for elements you want VoiceOver to ignore.</p>
