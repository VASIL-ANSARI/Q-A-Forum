<p>Not sure if this will help but have you considered just constraining the generic?</p>

<pre><code>public override Action&lt;T&gt; GetHandler&lt;T&gt;()
    where T : SomeType // Constrain to some type/interface
{
    // You can treat T like SomeType here
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can at least treat T as <code>SomeType</code> - maybe this is what you were after? If not can you give an example of usage so I can better understand what you are trying to achieve?</p>
