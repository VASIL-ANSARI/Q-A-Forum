<p>There are versions of log4j that will work with Java 1.1 and every version since then: see <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#a1.3" rel="nofollow">this entry</a> from the log4j FAQ.  Apart from picking the right version (in the Java 1.1 case) nothing special needs to be done to use log4j on an old JVM.</p>

<p>If you have a specific problem, you will need to spell it out. </p>
