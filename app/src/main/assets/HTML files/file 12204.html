<p>Cut the string to length: <code>digest1 = digest1.substring(0, 16);</code></p>

<p>MD5 outputs 16 bytes. If you encode it in hexadecimal, its 32 characters. If you encode it in base-64 it's 24 characters. Base-85 will squeeze it into 20 characters. There's no well-known encoding that is one character per byte.</p>
