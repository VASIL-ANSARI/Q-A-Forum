<p>You must be setting the Session["FacultyData"] value from a Linq query. The Linq queries use deferred evaluation, so instead of the result of the query, you are storing the query itself in the session variable. You need to use an operator on the Linq query that forces it to evaluate, like ToList, ToArray, or FirstOrDefault. Then store the resulting query result object in the session.</p>
