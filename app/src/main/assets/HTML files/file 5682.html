<p>How would you make the difference between the 2 different main of the two program ? It is quite complicated to know which source is for the programe 1 and which source is for the program 2. Thus, you need 2 different projects for 2 executable.</p>

<p>If you have shared source code between your two project, you can have a library (in a different project ^^).</p>
