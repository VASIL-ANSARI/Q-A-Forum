<p>This isn't really possible at all, consistently on all platforms, even if you get the <code>pid</code> <em>and</em> window handle.</p>

<p>E.g. Windows: You cannot simply set other processes' windows to foreground. The other process <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632668%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">must allow you to do so first</a> and even then there are still restrictions.</p>

<p>In general, the idea is that the user should be in control, and other applications should not interrupt by stealing focus. Not really what happens in your use case, but the OS/window manager has no real way to know that.</p>

<p>I suggest you do not immediately launch the profile at all, and only start the new profile once the user is done editing any meta data such as the profile name.</p>
