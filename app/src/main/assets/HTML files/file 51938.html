<p>The way I managed to resolve this problem is setting CATALINA_OPTS in the DockerFile like this:</p>

<pre><code>ENV CATALINA_OPTS="-Dkey=value"
</code></pre>

<p>Also you could have edited some config files, but this way is not that complex as for me.
So the whole DockerFile for my app would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>FROM tomcat:8.0-jre8
ENV spring.profiles.active=dev 
ENV CATALINA_OPTS="-Dkey=value"
ADD myWar.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
</code></pre>
