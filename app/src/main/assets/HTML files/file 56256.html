<p>You can do anything (like a volume mount) in the docker container as long as the Docker itself has the right permission. You should exec your container using following:</p>

<p>docker exec -it -u 0 Container_NAME /bin/bash</p>

<p>And then execute py.test, I just hope you're not doing su - to some user within py.test</p>
