<p>You have problems with enqueueing...You are adding all the elements to the end of the array(you haven't treated the fact that you initially set the default size to 8, and you start adding from the element on position 7 only).</p>

<p>You could keep track of how many elements you have in the queue up to the current moment in a separate variable.</p>
