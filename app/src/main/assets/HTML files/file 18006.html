<p>First thought:</p>

<p>In my opinion this could confuse your users because:
The usual url for a show action looks like this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>products/:id</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but the edit looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>products/:id/edit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if one of your users wants just to take a look (by clicking show) into a project it might get confused by the displayed url. You could fix this by using named routes but in my opinion this will definitely
conflicts with REST.</p>

<p>Second thought:</p>

<p>Before implementing jQuery logic just for enabling an edit action on an object you should use the built in mechanisms with a show- and an edit page/method, because the maintainability and readability will stay easier and clean with using default behavior.</p>

<p>Please correct me if I am wrong :)</p>
