<p>MadProgrammer is right.<br>
If I got it right, the file <code>client-temp.txt</code> has multiple lines; each one representing data from a single <code>SensorInfo</code> object. When you read all of them into <code>filedata</code> and pass it as a parameter for the constructor of <code>SensorInfo</code>, only the first line will be used to instantiate a single <code>SensorInfo</code> object, as you can clearly see from the source in the link you posted. All the remaining lines will be discarded. Keep in mind that a constructor of a class will always instantiate a single object of that class.<br>
To resolve the issue you should read line by line from the file <code>client-temp.txt</code> and pass each one as a parameter for the creation of a new <code>SensorInfo</code> object that will be added to the list.</p>

<p>Here is a suggestion for your new main method:</p>



<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    List&lt;SensorInfo&gt; readings = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("client-temp.txt"))) {
        String line = br.readLine();

        while (line != null) {
            readings.add(new SensorInfo(line));
            line = br.readLine();
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Unable to read data file");
        e.printStackTrace();
        System.exit(1);
    }

    String data = createStringFromInfo(readings);
    System.out.println("Lines: " + readings.size());
    writeFile("datastore.txt", data);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Regards</p>
