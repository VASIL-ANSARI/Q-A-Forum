<p>You can either do all of the math in C++, or you can use the matrices inside of OpenGL (glTranslatef, glRotatef, etc).</p>

<p>Bear in mind - those functions (glTranslatef and glRotatef) are <em>deprecated</em>, and are no longer the correct way to use OpenGL.  Currently, the correct way is to get a c++ math library, and calculate the matrices yourself.  Then send them up to a shader.  It's hard to learn, but you'll thank yourself later.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to calculate your rotation using simple math, just break out some typical trigonometry formulas, and calculate the positions of the points of each line.  Then draw the lines.</p>

<p>Or, to use (the deprecated functions in) OpenGL, do some reading on how glTranslatef and glRotatef work.  This is all covered in the OpenGL Red Book.</p>

<p>Move down to the <em>Viewing and Modeling Transformations</em> heading in that chapter, and you will easily figure out how to answer your question.</p>
