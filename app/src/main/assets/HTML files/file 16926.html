<p>I doubt that such a library exists.  </p>

<p>If you're only looking to convert a limited number of numbers(such as <code>zero</code> through <code>ten</code>) than it probably would take you more time to ask this question here than to just implement it yourself.  </p>

<p>If you're looking at converting more complex numbers such as <code>"one hundred twenty four and fifty-one hundredth's"</code> than you're looking for is a natural language recognizer, which is extremely complicated, and unlikely to have a good library in any language.</p>

<p>In the end, It's normally best for back end values and user consumable content to not be coupled.  </p>
