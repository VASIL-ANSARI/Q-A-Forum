<p>First of all, I wouldn't attempt to move 12M rows via a .NET app. I would use a tool like SSIS (SQL Server Integrated Services) to do this. SSIS is very fast, can support transactions and supports sophisticated data transformations. SSIS was designed to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>However, if you must do this within a .NET application. I would probably read something like 1K to 5K rows at a time, insert them into the target database, and get the next 1K to 5K rows etc. But this is going to be much slower than via a tool like SSIS.</p>
