<p>The same functionality doesn't exactly exist on iOS.</p>

<p>You can setup a local notifications using the functionality of a <code>UILocalNotification</code> object. With this you can set <code>fireDate</code>, etc. which is sort of like a push notification without a server. You can send a message, add a badge on the app icon, play a sound, etc.</p>

<p>Now the issue is that the app doesn't get launched by the OS. The app simply registers a notification in the OS, which is then handled at the <code>fireDate</code> time. This means you won't be able to have a chance to check for data and verify whether to continue with the notification, etc.</p>
