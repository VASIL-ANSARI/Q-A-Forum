<p>I don't see how it can be done by simply adding one-two lines of code, since it just how .NET configuration is serializing/deserializing collections. One solution would probably be - create your own type converter - descendent of <code>ConfigurationConverterBase</code>. Apply it to your <code>AutoSyncConfiguration</code> property. In converter do whatever you want to serialize/deserialize collections.</p>
