<p>According to the <a href="https://realm.io/docs/cocoa/0.91.1/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> every modification of your query result object (in your case Object Horse with Name Suey) modifies the data on disk directly because the result is the actual data and not a copy of it. So if you remove the horse you have to create a new one.</p>
