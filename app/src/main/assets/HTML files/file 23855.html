<p>This is just an idea for a solution.</p>

<p>You'll need to know how many unique 'individuals' you have. For your example, it's 26.</p>

<p>First, you create a dictionary of 26 pairs, where key is an individual, in our case a letter, and a value is a group number where it will be in the end. For each pair, initial value should be zero.</p>

<p>Second, you keep a 'groupNumber' integer variable that will store the next group number. You initialise it with 1.</p>

<p>Then, you iterate over the list of GroupPairs. You take the first GroupPair, which contains 'a' and 'd' and set the respective values in the dictionary to '1'. </p>

<p>For each following GroupPair you take its individuals and look up the respective values in the dictionary. </p>

<p>If one of the values is non-zero, i.e. one of the individuals already belongs to a group, you set the other value to the same number, thus putting it in the same group. </p>

<p>If both values are zeros you set them to 'groupNumber' and increment 'groupNumber'. </p>

<p>If both values are non-zero, this is where it gets a bit tricky. You find all pairs in the group dictionary where value equals the second value from that pair, and set their value to the first value from that pair.</p>

<p>After that is done, you iterate over the list of GroupPairs once again. For each pair you look up the first individual in the group dictionary and thus find out which group the pair belongs to.</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense...</p>
