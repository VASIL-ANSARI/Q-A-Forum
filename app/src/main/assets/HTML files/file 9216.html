<p>Here's another solution:</p>

<pre><code>$day = 1;
$strings = array();
while($day &lt; 31) {
    if (array_key_exists($day, $array)) {
        $strings[$day] = $array['$day'] . " spots available";
    } else {
        $strings[$day] = "No spots available for this date";
    }
    $day += 1;
}
foreach ($strings as $day =&gt; $string) {
    echo '&lt;td title="' . $string . '"&gt;' . $day . '&lt;/td&gt;';
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is so different about it? Well, fist of all, it's likely going to be slower than your solution since I'm looping 31 times, twice! But this example is so trivial that performance is not your main concern.
Your main concern is writing code that is so simple anyone can understand it.</p>

<p>PHP code gets very complicated if you have lots of HTML printing going on. Generally what you want to do is make some sort of model (adhoc or systematic) that collects all your data, and only prints it to HTML as the very last step.</p>

<p>Learn to separate the data-collection and model generation step from the HTML printing step. This may seem like overkill and a waste of CPU power and memory and what not, but what is more expensive: your time and sanity or some server in a hot room somewhere? ;)</p>

<p>Your choice to have a sparse array of only the days that have <em>spots available</em> is already an optimization. And <em>premature optimization is the mother of all evil</em>. Think about the easiest way to solve your problem, build that, it's likely going to be fast enough anyway.</p>
