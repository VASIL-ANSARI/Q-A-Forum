<p>You are always using "new_id" as the key on the "obj.put" line.  For the first map entry, you set the value for that key on the JSON object.  For each subsequent entry, you are replacing the value for that key, not adding a new key.  That is why only the last entry in the map is represented in the JSON.</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to accomplish, but you likely either need to use a different key each time through the loop or use a JSONArray instead of a JSONObject so that you don't need keys at all.</p>
