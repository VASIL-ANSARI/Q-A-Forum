<p>inside a for-loop , use System.Random to get an int in the range 0 to 9.</p>

<p>hope that helps, I'm not coding the solution because...  well, if you are going to learn c# probably you better be able to do that yourself!</p>

<h3>EDIT:</h3>

<p>I'll go ahead and post my "answer" with the caviet:   If you are asking this for some professional reason (such as answering a school test question or passing an employment interview screening)  <strong>*Then FYI: copy/pasting a solution someone else wrote on StackOverflow is going to cripple your ability to get (or keep) jobs in the future, and will reduce your ability to make money. *</strong>  I would continue further elaboration, but I'm sure we all know the repercussions if we think it through a bit.</p>

<pre><code>        var random = new Random();
        var list = new List&lt;int&gt;();
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; 13; i++)
        {
            list.Add(random.Next(10));
        }
</code></pre>
