<p>if you just started with laravel, i'd suggest to setup homestead first. This is a better way to work since you dont have to worry about server maintanance anymore and you can just focus on making a website.
This will also resolve this problem, since you use a vm to handle the server.
For more info about homestead, here are some links:</p>
