<p>I think your idea of creating a <code>HARNESS_ACCESSIBLE</code> macro is the cleanest way of going about this.  You definitely don't want to be #define-ing away <code>static</code> for just the reasons you described.</p>

<p>I don't think using this macro will be cluttering up your code.  You'll just be putting this in place of <code>static</code>, and it gives you the option of specifying exactly which functions you want to be able to unit test and keeping those minor utility functions explicitly <code>static</code>.</p>
