<p>I finally got the Safari Developer window open and about 50% of that long loading time is spent trying to load your custom fonts.  I'd get rid of those and see if this improves.</p>

<p>Most of the other half of the time is spent loading your images.  Perhaps see if you can optimize those.  I'd go back to look at your graphics sizes myself but your page almost crashed my Safari last time.</p>

<p>Then there is some other issue triggered by (???) where the text disappears and reappears on the page.  I could not troubleshoot that for you either because the browser was all but frozen.  I suspect that you are forcing the fonts to re-download every time some mouse event happens.</p>

<p>Maybe post more of your code here because I'm not visiting your page again.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>To find the offensive portion, I'd strip the page down to almost nothing and slowly add back whole pieces of working code until it chokes again.  (<strong>EDIT:</strong> As pointed out in another answer, start by removing the <code>mousemove</code> event.)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>Please <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://filetaxes4free.com/temporary/&amp;charset=%28detect%20automatically%29&amp;doctype=Inline&amp;group=0" rel="nofollow"><b>VALIDATE YOUR CODE</b></a> before doing anything else!  I found some errors related to open HTML tags.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong></p>

<p>Nothing says you can't use both MooTools and jQuery on the same page but unless there's some compelling reason, I'd convert the code from one to the other and stick with one library... things will load faster, run better and you'll have less potential for conflict.</p>
