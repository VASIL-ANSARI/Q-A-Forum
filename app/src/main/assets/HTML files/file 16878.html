<p>First things first .. ID should be <strong>unique</strong> .. And you are having so many elements with the same ID.</p>

<p>Try replacing the same with class names which makes your code cleaner.</p>

<p>Also why do you want to overload your page by having the same Div over and over again when you can simply Have a single div for the navigation..</p>

<p>And the projects in separate div ..</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE CODE</strong></p>

<p>Check this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/sushanth009/Ur7SW/36/" rel="nofollow">FIDDLE</a></p>

<p>I have made the required modifications for it to work with a Single Div wrapper that loads the projects</p>
