<p>In the current implementation a Stream is either all parallel or all sequential.  While the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/BaseStream.html#parallel--" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a> isn't explicit about this and it could change in the future it does say this is possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>S parallel()</p>
  
  <p>Returns an equivalent stream that is parallel. May return itself, either because the stream was already parallel, or because the underlying stream state was modified to be parallel.</p>

<p>If you need the function to be single threaded, I suggest you use a Lock or synchronized block/method.</p>
