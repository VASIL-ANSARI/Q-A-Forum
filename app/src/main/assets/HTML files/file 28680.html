<p>I doesn't see a code of your adapter for GridView. At first you should write a separate class - adapter for GridView, where method <strong>getView()</strong> must be overrided (see similar questions about adapters for GridView). When you retrieve a data, u should call notifyDataSetChanged() method for your adapter - this will refresh the GridView with new data.</p>

<p>Good example how to custom gridview <a href="http://www.mkyong.com/android/android-gridview-example/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mkyong.com/android/android-gridview-example/</a></p>

<p>And don't forget call <strong>adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();</strong></p>
