<p>As always, the best thing you can do is not re-implement something that has already been written. There are a large number of libraries and frameworks that will help with serialization for c++:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">Boost Serialization</a></li>
<li><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/datastreamformat.html" rel="nofollow">Qt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview?csw=1" rel="nofollow">Protocol Buffers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://msgpack.org/" rel="nofollow">msgpack</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/" rel="nofollow">Capn' Proto</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally the serialization framework you choose will exactly recreate the data graph that you are trying to store. Regardless of whether you have done any fixup, your goal will likely be to only provide const access to the global configuration data. Just make sure that mutators (including non const pointers) are not exposed via a header file.</p>
