<p>You can use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps" rel="nofollow"><code>gulp-sourcemaps</code></a> to write an inline sourcemap into your bundle.  This will cause the browser's developer tools to display source as if it were in the original source files despite actually being served in a bundle.</p>

<p>This would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

gulp.task('bundle', function() {
  gulp.src('src/**/*.js')
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
      .pipe(bundle())
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
</code></pre>

<p>There's a good general overview of how source maps work here: <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/" rel="nofollow">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/</a></p>
