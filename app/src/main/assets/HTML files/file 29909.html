<p>What you see is an example of floating point internal representation. You can have a look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format" rel="nofollow">here</a> to see how double are stored in memory. See also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9999221/double-precision-decimal-places">this question</a> to know why debugger shows you this value. </p>

<p>With this storing format, it is not possible to represent a decimal number exactly. That is why money calculations usually use special decimal types that are either custom or part of the programming language.</p>
