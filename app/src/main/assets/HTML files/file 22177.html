<p>At least one error I see:
<code>Validate() = true</code> should be <code>Validate() == true</code>. You are assigning instead of using comparison. </p>

<p>Even shorter, <code>if(Validate())</code> will work.</p>

<p>But the error itself is most probably caused by the missing semicolon after return it seems.</p>
