<p>First, look at the <code>sales_flat_order_item</code> table to check whether its a frontend bug (where you really are ordering 4 but is displaying 2) or a backend bug (where you really are ordering 2 but 4 is coming off). If it is a backend bug, start looking in <code>Mage_CatalogInventory_Model_Observer::subtractQuoteInventory</code></p>
