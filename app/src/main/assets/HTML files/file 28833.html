<p>That's why we have <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>.  For the overwhelming majority of cases where one is not sharing one's map across multiple threads without synchronization, plain-old <code>HashMap</code> suffices. </p>

<p>There is no guarantee that two objects that collide with <i>n</i> buckets will still collide with 2<i>n</i> buckets.  Just using a counting argument it should be about half as likely that any two objects collide. Fewer collisions mean shorter lists, which means the retrieval time is shorter. </p>

<p>Because we are rehashing and collisions are not consistent across different numbers of buckets, I am skeptical that you are reading the code correctly when you assert that each bucket's list is being reversed as part of the process. </p>
