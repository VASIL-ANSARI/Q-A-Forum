<p>It looks like you're running into an issue that has been discussed on the jQuery Steps plugin github page: <a href="https://github.com/rstaib/jquery-steps/issues/147" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rstaib/jquery-steps/issues/147</a></p>

<p>basically, since the body of the step content is positioned absolutely with a percent height, it's height is no longer based on the content within it. A few things people used to try to fix this are:</p>

<p>By <a href="https://github.com/waqashsn" rel="nofollow">waqashsn</a>:</p>

<pre><code>.content &gt; .body{
    /*position: absolute*/
    float:left;
    width:95%;
    height:95%;
    padding:2.5%
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's another alternative by <a href="https://github.com/AneeshRS" rel="nofollow">AneeshRS</a> that instead causes overflowing content to scroll:</p>

<pre><code>.wizard.clearfix &gt; .content.clearfix{
    min-height: 500px;
    overflow-y: auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Checkout the link to the issues page for a better explanation of either of these. Note however that any solution that involves removing the absolute positioning will likely cause transitions to no longer work.</p>
