<p>IoC in ASP.NET <code>Page</code>s is a bit limited - although the module is injecting properties into the page, it can't really use Autofac's regular dependency injection features.</p>

<p>In WebForms the way people typically get around this is to use something like Model-View-Presenter, where the page is just a 'dumb' view and the presenter is where the logic (and proper dependency injection) takes place.</p>
