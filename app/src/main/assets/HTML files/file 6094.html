<p>It seems like Datos is an object you defined since i couldn't find it in the SDK. Given that it could be a few different things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Either that <code>arr_datos</code> does not have the correct (or any) data inside of it</li>
<li>It could be that the Datos object is incorrectly handling data passed into it and not storing it correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Place a breakpoint in Xcode and verify that <code>arr_datos</code> has the information you think inside of it and that the datos object is correctly storing information.</p>
