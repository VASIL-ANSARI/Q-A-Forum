<p>Just having a quick look, it uses threads, yes. Node on the other hand uses processes, since it's design is single-threaded, however internally it creates thread pools and hence threads during callback creation.</p>

<p>Node implementations of processes uses sockets for communication, which is quite slow, in terms of latency. Your tasks should hence be dividable, so you won't need to have much communication.
Threads are like processes, but share the memory with their calling processes, so that communications is quicker, but more dangerous.</p>

<p>So, the question is rather aims are threads better then processes for concurrency? It depends... But in Node context use cluster and processes rather.</p>

<p>The library you are referencing to is quite old right? Better don't use it. There is a reason why people abandon stuff like this.</p>
