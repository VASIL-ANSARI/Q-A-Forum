<p>Sounds like a job for <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotkey</a> to me.</p>

<p>I am a "pro" (at least I get paid to program), but I would first look at using AutoHotkeys' many well tested functions to access windows, rather then delving into C#/.NET and most likey the WinAPI via PInvoke.</p>

<p>AutoHotkey even provides some basic user interface controls and is free.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/scripts/FavoriteFolders.htm">AutoHotkey script</a> that is very similar to what you are asking for.</p>
