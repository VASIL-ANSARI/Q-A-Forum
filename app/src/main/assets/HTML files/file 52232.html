<p>You can use a wrapper around the third party library class and inject the different flavor of wrapper to be used for different version of thirdparty library.</p>

<p>E.g For a <code>LibClass</code> you will have <code>IWrapperLibClass</code> which will have the currently used public methods. Your current implementation should depend on <code>IWrapperLibClass</code> and based on the version of 3rd Party library you have to figure out the way to inject the Flavour of <code>WrapperLibClassFlavourA</code></p>
