<p>What do you expect to read if <code>sizeof double</code> on read platform differs from <code>sizeof double</code> on write platform?</p>

<p>Suppose <code>sizeof double</code> on your write platform was 10. Then you stored a sequence of 10 bytes in a file that represents a 10-byte double. Then, if <code>sizeof double</code> on your read platform is 8, you would try to parse bits of an 10-byte double into an 8-byte and that would obviously end up with garbage.</p>

<p>Here's a more intuitive example with ints:
If you a have a 2-byte integer number, say 5. If you store it in binary file, you'll get a sequence of 2 bytes: <code>00000000 00000101</code>. Then, if you try to read the same number as a 1-byte int, you'll manage to read only the first byte, which is <code>00000000</code> and get just zero as a result.</p>

<p>Consider using strings to save doubles for portability <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6790009/817441">http://stackoverflow.com/a/6790009/817441</a></p>
