<p>Not really sure how that happened but try adding this code to your web config
</p>

<p>And then in your IIS, under Machine Key for the website, we have 
Encryption Method = SHA1
Decryption Method = DES</p>

<p>make sure all the checkboxes for Validation key and Decryption key are unchecked.
Note that "xxx" and "yyy" are in the key fields.</p>

<p>After making this change, you may need to recycle your app pool, and clear browser caches.</p>
