<p>This is a perfect example of JavaScript's <code>innerHTML</code> and <code>split()</code> methods. You can loop through the content of all of the <code>p</code> elements. Here's an example of searching in the first paragraph:</p>

<pre><code>contentArray = document.getElementByTagName('p')[0].innerHTML.split(' ')
</code></pre>

<p><code>split(' ')</code> splits the content of the element into an array, separating by the spaces. <code>innerHTML</code> is self explanatory.</p>

<p>Now, to find your words. <code>indexOf()</code> is your friend in this case:</p>

<pre><code>foodex = contentArray.indexOf('foo');
alert('The first occurrence of the string \'foo\' in the text is at word number ' + foodex);
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, to get surrounding words, just play with the array (this won't work if the occurrence of the string is close to the start or end of the paragraph, namely less than 10 words away:</p>

<pre><code>alert('I am the 10th word after \'foo\'' + contentArray[foodex + 10 - 1]);
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck (no guarantees this code works out of the box)!</p>
