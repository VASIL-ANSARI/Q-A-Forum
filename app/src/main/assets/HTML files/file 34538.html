<p>lowest level anything is always directly controlling hardware. It's the same for sound (e.g. sending midi sequences to a synthesizer or raw audio data of some format to a speaker). The OS layer is already an abstraction layer of sorts.</p>

<p>May I ask why you care? You're not very likely to interact with this at all. The lowest interesting level would be a general hardware independent low level API like OpenAL (unless you need to write a driver for some reason, in which case you likely wouldn't have asked this question).</p>
