<p>The problem is in the internal code of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.icollection.copyto.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>CopyTo</code></a> method.</p>

<p>MSDN says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type of the source ICollection cannot be cast automatically to the type of the destination array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means that the array must be able to convert without explicit conversion. Otherwise the method call will fail.</p>

<p>Instead of using <code>CopyTo</code>, you should use a <code>foreach</code> and copy them by hand one by one.</p>
