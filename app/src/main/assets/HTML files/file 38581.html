<p>You can do something fun with extension methods here.</p>

<pre><code>public static class Extensions
{
    public static T Get&lt;T&gt;()
    {
        // fake implementation, but T is required at compile time
        var result = Activator.CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;();
        return result;
    }

    public static T AssignId&lt;T, U&gt;(this T entity, U id)
        where T : IEntity&lt;U&gt;
    {
        entity.Id = id;
        return entity;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would be called as follows.</p>

<pre><code>var result = Extensions.Get&lt;EntityInt&gt;().AssignId(34);

var result2 = Extensions.Get&lt;EntityString&gt;().AssignId("WALKEN");
</code></pre>

<p>You can put your get method anywhere you like but the AssignId method would have to be in a class that is qualified to have extension methods, i.e. it must be a static non-generic class and you may need a using statement that refers to the namespace containing the extension method.</p>
