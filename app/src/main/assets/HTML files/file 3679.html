<p>I'm guessing the timer resumes as soon as you stop interacting with the NSStatusItem? (After the menu's dismissed &amp; mouse button released).</p>

<p>The user interaction puts the main run loop into a mode where it doesn't update timers, so if your label has to continually update, you'll probably need to move the NSTimer and the label drawing to a separate process or another thread.</p>
