<p>It's probably a habit left over from C/C++. In C, you would put constants on the left, because if you mistyped <code>=</code> instead of <code>==</code> there would be an error because you can't assign something to a constant. In Java, this is unnecessary because <code>if (foo = null)</code> also gives an error, which says that an object reference isn't a boolean.</p>
