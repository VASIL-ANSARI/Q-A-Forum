<p>If I understand you correctly, you are looking for doing a <code>$watch</code> on your model; eg:</p>

<pre><code>link: function($scope, element, attr, ngModel) {
    $scope.$watch(attr.ngModel,function(newVal,oldVal) {
        element.blur();
    })
</code></pre>

<p>You stated that you wanted to do something when the <code>model</code> changed, so this is the usage of the $watch.</p>
