<p>It seems that you've already answered your own question in the paragraph before edit. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Protocols/NSNibAwaking_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> states that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When an object receives an awakeFromNib message, it is guaranteed to have all its outlet instance variables set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you have to access <code>IBOutlet</code> ivars in your initialisation code, you have to do it in the <code>awakeFromNib</code> method. </p>

<p>Although I prefer <code>initWithCoder:</code> in cases when I do not need to access outlets because it is the proper initialiser method for objects being decoded with <code>NSCoding</code> protocol according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Protocols/NSCoding_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow"><code>NSCoding</code> documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>initWithCoder: instructs the object to initialize itself from data in the coder provided; as such, it <strong>replaces any other initialization method</strong> and is sent only once per object</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a side note though, it does not make much of a difference and in cases when I have to access outlets in my initialization code, I do not implement both <code>awakeFromNib</code> and <code>initWithCoder:</code> for the sake of simplicity. So if outlets are involved I usually implement <code>awakeFromNib</code> and do all the initialisation there. </p>
