<pre><code>int num = [[[myString mutableCopy] autorelease] replaceOccurrencesOfString:@"-" withString:@"X" options:NSLiteralSearch range:NSMakeRange(0, [myString length])];
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>replaceOccurrencesOfString:withString:options:range:</code> method returns the number of replacements that were made, so we can use that to work out how many <code>-</code>s are in your string.</p>
