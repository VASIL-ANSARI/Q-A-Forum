<p>I cannot test this right now, but you could probably differentiate the Siri Remote from a third party remote by using a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/tvos/documentation/GameController/Reference/GCEventViewController_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/GCEventViewController" rel="nofollow">GCEventViewController</a> with the controllerUserInteractionEnabled property set to false. This way, the Siri Remote inputs shouldn't get passed to UIKit (when the GCEventViewController is the first responder). The third-party remote's input events might go through to UIKit since, unlike the Siri Remote, it's not a GCMicroGamepad.</p>

<p>So far, Apple really doesn't support multiplayer games with multiple Siri Remotes, iOS Remotes or IR remotes. But I think it might be coming because <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/12/apple-will-update-the-iphones-remote-app-to-do-everything-apple-tvs-own-remote-can/" rel="nofollow">the Remote app on iOS will soon support multiplayer gaming</a> (so I guess the Apple TV will recognize multiple GCMicroGamePad controllers).</p>
