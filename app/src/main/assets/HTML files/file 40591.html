<p>You should have put the <code>||</code> expressions in parentheses. The <code>&amp;</code> operator (and the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator, which is what you actually should have used) has higher precedence, so as long as the direction string matched, the whole expression was true.</p>

<p>That said, that code is just crazy (no offense intended :) ). It's hard to read, inefficient, and prone to bugs (your question case in point). Try something like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>public void moveRobot()
{
    switch (direction)
    {
    case "north":
    case "North":
        position.Y += movementAmount;
        break;
    case "east":
    case "East":
        position.X += movementAmount;
        break;
    case "south":
    case "South":
        position.Y -= movementAmount;
        break;
    case "west":
    case "West":
        position.X -= movementAmount;
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even better would be to make <code>direction</code> an <code>enum</code> instead of a <code>string</code>, to ensure you always get a valid value.</p>
