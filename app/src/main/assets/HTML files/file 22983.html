<p>This is only theoretic considerations and I don't known working implementations for leaflet. However I have some issue, but don't have time now to resolve it.</p>

<p><strong>Web and phonegap storages:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><code>loacalstorage</code> - synchronous, easy to implement with base64 url, small size 2.5-5MB (probably phonegap resolve <code>localstorage</code> small size issue).</li>
<li><code>indexed db</code> and <code>web sql</code> - asynchronous, size 50 MB (maybe more).</li>
<li>phonegap file storage - asynchronous.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How implement:</strong></p>

<p>Write own layer which will work with your storage, probably it will be difficult for asynchronous APIs.</p>

<p>You always can store tile as data url with base64 encoding. You can transform image by server url to data url with JS and canvas.</p>

<p>If you can use tile preloading easiest way to use file storage, because you can just use links to tiles on your file system.</p>

<p>For asychronous APIs you always can detect your tile by <code>zoom</code>, <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code>: insert fake tile with <code>zoom_lat_lng</code> id and fake <code>src</code>, check tile in storage by this id, if tile found - load it, else load from server with caching.</p>

<p><strong>UPD</strong>: See my caching solution with indexed db and web sql for example:
