<p>You want to create a tempfile (which is fine on Heroku as long as you don't expect it to persist across requests).</p>

<pre><code>def perform
  # Create instance of your Carrierwave Uploader
  uploader = MyUploader.new

  # Generate your PDF
  pdf = GenerateReportPdf.new(@object)

  # Create a tempfile
  tmpfile = Tempfile.new("my_filename")

  # set to binary mode to avoid UTF-8 conversion errors
  tmpfile.binmode 

  # Use render to write the file contents
  tmpfile.write pdf.render

  # Upload the tempfile with your Carrierwave uploader
  uploader.store! tmpfile

  # Close the tempfile and delete it
  tmpfile.close
  tmpfile.unlink
end
</code></pre>
