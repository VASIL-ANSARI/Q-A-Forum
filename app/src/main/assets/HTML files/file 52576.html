<p>It's because the underlying observable <em>result</em> has already completed. So each new subscriber is just getting the OnCompleted callback. </p>

<p>If ObservableDefer was creating a new sequence each time or one that didn't complete you would see the desired behavior.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>return result.FirstAsync().Concat(Observable.Never&lt;bool&gt;());
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to remove the <code>Assert.Equal(1, completionCount);</code></p>
