<p>Actually, a class representing an entity should contain information relevant to that entity.</p>

<p>Any method that belong to the management of the entity, like looking for a specific object, telling which ones contain a set of properties and the like should be in a different class.</p>

<p>To make my point clear:</p>

<p>You can have your "Employee" with only the 3 string properties and then an "EmployeeManager" which is responsible of searching for employees, containing a list with all employees, looking by id, etc.</p>

<p>That way, you objects will be only information carriers and you will brake the dependency between them.</p>

<p>In your case, it makes more sense to have the "SearchEmployee" method on the Data Service.</p>
