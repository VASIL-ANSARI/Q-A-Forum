<p>As the documentation states for <code>AudioRecord</code> and <code>AudioTrack</code>:</p>

<pre><code>audioFormat     the format in which the audio data is represented. See ENCODING_PCM_16BIT and ENCODING_PCM_8BIT
</code></pre>

<p>you can only work with 8-bit and 16-bit PCM. If you want audio in other formats, either don't use <code>AudioRecord</code> and <code>AudioTrack</code> (try <code>MediaRecorder</code> and <code>MediaPlayer</code>) or you will have to transcode it using your own code, possibly leveraging the NDK.</p>

<p><code>AudioRecord</code> and <code>AudioTrack</code> are designed specifically for cases where the audio in question is not supported by the OpenCORE multimedia engine, either because it's not a supported codec or not a supported streaming protocol (e.g., SIP).</p>
