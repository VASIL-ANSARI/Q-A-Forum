<p>[I originally answered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6310654/jquery-jscrollpane-on-ul/6329440">a completely different question</a> here by mistake so editing to answer the correct question]</p>

<p>There is very little jScrollPane can do about this. I did a little research but it seems that different browsers behave differently when it comes to triggering rollout/mouseout events when the mouse leaves the browser window. This makes it hard to implement a consistent behaviour within jScrollPane (the problem also occurs when the mouse leaves an iframe if you use full body scroll on an iframe).</p>

<p>I think there are probably security reasons for browsers not reporting mouse movement outside of the window so there is probably very little that can be done about this :(</p>
