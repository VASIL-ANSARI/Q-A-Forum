<p>Razor is not going to help you in this. There are 2 ways to do this.</p>

<p><strong>1) Use javascript</strong> : Listen for the checkbox change event and if it is checked, read the content of first text box and paste it in second. This is the preferred i would go for. </p>

<p>Some thing like this</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
    $("#chkCopy").change(function(){
        $("#address2").val("");
       if(this.checked)
       {
            $("#address2").val($("#address1").val())

            //Lets read city and paste it in the second place as well.
            $("#city2").val($("#city1").val())
       }                
    });
});â
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you want to copy from textbox with id <code>address1</code> to textbox with id <code>address2</code> when checkbox with id <code>chkCopy</code> is clicked</p>

<p><strong>2) Using a formpost</strong> : Let the user clicks on "Copy" button and it does a form submit to your action method where you read the values of those form elements and set it on those properties meant for the second check box and return that to the view.</p>
