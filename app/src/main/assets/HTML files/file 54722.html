<p>To somebody who may stumble on this in the future - MQTT is a fairly simple, hassle free protocol to setup. Issues like this are most likely at the server side.</p>

<p>In my case, it was most likely <strong>CloudMQTT's Free Tier connection/usage limitations</strong> that caused this issue. After much time spent trying to figure the guts of Paho out, I simply spun up my own Mosquitto Instance using a handy Ansible role and AWS, and things worked out swell like they should have hours ago :-)</p>
