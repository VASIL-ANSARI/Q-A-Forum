<p>It looks like you are parsing the inputs, and based on certain values, adding further arguments, which you will again parse.  Right?</p>

<p>The <code>-h</code> is being handled by the first parsing.  Remember it exits after printing its arguments.  So it doesn't get to the <code>some group</code> addition, much less display the later help.</p>

<p>One way around this is to define the first parser with <code>add_help=False</code>, so the first <code>parse_know_args</code> does not handle the <code>-h</code>.</p>

<p>Now add your own <code>-h</code> argument to the parser (try <code>action='help'</code>); or recreate the parser.  Either way the second parsing step will act on the <code>-h</code>.</p>
