<p>CSS3 transitions would work perfectly for this. Simply do something like this in your CSS:</p>

<pre><code>body &gt; img {
    height:100px;
    transition:height .5s;
}
body &gt; img:hover {
    height:50px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems you do not currently have a CSS file so I advise you make one or add your styles to the head tag inside <strong>style</strong> tags.</p>
