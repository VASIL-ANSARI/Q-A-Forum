<p>There's a way easier way of implementing this. Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>import operator

questions = [(1,2), (4,2), (8,1), (10,100)] # operands for your questions
operators = {"+" : operator.add,
             "-" : operator.sub,
             "*" : operator.mul}
# a dictionary containing each operator's symbol and the resulting function
# (operator.add(x,y) is equivalent to x+y)

for num, operands in enumerate(questions,start=1):
    # iterate through each set of operands, enumerating starting at 1 
    operator = random.choice(operators)
    # return a random symbol from operators
    answer = operators[operator](*operands)
    # operators[operator] is the function, which we then call with the operands
    q_text = "{} {} {} = ?".format(str(operands[0]), operator, str(operands[1]))
    print("Question {}".format(str(num)))
    print(q_text)
    user_answer = input("&gt;&gt;")
    if float(user_answer) == answer:
        # correct!
    else:
        # fail!
</code></pre>
