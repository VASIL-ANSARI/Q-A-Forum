<p>You can try to use <code>formatter: "dynamicLink"</code> instead of <code>formatter:'showlink'</code>. I suggested if in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9048483/315935">the old answer</a>. It should work with retro version 4.0.0. You can download it <a href="https://github.com/OlegKi/jqGrid-plugins/blob/master/jQuery.jqGrid.dynamicLink.js" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It is very flexible and I think you would be able implement all your requirement. Nevertheless I'd recommend you to upgrade to the current version of <a href="https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid" rel="nofollow">free jqGrid</a> (version 4.13.0) because the version 4.0.0 is dead since a long time. You can try free jqGrid just by replacing the URLs to jqGrid files to the URLs described in <a href="https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/wiki/Access-free-jqGrid-from-different-CDNs" rel="nofollow">the wiki</a>.</p>
