<p>Why not use WifiManager.WifiLock when the transfer is happening and release it when you have finished.</p>

<p>I would suspect network connection switch would not be seamless.  I don't know for sure.</p>

<p>A BroadcastReceiver will let you know when Wifi connection state changes.  Have a look at ConnectivityManager though because that will monitor Wifi and GPRS etc and it does do failover.  Whether it is seamless though I don't know.</p>
