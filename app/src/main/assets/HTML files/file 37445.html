<p>You have two main options...</p>

<p>1) You can spend countless hours reviewing the queries that WordPress is creating based upon your theme and all the plugins you use and then optimizing them until the problem no longer occurs (which may or may not be feasible depending upon your hosting environment).</p>

<p>-- or --</p>

<p>2) Install something like WP Super Cache ( <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/" rel="nofollow">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/</a> ) so that the database isn't being hit that hard. It's basically a full page cache that will eliminate DB access for the type of stress you are putting it under. It's even easy enough to deactivate for when you are not scanning if you prefer that. Make sure to preload the cache before running the scan from Woorank.</p>
