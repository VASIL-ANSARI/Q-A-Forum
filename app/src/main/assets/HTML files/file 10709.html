<p>You don't specify what fails, but my guess is that right after</p>

<pre><code>gameMenuChoice = in.nextInt();
</code></pre>

<p>you should add</p>

<pre><code>in.nextLine();
</code></pre>

<p>otherwise, when you'll go in the loop for a second time, a residual <code>\n</code> will be read by the scanner instead of your new number.  The new number is the scanner, but in the next slot, followed by another <code>\n</code>.</p>
