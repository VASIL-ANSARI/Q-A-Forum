<p>The problem is the relative animation of the <code>top</code> property (-=20). Try changing that to the actual fixed pixel value to which you want to animate this property, e.g: if they start with <code>top: 190px</code>, try changing your <code>animate</code> function to <code>sub_div.animate({top:'170px'},500);})</code>.</p>
