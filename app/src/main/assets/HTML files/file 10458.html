<p>I would check a few things:</p>

<p>1) Is SQL Server started on the new machine?</p>

<p>2) Is the firewall configured to allow SQL connections?</p>

<p>3) Is the client connection mechanism (named pipes, tcp/ip) also configured in SQL Server.</p>

<p>4) Is there a valid network connection in the new machine (we used to have a lot of problems on laptops when they were not connected to the network).</p>

<p>You might have much better luck if you change the SQL Server machine name to <code>.</code> or <code>(local)</code> if you are always going to have the DB installed on the same machine as the app.</p>
