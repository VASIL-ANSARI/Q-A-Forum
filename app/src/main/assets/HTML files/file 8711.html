<p>Not an answer, but the Linux close man page contains the interesting quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is probably unwise to close file descriptors while they  may  be  in
      use by system calls in other threads in the same process.  Since a file 
      descriptor may be reused, there are some obscure race  conditions  that
      may cause unintended side effects.</p>
