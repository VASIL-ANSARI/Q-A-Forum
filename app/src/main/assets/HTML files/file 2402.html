<p>For me, it is a matter of experience. After dealing with multiple editors, libraries, and tools that manipulate databases, I've learned not to trust the "+" and "-" operators as much as I trust DATE_SUB(). It's a lot less likely that something is going to be accidentally broken as part of the next software upgrade with DATE_SUB(), when compared to using +/-</p>
