<p>Yes, it is possible to use a backspace (<code>'\b'</code>) to overwrite something already printed to the screen, but it isn't a technique you'd typically use.</p>

<p>Instead of using a backspace character to overwrite something you've already printed, modify your code to only print the parts that you want.  Here's a good starting point, but you'll need to modify it to cover situations like 1000, 0, and 1001.</p>

<pre><code>    if (thousands &gt; 0)
        printf("%s thousand ", single_numbers[thousands]);
    if (hundreds &gt; 0)
        printf("%s hundred ", single_numbers[hundred]);
    if (temp &gt;= 20)
        printf("%s %s only\n", tens_numbers[tens-2], single_numbers[units]);
    else
        printf("%s only\n", teens[temp-11]);
</code></pre>

<p>The other way to accomplish your goal would be to use <code>sprintf()</code> to print into a buffer, and selectively truncate the buffer to remove written characters.  But consider how inefficient that is -- why print and then erase when you can just skip the printing step entirely?</p>
