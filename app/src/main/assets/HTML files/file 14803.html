<p>It has been known for ages that multiple subinterpreters don't play well along C extensions. However, what I did not realize is that the default settings are very unfortunate. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationDirectives#WSGIApplicationGroup">ModWSGI wiki</a> clearly states that the default value for WSGIApplicationGroup directive is %{RESOURCE} the effect of which shall be that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The application group name will be set to the server hostname and port
  as for the %{SERVER} variable, to which the value of WSGI environment
  variable SCRIPT_NAME is appended separated by the file separator
  character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that for each Host: header ever encountered while accessing the server the mod_wsgi kindly spawns a new subinterpreter, for which the C extensions are then loaded.</p>

<p>I had unknowingly triggered the error by accessing localhost.invalid:81 with <em>links</em> browser on this local server causing 1 of our 4 WSGIDaemonProcesses to fail for all future incoming requests.</p>

<p>Summa summarum: <strong>always when using mod_wsgi with pyramid or any other framework that uses C extensions, make sure that WSGIApplicationGroup is always set to %{GLOBAL}</strong>. In other words, the result of using the default settings will cause you to shoot yourself in the foot, after which you might want to shoot yourself in the head too.</p>
