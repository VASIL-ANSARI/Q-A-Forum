<p>Edit: My old answer does not work.</p>

<p>This question is related to yours, though they are asking about QT:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7827430/setting-mac-osx-application-menu-menu-bar-item-to-other-than-python-in-my-pyth">Setting Mac OSX Application Menu menu bar item to other than &quot;Python&quot; in my python Qt application</a></p>

<p>A basic summary: You can't do it with the python code. You must create an application bundle.
One of the answers at that post links to a basic how-to.</p>

<p>Also, have a look at py2app: <a href="http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html</a></p>
