<p>There is no strong reason to prefer <code>count($myArray) == 0</code> over <code>empty($myArray)</code>. They have identical semantics. Some might find one more readable than the other. One might perform marginally better than the other but it's not likely to be a significant factor in the vast majority of php applications. For all practical purposes, the choice is a matter of taste.</p>
