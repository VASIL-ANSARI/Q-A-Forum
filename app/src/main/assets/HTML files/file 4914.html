<p>It depends how you create your session. Simply you have to nulify session entry. Here is simple example, how to create and destroy sessions.</p>

<pre><code>  get '/login' do
    session[:username] = params[:username]
    "logged in as #{session[:username]}"
  end

  get '/logout' do
    old_user = session[:username]
    session[:username] = nil
    "logged out #{old_user}"
  end
</code></pre>
