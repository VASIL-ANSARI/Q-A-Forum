<p>I was not exactly precise copying <code>Notification</code> code sample. I removed <code>setSmallIcon()</code> call from code as I was too lazy to add icons. As a result system was really dropping my <code>Intent</code>, saying that no icon is provided for it and it'll be a crash in future releases.</p>
