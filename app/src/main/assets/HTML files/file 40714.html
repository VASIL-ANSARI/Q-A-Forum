<p>You have both <a href="http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/07/storage-situation-internal-storage.html" rel="nofollow">internal storage</a> and <a href="http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/08/storage-situation-external-storage.html" rel="nofollow">external storage</a> on that device. You may not have <a href="http://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/09/storage-situation-removable-storage.html" rel="nofollow"><em>removable</em> storage</a>, but removable storage is not internal storage and it is not external storage.</p>
