<p>I believe the problem is that when you run <code>sys.stdout.write</code> it writes to the STDOUT buffer, but the buffer is not flushed until done so manually or closed (stdout is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#file-objects" rel="nofollow">File Object</a>, which you can confirm yourself with <code>type(sys.stdout)</code>). Since your loop is infinite, the buffer is never flushed.</p>

<p>Changing your loop in echo.py to this should do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>while 1:
    x = sys.stdin.readline()
    sys.stdout.write("got-" + x) # x already contains newline
    sys.stdout.flush() # flush the buffer
</code></pre>
