<p>Use the <code>LIMIT</code> clause in your SQL queries. </p>

<p>What you want is called <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination" rel="nofollow">pagination</a></em> - each batch of records is considered a page. You have to somehow (through <code>session</code>, or in the link the user clicks) have to hold account for your current page and request for the next like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT .... LIMIT (page_no * batchsize), batchsize
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.php-mysql-tutorial.com/wikis/php-tutorial/paging-using-php.aspx" rel="nofollow">This article</a> has some clear examples on how to do that. I hope this helps.</p>
