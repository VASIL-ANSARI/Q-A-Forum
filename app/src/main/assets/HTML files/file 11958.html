<p>Hibernate is not for mainating the consitency iof its accessed from more than otherw ay too. Database trigger is the way, but if you have only on/few such requirement. If its peppered in your application. You need something else. Like Distibuted database or distributed cache only having access to your database. Lone case, trigger will do. And May be a consol/main/web class invoking that trigger from hibernate too just to have a single set of OIRM too there. Hope that helps</p>
