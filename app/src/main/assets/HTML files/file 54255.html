<p>You do not need to modify your data, you can scale the axes in your view.</p>

<p>To do this you have to toggle the advanced properties, the small gear icon on the properties tab, look for "Scale" and choose each axis scale factor.  Or you can simply use the properties search field (below the Apply button) and search "Scale" to show this property up.</p>
