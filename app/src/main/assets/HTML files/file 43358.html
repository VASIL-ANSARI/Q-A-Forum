<p>I believe what you would be looking for is three tables (or two if each possession can only be owned by one person).</p>

<ol>
<li>Table Person has PersonId (INT PK Identifier) and PersonName (along
with any other person attributes) </li>
<li>Table Possession has PossessionId
(INT PK Identifier) and PossessionName (along with any other
possession attributes) </li>
<li>Table PersonPossession has PersonId and
PossessionId representing that the person has that possession.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a fairly simple design for an m:n relationship (i.e. a person has some number (possibly 0) of possessions, and possessions have some number of "owners")</p>

<p>If each possession can only be owned by a single person you can go down to two tables by eliminating table PersonPossession and just having PersonId being a column of the Possessions table</p>
