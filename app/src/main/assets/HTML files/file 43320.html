<p>Browsers <strong>do</strong> send cookies when requesting JavaScript files, just as they do when requesting anything else. And the same rules apply: The cookie must be for the origin/path. In your example, you seem to be using two different origins (<code>site1</code> and <code>site2</code>), which would explain why you don't see the cookie in the request.</p>

<p>For instance: I set up a page called <code>test.php</code> on my server that sets a cookie. It then has a link to <code>test2.html</code> which includes <code>foo.js</code>. These are all on the same path (<code>/</code>, in my example, because I'm lazy and didn't create a subdirectory for the test).</p>

<p>In the response headers when the browser gets <code>test.php</code>, I see</p>

<pre>
Set-Cookie:test=123
</pre>

<p>If I then click to <code>test2.html</code>, I see this in the request headers for <code>test2.html</code>:</p>

<pre>
Cookie:test=123
</pre>

<p>And then I see the request for <code>foo.js</code>, and in that request I see:</p>

<pre>
Cookie:test=123
</pre>
