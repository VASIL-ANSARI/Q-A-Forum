<p>If you look in the page source at the page numbers on the bottom of the page they have a unique url to each of the pages.  If you print out the soup you see that you can grab that url.  If there are a lot of pages it won't show all of the pages, just a ... for the intermediate pages.  However you can calculate the urls from the first and last values (I did not do that below).  Here is the code I used:</p>

<pre><code>url = "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g60713-San_Francisco_California-Hotels.html" 
page=urllib.request.urlopen(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(page.read())
#print(soup)
for myValue3 in soup.findAll("a",attrs={ "class" : "pageNum" }):
    try:
        print("the value of page " + myValue3.get("data-page-number") + " is: " + myValue3.get("href").split("#ACCOM_OVERVIEW")[0])
    except:
        print("error")
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the output</p>

<pre><code>the value of page 2 is: /Hotels-g60713-oa30-San_Francisco_California-Hotels.html
the value of page 3 is: /Hotels-g60713-oa60-San_Francisco_California-Hotels.html
the value of page 4 is: /Hotels-g60713-oa90-San_Francisco_California-Hotels.html
the value of page 5 is: /Hotels-g60713-oa120-San_Francisco_California-Hotels.html
the value of page 6 is: /Hotels-g60713-oa150-San_Francisco_California-Hotels.html
the value of page 8 is: /Hotels-g60713-oa210-San_Francisco_California-Hotels.html
</code></pre>

<p>notice the <code>-oa###-</code> in the url.  That can be changed and you can get all the subsequent pages.</p>
