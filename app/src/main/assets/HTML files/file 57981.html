<p>I believe you encountered a <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=612430" rel="nofollow">streamed XML parsing bug in chrome</a>. The error will point to the beginning of the XML tag, but in fact the âerrorâ is somewhere further in the content. It is because the server responds in chunks, and one of those chunks were split in the middle of a multibyte UTF character.</p>
