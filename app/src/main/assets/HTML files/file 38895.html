<p>The pattern is more clear in an image with <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tvrdik/5/html/Section5.html#AAAAATree-based%20topologies" rel="nofollow">color</a>.</p>

<p>You need a column and row of perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-ary_tree" rel="nofollow">d-trees</a> with height h.</p>

<p>A perfect d-tree of height h has d^h leaf nodes, and since the leaf nodes of a column tree maps to leaf nodes of distinct row trees, you need d^h row trees and d^h column trees.</p>

<p>The leaf nodes form a (d^h)x(d^h) matrix and can be mapped trivially.</p>
