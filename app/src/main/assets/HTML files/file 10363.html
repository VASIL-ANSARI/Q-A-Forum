<p>You will have to position it over the original image. Here's a quick example:</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/QPr5U/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/QPr5U/1/</a></p>

<p>I made a list of icons, where every image is in it's own <code>li</code> element. It could be divs or whatever, as long as every image is wrapped by another element, and a list is semantically the most correct.
Together with each image is a link with a width and height of 16px and a background image of a cross.</p>

<p>The trick is that the element around the image has a <code>position: relative</code>. This means that anything inside that <code>li</code> element that has a position, is relative to the boundaries of the <code>li</code>.
So if I now give the <code>.cross</code> element a <code>position: absolute</code> with a top and right value of 2px, this means the cross will be positioned 2px from the top and right of the list item.</p>

<p>The last thing I did was give the <code>li</code> items <code>display: inline-block</code> so that they don't span the entire width of the page, but only the width of the contents inside them. If you know how wide each image is going to be, you could also just give the <code>li</code> a fixed width.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
