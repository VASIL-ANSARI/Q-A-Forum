<p>The application pool has a property that causes it to be automatically recycled every N minutes (defaults to 1740, or every 29 hours.) Make this zero to disable recycling. The propertry is (on IIS7) under the "Recycling" heading and is called "Regular Time Interval (minutes)"</p>

<p>Apart from that, you should <strong>always close connections</strong> immediately and dont use <code>static</code> connections at all in ASP.NET (when Connection-Pooling is enabled which is default).</p>

<p>I mention it because of:</p>

<pre><code>private static Sistema instance;
private Sistema()
{
    OpenDataBase();
    LoadStaticInformation();
}
</code></pre>
