<p>I don't know, something like this? </p>

<pre><code>let str:String = "0,0 624,0 624,-48 672,-48 672,192"

let pointsStringArray = str.componentsSeparatedByString(" ")
var points = [CGPoint]()
for pointString in pointsStringArray {
    let xAndY = pointString.componentsSeparatedByString(",")
    let xString = xAndY[0]
    let yString = xAndY[1]
    let x = Double(xString)!
    let y = Double(yString)!
    let point = CGPoint(x: x, y: y)
    points.append(point)
}
print(points)
</code></pre>

<p>It's unsafe, of course, and doesn't handle all conditions. But this should take you in the right direction.</p>
