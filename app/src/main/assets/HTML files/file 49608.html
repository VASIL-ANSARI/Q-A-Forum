<p>It's not enough placing a dll into bin folder.</p>

<p>Look at this page: <a href="http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-7824" rel="nofollow">http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-7824</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Into development environment you must run Crystal Reports developer version for  Visual Studio: <strong>Install Executable - Support pack 15</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Into deployment environmento you must run Crystal Reports runtime: <strong>MSI 64 bit - 64bit.msi</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note: To integrate "SAP Crystal Reports, developer version for
  Microsoft Visual Studio" into VS 2010 or 2012 (SP 7 and higher) or VS
  2013 (SP 9 or higher) or VS 2015 RC (SP14) - VS 2015 (fully - SP 15),
  you must run the Install Executable. Running the MSI will not fully
  integrate Crystal Reports into VS. MSI files by definition are for
  runtime distribution only. By default Windows 10 does not install the
  3.5 framework, CR for VS still needs it. Select it by "Turn Windows feature on or off" and choose both options.</p>
