<p>As Dagon mentioned, <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/products/instant-payment-notification/" rel="nofollow">IPN</a> is the best way to handle this.  </p>

<p>You'll setup a listener script on your server, and every time a transaction happens on your PayPal account, the PayPal server will POST data about that account to your listener script.  You'll get different parameters depending on the type of transaction that occurs.  You can <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/ipn/integration-guide/IPNandPDTVariables/" rel="nofollow">see a list of the types and parameters here</a>.</p>

<p>You can build your email notifications, database updates, etc. into your IPN script to fully automate post-payment processing tasks.</p>

<p>So, in the example you've provided, what would happen is when the transaction first takes place the IPN would be triggered with a payment_status of Pending, and then you'd also see a parameter called pending_reason with a value of echeck.  This tells you the payment was made, but it's an echeck which takes time to clear, so the status again is Pending instead of Completed.</p>

<p>A few days later when that payment does clear (or fails) you'd get another IPN with an updated payment_status.  Only upon receiving an actual COMPLETED payment_status would you then would you deliver the order.</p>

<p>Again, this can all be automated within your IPN script.</p>
