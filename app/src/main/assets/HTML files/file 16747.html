<p>you need to add your ropeemacs dir into the load path, so that EMACS can find the package and load those commands for you</p>

<pre><code>(setq load-path (cons "/PATH-OF-ROPEEMACS"      load-path))
</code></pre>

<p>to be honest, I don't think rope emacs is that useful for me, it slows down the emacs startup quite a lot, but the benefit is not that obvious. when I want to look up issues, I simply go SO.</p>
