<p>I found <a href="http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/11912/how-much-memory-will-a-memory-table-take-up">this dba.se question</a>, in which the accepted answer had a link to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/memory-storage-engine.html" rel="nofollow">this dev.mysql page</a>, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>MEMORY tables use a fixed-length row-storage format. Variable-length
  types such as VARCHAR are stored using a fixed length.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I mentioned in the question, I had a table with 5m rows with one varchar[256] column. </p>

<p><strong>5,000,000 x 256 = 1.19G (assuming 1 byte per char)</strong>, so I think that's the answer!</p>

<p>That particular column alone contributed to 95% of the space, and the rest were from the other numeric columns. I guess InnoDB did not store it in fixed length on disk. And because the field mostly had test values that did not go past 10 - 15 chars, it occupied such a small size on disk.</p>
