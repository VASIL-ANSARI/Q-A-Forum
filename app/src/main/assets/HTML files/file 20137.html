<p>Well I would advice you to fix everything and extend FragmentActivity. But Anyway since can not be done without a <code>FragmentActivity</code>, here is a work-around</p>

<p>Create a FragmentActivity that is invisible (pretty easy with a translucent theme)</p>

<ul>
<li>Start this activity to handle dialogs inside it.</li>
<li>Finish it when dialogs are dismissed or so.</li>
</ul>
