<p>What do you mean by "easily backup and restore?"  If you are dealing terabytes of information, easy just isn't going to happen.  Just the file copies alone will take hours, and require a very large amount of space for you to keep backups.  And if you are really keeping terabytes of information, I don't think that you'll be happy with the downtime associated with that kind of process.</p>

<p>In my experience (not exhaustive by any means) there just isn't any good way of automatic scaling using SQL Server.  In all honesty, I'm not sure it's easy or automatic in any sort of DB scheme, but for sure nothing all that simple for SQL Server.</p>

<p>Apps that I've done with some of the same requirements you have, and I have done a few, I've just "sharded" teh database and used code to aggregate data that needs to cross servers.</p>

<p>Can you refine your requirements a bit?</p>
