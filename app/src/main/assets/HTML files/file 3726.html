<p>Neither of those will cause a crash on their own, so your crash is a side-effect of the scrolling and not a direct result of the code you pasted.  It would help to know the exact error you're seeing, but a likely cause is that you have an NSArray and you're trying to get an element at an index too large for it (or possibly negative).  It's likely that one of your table view's delegate or data source methods are the direct cause of the crash, and that scrolling is only relevant because it causes a bug there to manifest itself.</p>
