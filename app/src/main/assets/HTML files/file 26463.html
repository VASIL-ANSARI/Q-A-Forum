<p>It won't be easy in MySQL since there are difficulties when dealing with delimiter-separated string. As an option, you can use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/string-functions.html#function_substring-index" rel="nofollow">SUBSTRING_INDEX()</a> function like this (query simplified)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  *
FROM
  t
ORDER BY
-- left:
  CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(name, '-', 1) AS UNSIGNED),
-- middle:
  CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(name, '-', 2), '-', -1) AS UNSIGNED)
-- right:
  CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(name, '-', -1) AS UNSIGNED)
</code></pre>

<p>-also you should not forget about converting type to integer (<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/cast-functions.html#function_cast" rel="nofollow">CAST()</a> to <code>UNSIGNED</code> in case above). With sample data that would be:</p>

<pre>
+------+----------+
| id   | name     |
+------+----------+
| 1    | 1-1-1a   |
| 2    | 1-13-5j  |
| 4    | 7-1      |
| 5    | 9-1-2    |
| 3    | 12-13-2a |
+------+----------+
</pre>
