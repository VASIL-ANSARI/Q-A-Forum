<p>Don't <code>count(*)</code>, instead use <code>count(t1.id)</code></p>

<p><strong>Question Edit Change</strong></p>

<p>With the question edit, you should put a column name in the count statement of what you want to count, e.g. <code>count(user.id)</code></p>

<p>I believe the sql is wrong.  Don't you want this:</p>

<pre><code>select u.username, s.sitename, count(c.id)
from user u
join website s on u.website_id = s.id
join counter c on u.id = c.user_id
where u.id &lt;&gt; ""
group by u.username, s.sitename
order by u.id desc
</code></pre>
