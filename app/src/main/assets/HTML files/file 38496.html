<p>I just made some changes to your code (added qty filed to the model) . now its working .</p>

<p>But the main reason it was not working was - since this line :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click="toggleChecked($index)"&gt;check item&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>was outside of ng-repeat, toggleChecked($index) doesn't get the index value .</p>

<p>here is the updated script : <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/7n8NR/242/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/7n8NR/242/</a></p>
