<p><code>f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()</code> returns a file-like object which you're trying to provide as a command line argument. Instead, you want the <em>actual filename</em> which is available via its <code>.name</code> attribute - although I'm somewhat confused why you're creating a tempfile, writing to it, seeking back to position 0, then replacing your tempfile <code>f</code> object with the contents of the file? I suspect you don't want to do that replacement and use <code>f.name</code> for your query.</p>

<pre><code>Result = subprocess.Popen(['blastn','-remote','-db','chromosome','-query',f.name,'-out',str(i)],stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, there's some convenient wrapper functions around <code>subprocess.Popen</code> such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow">subprocess.check_output</a> which are also somewhat more explicit as to your intent which could be used here instead.</p>
