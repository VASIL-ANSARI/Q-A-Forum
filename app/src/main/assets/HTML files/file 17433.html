<p>No it is not usless, you can capture the Preview Images as actual pictures, if you want.</p>

<p>There are preview sizes bigger that screen size, I think almost all phones that have 800x480 resolution and 5MP camera (Galaxy S series) will have a max preview size of 1280x720.</p>

<p>On lower resolution phones (480x320) you can find decent cameras which will provide 800x600 prewview size.</p>

<p>The best use for bigger preview sizes than screen sizes is to provide zoom at a good quality.</p>
