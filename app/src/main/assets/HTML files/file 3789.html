<p>Check your projectproperties for the targeted .NET framework (under "Compile"->"Advanced Compile Options") and check the web.config values for added assemblies (System.Web.Mvc in version 4.0.0.0)</p>

<p>When migrating our project to MVC2 the wizard did not update these values and I had issues with my views.</p>

<p>Maybe this is what is preventing you from using MVC2?</p>
