<p>In your parent page (the one containing the iframe), you could set an event listener for the 'message' event, like so:</p>

<pre><code>window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);
function receiveMessage(e) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your iframe, just post a message to the 'parent' window like this:</p>

<pre><code>parent.postMessage(someString, parentUrl);
</code></pre>

<p>Because messages are strings, you'll need to serialize any data you're sending between iframe and parent window - I suggest JSON!  So in your case, serialize the returning HTML from the upload request and post it to the parent, then deserialize it on that side and inject it into the DOM.</p>
