<p>This assumes that the marriage and birth dates are in the same order (i.e., the first two birth dates correspond to the first marriage date and the next 2 birth dates correspond to the second marriage date)</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(len(marriage)):
    if marriage[i] &gt; data[i*2] and marriage[i] &gt; data[(i*2)+1]:
        print "Both birthdates less than marriage data"
</code></pre>

<p>I believe my assumption is correct because there are twice as many entries in the data list as there are in the marriage list.</p>
