<p>Right, although the message you should implement starting in iOS 6 is <code>-locationManager:didUpdateLocations:</code>. After setting up the delegate, call <code>-startUpdatingLocation</code> and the Location Manager will start sending <code>-locationManager:didUpdateLocations:</code> (or the other method) whenever the location changes until you tell it to stop. Your implementation of that method an do whatever you like -- update a position on a map, log the location to a file, look up the nearest gas stations... There's some reason that you're asking for location updates, and whatever that reason is, this lets you do it.</p>
