<p><code>|</code> -> This is bit-wise OR operator performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation and perform the both operand(right and left).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bitwise OR "|" operator produces 1 if either one or both of the
  bits in its operands are 1. However, if both of the bits are 0 then
  this operator produces 0. To be more precise OR "|" operator returns 1
  in all cases except when both the bits of both the operands are 0.</p>

<pre><code>if ((8 &gt; 4) | (j++ == 7)) System.out.println("j = " + j);
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>8&gt;4</code> will return <code>true</code> and <code>j++ == 7</code> will return <code>false</code>. so it will be <code>if(true|false)</code> and here bit-wise operator will return <code>true</code> or 1 and print value of j which became 1 after j++.</p>
