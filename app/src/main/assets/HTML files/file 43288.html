<ol>
<li>You use spring session beans for beans which are stateful and their state differs per user. These can be for example preferences of currently logged in user.</li>
<li>Default scope of bean in spring is singleton and it is no different in Web Application context.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note than in web environment you can use also REQUEST scoped beans and their lifetime is only per one user request. You should use request scope when session is not necessary and request is sufficient.</p>

<p>Also, in portlet environment, you can use another scope which is GLOBAL SESSION. Each portlet has its own indepenednt session and typically those portlets are preffered to have their own state encapsulated only for themselves. But if you need to share session data among different portlets, you will need to use global session scope.</p>
