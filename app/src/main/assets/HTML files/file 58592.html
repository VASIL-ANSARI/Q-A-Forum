<p>You do not create database entries in migrations, you usually create schema or specify changes in the <code>schema</code> in migration files. You use <code>seeds</code> for creating seed data in the database. </p>

<p>To create new data in database through rails you can use either <code>create</code> or <code>new</code> method but you need to <code>save</code> the data as mentioned in other posts in your links when you are using <code>new</code> method. </p>
