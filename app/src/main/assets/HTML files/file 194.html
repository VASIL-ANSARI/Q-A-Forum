<p>You can get the address that connects to your ServerSocket using http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/NetworkInterface.html#getInetAddresses()</p>

<p>However if your client is connecting via a NAT, then you will get the address of the router and NOT the Ethernet address. If it is on your local network (via a hub/switch, no router with NAT) the it wil work as intended.</p>
