<p>It's a struct for an arbitrarily large integer, introduced in .NET 4.</p>

<p>You'd use it when you want to represent integers larger than <code>Int64</code>/<code>UInt64</code> can cope with. For example, yesterday I wrote <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4298719/parse-decimal-and-filter-extra-0-on-the-right/4298787#4298787">some code to normalize <code>System.Decimal</code> values</a>. <code>System.Decimal</code> uses a 96-bit integer to represent its mantissa, but I wanted to work with it as an integer - so I used <code>BigInteger</code>.</p>

<p>(It's possible that I could have taken another approach just using <code>decimal</code>, but that's a different matter...)</p>

<p>As another example, there was a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4302116">question asked just 45 minutes ago</a> about representing large integers to work with them for cryptography purposes. While <em>real</em> crypto algorithms probably use something more specialized and efficient, using <code>BigInteger</code> to multiply large integers together etc is a good way of showing what logically happens in crypto code.</p>
