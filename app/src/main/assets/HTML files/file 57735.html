<p>There is a mechanism in the Linux kernel called <a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt?id=HEAD" rel="nofollow">binfmt_misc</a> which allows to associate arbitrary interpreters to executables using a magic byte sequence or a certain file extension. Interpreters are registered using the <code>/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/</code> file system interface.</p>

<p>On Fedora, the <code>systemd-binfmt</code> service is responsible for the interpreter registration. It reads a set of configuration files from the <code>/usr/lib/binfmt.d</code> directory and performs the necessary writes to the sysfs. In the context of the above question, installation of the <code>qemu</code> emulator suite will place the corresponding registration files in this directory. In the case of the ARM architecture, this file is called <code>qemu-arm</code> and has the following content:</p>

<pre><code>enabled
interpreter /usr/bin/qemu-arm
flags: 
offset 0
magic 7f454c4601010100000000000000000002002800
mask ffffffffffffff00fffffffffffffffffeffffff
</code></pre>

<p>This allows to transparently execute statically linked ARM executables on Linux. Thanks to Mark Plotnick for pointing this mechanism out.</p>
