<p>Regarding JUNG, there is no problem, but you would have to implement the following code:</p>

<ol>
<li>A GEF action that calls the layout algorithm.</li>
<li>Transformation of your model to the model used by JUNG.</li>
<li>Reading the results of the layout algorithm from JUNG and changing your model (using commands, of course).</li>
</ol>
