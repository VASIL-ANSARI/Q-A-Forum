<p>No problem with that, a bit like implementing a method that is only called by the system for some version upwards.</p>

<p>At worst you can say that you have generated some code that takes up space somewhere (the "disk" if you can call it that on iOS and probably also the RAM) without being used on the older version(s), but that is minimal.</p>

<p>This all requires that the code is compiled with an SDK that includes the protocol in question - if conformance to the protocol is declared by using the <code>&lt;ProtocolName&gt;</code> construct and including the corresponding header. But that is kind of a given, since it won't compile otherwise.</p>
