<p>Hey I had the same problem and "fixed" it via a workaround.
There is a line (#286 on version 2.0.17):
verticalTrackHeight = paneHeight;</p>

<p>I changed it to :
verticalTrackHeight = paneHeight-2;
Now I have a red line at the bottom, I need black so modified the background colour of the jspVerticalBar class in the css.</p>

<p>Hope this helps, no other functionality seems affected yet...</p>
