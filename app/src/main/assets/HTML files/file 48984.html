<p>This is a threading and / or a multiple context issue. Your entity cache is setup with one context but then you're using it from a different context (which is why the entities have the same name but are different).</p>

<p>It's possible that this is because you're setting up multiple different core data stacks (it looks like it from the code samples). In this case you should factor out all of the core data stack and mapping so creation code into a new class - a data manager. Pass the data manager to each of the view controllers so they can use it to download the content they need.</p>

<p>If it's a threading issue then turning on core data threading exceptions could help you find the cause.</p>

<p>Note that using FRCs in each view controller is fine, but that you should only have one main thread context that you set them all up with.</p>
