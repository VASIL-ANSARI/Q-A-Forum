<p>Meta redirect is an awful hack and it breaks the back button. Never use it.</p>

<p>The rest is basically equivalent. <code>window.location</code> is most common.</p>

<p>The fastest way may be not to redirect from JS, but to use <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> (with a click handler if you need to perform some operation before navigation), which e.g. enables browsers to prefetch DNS.</p>
