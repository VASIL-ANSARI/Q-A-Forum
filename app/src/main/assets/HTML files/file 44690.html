<p>You will need to sort millions of values to see the effect of the parallelism, if you ever do, because you are copying arrays all over the place and that puts most of the strain on the system on memory access and garbage collection, not on the sorting.</p>

<p>To properly parallelise sorting you would need to do it in-place - which makes a merge sort very unlikely to be a good candidate because it must create a new array for the target.</p>

<p>If all you are doing is experimenting then use a compare/compute intensive algorithm like bubble-sort.</p>

<p>Note that if this has been set as an assignment then your lecturer is probably expecting you to respond with <em>you can't because merge-sort is a bad candidate for parallelism</em>.</p>
