<p>Increasing dynos will not help here. If it's something the user needs to wait on, you're better off with a worker doing the work and asynchronously updating the user when it's complete. You may not make it faster this way (though maybe you can because your work loads less code?), but you wont run into H12's and the user isn't stuck waiting on a page to render, wondering if it's taking a long time, or broken. </p>
