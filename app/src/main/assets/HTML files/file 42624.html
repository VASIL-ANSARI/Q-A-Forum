<p>You do this by looking for a non-match and using this information:</p>

<pre><code>select (case when count(*) = 0 then 'Yes' else 'No' end)
from tbl2 t2
where not exists (select 1 from tbl1 where t1.site = t2.site);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>count(*)</code> guarantees that exactly one row is returned, containing <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>.</p>
