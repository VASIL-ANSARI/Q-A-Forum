<p>UDP packets already have a checksum to detect corruption. I don't think adding another checksum improves anything. However, you might be interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_tree" rel="nofollow">Hash Trees</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hash trees can be used to protect any kind of data stored, handled and transferred in and between computers. Currently the main use of hash trees is to make sure that data blocks received from other peers in a peer-to-peer network are received undamaged and unaltered, and even to check that the other peers do not lie and send fake blocks.</p>
