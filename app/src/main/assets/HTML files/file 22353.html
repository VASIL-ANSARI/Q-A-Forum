<p>It seems you have the same subquery in all the conditions.</p>

<p>You can use concatenation in this way to save code:</p>

<pre><code>//common subquery
$conditions = array('AND' =&gt; array(
                        'autori LIKE' =&gt; "%$a%", 'editore LIKE' =&gt; "%$e%",
                        'titolo LIKE' =&gt; "%$t%"));

//for example...  
if(...){
    $conditions+=array('AND' =&gt; array('anno &lt;=' =&gt; "$an2"));
}else{
    $conditions+=array('OR' =&gt; array('anno BETWEEN ? AND ?' =&gt; array($an,$an2)));
}

$u = $this-&gt;paginate('CdBiblio',$conditions);
</code></pre>

<p>You can also change the comparisons:</p>

<pre><code>if ($an==''&amp;&amp;$an2=='')
</code></pre>

<p>for</p>

<pre><code>if (!$an &amp;&amp; !$an2)
</code></pre>

<p>Oh and... i would use real words for variables. It is always better to understand what is what rather than creating variables with no sense, such as <code>$a</code>. This makes things easier for future modifications of the code as well as preventing coding mistakes.</p>
