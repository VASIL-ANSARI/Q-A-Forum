<p>Yes, UITableView is subclass of UIScrollView, its contentInset property is the property of UIScrollView, so find it in the part of UIScrollView.</p>

<p>I think the reason that I can set <code>contentInset</code> in Xcode 6 is because the project is created before Xcode 6. So if a project is created in Xcode 6 and above, you can't set <code>contentInset</code>. I think that is because in iOS 7 <code>UIViewController</code> will adjust this property accordingly. Look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIViewController_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIViewController/automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets" rel="nofollow">automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets</a> of <code>UIViewController</code>.</p>
