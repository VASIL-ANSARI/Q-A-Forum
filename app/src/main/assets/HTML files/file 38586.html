<p>You can do this by just inserting values that don't exist.  The query looks like:</p>

<pre><code>insert into table(languageId, languageItem)
    select 3, languageitem
    from table t
    where languageid = 2 and
          not exists (select 1
                      from table t3
                      where t3.languageid = 3 and t3.languageitem = t.langaugeitem
                     );
</code></pre>
