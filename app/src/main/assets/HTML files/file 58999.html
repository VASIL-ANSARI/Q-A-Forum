<p>There's nothing wrong with your gems. The thing is that when you run irb, it's just that. You only run the ruby interactive.
When you run <code>rails console</code> in order to show you the console it needs to go and set it for you with ActiveRecord, rails core, etc. So this (below) is all it does before it's set.</p>
