<p>got it ...phew, your requirements are weird as hell haha but this should give you what you need with a single input 'c'</p>

<p>maybe there are room to improve but at this point you're on your own.</p>

<p>somehow i can't update the fiddle so here it is</p>

<pre><code>select t1.name 
from
  (select s1.name,count(*) as count 
     from marks m1 
     inner join marks m2 using (score)
     inner join students s1 on (s1.id=m2.s_id)
     inner join students s2 on (m1.s_id=s2.id)
     where s2.name='c'
     group by m2.s_id
   ) as t1
JOIN 
   (select count(*) as min_count 
     from marks m 
     inner join students s on (m.s_id=s.id)
     where s.name='c'
   ) as t2
where 
   t1.name != 'c' 
   and t1.count &gt;= t2.min_count
</code></pre>
