<p>The default WCF message pattern is request/response; a client sends a request, and the server responds to it.</p>

<p>There is, however, a duplex message pattern, in which the service interface contract identifies another interface as its callback interface contract; the client must implement this callback interface contract, similar to how the service must implement the service interface contract.</p>

<p>This message pattern should allow your server to arbitrarily send a message to the client without the client having to prompt it to do so.</p>

<p>** Fair warning: in my experience, you potentially still have to deal with the issue of keeping the connection alive, in case you plan to have the server send a message back to the client after a significant period of inactivity.</p>

<p>If keeping the connection open is acceptable to you, then you can implement some kind of keep-alive mechanism.</p>

<p>If keeping the connection open is not acceptable, then I think you'd need to look at a more complex approach that would involve the client periodically checking in with the server in order to give the server an opportunity to send the client any queued up messages that it has for the client.</p>
