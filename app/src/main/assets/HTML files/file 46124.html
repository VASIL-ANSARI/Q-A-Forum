<p>In short, you cannot delete variables defined with <code>var</code>. If you set the variable using <code>window.usno</code> then it can be. See <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/understanding-delete/" rel="nofollow">Understanding delete</a> and the answers to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1596782/how-to-unset-a-javascript-variable">How to unset a Javascript variable?</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Do you really need to delete the variable though? Instead of making a global variable, restrict the scope of your variable to a function so that it will be garbage collected after the scope of the function ends.</p>
