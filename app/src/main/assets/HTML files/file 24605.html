<p>From what I can tell you want to be running a daemon. For instance instead of importing data from interpret, data would run as a standalone daemon which interpret would communicate with over something like a socket.</p>

<p>But at this point you've basically written a database, so why not just translate whatever data you have into some database and just communicate with a database?</p>

<p>Edit: The problem is that you want the huge object to persist between processes, but it can't work like that persay. Every time you call intepret, a new process is spawned which means that there is no access to the object generated by the previous process. That's why daemons (and databases) exist.</p>
