<p>It has to do how the expression tree is build. Look at this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AsQueryable is a method that allow the query to be converted to an
  instance of IQueryable. When you use AsQueryable operator on an
  existing query and apply further transformations such as applying a
  filter or specifying a sort order, those lambda statements are
  converted to Expression trees. Depending on the provider you are
  using,  expression trees will be converted into the domain specific
  syntax and than executed. In the case of Linq to SQL provider, the
  expression tree would be converted to SQL and executed on SQL server.
  However if you use AsQueryable operator on a query that does not
  implement IQueryable and only implements IEnumerable, than any
  transformations that you apply on the query would automatically fall
  back on IEnumerable specification. What this means is by tagging a
  query with AsQueryable you get benefits of both Linq to SQL and Linq
  to object implementation. If your existing query happens to implement
  IQueryable, the query is converted to SQL by the Linq to SQL provider,
  otherwise the query is executed in memory in the form IL code.</p>
