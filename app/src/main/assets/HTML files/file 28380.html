<p>For your example you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 7;
var formula = '+';
var y = 10;
z = eval(x+formula+y);  // 17
document.write(z);
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>eval</code> is a big problem for security, and you really shouldn't use it. If you could give more detail on what you're trying to achieve it might be possible to suggest an alternative.</p>
