<p>First of all, your example is not valid code, or at least it doesn't do what you want it to do. If you have </p>

<pre><code>for i in list1:
</code></pre>

<p>then i is not the index, but an element of list1. So first of all you would compare i and j, not list[i] and list[j].</p>

<p>It should be easier to use list comprehensions></p>

<pre><code>for i in list1:
    a = max([n for n in list2 if n &lt; i])
    b = min([n for n in list2 if n &gt; i])
</code></pre>

<p>You might have to add an if or two to make sure a and b exist, but it should work like this.</p>
