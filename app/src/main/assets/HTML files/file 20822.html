<p>Implementing an interface is much different from extending an abstract class.</p>

<p>Let's suppose that class Animal is an abstract class, and that Dog, Cat, Snake and Shark extend Animal.</p>

<p>The default Animal.move() implementation simply moves them.</p>

<p>But, interfaces allow us to further group-out similar animals, such as RunningAnimal, SwimmingAnimal.</p>

<p>So, if Dog extends Animal implements RunningAnimal, along the inherited move() he will also have to implement his own run(), which might find it's way in the overridden move() inherited from Animal. Does this make sense to you yet or do I need to clarify better / with some code? :)</p>

<p>Interfaces let you group similar functionality of different classes. "Clickable", "Sortable", "Serializable" ... They all encompass the members thru a shared functionality (so a list of clickables is more than a list of buttons) rather than a same purpose.</p>

<p>So, think about it like this</p>

<pre><code>Cat extends Animal implements RunningAnimal, ClimbingAnimal  -- inherits move() has to implement run() and climbTree()
Dog extends Animal implements RunningAnimal  -- inherits move(), has to implement run()
Snake extends Animal                         -- likely overrides inherited move()
Shark extends Animal implements SwimmingAnimal -- likely overrides move(), has to implement swim()
</code></pre>
