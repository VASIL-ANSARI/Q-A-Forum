<p>Partly a wild guess since your code's indentation is totally broken, but if the call to <code>ftp.quit()</code> is really in your for loop, then no wonder that you get such an error on the second iteration. If you really want to disconnect from the server between each iteration, then you obviously have to reconnect at the beginning of the next iteration...</p>
