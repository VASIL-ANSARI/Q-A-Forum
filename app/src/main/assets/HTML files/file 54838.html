<p>When you scan for CBPeripheral objects, the peripheral service UUID is obtained from the advertisement packet. The peripheral is basically saying, "Oh yeah, I have this service UUID!" iOS picks that up and passes the CBPeripheral to you.</p>

<p>But the peripheral might not be synced with what is in the advertisement packet. It's a non-binding agreement that the advertisement packet matches what's actually in the peripheral's service/characteristic hierarchy.</p>

<p>So what this means is that it's possible for a peripheral to advertise one service UUID, but actually contain another (or none).</p>

<p>Check out LightBlue on iOS or nRF Control Panel on Android to see if the service/characteristic hierarchy matches what you think it does. In LightBlue you should be able to view the advertisement data and compare it to the services on the peripheral you're connected to.</p>
