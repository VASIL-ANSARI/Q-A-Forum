<p>The <a href="https://github.com/errorstudio/contentful_model/issues/13#issuecomment-124579004" rel="nofollow">solution</a> was to use the undocumented approach required due to <a href="https://github.com/errorstudio/contentful_rails/commit/23c1f940b1e438ca1cd6f8491762211e61b32df4" rel="nofollow">changes a few months ago</a>.</p>

<p>The contentful_rails gem <em>requires</em> contentful_model (and vice versa), and the only configuration documentation for contentful_model is in that project's README, describing the approach in my question. Configuration made in this way was then completely wiped when contentful_rails was initialized, which expected the configuration to be done in its own initializer.</p>

<p>So I have deleted config/initializers/contentful_model.rb and now my config/intializers/contents_rails.rb file looks like:</p>

<pre><code>ContentfulRails.configure do |config|
  config.authenticate_webhooks = true # false here would allow the webhooks to process without basic auth
  config.webhooks_username     = ENV['CONTENTFUL_WEBHOOK_USERNAME']
  config.webhooks_password     = ENV['CONTENTFUL_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD']

  config.access_token          = ENV['CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN']
  config.preview_access_token  = ENV['CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN']
  config.space                 = ENV['CONTENTFUL_SPACE']
  config.contentful_options    = {
    #extra options to send to the Contentful::Client
  }
end
</code></pre>

<p>Of note is that config.options is no longer a thing; it's config.contentful_options.</p>
