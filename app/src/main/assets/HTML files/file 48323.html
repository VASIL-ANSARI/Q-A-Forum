<p>I'm sorry, but this is way too much code. </p>

<p>Not only for this question, but if you mentioned in your previous question that you only needed to store 10 or 11 alphanumeric characters in 4 integers of 32 bits, or shortly, 16 bytes, you wouldn't have needed the encoding into 6 bytes altogether, as 11 &lt; 16.</p>

<p>Just store the ASCII values of the characters in a byte array and convert that to 4 integers. </p>

<p>The most significant bit of an integer is the sign bit, which makes the integer negative when set (1). Using the ASCII value of the characters, which all will be &lt; 127, this bit, bearing the value of 128, will never be set. </p>
