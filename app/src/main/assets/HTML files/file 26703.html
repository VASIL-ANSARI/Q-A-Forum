<p>The error message is coming from <code>main.h</code> while it's included in <code>my_struct.h</code>, before <code>my_structure</code> is defined. You should rethink your include paths since <code>main.h</code> and <code>my_struct.h</code> include each other.</p>

<p>You probably want your <code>main.h</code> file to just include <code>my_struct.h</code>, and not have <code>my_struct.h</code> to include anything. You're essentially instructing your C compiler to have an infinite co-include loop.</p>
