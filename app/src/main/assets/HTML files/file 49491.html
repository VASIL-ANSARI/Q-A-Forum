<p>Well I'm going to suppose that is not your real EF model because your columns and relationships weren't represented using properties, but I'm going to suppose you have those navigation properties.</p>

<p>If you want to find the <code>Rims</code> value and the <code>Tires</code> value of all the cars that belong to an specific <code>Garage</code>, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var garageId=1;
var query=from car in context.Cars
          where car.GarageId==garageId
          select new {
                        CarTiresValue= car.Wheels.SelectMany(w=&gt;w.Tires).Sum(t=&gt;t.Value),
                        CarRimsValue=car.Wheels.SelectMany(w=&gt;w.Rims).Sum(r=&gt;r.Value)
                     };
</code></pre>
