<p>Google AJAX Search has no such limit of 1000. Yahoo Search does. Google AJAX Search limits you to getting 64 results per search but otherwise has no limit.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/documentation/reference.html#_class_GwebSearch" rel="nofollow">Google AJAX Search API - Class Reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The maximum number of results
  pages is based on the type of
  searcher. Local search supports 4
  pages (or a maximum of 32 total
  results) and the other searchers
  (Blog, Book, Image, News, Patent,
  Video, and Web) support 8 pages (for a
  maximum total of 64 results).</p>
