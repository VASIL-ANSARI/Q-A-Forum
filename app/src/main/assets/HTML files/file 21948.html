<p>I think the fastest way of going around this problem is through binary buffered file input.</p>

<p>I am not very familiar In C#, but you could look into some buffering techniques for going to a particular part of file, and doing buffered input from that part.</p>

<p>You can also resort to using C++ with Windows API for native buffering techniques, or find libraries which have fast buffering methods.</p>

<p>I can't suggest much else, hopefully this helps.</p>
