<p>Yes, you can also say:</p>

<pre><code>puts "Mintues: #{start}"
</code></pre>

<p>It's one of many nice Ruby choices. :) In this case, it doesn't make much difference.</p>

<p>Regarding the loop:</p>

<pre><code>start.downto(1) { |i| sleep 60 }
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, this is counting minutes down to <code>1</code> and each time is sleeping 60 seconds. So it will sleep for <code>start</code> minutes. If <code>start</code> isn't too large, you could just use <code>sleep 60*start</code>.</p>
