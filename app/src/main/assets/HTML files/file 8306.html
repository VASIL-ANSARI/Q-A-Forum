<p>As far as I understand and as far as my iPhone/iPod running iOS 5 and iOS 4.3 respectively work, it's all quite automatic. An app I started for 4.0 and have "updated" to work with Xcode for iOS 5.0 never throws any sort of warning my way about releasing and retaining, even though it's all over every dealloc, etc. However, some of the same code I inserted (copied the file) into a new project <strong>created</strong> with Xcode for iOS 5 has many, many warnings. So it appears you don't have to remove all those calls, and no, it somehow adapts it automatically for older versions. Profiling my iPod, I see no memory leaks or other signs of failing deallocs/releasing. Does this help?</p>
