<p>If you are getting a 500 error, that means the request is stuck at the web server, and has not yet hit the siebel server behind it. If the error is due to something missing in the xml, you will get a "SBL-" error code in the response. Until you get that, and are getting 500 errors, the request SOAP has not yet hit the siebel server.</p>

<p>I don't know python, but my suggestion would be to capture the RAW message going from your python script and compare that to the RAW message in SOAP-UI. Specially check the SOAPAction string, it should have a forward slash (/) and a colon (:). "Content-Type", "text/xml"</p>

<p>For further debugging, you will have to check the webserver logs to see how the message arrives there.</p>
