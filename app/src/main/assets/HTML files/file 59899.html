<p>Looks like you are working on some geofancing or gps tracking application
and you want to keep running your location tracking or some process even he is not on map activity
and also you want to store your data at temporary location</p>

<p>I think you should use android services that starts with your first activity to track your location and store it
some where. so when you reach to your map activity you can have your all location data at a time.</p>

<p>i will sugest to use SQLITE to store your location insted of shared preferences
you can drop table when you dont need that location data any more</p>
