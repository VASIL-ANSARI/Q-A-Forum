<p>You need to escape HTML, to sanitize your data before it hits your database. </p>

<p>From the Ruby Docs:<br>
    <code>CGI::escapeHTML('Usage: foo "bar" &lt;baz&gt;')</code><br>
    <code># =&gt; "Usage: foo &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot; &amp;lt;baz&amp;gt;"</code></p>

<p>If you didn't use <code>escapeHTML</code> someone could put a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in there and potentially write some harmful code. Maybe it's a social network site and people are embedding some malware in their comment and then everyone that visits for page has a bad time as well as you. </p>

<p>As far as the test goes, I think that's the reason, because you can control the test. But at the same time I really don't see why wouldn't add <code>escapeHTML</code> to the test as well, but maybe it's just not required where you are studying.</p>
