<p>The problem is from the fact you're recreating the month list when you change the year which changes the day list. You could re-write the whole thing to not do this or you could store the currently selected values before you recreate the list and select it again after the list has been created. </p>

<p>I would say though that all years have the same number of months so it's not really useful to dynamically generate it. The only list you're actually interested in changing is the day list so you can write it so that changing the year or month selection just alters the available days (saving the previously selected value and reselecting it if it's valid if you like)</p>
