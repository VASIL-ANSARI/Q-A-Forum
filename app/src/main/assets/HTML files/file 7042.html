<p>Unless you manually keep count in a variable you won't be able to easily determine this. As the loop is iterating across your collection it just uses the enumerator to grab the next element in the collection tell there are no more elements at which point it exits.</p>

<p>To manually keep a count you would just do:</p>

<pre><code>int count = 0;
List&lt;SomeObject&gt; someObjects = ReturnListWithThousandsOfObjects();

foreach(SomeObject someobject in someObjects)
{
     count++;
     DoSomething.With(someObject);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now at any point you can pause execution and see which iteration you are on</p>
