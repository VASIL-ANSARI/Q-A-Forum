<p>I think you can add the "focus: true" option for the spec you want to run, something like</p>

<pre><code>it 'does something', focus: true do
  //your spec
end
</code></pre>

<p>then you save the file and guard runs only that focused test</p>

<p>when you are finished you just remove "focus: true"</p>
