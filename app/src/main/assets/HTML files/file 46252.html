<p>You <strong>cannot store data locally securely</strong>. As soon as you are able to decrypt it an attacker can as well. That goes for EVERY encryption technique. No matter what you try.</p>

<p>You have to store the data or a different decryption key for each data point on a server and retrieve it one by one every time. You additionally have to make sure that the user does not just send 100s of requests and retrieves all data by hand. </p>

<p>Note that storing just one key on a server will result in the exact same thing as writing it hardcoded in the app. And not limiting the requests will just cause the attacker to need a little more time than just looking at an already decrypted local db.</p>

<p>Of course you can obfuscate it to make it seem like it has some good encryption behind it - but if someone <strong>WANTS</strong> to get the data, he will be able to.</p>

<p>Regarding the code in an ipa: you will not be able to see the original code but you will be able to see <em>some</em> code that produces the same output as the original code. As long as the device can produce the valid key, an attacker can as well.</p>

<p>I do not know if there is a huge community out there that is looking through random apps to steal some of its internal questions / answers / data, I doubt it.</p>

<p>You just have to make the product sooooo good that no competing product with the same data has any chance against it. The data itself can always be "stolen".</p>
