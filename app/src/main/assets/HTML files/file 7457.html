<p>it's happening due to the <strong>size of images</strong> that you download from web to show in your UITableView cells.</p>

<p>There is one and only one solution of crash to <strong>reduce the size of images as much as possible</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>@damian:</strong> As per your calculation :</p>

<p>1 image  = 2.4 mb then 10 images = 24 mb :
i think, After having 10 such images in your application the next image with size <strong>2.4 mb</strong> is enough to trigger a memory warning of level 2 .</p>
