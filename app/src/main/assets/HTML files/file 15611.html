<p>It's not entirely clear what you're trying to do, which is why you've got so many answers with different approaches. If you're trying to turn the "collection of employees" into a "collection of IDs" then you want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var ids = emp.Select(x =&gt; x.Id);
</code></pre>

<p>Or more directly:</p>

<pre><code>var ids = db.Employees.Select(x =&gt; x.Id);
</code></pre>

<p>(Optionally with <code>ToList</code> at the end of each of these.)</p>

<p>I would strongly advise you to learn LINQ (and the somewhat-related languages features such as <code>var</code>) thoroughly, from scratch, with the help of a good book or tutorial. Learning bits piecemeal by just finding samples which do something a bit like what you want is not a good approach, IMO.</p>
