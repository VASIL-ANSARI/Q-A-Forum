<p>I did something similar to this a couple of yrs. ago. But in my case the server and the PC where in the same lan. Is your PoS within the lan? If so, I'll explain it to you.</p>

<p>In the mean time, if you have the "little app" covered you can take a look at the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/print/PrintService.html" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/print/PrintService.html</a></p>

<p>The print service have a method to discover the printers registered within machine it is running on. So after you receive the message from the server on your app you just have to do something similar to the code shown in the link above:</p>

<p>Taked from, <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/print/PrintService.html" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/print/PrintService.html</a></p>

<pre><code>DocFlavor flavor = DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.POSTSCRIPT;
PrintRequestAttributeSet aset = new HashPrintRequestHashAttributeSet();
aset.add(MediaSizeName.ISO_A4);
PrintService[] pservices =
             PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices(flavor, aset);
if (pservices.length &gt; 0) {
   DocPrintJob pj = pservices[0].createPrintJob();
   // InputStreamDoc is an implementation of the Doc interface //
   Doc doc = new InputStreamDoc("test.ps", flavor);
   try {
         pj.print(doc, aset);
    } catch (PrintException e) { 
    }
}
</code></pre>
