<p>From your declaration of <code>MsgProc</code> it seems that it's a regular member function, which means it takes a "hidden" <code>this</code> pointer. That makes it incompatible with WNDPROC and that's why the compiler complains. </p>

<p>Trying marking it as <code>static</code>. Of course, this means that you cannot access non-static members of the class easily - you will need to stash a copy of the <code>this</code> pointer of the instance you want somewhere to do that.</p>

<p>You may also need <code>CALLBACK</code> instead of <code>WINAPI</code> but I don't have easy access to a compiler to verify this at this time.</p>
