<p>This is what I will suggest that on the button click callback function, you can perform following steps to send data to server:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prepare an XML string having name-value / id-value pair of your form
controls (eg "&lt;field id='opis_naziv' value=" +
$('#opis_naziv').val() + "/&gt;").</p></li>
<li><p>Store the XML string in a hidden control (textbox, etc.) with
    runat="server" attribute</p></li>
<li><p>Trigger click of button control with runat="server" attribute which will pass the control to server click event of the button where you can access the XML string from above control, parse it and use the values.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I will personally recommend calling a WebMethod on click of your button to perform server side operation.</p>
