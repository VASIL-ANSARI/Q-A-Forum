<p>The header command is executed by the browser rather than the server, so using header relies on the users browser being complicit with your wishes.</p>

<p>When the page is sent to the browser, the content following the header directive is also sent, so the user has access to the remaining content.</p>

<p>With php, you can force the script to end using the exit (or die) function. So the following is good practice:</p>

<pre><code>if (isLoggedIn() == false) {
    header('Location: login.php');
    exit;
}
</code></pre>
