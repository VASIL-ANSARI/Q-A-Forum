<p>I had this same issue in some different code I was working on last year, though that was with <code>POST</code> not <code>GET</code>.  Unfortunately I didn't find a way around it, so instead I resorted to using <code>WebRequest</code> directly.  here's a snippet from the fix:</p>

<pre><code>// HttpWebRequest is used here instead of HttpClient as there is no support
// in HttpClient to not buffer uploaded streams, which for our purposes
// causes an OutOfMemoryException to occur.
HttpWebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(ServiceUri.ToString() + requestUri) as HttpWebRequest;
request.ContentLength = content.Length;
request.ContentType = "application/octet-stream";
request.Method = "POST";

request.AllowWriteStreamBuffering = false;  // Prevents OutOfMemoryException
</code></pre>

<p>I think your fix is to somehow disable buffering when downloading using <code>HttpClient</code>.</p>
