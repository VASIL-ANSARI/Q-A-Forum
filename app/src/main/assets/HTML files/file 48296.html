<p>To determine the best score per session, all you need to do is first save the count from the session and compare with the previous session.</p>

<p>So after your do..while.. it would look something like</p>

<pre><code>int lowestScore = 6;// or max number of guesses

...

while(play == true)
{
    ...

    do...while...
    if(count &lt; lowestScore)
    {
         lowestScore = count;
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will compare the lowestScore with the current score evertime the user starts a new session.
Also, note the double equal sign in the while statement.</p>
