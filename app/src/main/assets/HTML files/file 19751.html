<p>Facebook uses the so called 'GraphRank' to determine whether to show or not to show a published action or aggregation on the user's timeline.</p>

<p>The calculation goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GraphRank = affinity * weight * interactions * time</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>affinity (score): this is the relationship between the viewing user and the creator of the action.</p></li>
<li><p>weight: if two users interact frequently with each other, the respective actions in the open graph are rated higher than for users who do not have the same interest and are not in close contact on Facebook.</p></li>
<li><p>interactions: how often does the user interact with the application and how do friends react to the activities in the social channels (if nobody clicks on the published actions it's bad for the GraphRank).</p></li>
<li><p>time: if an app is used irregularly or only once, actions will receive less attention in the long run and will be presented less prominently on the timeline.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to see your published action on your timeline just try to interact intensively with your app i.e. by publishing more stories (and like those with some test users).</p>
