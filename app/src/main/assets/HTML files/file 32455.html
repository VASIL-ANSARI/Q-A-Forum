<p>I've exracted the data you want with:</p>

<pre><code>var val = (from adresse in XmlFile.Elements("Adresse")
   let split = adresse.Value.Split(new[] { ' ' })
   let zip = split[split.Length - 2]
   let city = split[split.Length - 1]
   let street = string.Join(" ", split.Except(new[] { zip, city }))
   select new
   {
      Street = street,
      ZIP = zip,
      City = city
   }).FirstOrDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>But you have to be carefully. This code doesn't do any verification of the data.</p>
