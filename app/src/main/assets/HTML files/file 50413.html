<p>The main benefit would be:  We already have a bunch of code that uses PrimaryID, including ORM code that maps PrimaryID as the primary key column.  The only other reason I can see to keep PrimaryID is for human readability.</p>

<p>Also, I should let you know that GUID doesn't always protect you from data scraping.  You could very well be using a database that generates GUIDs in a predictable pattern (sequential or otherwise).  </p>
