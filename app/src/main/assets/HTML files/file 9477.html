<p>The source for the runtime is available, btw, if you really want to go deep.</p>

<p>In short;  method names -- their selectors -- are stored as C strings in the mach-o of the binary.   I.e. if you have a method <code>-(void)foo:(int)a bar:(int)b;</code>, there will be a selector <code>foo:bar:</code> string in the mach-o.</p>

<p>Type encoding information is also stored in a different segment of the mach-o file.  That type information -- for which there is API in the runtime to retrieve it -- describes the type of the return value and arguments to the method.  </p>

<p>Note that the type information is incomplete.  Note also that using the type information to figure out how to generically encode/decode the arguments to and return value from a method is a downright pain.</p>
