<p>If casting like you were contemplating works, you probably have to go with that.  The query you're using is just building a "WHERE cost = number" and if the database isn't able to compare properly with the number as passed, you need to pass it differently.  It looks like it's the database stopping you and not anything within Rails necessarily.</p>

<p>If you just don't like casting within your query, you could always do it in the model:</p>

<pre><code>def cost_with_incumbent_precision
  BigDecimal.new(cost.to_s, 18)
end
</code></pre>
