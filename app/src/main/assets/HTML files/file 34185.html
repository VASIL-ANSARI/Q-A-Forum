<p>Finally ended up reading python's source code. There is no way to do that. The function responsible to setup the trace call is <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ceval.c#L3875" rel="nofollow">call_exc_trace</a>, which resets the frame data associated with exceptions and, after the user tracing function ends, restores the old values.</p>

<p>This is a pity, and also explains why PDB has no features like reseting exceptions or returning immediately a value (PDB's <code>return</code> command actually <em>continues</em> until the end of the function).</p>
