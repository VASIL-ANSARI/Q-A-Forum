<p>View pages have access to the MVC HttpContext through <code>ViewContext.HttpContext</code>, which is an <code>HttpContextBase</code>.</p>

<p>The seemingly dual access is just due to the way ASP.Net works.  When you look at <code>Request.HttpContext</code>, this is the ASP.Net pipeline's injection of the original <code>HttpContext</code>.  This is accessible in any HttpHandler, whether it's an MVC controller or view, or a WebForms page or ashx. </p>
