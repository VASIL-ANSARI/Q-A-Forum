<p>The short answer is that what you are asking basically can't be done with pure CSS / HTML. (at least without tables) You'd need Javascript that would read #child's width/height and then do the calculation you want to do (I don't know) and set a new height/width to #parent.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you mean that you want #child's height/width to change according to its content, of course this is native CSS, just set it's height/width to auto and then start adding text inside it you'll see it will start growing to fit your content inside. </p>

<p>As the #child is positioned absolute, then it is taken OUT of the normal flow of the document, therefore it will not affect the #parent.</p>
