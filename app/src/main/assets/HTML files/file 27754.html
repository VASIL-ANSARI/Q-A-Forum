<p>I get the same(ish) coordinates from the Geocoding API as I do from the map: <a href="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1249%20Cedar%20Rd.%20101%20Chesapeake%20VA%2023322&amp;sensor=false" rel="nofollow">http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=1249%20Cedar%20Rd.%20101%20Chesapeake%20VA%2023322&amp;sensor=false</a> gives</p>

<pre><code>  "lat" : 36.7174039802915,
  "lng" : -76.2835059197085
</code></pre>

<p>Which match (with very small differences) in what I get when I right click on the marker and choose <strong>What's here</strong> which is possibly what you mean by geocoding from the map? :</p>

<pre><code>   36.717567,
   -76.283689
</code></pre>

<p>This puts the point right beside the location selected by Google maps. This shows that Google's internal look-up is using slightly different (better?) data then the Geocoding API but all three points show the same address. Am I missing something in how you are getting the incorrect address?</p>
