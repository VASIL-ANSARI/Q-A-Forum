<p>You need to show us how you're creating the block and assigning it to userData to be sure, but my guess is you're not copying the block and it's going out of scope, like this:</p>

<pre><code>objectLoader.userData = ^{ ... };
</code></pre>

<p>A blocks are created on the stack.  That means when the compound statement (e.g. function) enclosing it ends, the block is no longer valid.  If you want the block to survive, you need to copy it to the heap:</p>

<pre><code>objectLoader.userData = [^{ ... } copy];
</code></pre>
