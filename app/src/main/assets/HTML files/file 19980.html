<p>I don't think the Intent can be null (beside when a service is restarted by the Android OS). When your or another app start your service it always requires a Intent to do so, so getting a call to the onStartCommand without a Intent can only be from something within Android. </p>

<p>Starting a service (from a application) is impossible without Intent.</p>
