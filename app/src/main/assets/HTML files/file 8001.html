<p>I'm unsure this is your problem, but it looks like you have to do something special when dealing with endpoint 0.  From the javadocs of <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/usb/UsbRequest.html" rel="nofollow">UsbRequest</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requests on endpoint zero are not supported by this class; use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/usb/UsbDeviceConnection.html#controlTransfer%28int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20byte%5B%5D,%20int,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">controlTransfer(int, int, int, int, byte[], int, int)</a> for endpoint zero requests instead.</p>
