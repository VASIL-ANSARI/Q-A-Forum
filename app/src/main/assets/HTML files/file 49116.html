<p>Are you sure you don't get an error when using <code>WHERE</code> before <code>JOIN</code>?</p>

<p>It should work like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT people.*
FROM people
JOIN entries ON entries.personid = people.personid
WHERE entries.userid={$_SESSION['userid']}
ORDER BY entries.altordering
</code></pre>

<p>I assume <code>entries.personid</code> will always have a matching person in <code>people</code>, so you should use an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. You would use <code>FROM entries LEFT JOIN people</code> if you wanted to retrieve <code>altordering</code> even for non-existing <code>people</code>.</p>
