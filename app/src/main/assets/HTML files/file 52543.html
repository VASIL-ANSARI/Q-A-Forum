<p>There's a note in the Manage Worksheets page of the documentation that states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: User access levels are set in the GUI. If a user owns a given worksheet or is listed as an editor, then they have read/write access; if they're listed only as a viewer, then they have read-only access. In addition, if the worksheet is published then even unauthenticated users and users not listed as viewers have read access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure that you (or who is authenticated in your application) is set as an editor for you to have write access as well.</p>
