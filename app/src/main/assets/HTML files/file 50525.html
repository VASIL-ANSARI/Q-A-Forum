  <p>How does the printf statement (or the CString) know to grab/return the LPCSTR operator and thus get a pointer to the string, and not a pointer to the object?</p>

<p>It doesn't. <code>printf</code> isn't typesafe. It will blindly pretend that <code>name</code> is a C string and not a C++ class object. This is undefined behaviour, allowing the program to do whatever it wants, including work as expected. </p>

<p>To get this to work properly, you either have to cast the object explicitly or use something that is typesafe, unlike <code>printf</code>.</p>

<p>If the call seems to work properly, there's a chance that <code>CString</code>'s first or only data member is a C string of the appropriate type whose address is the same as the object's (similar to <a href="http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/1a555809b4bab4d6" rel="nofollow">this example</a>). However, this behaviour should never be relied upon.</p>
