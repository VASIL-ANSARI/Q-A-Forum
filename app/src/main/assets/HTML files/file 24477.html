<p>For that you need something like draggable and snap to that particualar area where the drag should stop.</p>

<p>You can refer to <a href="http://jqueryui.com/draggable/" rel="nofollow">Jquery UI</a> for it. </p>

<p>To suit your needs perfectly, here is the <a href="http://www.elated.com/res/File/articles/development/javascript/jquery/drag-and-drop-with-jquery-your-essential-guide/card-game.html" rel="nofollow">actual drag and drop to the snap object</a></p>

<p>Hope this helps now.</p>
