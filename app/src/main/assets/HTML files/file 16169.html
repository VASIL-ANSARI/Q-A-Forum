<p>Because <code>class</code> block only introduces a new context for execution of code. Ruby is Ruby, not C++ - don't treat it as such. If we want to execute some code during class definition, why do you think we shouldn't be able to? You can execute code just fine inside it - and during this, <code>self</code> will point at the <code>Class</code> object that represents your class, instead of any instance of its class. This allows you great flexibility and is one of the big things in what makes Ruby monkey-patchable (which is a plus from the perspective of Rubyists, even though many others frown at the practice).</p>
