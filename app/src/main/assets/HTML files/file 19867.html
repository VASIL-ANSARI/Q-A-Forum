<p>I think you need to instantiate the view before you call render -</p>

<pre><code>home: function() {
    var viewInstance = new homeView();
    console.log('home');
    viewInstance.render();
}
</code></pre>

<p>A lot of Backbone code samples don't help this confusion by not using capital letters to indicate things that should be instantiated (ie called with 'new'), and vice versa.</p>
