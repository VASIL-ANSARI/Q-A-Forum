<p>As skandigraun said in his comment there are other ways to find elements using Selenium. I have often had to use a CSS selector as well as xpath selectors.</p>

<p>For finding the CSS or xpath you need for the selector I usually use chrome developer tools or firebug to right click -> "Inspect element" followed by a right click on the desired element -> "Copy CSS path" or "Copy XPath"</p>

<pre><code>driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("#pubCarousel li a img")).click();
</code></pre>

<p>or for XPath</p>

<pre><code>driver.findElement(By.xpath("//*[@id=\"pubCarousel\"]/li/a/img")).click();
</code></pre>

<p>I am unfortunately away from my computer so I can't test them out right now. The XPath one should work for you, but I'm not sure if the CSS one will without a little tweaking.</p>
