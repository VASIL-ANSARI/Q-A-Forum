<p>Well, I didn't think important to mention that i was working with unity, and it was the culprit.</p>

<p>Unity modifies some settings, so it's important to do this when you load your viewcontroller:</p>

<pre><code>[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance]
 setCategory: AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord
 error: &amp;setCategoryError];
if (setCategoryError) {
    NSLog([setCategoryError description]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise a perfectly written audiorecorder won't work correctly. And that was it..problem solved !</p>

<p>This bug was a PAIN to detect, I hope this message helps anyone else in the same predicament.</p>
