<p>What tells the browser to either render the HTTP response body as an HTML page or try to open the result as an attachment is the <code>Content-Disposition</code> header of the response.</p>

<p>Try setting this header in the response:</p>

<pre><code>headers.set("Content-Disposition", "attachment");
</code></pre>

<p>With this the browser will be informed that the body of the response is an attachment, and will treat it as such, proposing to open it with the embedded PDF reader.</p>
