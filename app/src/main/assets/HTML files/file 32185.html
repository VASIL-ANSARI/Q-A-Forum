<p>You should be able to just add <code>text-align: center</code> to your <code>ul</code>.</p>

<pre><code>#navigation ul{
    text-align: center;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will center all the <code>li</code> elements, as well as the text inside them. If you don't want the text to center you could add a <code>text-align: left</code> to the <code>li</code> elements.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> But like others have said, this should be an easy search or trial and error for you. Lots of ways to do it too.</p>
