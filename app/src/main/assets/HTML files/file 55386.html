<p>The problem is, that you have a maximal recursion depth. If you want to avoid that, you can rewrite the code without recursion. This can be done using a simple loop. It would look something like this (This code is completely untested):</p>

<pre><code>static BigInteger fact(BigInteger n){
    BigInteger f = BigInteger.ONE;
    while(n.compareTo(BigInteger.ONE) &gt; 0) {
        f = f.multiply(n);
        n = n.subtract(BigInteger.ONE);
    }
    return f;
}
</code></pre>
