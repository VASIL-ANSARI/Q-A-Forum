<p><a href="http://watij.com/" rel="nofollow">Watij</a> is a Java-based web testing framework that will drive a web browser. Although it's nominally for testing, it can do what you want. You can intelligently search for button/controls to drive, and because it's controlling the browser, all the client side functionality (scripts etc.) will be triggered correctly.</p>
