<p>I finally found a trace of errors in the tomcat log localhost.YYYY-MM-DD.log. As it turns out, I needed to add commons-pool:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;commons-pool&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;commons-pool&lt;/artifactId&gt;
   &lt;version&gt;1.6&lt;/version&gt;
   &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which commons-dbcp is dependent upon. Installing this with Maven did away with the missing class exception I was getting.</p>

<p>My next problem was that I had mistakenly defined my datasource bean in the list of authenticationHandlers in deployerConfigContext.xml, which led to a type conversion exception. Moving the bean out of the list tag did the trick.</p>
