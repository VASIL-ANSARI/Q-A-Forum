<p>I believe your issue is that since div tags are block elements, they are still taking up space in the parent div. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>var element = document.getElementById("div_" + itemid); 
element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
</code></pre>

<p>Also, this action is a little cleaner in jquery. You may want to look into it for further DOM operations.</p>
