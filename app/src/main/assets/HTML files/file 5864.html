<p>You could incorporate the already existing transform to preserve the current size respectively aspect ratio:</p>

<pre><code>imgView1.transform = CGAffineTransformConcat(trans, imgView1.transform);
</code></pre>

<p>Also the documentation of the UIView class says that the frame property is undefined if the transform is not the identity transform, so you must not use it after you applied a rotation.</p>
