<p>BulkWriteAsync under the cover uses InsertManyAsync for insert operations.  The only difference is BulkWriteAsync allows you to perform different operations (insert, update, delete) under one roof. However if you are debating between BulkWriteAsync and InsertManyAsync for inserting bunch of documents, it's recommended to use InsertManyAsync directly. </p>
