<p>Not sure if you still need the answer to this question.  But will post the solution I found as I experienced the same problem.</p>

<p>Using your code above the only thing you are missing is to encode your csv string returned by your toCsv function.  This would look like this in your code above:</p>

<pre><code>function toCsv(arr){
    return arr.reduce(function(csvString, row){
        csvString += row.join(',') ;
    csvString += "\r\n";  //";";//"\n";
        return encodeURIComponent(csvString);
    }, '');
}

function flowDataCsv(){
    document.location = 'data:Application/octet-stream,' + toCsv(flowDataGrid);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully this helps anyone who comes across this issue again in the future!</p>
