<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>$.trim($(".class li").text());
</code></pre>

<p>The reason that it doesn't worked in your case is because the trim method you were calling was wasn't <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.trim/">jquery.trim</a> method. It is a method you were calling on a object instance (<code>.text()</code> returns a string). So some browsers have this method built-in while IE doesn't.</p>
