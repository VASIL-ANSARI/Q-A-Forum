<p>use <code>phpinfo()</code> and check the <code>session.*</code> settings.</p>

<p>Maybe the informations is forced to be stored in cookies and your browser do not accept cookies, something like that.</p>

<p>Check that first and come back with the results.</p>

<p>You can also do aÂ <code>print\_r($\_SESSION);</code> to have a dump of this variable and see the content....</p>

<p>Regarding your <code>phpinfoI()</code>, does the <code>session.save_path</code> is a valid one? Does your webserver has write access to this directory?</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
