  <p>How the implementation manages to work using this integer value to differentiate between a communication instance and the other?</p>

<p>The details depend on the implementation, but it's safe to assume that the operating system maps the file handle to the appropriate chunk of data. Exactly what the integer <em>means</em> doesn't matter -- it could be an index into an array, a number chosen at random and used as an identifier, or something else. All that matters in your code is that the number represents a specific file or socket.</p>

<p>The integer that's returned by <code>socket()</code> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor" rel="nofollow">file descriptor</a>, i.e. a value that refers to a specific <code>FILE</code> data structure. It's often said of Unix that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file" rel="nofollow">"everything is a file"</a> because the file system is used as an interface to many resources including disk-based files, pipes, devices like printers and terminals, and network connections. Functions that create new file handles, such as <code>open()</code>, <code>accept()</code>, <code>pipe()</code>, and <code>socket()</code>, are expected to return the associated file descriptor.</p>
