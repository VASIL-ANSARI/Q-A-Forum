<p>If you start a regular game, do you expect to find scrollbars for the whole level at the bottom and the side of your screen ? Or do you expect you can navigate (using your mouse/arrows/...) through the whole level.</p>

<p>In case of the first, be my guest and create a gigantic <code>JPanel</code> and put it in a <code>JScrollPane</code> but I strongly suggest to go for option 2.</p>

<p>For option 2 I outlined a possible approach in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8672598/what-is-the-best-way-to-load-and-cache-images-in-java/8672945#8672945">another related SO question</a>. That might be worth a look</p>
