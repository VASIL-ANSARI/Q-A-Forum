<p>JACK currently does not support annotation processing (used to generate proxies in Realm), but it also doesn't generate <em>class</em> files which Realm uses with Javassist (bytecode manipulation) through the Realm-Transformer which turns all field access into proxy method calls.</p>

<p>It's for the sake of removing mandatory getter/setters, actually. But with that update, also came the ability to use interfaces on Realm Objects, so it's a kinda important step.</p>
