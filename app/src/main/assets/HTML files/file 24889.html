<p>It seems the global list you are using is not thread safe. cause you say "list object will hold data that comes form several other client end" in your last comment. so if they all try to modify the list at the same time when you are trying to delete an item form the list it gonna crash. so for thread safety just modify your global list as private and made 2 public method. one for to add item to the list and another for to remove item from the list. of course don't forget to lock the global list that is SessionDataList.</p>

<p>so when you need to add or remove the item to or form list just use below specified two public method.</p>

<p>code snippets is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>private static SessionDatalist&lt;SessionData&gt; SessionDataList=new SessionDatalist&lt;SessionData&gt;();

public addSessionData()
{
  lock(SessionDataList)
  {

   //add list item here to the SessionDataList
  }
}

public removeSessionData()
{
  lock(SessionDataList)
  {

     //remove item from SessionDataList
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this help.</p>
