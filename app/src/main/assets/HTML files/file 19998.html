<p>Given your needs, and because I've used it successfully in the past I'd suggest using LABjs - <a href="http://labjs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://labjs.com/</a></p>

<p>As mentioned, there are loads of script loaders to choose from - LABjs is focused on performance more than anything and doesn't include many of the extra features that others such as requirejs (AMD loader), YepNope (feature detection-based conditional loader) have. If all you need is to load your scripts asynchronously and have control over the execution order, LABjs is a very small script that handles this well.</p>

<p>Using LABjs, you'd do the following to replicate your code above:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="js/libs/LAB.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$LAB
.script('http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js').wait()
.script('http://yourjavascript.com/301810712121/slidemenu_horiz.js')
.wait(function () {
    // Check jQuery has loaded (could do this for the slider as well)
    if (window.jQuery) {
        // Do something with your slider
    }
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the <code>.wait()</code> function ensures that jQuery has executed before slidemenu_horiz.js - the last <code>.wait()</code> is passed an anonymous function as a callback - within this you can test that everything has loaded and then do your initialisations.</p>

<p>It's worth checking out all the options as far a script loaders go. There really are loads out there and each has a different feature set that you may find addresses your problem better.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Added script reference to LABjs in code example for clarity</p>
