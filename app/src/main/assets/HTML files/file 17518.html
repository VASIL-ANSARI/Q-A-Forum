<p>To be able to automatically re-load a class you'll need to know how that class came to be constructed. Given how dynamic Ruby is, this is only easy in the most trivial of cases. It is common enough to have a class that's extended and altered significantly before it ends up in its final form. Determining the steps involved to recreate a class is not easy, and tracking these could be a severe performance drag.</p>

<p>A lot of this boils down to the fact that a Class is a collection of methods, instance variables, class variables, constants, and other modules and classes. Unlike more statically typed languages like C++, these can and will be declared at any time, in any place, for any reason. The state of the class is not something that can simply be re-generated.</p>

<p>The way Rails goes about reloading classes is to perform a number of tricks to ensure the class in question can be disposed of and reloaded. Rails also has to provide several hooks to notify extensions that a class is being reloaded so they can re-do their operations on it once it's been rebuilt otherwise many extensions would load only once.</p>

<p>In short, what seems superficially trivial turns out to be very tricky indeed.</p>
