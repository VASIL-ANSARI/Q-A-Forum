<p>It's a (simple) recursive pattern.</p>

<p>The inner function either:</p>

<ul>
<li>finds that the target has been found, and returns it</li>
<li>or finds that the target has been exceeded, when it returns <code>null</code></li>
<li>otherwise tries to call itself with either <code>(n + 5)</code> or <code>(n * 3)</code>, accumulating the output from the previous stage as it goes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two options are the ones that terminate the recursion.</p>

<p>The <code>||</code> operator is the important part of third case.  It first tries the <code>n + 5</code> solution, but only if that recursive call returns <code>null</code> will the lazy <code>||</code> operator evaluate the <code>n * 3</code> call.</p>

<p>Note however that if <em>both</em> calls fail because <code>n * 3</code> and <code>n + 5</code> both exceed the target value (which they do, for lots of numbers) then the whole function will return <code>null</code>.</p>
