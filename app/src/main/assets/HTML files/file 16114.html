<p>The function expects four <code>string</code>s.  You pass two <code>string</code>s, and then an <code>int</code>, and then a <code>char</code>.  </p>

<p>Adding two <code>char</code>s results in an <code>int</code>.  You can't concatenate chars, it makes no sense as a <code>char</code> represents an <em>individual</em> character, so the result is an <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>The last one is a straight cast to <code>char</code> where a <code>string</code> is expected, that seems obvious enough.</p>
