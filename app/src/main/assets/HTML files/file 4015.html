<p>Okay I figured this one out. I'm answering here so I can hopefully help someone someday, but the problem was a basic oversight on the difference between Has Many Through and Has And Belongs To Many Associations.</p>

<p>You if you want to handle checkboxes or multiselect lists in a Has Many Through, there is no '_ids' method generated for you by the association and you need to write one for yourself.</p>

<p>See Paul Barry's article here:
<a href="http://paulbarry.com/articles/2007/10/24/has_many-through-checkboxes" rel="nofollow">http://paulbarry.com/articles/2007/10/24/has_many-through-checkboxes</a></p>

<p>Polymorphic stuff can be complicated, but if you're stuck real good maybe take a step back and make sure it's not something even more basic that's messing you up-- worked for me!</p>

<p>Below is the code modified from Paul's blog on how to handle this if you're dealing with a polymorphic has many through (basically you just need to use the attributes hash and write your polymorphic_type attribute):</p>

<pre><code>attr_accessor :store_ids
after_save :update_stores

#after_save callback to handle group_ids
def update_stores
  unless store_ids.nil?
    self.staffings.each do |staffing|
      staffing.destroy unless store_ids.include?(staffing.staffable_id.to_s)
      store_ids.delete(staffing.staffable_id.to_s)
    end 
    store_ids.each do |s|
      self.staffings.create(attributes = {:staffable_id =&gt; s, :staffable_type =&gt; 'Store'}) unless s.blank?
    end
    reload
    self.store_ids = nil
  end
end 
</code></pre>
