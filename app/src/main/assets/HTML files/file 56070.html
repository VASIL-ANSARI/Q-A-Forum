<p>You are going to need to do a subquery for this.  For example:</p>

<pre><code> Select user_id from table Where user_id not in 
         (select user_id from table where status = 4 and user_id is not null);
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to exclude all user_id's that are in a status of 4.</p>
