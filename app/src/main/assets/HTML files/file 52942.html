<p>I'm the developer of the HockeyApp app for Android. Can you post screenshots on how the app behaves differently when you launch it after installed through HockeyApp than through your IDE? This was not really clear to me from your post.</p>

<p>Feel free to open a <a href="http://support.hockeyapp.net" rel="nofollow">support request</a>, where you can also post screenshots explaining the issue. I will make sure to handle this directly.</p>

<p>Some background: HockeyApp only downloads the APK. Once the download is completed, the APK is handed over to the Android package manager, which is taking care of installation and launching the app. This is the only way how non-system apps can install APKs on Android.</p>
