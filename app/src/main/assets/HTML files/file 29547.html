<p>This code sets up a one-to-one relationship between the <code>Comment</code> and the <code>Attachment</code> model:</p>

<pre><code>has_one :attachment
</code></pre>

<p>This has nothing to do with Paperclip.</p>

<p>I assume that within your <code>Attachment</code> model you have something along the lines of the following:</p>

<pre><code>has_attached_file :attach
</code></pre>

<p>You need to interact with the <code>:attach</code> attached to the <code>Attachment</code> model:</p>

<pre><code>@comment.attachment.attach
</code></pre>

<p>When you're trying to attach this to your email you should be using something like this:</p>

<pre><code>attachments[comment.attachment.attach_file_name] = File.read(comment.attachment.attach.path)
</code></pre>
