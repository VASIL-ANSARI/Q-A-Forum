<p>Your problem is that you have variables and functions declared inside <code>Song</code>, but are defined at namespace level. This makes them different entities, and so definitions for the declarations in <code>Song</code> are never found.</p>

<pre><code>static char songListFile_[ENTRY_SZ] = "";
static char currentMP3_[ENTRY_SZ] = "";
static void ClearListFile() {/*...*/}
</code></pre>

<p>These should be changed. Removing <code>static</code> and prefixing the surrounding class <code>Song</code> should fix it.</p>

<pre><code>char Song::songListFile_[ENTRY_SZ] = "";
char Song::currentMP3_[ENTRY_SZ] = "";
void Song::ClearListFile() {/*...*/}
</code></pre>

<p>You only need the <code>static</code> inside the class definition. Outside it, you're using a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15235526/the-static-keyword-and-its-various-uses-in-c">different meaning</a> of the <code>static</code> keyword. I think you have more instances like this outside the code you posted, but it shouldn't be difficult to find them.</p>
