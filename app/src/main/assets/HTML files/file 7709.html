<p>The key is to understand what the top level layout manager is doing and making sure the lower level has a preferred size or other attribute set to have it render correctly.</p>

<p>From the API (http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/BorderLayout.html):</p>

<p>The <strong>NORTH and SOUTH components may be stretched horizontally</strong>; <strong>the EAST and WEST components may be stretched vertically;</strong> the CENTER component may stretch both horizontally and vertically to fill any space left over.</p>
