  <p>i implemented windowActivated but the output is not showing anything?</p>

<p>That is because the window is already visible before you add the WindowListener to the frame, so it has already been activated. Try clicking on another window on your desktop and then reselect your Frame and you will see the message.</p>

<p>If you want the message to appear at startup, then move the setVisible() statement to the bottom of your code (after you add the WindowListener).</p>

  <p>But in the above case I havenot called the windowClosing method?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you write GUI code you write code to handle "events", that is why you wrote the WindowListener. Now when the user clicks on the "Close" button Java will generate the "windowClosing" event for you. </p>

<p>I suggest you read the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/TOC.html" rel="nofollow">Swing tutorial</a> for the basics of GUI programming. Yes, the tutorial is for Swing but that is what you should be learning instead of AWT. Also Swing is built on top of AWT anyway. Maybe start with the section on <code>Writing Event Listeners</code>?</p>
