<p>Take a look at the parameters of the block in the error message. Your code has one argument, sender. But the block needs a UIGestureRecognizer, a UIGestureRecognizerState and a CGPoint. So, it should look something like </p>

<pre><code>[UITapGesture recognizerWithHandler:^(UIGestureRecognizer *recognizer, UIGestureRecognizerState UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded, CGPoint point){
}];
</code></pre>
