<p>I think you want to use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ceil.php" rel="nofollow"><code>ceil()</code> </a> or <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.round.php" rel="nofollow"><code>round()</code> </a>.</p>

<p>Since these are floating point numbers, there is room for error. Be careful how you round, and be sure that you don't independently calculate the last remaining percentages. Simply subtract the total of what you have from 1 or 100.</p>

<p>Make sure you dont calculate separate sides of the equation, sum one side, then subtract the other from 1 or 100 or however you are handling your percentages.</p>
