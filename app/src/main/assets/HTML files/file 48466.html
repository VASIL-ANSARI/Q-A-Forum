<p>Problem in my system is that due to prefer-application-packages in weblogic-application.xml server is looking for that package into my EAR. My EAR have both logback-core and logback-classic jars.So ideally logabck logs should work but same package(org.sl4j.*) is also available in  activemq-all-5.8.0.jar with log4j implementation, which is in my EAR too . So it did not let my logback logs work .</p>
