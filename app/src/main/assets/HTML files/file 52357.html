<p>You need to rethink what your actual goal is here, at least for me the use case is completely unclear.</p>

<ul>
<li>JPA does not create connections between objects unless the connections are stored in the database as columns</li>
<li>you are not calling the notifyobservers method anywhere so no changes will be actually broadcast</li>
<li>you should probably be using JPA lifecycle events like @PrePersist and a proper handler instead of observers</li>
</ul>
