<p>I don't know FuelPHP but it looks like the templates are included inside of a closure. Since PHP 5.4 closures can be bound to an object and have <code>$this</code>. Per default it is the object where the closure was created. See also: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5734109/664108">http://stackoverflow.com/a/5734109/664108</a></p>
