<p>Well, there are several policies for that. You certainly can use either 'data' or 'rev' attributes, but then you might have difficulties when trying to select a specific container element.</p>

<p>Usually, though, wrapper (and replacer) plugins work with elements with <code>id</code> attribute set, so they can generate a corresponding <code>id</code> for the elements they create. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.somePlugin = function(someId) {
  var somePluginId = 'some-plugin-' + someId;
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows both grapping all items (with <code>'[id^="some-plugin-"]'</code> selector) and each specific one (having an <code>id</code> of element which was involved in its creation). </p>

<p>The same policy, of course, can be applied when more then one new element should be created; you just have to use several specific prefixes for these.</p>
