<p>There are many sdks out there which can be incorporated in your app.</p>

<p>You can use 
1. <a href="https://try.crashlytics.com/" rel="nofollow">crashlytics</a>
2. <a href="http://www.localytics.com/" rel="nofollow">localytics</a>
3. <a href="https://app.crittercism.com" rel="nofollow">crittercism</a></p>

<p>Its always a best practice to include some analytics tools in your android application to know where users are spending a lot of their time. I personally like <a href="http://www.flurry.com/" rel="nofollow">flurry Analytics</a>.</p>

<p>Since you have already uploaded the apk you should check it out in the google play developer console. Even google will provide the crash data, and it is the only resource you have.</p>

<p>As far as fixing the application goes you can do it only by uploading a new apk and asking the users to update the app.</p>
