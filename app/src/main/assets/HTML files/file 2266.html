<p>There's no direct support in the form of a <code>parent</code> attribute, but you can perhaps use the patterns described <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element.htm#accessing-parents">here</a> to achieve the desired effect. The following one-liner is suggested (from the linked-to post) to create a child-to-parent mapping for a whole tree:</p>

<pre><code>parent_map = dict((c, p) for p in tree.getiterator() for c in p)
</code></pre>
