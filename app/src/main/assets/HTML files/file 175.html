<p>I saw this functionality in older versions of VS.Net (2003 I think).  It may still exist in current versions, but I haven't encountered it.  Seems that files with the same name, even in different directories confuse VS.Net, and it ends up setting a break point in a file with the same name.  May only happen if the classes in the file both have the same name also.  So much for namespaces I guess.  </p>

<p>You also may want to check your build configuration to make sure that all the projects are in fact building in debug mode.  I know I've been caught a couple times when the configuration got changed somehow for the solution, and some projects weren't compiling in debug mode.</p>
