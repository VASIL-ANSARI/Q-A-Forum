<p>After spending the day on it and having a think while running on my treadmill I believe I have the answer. I'm posting it here for the benefit of others. I moved the join with tbl_member into a sub query, and for the sake of completeness include another subquery to get the actual title of the position from a third table, tbl_position, shown below. <em>(Can't see a way to replace the sub queries with joins but that doesn't matter.)</em> </p>

<pre><code>TABLE tbl_positions
   (
   position_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, -- pk
   position VARCHAR(100), -- title of position
   &lt;other stuff&gt;
   )
</code></pre>

<p>The code I came up with is below which appears to work correctly and shows all the overlaps with details of who is overlapped with whom, when and why.</p>

<p>The oly niggle  is that if, for example, Fred is shown to overlap as President with Jim's existing record with the reason that Fred's tenure completely encloses Jim's tenure, then Jim's position as President is also shown to overlap with Fred's existing tenure record with the reason given that Fred's is completely enclosed by Jim's. ie I get both sides of the overlap. </p>

<p>If there is a quick way to get just a 'one way' overlap then by all means post a better answer.</p>
