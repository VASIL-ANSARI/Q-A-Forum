<p>Try whether <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-data-seek.php">mysql_data_seek()</a> does what you need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mysql_data_seek() moves the internal
  row pointer of the MySQL result
  associated with the specified result
  identifier to point to the specified
  row number. The next call to a MySQL
  fetch function, such as
  mysql_fetch_assoc(), would return that
  row.</p>
  
  <p>row_number starts at 0. The row_number
  should be a value in the range from 0
  to mysql_num_rows() - 1. However if
  the result set is empty
  (mysql_num_rows() == 0), a seek to 0
  will fail with a E_WARNING and
  mysql_data_seek() will return FALSE</p>
