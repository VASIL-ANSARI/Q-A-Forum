<p>I asked the question here mainly because there is much more active iPhone community here, coupled with the huge amount of questions regarding iStore submission/code signing etc.</p>

<p>For anyone still wanting an answer to this:</p>

<p>If the application has not ever been released, reject the binary and create a new application altogether. If you want to keep the same name as the app you'll have problems since Apple won't allow you to completely remove the old application and you can't have two with the same name. In this case, email them directly explaining the situation and they should rename the old application to an arbitrary name, freeing up the name for the new app</p>
