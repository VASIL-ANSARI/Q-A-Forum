<p>At the moment there is no option for that, because remote SDKs were removed from the list of available ones due to some <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RUBY-12846" rel="nofollow">technical reasons</a>, but we've submitted a <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RUBY-18210" rel="nofollow">request</a> to implement it back, so please vote for it.</p>
