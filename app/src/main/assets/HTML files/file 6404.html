<p>You're probably going to have to break up your timestamp into ymd:HM and use DIV 5 to split the minutes up into 5-minute bins -- something like</p>

<pre><code>select year(a.timestamp), 
       month(a.timestamp), 
       hour(a.timestamp), 
       minute(a.timestamp) DIV 5,
       name, 
       count(b.name)
FROM time a, id b
WHERE a.user = b.user AND a.id = b.id AND b.name = 'John' 
      AND a.timestamp BETWEEN '2010-11-16 10:30:00' AND '2010-11-16 11:00:00'
GROUP BY year(a.timestamp), 
       month(a.timestamp), 
       hour(a.timestamp), 
       minute(a.timestamp) DIV 12
</code></pre>

<p>...and then futz the output in client code to appear the way you like it. Or, you can build up the whole date string using the sql concat operatorinstead of getting separate columns, if you like.</p>

<pre><code>select concat(year(a.timestamp), "-", month(a.timestamp), "-" ,day(a.timestamp), 
       " " , lpad(hour(a.timestamp),2,'0'), ":", 
       lpad((minute(a.timestamp) DIV 5) * 5, 2, '0'))
</code></pre>

<p>...and then group on that</p>
