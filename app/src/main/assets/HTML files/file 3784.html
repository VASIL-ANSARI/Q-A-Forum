<p>Even though some time has passed, and the following isn't <em>exactly</em> what the OP asked for, I'll post a link to a valuable resource here. It might be a useful starting point for others looking for this kind of information.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.csharp-online.net/WF_Activities%E2%80%94Customizing_the_Designer" rel="nofollow"><em><strong>WF Activities--Customizing the Designer</strong></em></a> over at the <em><strong>C# Online.NET</strong></em> site.</p>

<p>Take the code snippets from the first three pages (<em>Implementing a style</em>, <em>Implementing a Designer</em>, <em>Adding attributes to the Activity</em>) and voilÃ , you have the building blocks for a composite activity that accepts other child activities.</p>

<p>(What's missing now to answer the OP's question is how to restrict the activity insertion process to certain positions in the child activity graph.)</p>
