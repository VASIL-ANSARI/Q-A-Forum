<p>I would initialise it with some vectors just in case:</p>

<pre><code>"pointList":  { type: "v2v", value: [ new THREE.Vector2(), new THREE.Vector2() ] },
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is what you need to add to your shader:</p>

<pre><code>uniform vec2 pointList[2];
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you want to avoid <code>Vector2</code>s you can use <code>2fv</code> as uniform type:</p>

<pre><code>"pointList":  { type: "2fv", value: [ 1, 0,  0, 1 ] }
</code></pre>
