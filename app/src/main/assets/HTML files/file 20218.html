<p>It looks like you're trying to initialize the same viewController twice. You don't need to <code>alloc] init]</code> after you <code>instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier.</code> At least, from my experience you don't. Try this: </p>

<pre><code>Setting *nextController = [[self storyboard] instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"setting"];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:nextController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>That will "push" the <code>nextController</code> with the <code>storyBoardID</code> of "setting" from the right into your existing <code>NavigationController</code>.</p>

<p>However, using my intuition, I believe you want to present a settings view modally, that has it's own <code>NavigationController</code>. In that case, try this code, which wraps the Settings <code>ViewController</code> into a <code>NavigationController</code>, and presents that whole thing modally, so you can navigate within settings:</p>

<pre><code>Setting *nextController = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"setting"];
UINavigationController *navcont = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:nextController];
navcont.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleCoverVertical;
[self presentViewController:navcont animated:YES completion:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could do all of this in the Storyboard itself. Select your settings view controller, and go to Editor Menu > Embed In... > Navigation Controller. Then make a <code>segue</code> from your button to the navigation controller that holds the settings controller. Set the segue to "Modal" and you're all done.</p>
