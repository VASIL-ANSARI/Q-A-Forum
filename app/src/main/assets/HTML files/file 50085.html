<p>Why are you storing your jQuery objects in an array ? You can't save jQuery objects to preserve their states as JQuery objects are simply wrappers to the DOM elements chosen by your selector. If the DOM changes, then those changes will be reflected by the jQuery object. If you want to preserve the old values, you should store the properties you want to keep rather than the entire jQuery object. Alternatively, you could also store your jQuery string inside an array:</p>

<pre><code>var arr = [];

arr.push(someElement);
</code></pre>

<p>When needed you can then query if your element is still contained in the array</p>

<pre><code> if (arr.indexOf(someElement)){
    $(someElement).dostuff......
 }
</code></pre>
