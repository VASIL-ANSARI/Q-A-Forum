<p>I think I'm probably missing something. Users will always see the text "Live" because that's what's hard-coded in text.html. It doesn't matter if you change the text through JavaScript since it will only affect the browser that you're seeing. You need to save it to a persistence storage (ie. database) and dynamically display it on the page.</p>
