<p>This type of query is called UNPIVOT, which unfortunately isn't natively supported by MySQL.  However, you can simulate this using UNION:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 'Red_Ball' AS Color_of_Balls, SUM(Red_Ball) as No_of_Balls
FROM color_balls
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Green_Ball', SUM(Green_Ball)
FROM color_balls
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Yellow_Ball', SUM(Yellow_Ball)
FROM color_balls
</code></pre>

<p>Oracle10g doesn't support this natively either, although there is <a href="http://www.bobjankovsky.org/show.php?seq=97" rel="nofollow">this workaround</a>.</p>
