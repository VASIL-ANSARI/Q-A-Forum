<p>The <a href="http://netbeans.org/community/releases/70/cpp-setup-instructions.html#compilers_windows" rel="nofollow">configuration page</a> lists the required cygwin packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>gcc</li>
<li>g++ (gcc-g++ package)</li>
<li>gdb</li>
<li>make</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure those packages are installed by re-running the Cygwin Setup and checking those packages in the Select Packages step.  Look under the Devel category or search for the packages in the Search field. </p>

<p>If the packages are marked "Skip" then they are not installed. Click the skipped packages until a version number appears where "Skip" did. </p>

<p>Then, click Next, let Cygwin install any dependencies, and click Next again to download and install the packages.</p>
