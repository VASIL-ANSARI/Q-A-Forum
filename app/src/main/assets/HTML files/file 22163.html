<p>A few options come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Git submodules. Store your models in a separate repo (or repos), and then include it as a <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules" rel="nofollow">Git submodule</a> in each app. This allows you to reuse them without having redundancy, though youâll likely have to ensure that you keep which revision each app is using in-sync.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it one app, with two distinct parts. Maybe your API could be a simple Sinatra (or other microframework) app, and reside within the Rails app, and then mounted to a path/subdomain. This may be the least amount of work and the simplest, but itâs also probably the most cluttered.</p></li>
<li><p>Use your own API. You already have an API, why not use it? Your front-end app can just talk to that and doesnât have to have any the model logic inside it. This also has the nice side-effect of ensuring that your API works and is full-featured, as youâre now a consumer of it instead of just third-parties.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Which one you pick is up to you, though I happen to prefer the last. While itâs probably more work, youâll likely end up with an overall better design by making your business logic external (and making MVC violations harder, if not impossible).</p>
