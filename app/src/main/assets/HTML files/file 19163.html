<p>You could bind the <em>Minimize Active View or Editor</em> command in <strong>Preferences > General > Keys</strong>  to any key combination you want, and if you do it the Console, it will minimize it. However when you do this, it will minimize all the views that share docking space with the Console. You can bring  it up again with <em>Alt+Shift+Q,C</em> but this will show the Console as a floating view, it won't maximize the dock to it's original position. Hit <em>Esc</em> in this floating Console and it will go away. </p>

<p>If you can live with this, then it's probably OK.</p>

<p>Another way would be to maximize the Code view with <em>Ctrl+M</em>, in case you want to focus just on the code.</p>
