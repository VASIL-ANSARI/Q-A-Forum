<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>import re

match = re.compile(r"@\w+")
items = re.findall(string)
for item in items:
    string = string.replace(item, my_replace(item)
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow you to replace anything that starts with @ with whatever the output of your function is. 
I wasn't very clear if you need help with the function as well. Let me know if that's the case</p>
