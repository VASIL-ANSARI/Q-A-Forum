<p>Unless you're talking about a large amount of code, loading some extra code is not likely to have a noticeable impact. It slows the initial page loading a bit, and uses some more browser memory, but it doesn't have much impact on performance after the initial load.</p>

<p>Conversely, running unnecessary code frequently (60 times a second is frequent) is likely to make the page less responsive, because it will be interrupting the browser while the user is trying to use it. The actual impact of this will depend on how expensive the function is, though. You should avoid <code>setInterval</code> with small intervals when it can be replaced with code that operates in response to user-driven events.</p>
