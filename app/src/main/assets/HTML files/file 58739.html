  <p>âjava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class me.ryan.Resourcesâ</p>
</blockquote>

<p>means that the initialization of the statics for your <code>Resources</code> class has failed.  The exception message does not say why, but the stacktrace will probably say that ... in the nested exception chain.</p>

<p>The failure will have happened because one of your <code>load</code> calls has failed due to an <em>unchecked</em> exception that was not caught.</p>

<hr>

<p>Looking at the code for <code>load</code> <strong>I am guessing</strong> that the exception was a <code>NullPointerException</code>, and that it happened because the</p>

<pre><code>Resources.class.getResource(path)
</code></pre>

<p>call has returned <code>null</code> instead of a <code>URL</code> object.  It will do that if the classloader cannot find a resource whose pathname corresponds to what you asked for.</p>

<p>If this is what is going on then the root cause is that you have used the wrong paths. or your build / deploy procedure has not placed the required image files where the classloader expects th find them; e.g. in the JAR file, if you are running from an executable JAR.</p>
