<p>Answering my own question..</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.4" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.4</a> I would say that 
a "Cache-Control: must-revalidate" without expiration states that the resource should be validated on every request.</p>

<p>In this case it means a conditional GET should be done every time the resource is made. So in this case System.Net.Http.HttpClient is behaving correctly and the legacy (Http)WebRequest is doing invalid behavior.</p>
