<p>You can already get the $content using your code.</p>

<pre><code>$content .= zip_entry_read($zip_entry, zip_entry_filesize($zip_entry));
</code></pre>

<p>Now all you need to do is to parse the content as an XML file:</p>

<p>You need to get all 'w:p' elements (which are paragraphs), get their text (everything that is inside a 'w:t' tag), and join all those blocks together with '\n' to create the paragraphs.</p>

<p>For the images, you can get them in the folder <code>/word/media/*</code></p>
