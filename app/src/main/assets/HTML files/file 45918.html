<p>For browsing the Android source code on the web, I typically use <a href="https://github.com/android" rel="nofollow">the Android GitHub repositories</a>. The design library <a href="https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_support/tree/master/design/src/android/support/design/widget" rel="nofollow">is located here</a>.</p>

<p>You can also clone all of the support libraries via this git repo: <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/" rel="nofollow">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there's one big caveat: The Snackbar (amongst numerous other recent additions to the design support library) doesn't appear to actually be in the repository yet.</p>

<p>Perhaps Google is waiting until the next release to push it, perhaps they are waiting for the release of M, or perhaps they simply forgot. Regardless, that source is simply not publicly available at the moment. I would keep watching the links above for updates though!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The source for Snackbar can now be found in the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support.git/+/master/design/src/android/support/design/widget/Snackbar.java" rel="nofollow">support libraries repo</a>.</p>
