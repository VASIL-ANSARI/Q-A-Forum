<p>Sounds like you want something along the lines of </p>

<pre><code>ActiveSupport::TimeZone.new('America/New_York').local_to_utc(t)
</code></pre>

<p>This says convert this local time (using the zone) to utc. If you have <code>Time.zone</code> set then you can of course to</p>

<pre><code>Time.zone.local_to_utc(t)
</code></pre>

<p>This won't use the timezone attached to t - it assumes that it's local to the time zone you are converting from.</p>

<p>One edge case to guard against here is DST transitions: the local time you specify may not exist or may be ambiguous.</p>
