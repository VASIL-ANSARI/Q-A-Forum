<p>So your question is "How to avoid filesort on your query" ?<br>
In which case, to get MySQL to do an index sort you need to have all of the columns in your index in your where clause.</p>

<p>With the id,timestamp primary key you have to</p>

<pre><code>where id = myid and item.timestamp between (t1,t2)
</code></pre>

<p>Also beware of open-ended ranges (and timestamp &lt; now() )</p>

<p>I'm not sure what datatypeID is, but if thats your only condition, then adding an index on just that column should also suggest an index sort. but you might have to create the index on (timestamp,datatypeID)  ...in that order... instead.</p>
