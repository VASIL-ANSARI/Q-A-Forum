<p>OK, mystery solved.</p>

<p>The first_or_create was being invoked from a method into which arguments were passed for a number of attributes. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>def get_right(language,work_id,contact_id,terms)
  right = Right.where(:language           =&gt; language          ).
                where(:work_id            =&gt; work_id           ).
                where(:terms              =&gt; terms             ).
                where(:contact_id         =&gt; contact_id        ).
                first_or_create!
  right.id
end
</code></pre>

<p>When the method was called the terms argument was being passed as {} instead of nil.</p>

<p>Apparently activerecord's method of dealing with stupidity like that is to remove the predicate on the offending column (terms) in the query and append a (1 = 2) predicate instead. </p>

<p>I can't say that I wouldn't rather encounter an error :(</p>
