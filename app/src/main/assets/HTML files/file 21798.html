<p>I can understand internal members being documented - that way it may be easier to <em>browse</em> the documentation for code you're writing within the same assembly. (And there's always InternalsVisibleTo, of course.) For private members, I think it's a bit harder to justify.</p>

<p>If you use Sandcastle to generate offline documentation, you can ask it to generate a new XML file with only the public members - and only the summary parts, at that. I can't remember offhand what it looks like in SHFB, but in our Noda Time project file, I believe this is the relevant section:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;ComponentConfig id="IntelliSense Component" enabled="True"&gt;
    &lt;component id="IntelliSense Component" 
               type="SandcastleBuilder.Components.IntelliSenseComponent" 
               assembly="{@SHFBFolder}SandcastleBuilder.Components.dll"&gt;
      &lt;output includeNamespaces="false" namespacesFile="Namespaces" 
              folder="{@OutputFolder}\..\PublicApi" /&gt;
    &lt;/component&gt;
  &lt;/ComponentConfig&gt;
</code></pre>
