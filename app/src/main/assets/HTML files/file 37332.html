<p>Look at your two pieces of code...</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    final int MOVE = 50;
    if (e.getSource() == moveLeft) {
        horizontal -= MOVE;
    } else {
        horizontal += MOVE;

    }
    repaint();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your <code>actionPerformed</code> method, you are updating the <code>horizontal</code> value, that sounds reasonable, but in your <code>paintComponent</code> method you are reassigning the value with something else, overriding what ever the <code>actionPerformed</code> method did...</p>

<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    //...
    horizontal = center - DIAMETER / 2;
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Start by taking a look at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/" rel="nofollow">Performing Custom Painting</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/painting-140037.html" rel="nofollow">Painting in AWT and Swing</a> to understand how painting works in Swing.</p>

<p>What you need to do is create some kind of flag which can be used to tell the <code>paintComponent</code> method to initialise the <code>horizontal</code> to a default position, once, then let the program update the value from there...</p>
