<p>RSpec can be confusing at first, since there are always many valid ways to achieve the same goal. That is why I would recommend you get <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book" rel="nofollow">The Rspec Book</a> instead of (or before) going through <em>"many tutorials and examples"</em>.</p>

<p>I could come up easily with eight different ways for this single test (see the code sample below), and you could mix and match parts of them even more, resulting in even more different ways to solve the same problem.</p>

<p>This is why I think getting a basic understanding of RSpec principles is necessary before you are able to work through examples and tutorials - every example will look slightly different, but if you have the basics down, you will easily be able to see what each example does.</p>

<pre><code>require "rspec"

class Song
  def title=(title)
    @title = title
  end

  def title
    @title.capitalize
  end
end

describe Song do
  before { @song = Song.new }

  describe "#title" do
    it "should capitalize the first letter" do
      @song.title = "lucky"
      @song.title.should == "Lucky"
    end
  end
end

describe Song do
  describe "#title" do
    it "should capitalize the first letter" do
      song = Song.new
      song.title = "lucky"
      song.title.should == "Lucky"
    end
  end
end

describe Song do
  let(:song) { Song.new }

  describe "#title" do
    before { song.title = "lucky" }

    it "should capitalize the first letter" do
      song.title.should == "Lucky"
    end
  end

describe Song do
  let(:song)  { Song.new }
  subject     { song }
