  <p>no matter what i do, each panel I add to the JFrame becomes the same, unchangeable size. </p>

<pre><code>setLayout(new GridLayout(1,3));

<p>That is because you are using a GridLayout() which makes every component the same size. If you don't want that to happen then don't use a GridLayout.</p>

<p>There is no reason for the table to be scrollable since all the rows a visible.</p>

<p>Don't really know what you are trying to do but I might suggest you just use the default BorderLayout of the JFrame. Then your code might be something like:</p>

<pre><code>frame.add(buttonsPanel, BorderLayout.LINE_START);
frame.add(scrollPaneWithTable, BorderLayout.CENTER);
frame.add(blackPanel, BorderLayout,LINE_START);
</code></pre>
