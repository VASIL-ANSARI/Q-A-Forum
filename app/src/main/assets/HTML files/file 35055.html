<p>This is what you could write:</p>

<pre><code>// Input stream for your file. Passing the file name and it gets open for you
ifstream dataFile("test.txt");

// Array replacement with a proper container
vector&lt;string&gt; stringlist;

// Temporary variable to read the line or word in
string mystring;

// Read continously into the temporary variable until you run out of data
while (getline(dataFile, mystring)) {
    // In each iteration, push the value of the temporary variable
    // to the end of the container
    stringlist.push_back(mystring);
}

// At last, close the file as we do not need it anymore
dataFile.close();
</code></pre>

<p>I suggest not to use raw arrays for this, but proper standard library containers such as <code>vector</code> or <code>list</code> and <code>string</code>. It also depends on your exact use case whether you wish to use the <code>operator&gt;&gt;</code> overload, or getline. The former will read a word, whereas the latter will read a line in.</p>
