<p>You're only setting values down to the second, so the <em>millisecond</em> part is left at whatever it was from <code>new Date()</code>. Your description isn't entirely clear, but I suspect you just want:</p>

<pre><code>fechaMin.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, use a better API, such as <a href="http://joda.org/joda-time">Joda Time</a> or the <code>java.time</code> API in Java 8.</p>
