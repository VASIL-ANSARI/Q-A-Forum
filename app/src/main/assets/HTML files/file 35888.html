<p>I have a way of solution that 
1. we can add identity column on the table and fetch the data based on this identity column and do what ever you want.
2. By using ROWNUMBER also we can get the rows and do the manipulation according to your requirement.
3. We can add datetime column to the table and based on the datetime fetch the data and do the manipulation according to your requirement.</p>

<p>If Any one have any solution apart from the above, please share it across.</p>
