<p>Yes you can.</p>

<p>Lets say given numbers are</p>

<p>76.21445
and </p>

<p>0.01</p>

<p>what you can do is multiply 76.21445 by 100 (or divide per 0.01)
round the result to nearest or lower integer (depending which one you want)</p>

<p>and than multiply it by the number again.</p>

<p>Note that it may not exactly print what you want if you will not go for the numbers with decimal precision. (The problem of numbers which in the binary format are not finite in extansion). Also in Math you have the round function taking doing pretty much what you want.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html</a> you use it like this </p>

<pre><code>round(200.3456, 2);
</code></pre>
