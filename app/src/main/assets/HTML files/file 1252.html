<p>Point the ajax jsonp request at a php file in the same domain, and in that php file, trought <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php" rel="nofollow">cUrl</a>, do the request to the second domain.</p>

<p>In short, use an php file as a tunnel between the two domains (cUrl is just an example)</p>
