<p>You have some packages from one repository, and some others from the main repository. Additionally, and this is where the error creeps in, some of those packages are <strong>held</strong>. You chose <em>not</em> to upgrade them:</p>

<pre><code>php5-mysqlnd : Depends: phpapi-20121212
               Depends: php5-common (= 5.5.36...) but 5.6.18... is to be
                        installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What probably happened</strong></p>

<p>During a previous upgrade, the system had an error and suggested some resolutions, one of which was to the tune of, "...continue <strong>and break dependencies</strong>". You chose that one -- i.e., you signed a waiver to APT saying, "I'm never gonna upgrade <em>that</em>".</p>

<p>Now you want to do exactly that -- and you no longer can.</p>

<p><strong>What you need to do</strong></p>

<p>You need to identify those held packages, determine why they're held, and upgrade them accordingly; or go back to MySQL 5.5, if some more important dependency would be broken.</p>

<pre><code>apt-get update

apt-get --ignore-hold --dry-run upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>will tell you what would happen if you try and upgrade also those packages that are currently held. You can try also the <code>--fix-missing</code> and <code>--fix-broken</code> options. But the most important answer you need is, <em>why were those packages held back in the first place</em>.</p>

<p>If you just go on and ignore the held packages, you risk breaking something that can't be easily repaired. I did that once when I unwittingly upgraded a held-back Subversion package that was required to access a specific and very choosy repository. The upgrade went OK, but then I could no longer commit source changes.</p>
