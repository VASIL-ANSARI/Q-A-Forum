<p>Javascript/Jquery is not the right choice there.</p>

<p>Javascript/Jquery work client side: they operate on users pc and not on your server. Maybe there are some plugins capable of resizing images, but surely you won't be able to store them in different folders using Javascript/Jquery</p>

<p>Such an operation must be done on your server, with a sever side language like PHP, NodeJS (still uses Javascript language), Java or many others.</p>

<p>The answer is based on the language off your choice, so i can't give a general one</p>
