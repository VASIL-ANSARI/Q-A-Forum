<p>The behaviour you see is quite normal.</p>

<p>If you remove the <code>MarshalByRefObject</code>, since you have <code>Serializable</code> attribute, remoting will serialize the class for you and marshal the <strong>state</strong> to the main AppDomain. So when the method runs, in runs in the current AppDomain since it lives in the main AppDOmain (has been serialized and marshalled to current AppDomain).</p>

<p>If you keep <code>MarshalByRefObject</code>, remoting will make the call on the remote object.</p>

<p>If you remove both, it will throw up an exception since remoting objects need to have one.</p>
