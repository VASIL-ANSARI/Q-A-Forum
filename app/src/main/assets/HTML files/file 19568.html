<p>What you want is generally called a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table" rel="nofollow">pivot</a>". </p>

<p>Here's how you code it in sql using an extra join for each extra column:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    a.id AS user_id,
    a.name AS Name,
    CONCAT(b1.client_no, ', ', b1.wholesaler) AS client_no_wholesaler1,
    CONCAT(b2.client_no, ', ', b2.wholesaler) AS client_no_wholesaler2,
    CONCAT(b3.client_no, ', ', b3.wholesaler) AS client_no_wholesaler3,
    CONCAT(b4.client_no, ', ', b4.wholesaler) AS client_no_wholesaler4
FROM users AS a
JOIN client_numbers AS b1 ON b1.user_id = a.id
LEFT JOIN client_numbers AS b2 ON b2.user_id = a.id and b2.id &gt; b1.id
LEFT JOIN client_numbers AS b3 ON b3.user_id = a.id and b3.id &gt; b2.id
LEFT JOIN client_numbers AS b4 ON b4.user_id = a.id and b4.id &gt; b3.id
GROUP BY 1, 2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the extra joins avoid duplicate joins by the addition of an ever-increasing id condition in the <code>ON</code> clause for the extra joins. If id isn't a suitable ordering column, chose something else to separate the joins.</p>
