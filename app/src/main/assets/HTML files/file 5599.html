<pre><code>with tempTable as(
    select top 2 max(salary) as MaxSalary from employee order by salary desc
) select top 1 MaxSalary from tempTable
</code></pre>

<p>description:</p>

<ol>
<li>select the top 2 maximum salaries</li>
<li>order them by desc order ( so the 2nd highest salary is now at the top) </li>
<li>select the top 1 from that</li>
</ol>

<p>another approach:</p>

<pre><code>select top 1 MaxSalary from (
    select top 2 max(salary) as MaxSalary from employee order by salary desc
)
</code></pre>
