<p>Well. it happens that I'm developing a similar kind of app</p>

<p>There's no problem on using koa-static to serve you static content and koa-router for you api endpoint. I never used koa-send directly. but I think you doesn't need too, given your set up</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is the order when attaching middleware to koa app. Try to attach koa-static first for your assets ( and maybe even index.html) and later use the koa-router for your api. Requests trying to get some static file never reach the router. and this way the router only responsibility will be serving your api</p>

<p>If that's not posible ( for example, because you have a bunch of non-static html files to server, consider taht you can have more than one router per app, even nesting one inside the other</p>

<p>( If the answer is not enough, give some time to cook a simple example. I'll post it as soon as possible)</p>

<p>EDIT: added a quick and dirty example <a href="https://gist.github.com/develmts/a3c1f89c8327f33f143da230ad52c7ae" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Probably it doesn't work out of the box, but it's enough to get the idea</p>
