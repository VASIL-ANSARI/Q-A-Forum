<p>See the working fiddle (Quick Fix): <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/VH3fR/13/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/VH3fR/13/</a></p>

<p>I don't know if this is the best solution, What I did is instead of creating a path &amp; translating it, I have created the path directly at the required position.</p>

<p>The reason for the behavior is if you look at the source code of the <code>move</code> method, it takes the pointer &amp; applies transform method for rotation on the pointer, which overrides the translate method you called.</p>

<p>Here I removed the rectangle &amp; directly built an arrow using path.</p>
