<p>Since MySQL do not support <code>EXPLAIN UPDATE</code> statements before version 5.6.3, we're quite blind about this query. Try <code>USE INDEX</code> statement...</p>

<p>I've launched the same on my server. All was ok with 15 <code>TEXT</code> fields and 4096 rows of quite arbitrary text. It was ok with both <code>USE INDEX(PRIMARY)</code> and <code>IGNORE INDEX(PRIMARY)</code> statements.</p>

<p>So, I suppose, you have problems with your SQL server, installation package, or whatever, not query...</p>
