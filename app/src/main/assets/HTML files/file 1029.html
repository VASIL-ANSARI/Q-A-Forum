<p>In your PHP.INI file, try to comment all the extensions lines and restart IIS. Take note that MySql will no longer work. Do some tests.</p>

<p>If it's successfull, uncomment back the mySql line. Do some tests.</p>

<p>If it's unsucessfull, them I can't help you more. I suspect that's a loaded extension causing the error. You have to find which one...</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
