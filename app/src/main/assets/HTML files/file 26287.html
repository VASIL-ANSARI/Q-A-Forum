<p>It's just because of the order of operations of a query.</p>

<ol>
<li>FROM clause</li>
<li>WHERE clause</li>
<li>GROUP BY clause</li>
<li>HAVING clause</li>
<li>SELECT clause</li>
<li>ORDER BY clause </li>
</ol>

<p><code>WHERE</code> just filters the rows returned by <code>FROM</code>. An aggregate function like <code>MAX()</code> can't have a result returned because it hasn't even been applied to anything.</p>

<p>That's also the reason, why you can't use aliases defined in the <code>SELECT</code> clause in a <code>WHERE</code> clause, but you can use aliases defined in <code>FROM</code> clause.</p>
