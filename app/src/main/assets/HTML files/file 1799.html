<p>While a <code>callvirt</code> instruction does take longer this is usually done because it provides a cheap <code>null</code> check for the CLR prior to making the call to the method.  A <code>callvirt</code> shouldn't take significantly longer than a <code>call</code> instruction especially considering the <code>null</code> check.</p>

<p>Have you found that you could significantly improve the performance of your application by creating types (either <code>structs</code> or classes with static methods) that allow you to guarantee that the C# compiler will emit <code>call</code> instructions rather than <code>callvirt</code> instructions?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I am wondering if you are going to create an unmaintainable code base that is brittle and hard to use simply to solve a problem that may or may not exist.  </p>
