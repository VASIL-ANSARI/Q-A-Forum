<p>Just glanced at the code for <code>TextView</code>... seems it only draws the selection highlight when the private member <code>mCursorVisible</code> is true. The behaviour you're seeing is evidently by design.</p>

<p>To workaround it I'd try creating and setting a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/style/BackgroundColorSpan.html" rel="nofollow"><code>BackgroundColorSpan</code></a> from the current selection. </p>
