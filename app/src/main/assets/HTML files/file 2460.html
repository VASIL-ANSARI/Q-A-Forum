<p>Please try with an "official" <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/" rel="nofollow">Connector/J 5.1</a> i.e. distributed by MySQL, not a deb (note that I have nothing against deb).</p>

<p>Also please enable <code>--log-warnings</code> on the mysql server and see if anything is showing up in your error logs. </p>
