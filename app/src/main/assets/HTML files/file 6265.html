<p>You never copy the <code>token</code> once you've found it. You can't copy <code>linebuffer</code>, as the data in there will be overwritten as the next line is loaded.</p>

<p>This line:</p>

<pre><code>number[ctr] = linebuffer;
</code></pre>

<p>should reference <code>token</code> to save the most recently found token, but it doesn't. It should probably read something like<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(number[ctr], token);
</code></pre>

<p>but then you'd have to change the declaration to make sure there's space:</p>

<pre><code>char number[3][32];
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, this introduces a buffer overrun risk, if there's a very long token it won't fit. How to best handle that is left as an exercise. :)</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Why the temporary vector is called "number" when it is used to store two numbers and one string (the name) is beyond me.</p>
