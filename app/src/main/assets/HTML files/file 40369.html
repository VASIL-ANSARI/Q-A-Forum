<p>There are no rules. You just need any <code>ViewGroup</code> -- position and size it however you want. When you add the <code>Fragment</code> into it, it will behave just as if you'd created the <code>Fragment</code>'s <code>View</code> manually, and called <code>yourViewGroup.addView(fragmentView)</code>.</p>

<p><code>FrameLayout</code> is typically used just because it makes a good container with no real behavior (you just give it a size and position and let the fragment fill that container). </p>

<p>There's absolutely no need to make the container view its own layout file. In fact, if you want the <code>Fragment</code> to take over the content view of the entire <code>Activity</code>, you could even just add the <code>Fragment</code> to the <code>Activity</code> using the ID <code>android.R.id.content</code>.</p>
