<p>First, if there's another way to detect errors that doesn't involve doing this, do that instead. Your future self will thank you.</p>

<p>But if you really need to listen to <code>System.err</code>, you might want to use <code>System.setErr(PrintStream)</code>. Write your own PrintStream subclass that looks for "Error:" in the text being printed.</p>
