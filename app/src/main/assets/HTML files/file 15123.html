<p>The <a href="http://validator.w3.org" rel="nofollow">W3C Markup Validator</a> finds 101 markup errors on the page and additionally issues 10 warnings. The page structure is rather contrived, and it does some browser sniffing and tries to serve different style sheets for different browsers. It is very difficult to say whether these have something to do with the problem observed. It is probably a major effort to track down the cause of the problem, and having that many markup errors makes a page rather fragile.</p>

<p>Iâm afraid the obvious answer âsimplify the structure and fix the markup errors firstâ is not very realistic, but it might be the best advice you can get.</p>
