<p>indicates that your are not passing enough or too many variables for the string substitution. Using str() explicitly might also help you get to your own answer, as the output of the text will hint what type the scores really are:</p>

<pre><code>def displayScore(player1_score, player2_score):
    resultSurf = BasicFont.render('Player 1 Score = %s' % str(player1_score), True, white)
    resultRect = resultSurf.get_rect()
    resultRect.topleft = (125, 25)
    gameDisplay.blit(resultSurf, resultRect)

    resultSurf = BasicFont.render('Player 2 Score = %s' % str(player2_score), True, white)
    resultRect = resultSurf.get_rect()
    resultRect.topleft = (375, 25)
    gameDisplay.blit(resultSurf, resultRect)
</code></pre>
