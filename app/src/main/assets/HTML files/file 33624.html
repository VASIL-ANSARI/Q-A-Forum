<p>You are using the XML attribute of android:id, then you are specifying a new id to create a new entry in R.java, that is why you have to include (+) sign.</p>

<p>But in here: </p>

<pre><code>android:nextFocusUp="@id/edit"
</code></pre>

<p>you are referring to an id that has already been created above.</p>
