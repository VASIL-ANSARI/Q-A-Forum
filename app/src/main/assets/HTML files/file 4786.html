<p>The second block looks like thread local storage associated with a library-owned thread created to handle async read(s).</p>

==22330==    by 0x4E34728: pthread_create@@GLIBC_2.2.5 (allocatestack.c:561)
</code></pre>

<p>The first and third look like internal structs associated with an outstanding async read.</p>

<p>If you can run for a sustained time with only this to worry about, my instinct would be to be grateful for small mercies.  The library surely has to have some latitude to allocate persistent memory to correlate the result for an async read.</p>
