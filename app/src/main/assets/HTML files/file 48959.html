<p>Such a distortion as a symmetry of revolution.</p>

<p>In polar coordinates, with the pole at the center of the image, it is expressed as</p>

<pre><code>r' = f(r)
Î' = Î
</code></pre>

<p>where the quote indicates the distorted coordinates. The function f is unknown and should be measured empirically, by calibration (looking at a regular target).</p>

<p>To correct the image, you need to invert the function f and apply the reverse transform to the image. In fact, it is easier to measure g directly by calibration. As a starting approximation, a simple model like </p>

<pre><code>r = r' + a.r'Â³ 
</code></pre>

<p>can do.</p>

<p>Most probably you don't have a picture of a grid taken with the same lens. Your last resort is to implement the undistortion function with adjustable parameters, and optimize these by trial and error.</p>

<p>It should also be possible to derive the calibration curve by looking at the deformation of straight lines, but this is more "technical".</p>

<hr>

<p>In Cartesian coordinates, you can express the correction transform as</p>

<pre><code>x = g(r').x'/r'
y = g(r').y'/r'
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>r' = âx'Â²+y'Â²</code>.</p>
