<p>Openmp support is compiler dependent. So you can't just take omp.h from gcc and use it with sun pro. </p>

<p>Use option   -xopenmp in sun pro (read more at <a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/studio_openmp.html" rel="nofollow">http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/studio_openmp.html</a> )</p>

<p>And you can take Full installation of recent gcc (4.2 and later) and use it for compiling all your programs with openmp pragmas.</p>
