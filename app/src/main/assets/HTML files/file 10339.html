<p>Check your assumptions ! I don't think you are doing the same. I don't know openCv
very well, but your not doing anything with your temp image, so there is no reason for the channel image to change ! You should set the result of the temp image in the original image, something like this perhaps :</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; width * height; i++) {

    double lap_val = cvGet1D(lapl, i).val[0]; // get modified image data

    int v = (int) ((255.0 * lap_val / maxv) + 0.5); // scale to 0 255
    cvSet1D(channel, i, cvScalarAll(v)); // store in original image
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can take the original code, and comment it to explain what each cvImage contains, and see what you have missed when reusing it in your app.</p>
