<p>It sounds like you are talking about `Content-Type'.  When you save a file to the filesystem, you can't set this: the system will decide what to use based on the file extension and possibly by analysing the contents, if it's a text file.</p>

<p>However, you can set the content type when you serve a file to someone's browser, and when you upload it to S3.  See here for the latter <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25315658/setting-the-content-type-in-direct-to-s3-upload-using-rails-and-jquery-file-uplo">Setting the Content-Type in direct to S3 upload using Rails and jQuery File Upload</a></p>
