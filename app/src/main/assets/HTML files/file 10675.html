<p>I would assume that the ORs are causing it.
Try parenthesis around the three statements that are OR connected.</p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT news.id, news.slug, news.title, news.created_on FROM (news) 
WHERE `published` = '1' 
AND (
     news.title LIKE '%running%' 
  OR news.body LIKE '%running%' 
  OR news.intro LIKE '%running%' 
)
ORDER BY created_on desc
</code></pre>
