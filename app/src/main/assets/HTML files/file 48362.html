<p>I solved the problem, now I put them the answer.</p>

<p>First we open the project folder and go to the following path "PROJECT FOLDER \ .idea \ libraries"</p>

<p>Now edit the file: "design_22_2_0.xml" and before "" we put the following lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ANNOTATIONS&gt;
  &lt;root url="jar://$PROJECT_DIR$/app/build/intermediates/exploded-aar/com.android.support/design/22.2.0/annotations.zip!/"/&gt;
&lt;/ANNOTATIONS&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>now you can import the library "android.support.design.widget.NavigationView"</p>
