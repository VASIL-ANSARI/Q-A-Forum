<p>I haven't really used "popupNode", but in general nodes aren't the same as strings.  I suggest reading up on the Document Object Model (DOM) to learn more.</p>

<p>As far as replacing text, assuming popupNodes work like other nodes then something like this may work for you:</p>

<pre><code>var target = document.popupNode;
target.innerHTML = target.innerHTML.replace("old_string", "new_string")
</code></pre>
