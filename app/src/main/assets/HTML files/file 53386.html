<p>The problem solved! Really my service (and also the notification) has worked correctly but i has this codes in <code>onPause</code> of the <code>Activity</code>:</p>

<pre><code>protected void onPause() {
    Intent playAlarm = new Intent(this, AlarmVibrationService.class);
    stopService(playAlarm);
    super.onPause();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It (<code>onPause</code>) happens right after my <code>Activity</code> opens in sleep-mode! I don't now why it happens but it cause stopping the service. Now i removed above code and the problem solved... </p>
