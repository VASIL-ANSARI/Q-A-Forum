<p>It's a set of quite widespread C++ libraries, they're probably needed by PySide, even though I've never tried it.</p>

<p>Download them from there:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.42.0/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.42.0/</a></p>

<p>Otherwise, you can install them from macports: <a href="http://www.macports.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.macports.org</a> once you've installed macports, just run "sudo port install boost". Unluckily, pyside itself doesn't seem to be in macports yet.</p>
