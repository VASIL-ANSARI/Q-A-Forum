<p>I cannot see anything wrong with the code - it works out of the box if I put it in my sample Jersey app with default settings. How do you configure your JSONConfiguration?</p>

<p>You could change return type of getHtml() to String and return myData.toString(). No Implicit serialization would be required.</p>
