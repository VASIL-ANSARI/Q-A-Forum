<p>You have to have the exact dSYM that was generated along the build that is installed on the device and generates the crash report.</p>

<p>Please follow the steps explained in this answer (even though the original problems are not the same, the steps help identify if you have the correct dSYM): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13650516/symbolicate-crash-log-when-app-name-contains-apostrophe-and-space-deployed-app/13660458#13660458">Symbolicate Crash Log when App Name Contains Apostrophe and Space (Deployed App)</a></p>

<p>Executing the line with <code>atos</code> you posted, is most likely to return nothing useful, since the address given as a parameter does not have to exist in your app. You have to use a proper address taken from the crash report and calculated properly as detailed here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13574933/ios-crash-reports-atos-not-working-as-expected/13576028#13576028">iOS crash reports: atos not working as expected</a></p>

<p>Best approach is the follow the steps written in the first linked post.</p>
