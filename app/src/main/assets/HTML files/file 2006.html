<p>A number of years ago we did something similar.  How we handled it was by creating a couple of interfaces that were implemented by a PluginManager and the Plugins.  </p>

<p>The Plugin Manager implemented an interface similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>    ''' &lt;summary&gt;
'''The IPluginManager interface is implemented by whatever component manages your gui
'''It provides a means for plugins to access GUI elements of the application
''' &lt;/summary&gt;
Public Interface IPluginManager

    ''' &lt;summary&gt;
    '''The MDIForm property allows the plugin to display itself
    '''inside of the application's main MDI form (ie.  plugin.form.mdiparent=mdiform)
    ''' &lt;/summary&gt;
    ReadOnly Property MDIForm() As Form
    ReadOnly Property Toolbar() As ToolBar

    ''' &lt;summary&gt;
    '''Allows the plugin to request that the application's main menu be updated
    ''' &lt;/summary&gt;
    ''' &lt;param name="Menu"&gt;The menu to add to the main menu&lt;/param&gt;
    Sub UpdateMainMenu(ByVal Menu As Menu)

    ''' &lt;summary&gt;
    '''Allows the plugin to request that the application's workspace toolbar be updated
    ''' &lt;/summary&gt;
    ''' &lt;param name="Buttons"&gt;the collection of toolbar buttons to add to the toolbar&lt;/param&gt;
    Sub UpdateToolbarButtons(ByVal Buttons As ToolBar.ToolBarButtonCollection)

End Interface
</code></pre>

<p>The Plugins implemented this interface:</p>

<pre><code>    ''' &lt;summary&gt;
'''The IPlugin interface is implemented by all plugins
'''It provides a standardized means for the pluginmanager
'''to communicate with a plugin, without knowing the plugin explicitly
''' &lt;/summary&gt;
Public Interface IPlugin

    ''' &lt;summary&gt;
    '''Allows the plugin to be intialized first before it asked to run
    ''' &lt;/summary&gt;
    Sub Initialize()

    ''' &lt;summary&gt;
    '''Allows the pluginmanager to register itself with the plugin
    '''so the plugin can listen to events from the pluginmanager
    ''' &lt;/summary&gt;
    ''' &lt;param name="PluginManager"&gt;A plugin manager that implements the IPluginManager interface&lt;/param&gt;
    Sub RegisterPluginManager(ByVal PluginManager As IPluginManager)

    ''' &lt;summary&gt;
    '''Requests the plugin to run its functionality
    ''' &lt;/summary&gt;
    Sub Run()

End Interface
</code></pre>

<p>Once the app starts up, the PluginManager finds all of the available plugins (sounds like you have this working already) and then instantiates each plugin, registering itself with each plugin.  The PluginManager then Intializes and then Runs the plugin(s).  </p>

<p>On the plugin side, when the Plugin is Initialized or Runs (depending on your needs) you simply set the plugin form's MDIParent property to the MDIForm provided in the IPluginManager interface.  And Viola!</p>

<p>It's a pretty simple contract between the two that you can easily change or expand upon.</p>
