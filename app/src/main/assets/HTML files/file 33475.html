<p>"Displaying the frequency" can mean many things.  Actually, my PitchDetect demo DOESN'T use a Fourier Transform - it uses autocorrelation.  But that will only give you a single pitch, at high accuracy.  If your signal has multiple simultaneous notes - well, that's a hard problem.</p>

<p>If you want to see a frequency analysis breakdown of the live mic input, check out <a href="http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/AudioRecorder/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/AudioRecorder/index.html</a> (code at <a href="https://github.com/cwilso/AudioRecorder" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/cwilso/AudioRecorder</a>).  That uses the built-in FFT in the RealtimeAnalyser to show a frequency spectrum graph of a live audio signal.</p>
