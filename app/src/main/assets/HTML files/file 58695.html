<p>To answer the question, you can initialize arrays of objects in Objective-C / Foundation with either one of two methods:</p>

<pre><code>// Original, longer way of doing it
NSArray *words = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"list", @"of", @"words"];

// Modern Objective-C shorthand
NSArray *words = @[@"list", @"of", @"words"];
</code></pre>

<p>A little bit more verbose, but given your object, here's how your Swift code:</p>

<pre><code>let playerData = [
    Player(name: "Bill Evan", game: "Call of Duty", rating: 4),
    Player(name: "Linh Nguyen", game: "Alien vs. Predator", rating: 3)
]
</code></pre>

<p>Would look in Objective-C:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *playerData = @[
    [[Player alloc] initWithPlayer:@"Bill Evan" game:@"Call of Duty" rating:4],
    [[Player alloc] initWithPlayer:@"Linh Nguyen" game:@"Alien vs. Predator" rating:3]
];
</code></pre>
