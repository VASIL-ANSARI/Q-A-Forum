<p>There's a number of approaches you could take.  Probably the most obvious one is to have a separate page for your show_all.  It sounds like you're trying to do too much with your homepage.  </p>

<p>If you must have these on the homepage, and your link is also on the homepage, you could use an ajax call to load up your items without having to redirect to that url.</p>

<p>Finally I suppose you could try making a route just for this situation.  I don't really have any experience with Rails3 routes, though, so I can't suggest any syntax.</p>

<p>Really, though, this smells like an application design problem, not a technical problem.  I strongly encourage you to rethink how you are trying to do this.  This doesn't sound like a feature that is appropriate to put on your homepage.  Make a separate show_all action.</p>
