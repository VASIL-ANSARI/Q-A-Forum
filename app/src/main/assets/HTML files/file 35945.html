<p>I don't know for sure. Just searched over the web to find out how to use dagger properly for testing.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as I understand, the <code>MainActivity</code> takes its object graph from the Application. So, that is the place where you have to insert your <code>MockModule</code>.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you should create a subclass of <code>PhoneApplication</code> and override <code>getModules()</code> method to return your <code>MockModule</code>. After that, you should mock application with <code>ActivityUnitTestCase.setApplication()</code> (your test should subclass <code>ActivityUnitTestCase</code> first). That should fix the issue.</p>
