<p>Use <code>for</code> instead of <code>foreach</code>. <code>foreach</code> doesn't expose its inner workings, it enumerates anything that is <code>IEnumerable</code> (which doesn't have to have an index at all).</p>

<pre><code>for (int i=0; i&lt;arr.Length; i++)
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Besides, if what you're trying to do is find the index of a particular item in the list, you don't have to iterate it at all by yourself. Use <code>Array.IndexOf(item)</code> instead.</p>
