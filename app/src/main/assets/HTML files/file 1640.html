<p>This may not necessarily be bad. Each condition cuts off a half of the cases. If you know you only need to do something when the first condition is true, you drop 512 cases already. That's the point of those checks.</p>

<p>You can however rewrite it to be better looking and more readable:</p>

<pre><code>if(c1 &amp;&amp; c2 &amp;&amp; c3 &amp;&amp; c4 &amp;&amp; c5)
</code></pre>
