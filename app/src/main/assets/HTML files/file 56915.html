<p>You are nesting your <code>then</code> values and actually have two different <code>then</code> routes â for lack of a better term. </p>

<p>So far as the javascript is concerned, once the first <code>then</code> is resolved in your <code>request</code> method, it can move on to the next <code>then</code>. Here, once <code>writeToPdf</code> is resolved, that part of the promise chain then moves on to the <code>console.log</code> statement since the previous promise at that level has been resolved. That make sense?</p>
