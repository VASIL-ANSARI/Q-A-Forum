<p>There are third-party implementations of interfaces for Python (most popular is <a href="http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface">Zope's</a>, also used in <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/plugin.html">Twisted</a>), but more commonly Python coders prefer to use the richer concept known as an "Abstract Base Class" (ABC), which combines an interface with the possibility of having some implementation aspects there too.  ABCs are particularly well supported in Python 2.6 and later, see <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/">the PEP</a>, but even in earlier versions of Python they're normally seen as "the way to go" -- just define a class some of whose methods raise <code>NotImplementedError</code> so that subclasses will be on notice that they'd better override those methods!-)</p>
