<p>My experience of working out what to do here was:</p>

<p>I started trying to expand an image to full screen, but this led to issues with the image
being placed behind other items on the same screen and complication in returning to normal view.</p>

<p>I then created another view controller and created a segue from the original one to this controller. The segue was created by dragging from my tap gesture to the next view controller.</p>

<p>Key steps for me while using information on the board:</p>

<p>In the destination view controller create a property for an IMAGE as well as the ImageView.</p>

<p>In the source view controller be sure to link the image you are passing to the image in the image property just created in the destination view controller within the "prepare for segue".</p>

<p>Going back to the destination view controller, within ViewDidLoad i equated the image set as a property (and which has now been passed the image within the segue), to be the IMAGEVIEW within the source view controller. This is the image view you would have drag and dropped to the view controller.</p>
