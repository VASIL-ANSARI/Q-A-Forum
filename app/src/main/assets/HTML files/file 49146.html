<p>You have not initialized and allocated the Person object, and then you are trying to populate its properties so you are obviously getting an access violation.</p>

<p>Change to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Person *one = [Person new];
one.firstName = @"Allen";
one.lastName = @"X";
</code></pre>
