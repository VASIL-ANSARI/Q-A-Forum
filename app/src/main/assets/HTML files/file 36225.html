<p>In MySql,  you can't have an <code>ORDER BY</code> as part of the <code>UPDATE</code> directly when using multiple tables (see this <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>). Try this instead :</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE student AS table1
        INNER JOIN (
        SELECT st.student_id, st.roll_no, st.name, st.teacher_approval
        FROM student AS st
            JOIN (
            SELECT * FROM
            classes AS cl
            WHERE cl.standard = '".$standard."'
            ) AS tmp
            ON tmp.student_id = st.student_id
            WHERE st.teacher_approval = '1'
            ORDER BY st.name ASC
        ) AS table2 
        ON table2.student_id = table1.student_id
    SET table1.roll_no = @incr:=@incr+1
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
