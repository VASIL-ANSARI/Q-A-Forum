<p>I'm afraid thats not the ZAP code, and ZAP does not use it in any way.</p>

<p>The ZAP code lives in <a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy</a> and is very well maintained :)</p>

<p>However I probably wouldnt recommend using the ZAP code as a basis for a long running server right now - we are improving ZAP so that it can be used like this but there are currently still limitations.</p>
