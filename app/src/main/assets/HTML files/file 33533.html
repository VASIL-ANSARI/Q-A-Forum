<p>So, about a minute after I posted this I discovered QProcess's signal <code>readyReadStandardError()</code>, which operates identically to <code>readyReadStandardOutput</code> except that it is emitted when whatever the QProcess is running has an error. I connected this to a slot identical to what I have above but instead printing <code>QString(process-&gt;readAllStandardError()).toStdString()</code> and it worked.</p>
