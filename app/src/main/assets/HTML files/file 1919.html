<p>Based on the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=__builtin_apply_args" rel="nofollow">code snippets I found via google</a>, I would say that the size value is not something you can directly compute without more platform specific information (or at least knowing the calling convention). If the size is too small, then you won't pass enough arguments on the stack and the function will do something unspecified. If the size is too large, then you'll just use up unnecessary stack space.</p>
