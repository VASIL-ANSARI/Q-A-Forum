<p>First, I am not really sure why you are switching to the SLF4J API since the Log4j 2 API supports everything SLF4J does and much more. In my own code I have found that switching only requires changing the imports and LoggerFactory to LogManager.</p>

<p>Configurator is a class in Log4j 1 that is used to configure Log4j. It is similar to the Configurator class in Log4j 2.  You probably want to call one of the initialize methods.</p>
