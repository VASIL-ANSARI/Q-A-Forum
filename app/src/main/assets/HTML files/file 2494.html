<p>If you use <code>compare:options</code> with NSLiteralString, it should compare character by character, that is, the Unicode code points, regardless of the grapheme.  The default behavior of <code>compare:</code> is to use no options.  You could use <code>- decomposedStringWithCanonicalMapping</code> to get the Unicode bytes of the input string, but I'm not sure how that would interact with <code>compare:</code>.</p>
