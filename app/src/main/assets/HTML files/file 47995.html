<p>It sounds like you are not including the required Amazon widgets js library on the page where your trying to render the addressBook.  To confirm, open up console and see if you get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"ReferenceError: OffAmazonPayments is not defined"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If so, simply included the sandbox or production js file:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script type='text/javascript' 
    src='https://static-na.payments-amazon.com/OffAmazonPayments/us/sandbox/js/Widgets.js'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script type='text/javascript' 
    src=='https://static-na.payments-amazon.com/OffAmazonPayments/us/js/Widgets.js'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, your above code is to render Amazon's address book, not wallet.  The wallet (selecting credit card) is required for payment and the address book (selecting shipping address) is optional.
