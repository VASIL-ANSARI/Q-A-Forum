<p>I have encountered a similar issue and I resolved it by exiting Visual Studio and deleting the <code>.suo</code> file from my solution folder.</p>

<p>This file is recreated when you open the project again and it is not harmful to delete it.</p>

<p>The <code>.suo</code> is used for storing the layout of your solutions, the breakpoints you've set, the tabs you had open, etcetera.
I am not sure why this worked but my logic was that Visual Studio thought I was trying to place a breakpoint in a location different to where I was actually placing it.</p>
