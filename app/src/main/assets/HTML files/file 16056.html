<p>Your problem is the usage of the global current variable. Start using closures:</p>

<pre><code>(function(c){
    timer = setInterval(function() { showImage(c) },2000);
})(current);
</code></pre>

<p>this way at the moment of the click you'll pass current to the function, and 2 seconds later you'll pass THAT value to showImage and not current'v value whatever it may be 2 seconds later.</p>

<p>However trying to understand what you want to do... I think the better way would be something like this:</p>

<p>Instead of doing fade to an element that you "calculate" by the value of current, I would try to use classes to "sign" the "current" element: $(this).addClass("current") or something like that, and in the fade I would use $('#contG').find('li:.current').fadeOut("slow", function(){$(this).removeClass("current")});</p>
