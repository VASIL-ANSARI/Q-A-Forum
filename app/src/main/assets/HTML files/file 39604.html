<p>It doesn't <em>run</em> because you're passing <code>scanf</code> the variable, but you should pass the address of the variable, i.e. use:</p>

<pre><code>scanf("%i", &amp;something);
</code></pre>

<p>instead of <code>scanf("%i", something);</code></p>

<hr>

<p>Also, as others pointed out, you're mixing <code>char</code> and <code>int</code> too liberally, so it won't work as expected.</p>

<p><code>year</code> and <code>year_imput</code> can't be chars because they won't hold values large enough, you'll need at least a short.</p>
