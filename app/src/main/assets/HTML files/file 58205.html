<p>Converting both images back to .jpg, and using <a href="http://regex.info/exif.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://regex.info/exif.cgi</a>, the following header comments appear:</p>

<p>One:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v80), quality = 90</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v62), quality = 90</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(can't remember which order I converted the images in, but there is a version change either way)</p>

<p>As you can see, they have upgraded the JPEG compressor (or spec?) to a newer version, resulting in a different JPEG encoding, or at least difference in the comments.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, there does not seem to be an issue with your base64 converter, but just that the two images actually are different</p>
