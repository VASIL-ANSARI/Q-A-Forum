<p>Kind of weird code here... so I gather that this is making a query, which will return a list of hyperlinks as a result, and you are screen-scraping the result for the first hyperlink, then you are trying to load the content of that second link? Well, are you sure the server is returning a valid hyperlink? Try loading the page in your browser.</p>

<p>If it's valid then I'm not sure what the issue is, but why wouldn't you use <code>WebView.loadUrl()</code>, and let the browser component take care of it?</p>
