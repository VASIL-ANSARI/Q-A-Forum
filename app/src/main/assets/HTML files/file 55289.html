<p>If I understand correctly, you're just needing an array of object with three properties. I think, what you can do is just to map through your records and return object with the data you just need. Something like this</p>

<pre><code>x.records.map(function(record) {
  return {name: record.name, score: record.score, IP: record.IP};
});
</code></pre>
