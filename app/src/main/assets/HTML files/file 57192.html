<p>Remove <code>*= require_tree .</code> from application.css.scss. This line includes all the css file in all the pages</p>

<p>To include the controller specific stylesheet include this tag in each view<br>
<code>&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag params[:controller] %&gt;</code></p>

<p>If you have css that you want to include across all pages you can include
<code>*= require_tree ./common_dir</code> in application.css.scss and create the common_dir under assets/stylesheets</p>
