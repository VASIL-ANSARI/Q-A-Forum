<p>Easiest way - if it doesn't interfere with the rest of your code - is to simply set the node as not selected in the SelectedNodeChanged method.</p>

<pre><code>protected void TreeView1_SelectedNodeChanged(object sender, EventArgs e){
  // Do whatever you're doing
  TreeView1.SelectedNode.Selected = false;
}
</code></pre>
