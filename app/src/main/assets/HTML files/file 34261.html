<p>I ended up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uninstalling RabbitMQ and Erlang.</li>
<li>Removed <code>C:\Users\username\AppData\RabbitMQ</code></li>
<li>Restarted because at least one piece of Erlang (epmd.exe) was still running.</li>
<li>Reinstalled Erlang and RabbitMQ.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?</p>
