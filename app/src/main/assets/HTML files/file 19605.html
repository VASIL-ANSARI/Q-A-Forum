<p>Solved! This has to do with funky cakePHP $model->saveAll() on hasMany relationships.</p>

<p>In order to correctly update this form, all advisors that <strong>may</strong> be changed in saveAll() must unset their relationship to their respective rooms and saved in the database</p>

<pre><code>foreach($copyOfData['Advisor'] as $advisor) {
    $advisor['room_id'] = null;
    $this-&gt;Advisor-&gt;save(array('Advisor' =&gt; $advisor));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Only after this has been done, can we call <code>$this-&gt;Advisor-&gt;saveAll($this-&gt;request-&gt;data, array('deep' =&gt; true))</code> and have <code>saveAll()</code> behave as expected.</p>
