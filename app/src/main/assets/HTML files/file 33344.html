<p>try to implement this, hope it will help:</p>

<pre><code>double angle = Math.atan2(dlat, dlon); // in radians
</code></pre>

<p>This is assuming your arrow is pointing along the horizontal axis(due east) by default. You might have to tweak it by whatever direction your arrow drawable is pointing. For example, if it's pointing a constant 90 degrees off, just rotate it an additional 0.5*PI rads to align it.</p>
