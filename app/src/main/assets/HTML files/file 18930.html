<p>Assuming <code>pen.forward(length / (Math.pow(3, length)));</code> draws a straight line :</p>

<p>The formation of a Koch curve is recursive. To draw a level n Koch curve, you'll need to draw four level (n-1) curves. The pseudo code for drawing Koch curves is like this:</p>

<pre><code>drawKochCurve (length, level):
    if level = 0:
        drawStraightLine(length)
    else:
        drawKochCurve(length / 3, level - 1)
        turnLeft(60)
        drawKochCurve(length / 3, level - 1)
        turnRight(120)
        drawKochCurve(length / 3, level - 1)
        turnLeft(60)
        drawKochCurve(length / 3, level - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>In your code, I see there's one recursive call. Instead of drawing straight lines, you need to draw smaller Koch curves. Draw Straight lines only at the base cases.</p>
