<p>I partially have found the answer to my question:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-implementation-details.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL documentation says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the slave stops before the SQL thread has executed all the fetched statements, the I/O thread has at least fetched everything so that a safe copy of the statements is stored locally in the slave's relay logs, ready for execution the next time that the slave starts. This enables the master server to purge its binary logs sooner because it no longer needs to wait for the slave to fetch their contents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This indicates that it is perfectly possible to resume the import process (execution of the statements), however, it still remains unclear</p>

<ol>
<li>if I need to <code>start slave</code> before the described things happen and</li>
<li>what happens if the slave doesn't find its master if I do <code>start slave</code>.</li>
</ol>
