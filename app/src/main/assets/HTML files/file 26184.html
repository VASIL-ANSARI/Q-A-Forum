<p>What you have is an handler method for the <code>MouseWheel</code> event. You need to attach your handler method to the <code>MouseWheel</code> event for the chart control. From the method signature, I assume that your chart control is named <code>chData</code>, so you could use the following code in your form's constructor:</p>

<pre><code>chData.MouseWheel += new EventHandler(chData_MouseWheel);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you could also associate the handler with the event at design time. To do that, use the Properties Window and click the lightning bolt in the toolbar to switch to the "Events" view. Then find the <code>MouseWheel</code> event, click the drop-down arrow, and select your handler method's signature. This will cause the designer to write the above code into the code-behind file for your form.</p>

<p>Aside from that, there's a giant red flag in your code: an empty <code>catch</code> block. If you aren't handling an exception or doing anything with it, then you should not be catching it. This isn't Pokemon, there's no reward for catching them all.</p>
