<p>The <strong>collision()</strong> method must be defined as follows to be invoked as you show:</p>

<pre><code>void collision(UFO ufo) {
    // collision implementation
}
</code></pre>

<p>The return type does not have to be <strong>void</strong> (it can be anything including <strong>Object</strong> actually depending on whether it returns something), but the method signature must have a single parameter of type <strong>UFO</strong>.</p>
