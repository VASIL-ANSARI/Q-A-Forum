<p>The error means you have reached maximum method count in your app. That does include any libraries that you use for your project.</p>

<p>There are two ways to tackle the issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get rid of any third-party libraries that you don't really need. If you use google play services that might contribute a lot to the method count. Fortunately as of the latest play-services release it <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html#split">is possible to include only parts</a> of the framework.</li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/building/multidex.html">multi dex setup</a> for your application. </li>
</ol>
