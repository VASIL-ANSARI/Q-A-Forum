<p>You say you want to run the file <em>after your build.</em> <code>execute_process()</code> runs at CMake-time, not at build time. What you're looking for would be <code>add_custom_command()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>add_executable(LicenseStamper stamper.cpp)

add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT stamped_file.lic
  COMMAND LicenseStamper any other arguments
  DEPENDS any/dependency.file
  COMMENT "Stamping the license"
  VERBATIM
)

add_custom_target(
  StampTheLicense ALL
  DEPENDS stamped_file.lic
)
</code></pre>

<p>The custom command will run the executable (and build it first, if necessary). The custom target will drive the custom command - it depends on the command's output, so when the target is built, it will require its dependency to be built, causing the custom command to run.</p>
