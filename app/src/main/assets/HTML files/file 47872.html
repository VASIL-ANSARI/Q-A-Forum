<p>The important thing to realize here, is that <code>Focus</code> and <code>Accessibility Focus</code> are not the same thing.  </p>

<p>You are looking for the following:</p>

<pre><code>welcomeText.sendAccessibilityEvent(AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_FOCUSED);
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful about when you do this.  Doing this in onCreate is probably a bad idea, as then it will only happen when the application activity is loaded.  What you probably want is for it to happen each time it is resumed.  Also, the AT (TalkBack) creates its connection to the Activity at some point in this lifecycle, and so you want to be sure you don't have a race condition.  TalkBack must connect to your activity before you post your Accessibility Event.</p>

<p>Though note, that this may be a bad requirement.  WCag 3.2.1 and 3.2.3 clearly state that navigation should be consistent and predictable, and part of this is avoiding unexpected shifts of focus.  This could be considered a violation of these guidelines, and actually less accessible than not doing so.</p>
