<p>The <code>toArray()</code> method doesn't actually know that it's being called on a set of <code>Position[]</code>s; all it knows is that it's being called on a set. (This is because of how generics are implemented in Java; not very much information is available at run-time.) So, it just returns an <code>Object[]</code> full of <code>Partition[]</code>s, rather than returning a true <code>Partition[][]</code>. (The difference being that an <code>Object[]</code> <em>can</em> contain arbitrary objects &mdash; it would be valid, after your call, to write <code>saved_pos[0] = new Object()</code> &mdash; whereas a true <code>Partition[][]</code> would raise a <code>ArrayStoreException</code> if you tried to set one of its elements to <code>new Object()</code>.)</p>

<p>Fortunately, there's a separate <code>toArray(...)</code> method that can be used, where you <em>tell</em> it what array type you want, like so:</p>

<pre><code>Position[][] saved_pos = save.keySet().toArray(new Position[0][]);
</code></pre>
