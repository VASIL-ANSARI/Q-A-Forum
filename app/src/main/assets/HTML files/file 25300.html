<p>Just from the top of my head (without actually knowing how big your snapshot files would get):</p>

<p>Have you tried Google's Gson JSON library? It seems to provide both versioning (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Versioning-Support" rel="nofollow">https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Versioning-Support</a>) and streaming (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gson/streaming" rel="nofollow">https://sites.google.com/site/gson/streaming</a>) for JSON-based documents.</p>

<p>And now that we are talking JSON, how about storing the snapshots in e.g. CouchDB (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB</a>) documents?</p>

<p>JSON may take a bit more space but it is readable.</p>
