<p>Checklists in Trello are a bit weird. A checklist belongs to a board. The same checklist can be on several cards. But each card has separate checklist item states (checked/unchecked). I don't think it's possible to add the same checklist to more than one card on trello.com, but that's how it's modeled behind the scenes.</p>

<p>As of release 0.5.5-beta Trello.NET supports this. Use <code>Trello.Cards.ChangeCheckItemState</code>. More info <a href="https://github.com/dillenmeister/Trello.NET/issues/8" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>This example shows how to loop through a cardÂ´s check lists and check items.</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var checkList in trello.Cards.WithId("a card id").Checklists)
{
    Console.WriteLine(checkList.Name);

    foreach (var checkItem in checkList.CheckItems)             
        Console.WriteLine("\t{0}: {1}", checkItem.Name, checkItem.Checked);
}
</code></pre>
