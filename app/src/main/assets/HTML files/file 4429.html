<p>Try this in your CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.item {position: relative; margin-bottom: 30px;}
.item .caption {position: absolute; bottom: -20px;}
</code></pre>

<p>That should get close enough to tweak it further yourself. The "margin-bottom" will expand the space available under each item, and a larger negative "bottom" will move the caption text lower down.</p>
