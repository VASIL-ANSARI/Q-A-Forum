<p>I was working on your question and this are my results, first of all you need to get you CurrentGraphicsContent, if you don't do this, you can't draw anything, so try with this code</p>

<pre><code>override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
    super.draw(rect)

    if let ctx = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext() {
        ctx.setFillColor(UIColor.blue.cgColor)
        ctx.addEllipse(in: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100))
        ctx.fillPath()

        UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
    }
    // Drawing code
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps you</p>
