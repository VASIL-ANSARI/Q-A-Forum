<p>NSToolbar, sadly, canât really be subclassed. Itâs a poorly-written class that tries to be very âmagic,â so itâs not even a subclass of NSViewâyou canât control how it draws at all, it creates a private view.</p>

<p>You can set its âsizeModeâ but I assume youâve already done that and found that the number of pixels high isnât what you want.</p>

<p>The easiest thing to do is just leave space for your widgets at the top of your window (above the document content) and have autolayout position your buttons for you. (I havenât been able to use a real NSToolbar in years because of its limitations.)</p>

<p>As for the popUp menu being mis-aligned with the button: where the menu draws is basically hard-coded, so if you use a button style that NSPopUpButton doesn't expect then the menu will be offset some.</p>

<p>If youâve already tried just unchecking the âdraws borderâ flag on a default-style NSPopUpButton (one fresh off the palette), There are two solutions for to try: One is to keep trying different buttonStyles that look correct to your eye until you find one thatâs not offset. Two is to leave the buttonStyle do the default for NSPopUpButtons but subclass the buttonCell and have it not draw the border (but still leave room for it).</p>
