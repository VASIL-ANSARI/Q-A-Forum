<p>Remove the period for integer division:</p>

<pre><code>int((226553150*1023473145)/5)
</code></pre>

<p>Comes out as 46374212988031350 for me.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> after @tobias_k's comment:
This only works in Python2, where <code>/</code> is either floating point division (if either of the arguments is float) or integer division (if both arguments are integers).
In Python3 (or with <code>from __future__ import division</code> in Python2) <code>/</code> is always floating point division and the rounding problem comes up again, because the numbers you multiply are too large to be exactly expressed in floating point.</p>

<p>The solution is either to use <code>//</code>, which is always integer division in all Python versions or (if you really need the denominator to be float) to switch to <a href="http://mpmath.org/" rel="nofollow">mpmath</a>, where you can increase the floating point precision until you don't have the rounding errors anymore.</p>
