<p>I've run <a href="http://jsperf.com/selector-event-battle/2" rel="nofollow">performance tests</a>. Turns out that using more complicated selectors + filtering items using <code>.not()</code> + handling events instead of triggering them is the fastest option. The worst option is to loop all elements to filter them and trigger an event.</p>
