<p>Elaborating on my comment (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/724856/picking-out-items-from-a-python-list-which-have-specific-indexes#724881">Picking out items from a python list which have specific indexes</a>)</p>

<pre><code>from sys import argv
import csv

if len(argv) == 4:
  script, inputFile, outputFile, cols_str = argv
  cols = [int(i) for i in cols_str.split(",")]

with open(inputFile,"r") as fin:
  with open(outputFile,"w") as fout:
    writer=csv.writer(fout)
    for row in csv.reader(fin):
      sublist = [row[x] for x in cols]
      writer.writerow(sublist)
</code></pre>

<p>This should (untested) keep all the columns that are given as comma-separated list in the 3rd parameter. To remove the given colums, </p>

<pre><code>sublist = [row[x] for x not in cols]
</code></pre>

<p>should do the trick.</p>
