<p>Add a card background view whose <code>backgroundColor</code> has a transparency (<code>alpha</code>) set to less than 1 (maybe 0.5) when it is the top card. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>View
    Card (back card outer view)
        Card Background view
        Card Icon view
        Card Label view
    Card (front card outer view)
        Card Background view
        Card Icon view
        Card label view
</code></pre>

<p>You'll then be able to see the back card through the front card.</p>

<p>The card outer view allows moving the card as a whole by just change the <code>frame</code> of the outer view.</p>

<p>The Card outer view <code>backgroundColor</code> should be clear (e.g., <code>[UIColor clearColor]</code>).</p>

<p>Result will look something like this (the front and back "cards" are offset to make it easier to see content of both cards):</p>
