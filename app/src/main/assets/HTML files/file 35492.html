<p>The problem you're having is that you're using <code>perspective</code> as a seperate CSS property. If you look <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you'll see that <code>perspective</code> is simply a "command" you can pass to <code>transform</code>.</p>

<p>Another point: if you look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform#Browser_compatibility" rel="nofollow">this</a> you'll see as of version 16 of firefox the <code>-moz</code> is no longer needed.</p>

<p>The fix is relatively simple, just do exactly as you've done for chrome (webkit) compatibility:</p>

<pre><code>.book {
    position: relative;
    transform: perspective(100px) rotateY(-2deg);
    -webkit-transform: perspective(100px) rotateY(-2deg);
    outline: 1px solid transparent;
    box-shadow: none;
    margin: 0;
}
</code></pre>
