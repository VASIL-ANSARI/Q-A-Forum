<p>You are using the ClientID in your jQuery call, which might not always be the same.  You need to retrieve the ClientID of that control from ASP.NET when the page is loading in order for that code to work more consistently.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$("#&lt;%= UCCalender11_textDate1.ClientID %&gt;").datepicker({
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you need to change <code>UCCalender11_textDate1</code> to whatever the TextBox control's ID value is in ASP.NET (if that's not it).</p>
