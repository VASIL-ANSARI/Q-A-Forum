<p>it depends on what arduino libraries do you use to connect the arduino to android. as far as I know... Arduino Mega 2560 ADK has an USB host interface and can communicate starting with android 2.2.3
you can check <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/adk.html" rel="nofollow">Google's ADK documentation</a></p>
