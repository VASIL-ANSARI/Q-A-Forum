<p>As far as I know XUL is only allowed to run in the parent (chrome) process. So the HTML page itself in which you're embedding the XUL iframe also has to run in chrome, i.e. the containing <code>&lt;xul:browser&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;xul:iframe&gt;</code> has to be flagged non-remote and probably chrome-privileged.</p>
