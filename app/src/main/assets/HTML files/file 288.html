<p>The following is the solution:</p>

<pre><code>private void frmMainLoad(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ActiveControl = textBox1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The better question would however be why... I'm not entirely sure what the answer to that one is.</p>

<p>Edit: I suspect it is something to do with the fact that both the form, and the TabControl are containers, but I'm not sure.</p>
