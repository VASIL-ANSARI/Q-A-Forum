<p>You can use something like <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/ssl_requirement" rel="nofollow">SSL_Requirement</a> with your create/update actions. It seems SSL_Requirement is older (not that it needs to be updated, it's not terribly complicated), but there may be a newer gem/plugin that people prefer now.</p>
