<p>This is uniquely a problem with a mouse. If you drag with a mouse, as you release with the menu open, it will complete the click...</p>

<p>...which upon seeing that the menu is open will close it.</p>

<p>If you test with a touch device, you will see that a click does not complete its event and the menu operates as intended. If you happen to already be using modernizr <a href="https://modernizr.com" rel="nofollow">https://modernizr.com</a> in your project, you can simply only enable swipe for touch devices like so:</p>

<pre><code>$('html.touch .hamburger').swipe({
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. I see that the latest versions of modernizr don't support that particular test anymore. They use the touchevents class and test instead. <a href="https://modernizr.com/docs" rel="nofollow">https://modernizr.com/docs</a></p>
