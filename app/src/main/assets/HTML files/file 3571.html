<p>If I recall correctly, the use of ordinals like you describe is being deprecated by Microsoft in a future release of SQL Server. I could be wrong on this, but I think that's the case. I've always liked using them in certain cases because it involves less typing when you're dealing with derived columns that contain a longish query.</p>
