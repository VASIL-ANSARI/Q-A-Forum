<p>In general, it's not a good idea to use the same JVM in latency-optimized workload (your REST API) as well as throughput-optimized workload (your CPU-intensive work). It will be difficult to tune the garbage collection in a way that's specific to the type of your workload. Simpler and smaller JVMs will be more predictable.</p>

<p>Specifically to your question, make sure you pass the <code>-XX:+UseThreadPriorities</code> flag as described <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E15289_01/doc.40/e15062/optionxx.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and run the application as root if on Linux.</p>
