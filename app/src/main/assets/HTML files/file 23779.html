<p>R is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language" rel="nofollow">interpreted language</a>, whereas C++ is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language" rel="nofollow">compiled language</a>. This means that the source code will not be run interactively. Loading and running source code on the fly from your IDE is something that is not possible, except during debugging ("edit-and-continue").</p>

<p>However, there are some recent projects that try to add an interactive layer on top of C++, e.g. <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cling" rel="nofollow">Cling</a> and the <a href="http://cppnow.org/session/the-projucer-live-coding-with-c-and-the-llvm-jit-engine/" rel="nofollow">Projucer</a>. In other compiled languages such as the D programming language (a cousin of C++), source code can be <a href="http://dlang.org/rdmd.html" rel="nofollow">directly run</a> from the command line. </p>
