<p>Before asking a question like this, you should <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html" rel="nofollow">profile</a> your code to find out which part takes the most time.</p>

<p>But anyway, I see you have implemented a substring search function. Using the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.find" rel="nofollow"><code>find</code> string method</a> instead should give a significant speed-up.</p>

<p>Note also that a compression algorithm implemented in Python is not going to be as fast as one in eg. C, not even close.</p>
