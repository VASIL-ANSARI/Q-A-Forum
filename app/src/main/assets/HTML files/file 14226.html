<p>Ok, I ended up writing a temporary solution.. its a bit hacky, but I just manually remove the DOM from the carousel</p>

<pre><code>            jQuery(formPhoto.gallery.carousel.contentEl).find("[src*=\"" + formPhoto.activeObj.value[e.target.originalImages[e.target.currentIndex].id].file + "\"]").parent().remove();
            //we look for the image that contains the same filename as the one we're trying to delete.
            //so we just remove that.

            formPhoto.gallery.cache.images.splice(e.target.currentIndex,1);

            delete formPhoto.activeObj.value[e.target.originalImages[e.target.currentIndex].id];
            e.target.originalImages.splice(e.target.currentIndex, 1);


            formPhoto.activeObj.object.find("[type=amountadded]").html(formPhoto.activeObj.valueLength() + " photos");

            if(formPhoto.gallery.cache.images.length == 0)
                formPhoto.gallery.hide();
            else   {
                //real hacky job. Atleast it looks like a real cool effect occured.
                formPhoto.galleryInitiate(formPhoto.activeObj, e.target.originalImages);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Also fixed the issue of the images reappearing, was because the newly generated files had the same filenames. Added a date component to the file names for the mean time.</p>
