<p>If this is a winforms application, then you need to take a couple of steps:</p>

<p>1) Add references to each of the UserControl project DLLs to your application.</p>

<p>2) Add the controls to your tab pages. There are two options:</p>

<p>a) Add the control through code at run time.</p>

<p>b) Add the control to the form at design time (I prefer this method, but both are correct). To do this: open the form that you want to place the controls on, open the toolbox, if it isn't already, then drag each of the project DLLs onto the toolbox. This should create items in the toolbox to chose from that match your usercontrols. Create a tab for each user control, then drag the appropriate item from the toolbar to the tab; this should create the user control in the tab.</p>
