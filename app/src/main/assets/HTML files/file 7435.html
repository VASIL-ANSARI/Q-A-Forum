<p>Image taken from your iPhone Camera will have orientation<code>(UIImageOrientation)</code> information (EXIF info). This tells exactly in what orientation the image is. If the Viewer is capable of understanding this info , it will display them properly else you will see the images as it is (I guess Safari doesn't respect the orientation, just compare opening with safari).  </p>

<p>Now, There is a (pseudo) standard procedure followed after image capture to make it default orientation (UIImageOrientationUp) and internally rotating the actual image - which makes the image viewable on any viewer.   </p>

<p>please check the following post and use the scaleAndRotate function. This shall address your issue.
