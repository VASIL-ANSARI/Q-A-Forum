<p>OK -- There are a few things going on here:</p>

<p>1) You mention that the Tomcat server is pre-installed on the machine, but yet you have the directory specified in your target directory.  This is not a good idea as that will get wiped out after a <code>mvn clean</code>.</p>

<p>2) For pre-installed Tomcat you are not setting the <code>type</code> to <code>existing</code> inside the deployer configuration.</p>

<p>3) Where is your context definition?  Do you have a context fragment file or are you using a tomcat.xml file inside the WEB-INF directory in the WAR?  </p>

<p>Bottom line a combination of configuration errors are holding you back.  Post an updated Maven configuration and addition details about the XML context definition and I can help you further.</p>
