<p>You don't really need regular expressions if you just want to get pathname without leading slash. Since <code>location.pathname</code> always starts with <code>/</code> you can simply take the substring from the first index:</p>

<pre><code>document.location.pathname.substr(1) // or .slice(1)
</code></pre>
