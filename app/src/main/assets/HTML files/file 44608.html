<p>I think you should be able to get rid of this with a binding. You'll need to implement INotifyPropertyChanged somewhere - I'm using the MVVM Light framework here, which uses RaisePropertyChanged. </p>

<p>XAML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MediaElement IsMuted="{Binding IsMuted}" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Codebehind/ViewModel:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// The &lt;see cref="IsMuted" /&gt; property's name.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public const string IsMutedPropertyName = "IsMuted";

private bool _isMuted = true;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Sets and gets the IsMuted property.
/// Changes to that property's value raise the PropertyChanged event. 
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public bool IsMuted
{
    get
    {
        return _isMuted;
    }

    set
    {
        if (_isMuted == value)
        {
            return;
        }

        //IsMuted will always return true
        _isMuted = true;
        RaisePropertyChanged("IsMuted");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful with this and give it some thorough testing. I'm not 100% sure I could guarantee that it'll pull the level back to 0 before you get a sample or two playing back as a very brief squawk.</p>
