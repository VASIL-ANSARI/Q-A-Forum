<p>This is controlled by the QGraphicsScene. You stated: -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I'm using a QGraphincsView that holds several elements which inherit from QGraphicsItem</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not actually the case. A QGraphicsView is a window into an area of the scene; it is a QGraphicsScene which holds items derived from QGraphicsItem.</p>

<p>You can see in the documentation that the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsscene.html" rel="nofollow">QGraphicsScene</a> has functions such as <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsscene.html#selectedItems" rel="nofollow">selectedItems()</a>, <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsscene.html#selectionArea" rel="nofollow">selectionArea()</a> and <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsscene.html#setSelectionArea" rel="nofollow">setSelectionArea()</a>. While a QGraphicsItem can be selected with <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsitem.html#setSelected" rel="nofollow">QGraphicsItem::setSelected</a>, the control of what happens when you click an item is governed by the QGraphicsScene, with the event having been passed from the QGraphicsView.</p>

<p>If you inherit from QGraphicsScene, you can override the mouse methods; <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsscene.html#mousePressEvent" rel="nofollow">mousePressEvent</a>, <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsscene.html#mouseMoveEvent" rel="nofollow">mouseMoveEvent</a>, <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsscene.html#mouseReleaseEvent" rel="nofollow">mouseReleaseEvent</a>. This will allow you to monitor when the user selects consecutive items by clicking on them and react by calling their QGraphicsItem::setSelected function.</p>

<p>Alternatively, depending upon your design, you can allow the user to draw an area on the scene and call <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qgraphicsscene.html#setSelectionArea" rel="nofollow">QGraphicsScene::setSelectionArea</a>, which will set all the items surrounded by the given QPainterPath.</p>
