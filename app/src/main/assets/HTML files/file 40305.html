<p>You have to actually use the file upload middleware to get express to unpack that part of the request.  From the <code>multer</code> docs:</p>

<pre><code>var express = require('express')
var multer  = require('multer')

var app = express()
app.use(multer({ dest: './uploads/'}));

console.log(req.body)
console.log(req.files)
</code></pre>
