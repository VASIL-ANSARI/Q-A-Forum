<p>In order to add the table name to the query, you are going to need to add a hard-coded value to your pivot query or subquery.  You can make a change to your query to be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Value AS FieldName, 
   [42] AS [KeyID_42],[600] AS [KeyID_600],
   TableName
INTO ##Temp311037
FROM
(
  -- add hard-coded value here
  SELECT TransID, Value, FieldName, 'tblSQLContacts' as TableName
  FROM 
  (
     SELECT TransID, Convert(VarChar(250), [AccountNbr]) AS [AccountNbr], 
        [CoAdd1]) AS [CoAdd1], 
        Convert(VarChar(250), [CoAdd2]) AS [CoAdd2], 
        Convert(VarChar(250), [CoCity]) AS [CoCity], 
        Convert(VarChar(250), [CoFax]) AS [CoFax]
      FROM tblSQLContacts
   ) p
  UNPIVOT
  (
     FieldName 
     FOR Value IN ([accountNbr], [CoAdd1], [CoAdd2], [CoCity], [CoFax])
  )AS unpvt
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT
(
  MAX(FieldName)
  FOR TransID IN ([42],[600])
) AS PivotTable
WHERE [42] &lt;&gt; [600]
</code></pre>

<p>Since the value will be the same for each row, it should not alter your result of the pivot.</p>
