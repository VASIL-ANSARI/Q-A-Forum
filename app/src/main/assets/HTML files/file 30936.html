<li>Split your method into smaller testable methods: here you have a combination of input parsing (from string to some sort of collection) and probably sorting (which is difficult to follow though) -- you want to test those functionalities separately</li>
<li>Define "test cases" that you want to test, first not programmatically, but conceptually. For example you want to test if the method does not fail for empty data, works fine on sorted data, on data of size 1, of odd and even size, on a number of repeated values etc</li>
<li>Define scenarios where the method should throw an exception and write test method for that annotating them as <code>@Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)</code></li>
<li><p>Per test case implement a test method in the following form (this particular piece of code may not be compilable :)</p>

<pre><code>@Test
public testPresortedValues()
{
    List&lt;Integer&gt; data = Lists.newArrayList(1, 1, 1, 2, 25, 30);
    List&lt;Integer&gt; expected = Lists.newArrayList(1, 1, 1, 2, 25, 30);
    Sorter sorter = new Sorter();
    sorter.sort(data);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.size(); ++i)
    {
         Asser.assertEquals(data.get(i), expected.get(i);
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
