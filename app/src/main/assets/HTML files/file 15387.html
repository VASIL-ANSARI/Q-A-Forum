<p>I knew it was simple, just a dumb PHP mistake, it has been too long since I used PHP last:</p>

<pre><code>//SOAP CALL
function sayHello(){
    $client = new SoapClient('http://Server:8080/MyClassService/MyClass?WSDL');
    $response = (array) $client-&gt;glassfishHello();      
    return $response['return'];
}
</code></pre>
