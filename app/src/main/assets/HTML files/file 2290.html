<p><a href="http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/GNUstepWeb" rel="nofollow">GNUStepWeb</a> is a web framework based on the Objective-C version of NeXT's WebObjects (Apple's WebObjects being Java only), but it has no particular support for JSON. It's certainly possible to get it to write JSON data, of course.</p>
