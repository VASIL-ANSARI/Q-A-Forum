<p><strong>If it is just about dumping :</strong></p>

<p>If i get your problem the solution holds in two lines (If you are following SQL standards) :</p>

<pre><code> pg_dump &lt;yourdatabase&gt;

 mysql &lt; &lt;yourfile.sql&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With the first line you are dumping your database, many options exists whether you want to dump tables, content, schemas, etc... go to the man page for more details</p>

<p>With the second lines you are just loading them into your mysql.</p>

<p><strong>If it is about mapping :</strong></p>

<p>Take a look a <a href="http://kettle.pentaho.com/" rel="nofollow">Kettle</a>, it's an Open Source ETL, it works really well on Linux and you can automize task using crontabs.</p>

<p>Hope I could help,</p>
