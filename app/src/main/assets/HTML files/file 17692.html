<p>In the time it would take to figure it out, I could build a full working example using a different slider plugin.  I suggest you get a slider plugin which has documentation and is more modern.  Sorry this doesn't answer your question, but the GalleryView slider is over 2 years old... which is dead and rotting in web speak.</p>
