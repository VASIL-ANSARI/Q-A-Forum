<p>First of all <code>query string</code> is normally used to describe the values passed on the URL after the <code>?</code> character i.e. <code>example.com/script.php?a=1&amp;b=2&amp;c=3</code></p>

<p>Your issue is nothing to do with displaying the value of the variable <code>$sqlCheck;</code>.</p>

<p>If you actually read the error message it is saying <strong>I cannot find the file you are trying to include using the</strong> <code>require_once</code> <strong>command</strong></p>

<p>Remember that the <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> functions expect the path to the file that you are including to be relative to the location of the script that they are located in.</p>

<p>As you statement is <code>require_once('config.php');</code> then PHP expects to find it in the same directory as this script.</p>

<p>I would therefore assume that <code>config.php</code> <strong>does not exist in the same directory as the script</strong> The second error message is saying that PHP also cannot find this file in any of the directories that you (or someone) have configure the PHP search path to be either.</p>

<p>Change the statement so that the <code>require_once('config.php');</code> is correctly path'd</p>
