<p>I usually use </p>

<pre><code>private readonly object m_lock = new object();
</code></pre>

<p>And every time you are accessing your method do the following:</p>

<pre><code>lock(m_lock){
     // your code goes here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using this will ensure that only one thread at a time can access this piece of code. Hope this helps</p>
