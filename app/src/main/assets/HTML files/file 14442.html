<p>You're probably asking how they made a desktop application using what looks just like HTML/CSS/JS. They didn't.</p>

<p>The source code you link to is Nitro for web, it's a Chrome extension.</p>

<p>The source for the desktop version is different and is hosted over at launchpad:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/nitrotasks/" rel="nofollow">Nitrotasks Desktop</a> project page</li>
<li><a href="https://launchpad.net/nitrotasks/trunk/1.2.5/+download/nitrotasks_1.2.5.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">Nitrotasks Desktop Source Code</a> download link</li>
</ul>

<p>The desktop version is a Python application, as you can see from <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cooperjona/nitrotasks/quickly_trunk/files/head:/nitrotasks/" rel="nofollow">browsing around the code</a>.</p>

<p>It has files like <code>NitroTasksWindow.py</code>, and uses GTK for windowing.</p>
