<p>The standard and popular way to do it is with .htaccess file. You should learn how to use .htaccess rewrite rule for this. It should look like:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine on

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/([^/]+)(/.*)?$ $3?$1=$2 [N,QSA]
RewriteRule ^(/[^/]+|[^/]+/|/?)$ /index.php [L,QSA]
</code></pre>

<p>This would run at the Apache level, which is probably what you want.</p>
