<p>Although my bokeh plots are embedded and served in a Django app, I believe I have stumbled on a solution to this. Instead of specifying x_range and y_range inside the TimeSeries constructor, put these lines after the two TimeSeries objects have been created:</p>

<pre><code>fig_ca.x_range = ew_kpi.x_range
fig_ca.y_range = ew_kpi.y_range
</code></pre>

<p>and you should find them linked together. In my case I only linked the x_range.</p>
