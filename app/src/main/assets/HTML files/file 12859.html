<p>No it isn't, a hard link points to only one file.</p>

<p>You have the added complexity that your app is a third party app... The only solution I see would be to write a dynamic object overriding the file methods <em>only for a particular path</em> so that, for instance, <code>read()</code> would start with the first file, then go on to the second after having finished the third etc. Uh. Good luck!</p>
