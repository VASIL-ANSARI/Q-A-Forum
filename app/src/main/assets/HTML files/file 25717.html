<p>Yes, valgrind can definitely help you. In addition to a lot of heap-based analysis (illegal frees, memory leaks, etc.) its memcheck tool detects illegal reads and writes, i.e. situations when your program accesses memory that it should not access. This analysis does not differentiate between static and dynamic memory: it would report accesses outside of a stack frame, accesses beyond bounds of a static array, and so on. It also detects access to variables that have not been onitialized previously. Both situations are undefined behavior, and can lead to crash.</p>
