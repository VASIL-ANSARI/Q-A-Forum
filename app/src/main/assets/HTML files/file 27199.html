<p>Most possibly that you use Windows and after reading from the file into JList/JPanel you didn't close the file (keep the handle open). Close the file and rename it, then re-open it. On other OSes (Linux/OS X) you will be able to rename the file even if it's used by your component. But I guess your java app should be cross-platform.</p>
