<p>I don't think Imagick has anything built in for it, so you would have to create a new palette (copy colors from the old one with an offset) and then use <code>$pixel = $average::getImagePixelColor()</code> and then do <code>$pixel-&gt;getColor()</code> and <code>$pixel-&gt;setColor()</code> according to the new palette.</p>
