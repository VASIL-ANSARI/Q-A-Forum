<p>The browser is preventing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" rel="nofollow">cross-site scripting</a>. You have to use a relative path, otherwise most browsers will simply refuse to make an AJAX call.</p>

<p>As one possible workaround, you could set up a very simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy" rel="nofollow">reverse proxy</a> (with <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html" rel="nofollow">mod_proxy</a> if you are using Apache). This would allow you to use relative paths in your AJAX request, while the HTTP server would be acting as a proxy to any "remote" location. </p>

<p>The fundamental configuration directive to set up a reverse proxy in mod_proxy is the ProxyPass. You would typically use it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>ProxyPass   /ajax/stackoverflow/   http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the browser would be requesting <code>/ajax/stackoverflow/tag?tagnames=javascript</code> but the server would serve this by acting as a proxy to <code>http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag?tagnames=javascript</code>. </p>
