<p>You have an automatic public <em>property</em>, which defines a <em>private</em> field. If you ask for the non-public fields, you'll get the backing field of that property.</p>

<p>BTW, you need to ask for both <code>BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance</code>, otherwise you won't retrieve that field.</p>
