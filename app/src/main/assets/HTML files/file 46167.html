<p>The option is <code>textvariable</code>, not <code>stringvariable</code>. </p>

<p>Unrelated to this problem, when you do <code>height = Entry(...).grid(...)</code>, <code>height</code> will always be <code>None</code> since that is what <code>.grid(...)</code> returns. It is a best practice to separate widget creation from widget layout. </p>

<p>When you do that (separating creation from layout) you don't actually  need to use <code>StringVar</code>s, since you can get the value directly from the widget itself (eg: <code>hgtval = float(height.get())</code></p>
