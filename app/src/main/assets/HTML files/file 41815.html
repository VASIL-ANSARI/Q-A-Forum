<p>Not all JPA implementations would convert <code>en.name = :name</code> with <code>name</code> parameter as <code>null</code> to <code>entity.NAME = null</code>. The implementation I use (DataNucleus JPA), for example, converts it to <code>entity.NAME IS NULL</code> IIRC. </p>

<p>JPQL doesn't tell an implementation what SQL to execute, just what the user can define. The rest is for the implementation to decide. It's for the user to decide which implementation to use.</p>
