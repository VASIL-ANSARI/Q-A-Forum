<p>There are a few things to note in here.... I have done (I'm a JDOM maintainer) extensive work on JDOM 2.0.1 especially in regards to performance of XPath evaluation. Here are some numbers:</p>

<p>Read it from the bottom up.</p>

<p>Here are some other interesting numbers (compares different JDOM versions with different Java VM's)</p>

<p><a href="http://hunterhacker.github.com/jdom/jdom2/performanceJDK.html" rel="nofollow">http://hunterhacker.github.com/jdom/jdom2/performanceJDK.html</a></p>

<p>The 'bottom line'....</p>

<ul>
<li>JDOM 2.x introduces faster iterators. Jaxen is <em>very</em> Iterator intensive, and the performance improvements in JDOM 2.x are significant in this regard....</li>
<li>Java 7 is <em>much</em> faster than previous versions in regard to iterator performance too.</li>
<li>There is no benefit to 'compiling' Jaxen XPaths....</li>
<li>even in the best of times though, the 'native' method of searching will be faster than the XPath version.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your biggest performance boost will come from running with Java7, then upgrading to JDOM 2.x</p>

<p>Although the 'custom' search, if written efficiently, will always be faster than XPath.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, JDOM 2.x introduces a new API for running XPath queries that you may find easier to work with (although the old API still works too): <a href="https://github.com/hunterhacker/jdom/wiki/JDOM2-Feature-XPath-Upgrade" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/hunterhacker/jdom/wiki/JDOM2-Feature-XPath-Upgrade</a></p>
