<p>I've found a solution to my problem.
The SQL scripts (some of them were omitted in the sample posted in SOF) which were declared in my "applicationContext-test.xml" file were not well ordered resulting in a view with a INVALID status. 
-> Resulting in generated SQL query done by Hibernate complaining that some tables and / or columns were'nt found.</p>

<p>I've found the problem (and also the solution) thanks to the excellent H2 web server allowing me to view in memory data. In the SCHEMA_INFORMATION section, I saw VIEWS and when clicking on it, I saw STATUS = INVALID.</p>

<p>In order to add an H2 web server using Spring XML config, you can easily add this : </p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id="h2Server" class="org.h2.tools.Server" factory-method="createTcpServer" init-method="start" destroy-method="stop" depends-on="h2WebServer"&gt;
        &lt;constructor-arg value="-tcp,-tcpAllowOthers,-tcpPort,9992"/&gt;
    &lt;/bean&gt;

    &lt;bean id="h2WebServer" class="org.h2.tools.Server" factory-method="createWebServer" init-method="start" destroy-method="stop"&gt;
        &lt;constructor-arg value="-web,-webAllowOthers,-webPort,8882"/&gt;
    &lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Do not forget to add a depends-on attribute valued to "h2Server" (so : depends-on="h2Server") to you datasource bean</strong>, otherwise it will not work as expected !</p>
