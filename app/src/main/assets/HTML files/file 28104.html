<p>There are two possible scenarios I can think of. </p>

<p>The first one is just to pause the data visualization so that once resumed, the chart having been hidden will have the same points as the others.In order to do so, you may use a checkbox and recreate the chart only if the checkbox is checked/unchecked.</p>

<p>The second scenario involves skipping those data values that have been displayed on the other charts. In order to do so you only need to place the data binding inside the checkbox checked/unchecked clause.Once resumed, the chart having been paused will contain less points compared to the other non-paused charts on your page.</p>
