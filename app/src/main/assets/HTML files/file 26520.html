<p>You will need to edit the Edit the admin_svg/BB_birds_in_flight.svg manually so that the birds are in the colours you want. You cannot alter the contents of a background image from the host document. </p>

<p>When used as an image an SVG document is very similar to an ordinary png or jpeg image, it must be all in one file and it can't be manipulated from the outside. This allows hosting sites to upload SVG images and vet them secure in the knowledge that the image won't radically change later.</p>

<p>If you want the colours to change your options are limited to CSS or SMIL animation. Here's a couple of the birds with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html" rel="nofollow">SMIL animation</a> - if you put the mouse over one of the birds it will change colour, the other changes colour all the time:</p>
