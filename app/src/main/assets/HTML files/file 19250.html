<p>In the general case, this is hard, because some programs make extensive use of display control codes to draw dialogs etc.  If you just want to drop any individual unprintable characters, that's easy with <code>tr</code>, but if you want to remove display control codes, too, that's significantly more complex, and basically requires knowledge about which terminal emulator you are working with.  A plausible target would be <code>xterm</code> but I'm not aware of any off-the-shelf solutions for stripping <code>xterm</code> display codes.</p>
