<p>In all those dependencies there is one which might be duplicate. Duplicate dependency gives such an error.
Try and replace the first line in the dependencies function </p>

<pre><code>compile 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.0'
</code></pre>

<p>with </p>

<pre><code>provided 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.0'
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure if this will work but something like this worked for me before.
Try and delete dependencies which seem duplicate to you</p>
