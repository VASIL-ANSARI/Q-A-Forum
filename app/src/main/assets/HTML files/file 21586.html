<p>Setting <code>.innerHTML</code> does not evaluate <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags; it's just not what browsers do.</p>

<p>If you need to return JavaScript to be executed, you're better off just sending it as a string (without <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags) so that you can easily pass it to <code>eval()</code>.</p>

<p><em>edit</em> If you do this with jQuery instead of directly setting <code>innerHTML</code> (that is, if you use <code>$(something).html()</code>), and you add the content directly to something in the DOM (that is, not just an element that's been instantiated but not appended to the DOM), then jQuery will actively find and extract your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> content and evaluate it. </p>
