<p>What you are doing now is counting all empty occurrences of the column <code>COLUMNNAME</code> in the table <code>shiv_tab_col</code>. Which is 0 (you already found that out).</p>

<p>The solution is a bit more complicated, you need dynamic SQL to accomplish what you want to do:</p>

<pre><code>declare
  l_count pls_integer;
begin
  for r_cur in (
    select columnname
    from shiv_tab_col
  )
  loop
    execute immediate 
      'select count(1) from ser_shiv_syn where '||r_cur.columnname||' is null' 
    into l_count;
    dbms_output.put_line(l_count);
    dbms_output.put_line(r_cur.columnname);
  end loop;
end;
/
</code></pre>
