<p>In your worker class, implement Comparable interface like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Worker implements Cloneable, Comparable&lt;Worker&gt; {
....
    public int compareTo(Worker worker) {
        return Double.compare(this.salary, worker.getSalary());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then assuming you have list of workers already, you could sort like:</p>

<pre><code>Collections.sort(listOfWorkers);
</code></pre>

<p>clone has nothing to do with sorting the collection or array but you could implement multiple interfaces.</p>
