<p>Not sure in what context this is all running, but perhaps you have a statement on the page which checks to see if the menu is open, and closes it if it is, this would happens on page load ... so if the user clicks the back button and ends up on the page the below check would run ...</p>

<pre><code>if ('hidden' != divref.style.visibility) divref.style.visibility = 'hidden';
</code></pre>
