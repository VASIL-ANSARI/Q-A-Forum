<p>You are probably using a signed certificate on your ldap host on the 636 port. The client (your PHP server) is rejecting this certificate as the certificate authority in not in its known/valid ca's. 
Either get a real SSL certificate or install the certificate path on your webserver.</p>

<p>If, and only If, your webserver and ldap host are within the same network and is solely managed nu you and youare sure no data can be captured between the hosts, you could choose to not use the SSL/TLS version of the ldap protocol..</p>
