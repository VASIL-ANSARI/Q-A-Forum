<p>You won't get around maintaining two sets of proxy classes. This is completely analogous to the <code>iterator</code> and <code>const_iterator</code> nested classes of standard library containers.</p>

<p>Since you are returning a copy of the proxy class, the proxy class that contains a mutable reference to the original object cannot possibly also be used for constant-only access to the original object, so you cannot get around <em>some</em> sort of two-fold approach. The semantics of the two are different: If all you have is an instance of the proxy class, you <em>have</em> to be able to know whether it allows mutating or only read-only access.</p>
