<p>Unless you've taken a disciplined approach to separate your language from your code, such as using localization files, then no, there's no easy way to find instances of displayed text. How is a search supposed to differentiate between <code>'apple'</code> used as a type column and <code>'apple'</code> inserted into a page?</p>

<p>This is why you might want to take an approach where you don't embed language in your controllers and models. Instead you could create a helper method to describe them for you:</p>

<pre><code>You have &lt;%= pluralize_model(@apple, 10) %&gt; left.
</code></pre>

<p>That method, if constructed properly, would render <code>'10 apples'</code> or whatever term you'd like to use for that type of object.</p>
