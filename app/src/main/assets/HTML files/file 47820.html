<p>Try instead of using a raw File constructor, use the method getFileStreamPath provided by the Context. That is to say, do:</p>

<pre><code>File oldfile = ctx.getFileStreamPath("shoppinglists.tmp");
File newfile = ctx.getFileStreamPath("shoppinglists.csv");
oldFile.renameTo(newFile);
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is presumably that new File() refers to a name relative to the program's current directory, which is probably not, and certainly not guaranteed to be, the directory in which internal files are stored.</p>
