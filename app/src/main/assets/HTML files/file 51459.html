<p>Softmax is an only addition function (in logistic regression for example), it is not a model like </p>

<pre><code>model = LassoCV()
model.fit(DF_X,SR_y)
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore you can't simply give it data with fit method. However, you can simply create your model with the help of TensorFlow functions.</p>

<p>First of all, you have to create a computational graph, for example for linear  regression you will create tensors with the size of your data. They are only tensors and you will give them your array in another part of the program. </p>

<pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.placeholder("float", [4, 3])      
y_ = tf.placeholder("float",[4])
</code></pre>

<p>When you create two variables, that will contain initial weights of our model</p>

<pre><code>W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([3,1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
</code></pre>

<p>And now you can create the model (you want to create regression, not classification therefore you don't need to use tf.nn.softmax ) </p>

<pre><code>y=tf.matmul(x,W) + b
</code></pre>

<p>As you have regression and linear model you will use </p>

<pre><code>loss=tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y_ - y))
</code></pre>

<p>Then we will train our model with the same step as in the tutorial </p>

<pre><code>train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01).minimize(loss)
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you created the computational graph you have to write one more part of the program, where you will use this graph to work with your data. </p>

<pre><code>init = tf.initialize_all_variables()
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init)       
sess.run(train_step, feed_dict={x:np.asarray(DF_X),y_:np.asarray(SR_y)})
</code></pre>

<p>Here you give your data to this computational graph with the help of feed_dict. In TensorFlow you provide information in numpy arrays.
If you want to see your mistake you can write </p>

<pre><code>sess.run(loss,feed_dict={x:np.asarray(DF_X),y_:np.asarray(SR_y)}) 
</code></pre>
