<p>It seems like the most likely problem here is that <code>ClntFree</code> is actually a macro that expands out to use an SEH <code>__try</code> block.  Nothing else on the surface seems like it would make sense as a macro and a macro seems like the most likely cause here.</p>

<p>Have you looked at the definition of <code>ClntFree</code> to see if it's a macro or not?</p>
