<p>I'd comment to ask these but my reputation is not high enough. </p>

<p>I believe "\l" is "linefeed", so that would mesh with you seeing 0A in the file encoding.</p>

<p>My first question would be, what character encoding is your data files in? And what is the datatype on your table columns? </p>

<p>I would guess that this is going to be a character encoding issue. I see your DATAFILETYPE is 'widechar' Did you confirm that your source file is Unicode? And when you insert data and select it back out, does it look as if the character encoding is being preserved?</p>
