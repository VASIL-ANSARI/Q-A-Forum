<p>Just in case someone ends up in here.</p>

<p>As Jaromanda told in the comments section (and many others in other posts)  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeunload" rel="nofollow">window.onbeforeunload</a> is our best ally. In this precise case, it doesn't serve me well, as this prompts an alert and I just want to capture it so it doesn't really executes. Haven't found any answer to just capturing Ctrl + W as it's a complex thing to "abort" a close command.</p>

<p>EDIT #1:
It seems the problem is Chrome, you can capture these comands in Firefox (haven't tested them in IE/Edge nor Safari). If by any chance someone knows/comes up with any ideas, they will be gratefully accepted</p>
