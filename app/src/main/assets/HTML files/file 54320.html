<p>No, integral types (which include the 3 types <code>char</code>, <code>unsigned char</code> and <code>signed char</code>) can be implicitly converted to each other. As this behavior may not always be intended however, several compilers issue warnings, and some code conventions require casts to make conversions explicit.</p>

<p>In any case, <em>if</em> you cast, you should prefer the C++ cast operators, because they're more limited and thus safer. In your case, this could be <code>static_cast</code>.</p>

<p>As already hinted by others, global variables are not always the best practice and a variable (not constant) named "one" with the value 1 is slightly suspicious, but without knowing your design it's difficult to tell whether those choices are appropriate. </p>
