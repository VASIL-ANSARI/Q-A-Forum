<p>Edited:  didn't saw your stacktrace. your stacktrace show that there is a version miss match. you can find appropriate compatible version on there documentations.</p>

<p>make sure that required jar files are available in your classpath.</p>

<p>when you are running using -cp option, your jvm searches for required jar file in all directory locations separated by ; given in your classpath variable.</p>

<p>make sure you have also added ;.; in your classes path, which causes the jvm to load/search class/jar files available in your current working directory as well. </p>
