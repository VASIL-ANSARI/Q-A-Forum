  <p>The problem is that JavaScript interprets the first {} as an empty
  code block and ignores it. The NaN is therefore computed by evaluating
  +{} (plus followed by the second {}). The plus you see here is not the binary addition operator, but a unary prefix operator that converts
  its operand to a number, in the same manner as Number()</p>

  <p>Why is the first {} interpreted as a code block? Because the complete
  input is parsed as a statement and curly braces at the beginning of a
  statement are interpreted as starting a code block. Hence, you can fix
  things by forcing the input to be parsed as an expression:</p>
  
  <p>({} + {})</p>
  
  <p>'[object Object][object Object]'</p>
