<p>Might you are using that <code>instance</code> member in a  <code>static</code> context.</p>

<p>You cannot use a non <code>static</code> member instance in a static context. That is what compiler is complaining.</p>

<p>Either you need to create a new <code>instance</code> with in that static context or member should be <code>static</code>.</p>

<p>Reason is that static methods or members are attached to class rather than a <code>instance</code>.</p>

<p>Reason is that you can call static method without an instance, so <code>instance</code> members should not be used inside that context.</p>

<p>I'm recommending this tutorial of oracle about <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Understanding Instance and Class Members</code></a></p>
