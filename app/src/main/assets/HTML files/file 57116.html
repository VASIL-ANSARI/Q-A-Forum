<p>you cannot do it as you inherit from <code>QGraphicsScene</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class CustomScene : public QGraphicsScene
</code></pre>

<p>btw. this error has nothing to do with the way you implemented PIMPL idiom (actually it looks fine), inheritance from incomplete type is simply not possible as compiler needs to know the size / layout of your base class.</p>
