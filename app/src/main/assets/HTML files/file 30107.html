<p>You are using $(this) in the wrong context. To actually select an item so you can affect it, you would use this instead:</p>

<pre><code>$('[pathname="' + pathy + '"]').addClass('active');
</code></pre>

<p>Using the [name="value"] selector you can grab a selector to an item by its attribute.</p>
