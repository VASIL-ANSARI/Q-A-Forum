<p>Well, this question is isn't about AJAX per-se, but about Microsoft's AJAX-based UpdatePanel, which is a complex beast. The simple explanation of the way UpdatePanel's work is that everything works the same as a normal full-page "post back" (ViewState POSTed to the server, server-side DOM is recreated, all of the page event life-cycle events are executed) except at the very end the response rendered to the client only includes the subset of HTML needed to refresh the content of the UpdatePanel from which the AJAX request was initiated. There are some additional subtleties and complexities at play, but this is the basic idea.</p>
