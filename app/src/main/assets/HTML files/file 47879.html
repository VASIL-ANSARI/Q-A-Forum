<p>That code expects a file name to be passed on the command line, not read from stdin.  You've not specified what platform you're on, but you'll do something like <code>my_program.exe C:\some\file\somewhere</code> on Windows or <code>./my_program /some/file/somewhere</code> on Linux/Mac/Other Unix like OS.  If you're running the program from your IDE's run/debug function then you'll need to configure it to pass the name of the file as a command line argument.  How to do that will depend on what IDE you're using.</p>
