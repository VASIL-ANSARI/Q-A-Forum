<p>try it in Firefox...  I don't know a way to make the header and footer a fixed height, and then have the wrap and content the "remaining area" like for the frameset usage...  But you can also style the header and footer as <code>position: absolute</code> and attached to the top and bottom of viewport, by using <code>top: 0</code> and <code>bottom: 0</code> respectively.</p>
