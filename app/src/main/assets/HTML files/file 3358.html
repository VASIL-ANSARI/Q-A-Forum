<p>Why not convert everything to UTF-8?  It can handle everything UTF-16 can (which is obviously what you mean by "Unicode"), but ASCII characters will take up only one byte each, just like ASCII.  And you won't have to worry about some of your files being in different encodings than others.  If your diff tool decodes the files to a common encoding first, it shouldn't break your old diffs.</p>

<p>Converting UTF-16 to ASCII is a very bad idea.  You say there's nothing but ASCII in those files, but if you're wrong, the non-ASCII characters will be lost.  That is, unless you use something like Java's <code>native2ascii</code> utility, which converts non-ASCII characters to Unicode escapes (for example, <code>Ã -&gt; \u00C3</code>), but that would definitely break your diffs.</p>
