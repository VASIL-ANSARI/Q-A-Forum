<p>So as I was about to post this, I realized what my mistake was.  Looking through the Manifest again I noticed something interesting.  The application did not originally have the LoginActivity.  When I added the LoginActivity, the following line was added to the Manifest.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:name=".LoginActivity"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I did not know this at the time and so just edited the original launcher activity, as seen below.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity
            android:name="com.jonasSoftware.blueharvest.LoginActivity"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:exported="true"&gt;
            &lt;intent-filter&gt;
                &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;

                &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;
            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
        &lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the android:name= line had originally been "com.jonasSoftware.blueharvest.HomeActivity".  So when I removed the extra  line from the Manifest, everything started working again.</p>

<p>I hope this helps someone.</p>
