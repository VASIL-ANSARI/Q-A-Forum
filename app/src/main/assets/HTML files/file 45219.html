<p>I've used MSDeploy/WebDeploy using both the command line or from the Visual Studio <em>publish</em> UI command.</p>

<p>Check this other Q&amp;A I've auto-answered it myself <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25329952/generated-sourcemanifest-doesnt-include-additional-runcommand-webdeploy-setti">Generated *.SourceManifest doesn&#39;t include additional runCommand WebDeploy settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can deploy the service executable and satellite assemblies and/or configuration files using regular MSDeploy and then execute a <code>runCommand</code> of some PowerShell or batch file somewhere in the server's file system (f.e. <code>C:\deploy_service.cmd</code> so you'll be able to update this and all servers running your Windows Services running a single MSDeploy command.</p>
