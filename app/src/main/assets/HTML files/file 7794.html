<p>You seem to be using jQuery, at least for the link handler part.</p>

<p>The thing to realize is that $.click(handler) is just shorthand for .bind('click', handler). If you define the handler elsewhere, you can also unbind it later, like this:</p>

<pre><code>var handler = function(event) { 
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log("the links, they do nothing!");
}

// when you want the external links to be inactive.
// you could use .click(handler) here too, it's the same.
$('a[href^="http"]').bind('click', handler);

// when you want them back
$('a[href^="http"]').unbind('click', handler);
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, href^="http" is a bit fragile, if you only want this to happen to external links. Internal links might start with "http", and some external links could start with other protocols like "ftp". Better to give such links their own class, like Wikipedia does with 'external'.</p>
