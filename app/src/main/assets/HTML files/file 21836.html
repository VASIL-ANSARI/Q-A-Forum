<p>First of all, you don't need a native query for that. JPQL will do just fine. And the result of such a query will simply be a <code>List&lt;Object[]&gt;</code>, where each object array will contain an element for each returned column. Just iterate over this list and do whatever you want with the elements:</p>

<pre><code>for (Object[] row : list) {
    Integer id = (Integer) row[0];
    String name = (String) row[1];
    ...
    Long count = (Long) row[4];
    ...
}
</code></pre>
