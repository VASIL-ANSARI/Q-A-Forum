<p>first of all you need to get the content of the pre so:</p>

<p>Example with jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>var contents = $("#output").html();

//now you could need to remove "[" and "]":

contents = contents.replace("[","").replace("]","");
var elements = contents.split(",");

//now you will have to check the length of "elements"

var count = elements.length;
</code></pre>
