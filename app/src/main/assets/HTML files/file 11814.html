<p>When <code>initNewWindow()</code> returns, the <code>window</code> variable is deleted and the window's reference count drops to zero, causing the newly created C++ object to be deleted.  This is why your window closes immediately.</p>

<p>If you want to keep it open, make sure to keep a reference around.  The easiest way to do this is to make your new window a child of the calling window, and set its <code>WA_DeleteOnClose</code> widget attribute (see <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qt.html#WidgetAttribute-enum" rel="nofollow"><code>Qt::WidgetAttribute</code></a>).</p>
