<p>Here's a repaired version of your code. Correct indentation is <em>very</em> important in Python because that's how you group code into blocks. If the code indentation is wrong neither the Python interpreter nor humans reading your program can tell what you want it to do.</p>

<p>We can simplify <code>letters</code> into a single string, rather than a tuple of strings. </p>

<p>The main change I made copies characters that aren't in <code>letters</code> to <code>newPhrase</code> without shifting them. This means that spaces and punctuation just get copied, but it also means that numbers and upper-case letters will also just get copied.</p>

<p>I also put your program into a big loop so that the <code>"Do you want to exit? "</code> stuff is meaningful. Otherwise, the program will just exit anyway.</p>

<pre><code>letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" 

welcome = print("Hello there!")

while True:
    #Encrypt
    numberShift = int(input("How much do you wish to shift the letters? "))
    phrase = input("Enter a phrase to be encrypted: ")
    newPhrase = ""
    for l in phrase:
        #Only change characters that aren't in letters
        if l in letters:
            pos = letters.index(l) + numberShift
            if pos &gt; 25:
                pos = pos - 26
            l = letters[pos]
        newPhrase += l

    print(newPhrase)

    #Decrypt
    numberShift = int(input("How many times has the code you want to decrypt been shifted? "))
    phrase = input("Enter a phrase to be decrypted: ")
    newPhrase = ""
    for l in phrase:
        #Only change characters that aren't in letters
        if l in letters:
            pos = letters.index(l) - numberShift
            if pos &gt; 25:
                pos = pos - 26
            l = letters[pos]
        newPhrase += l

    print(newPhrase)

    if 'yes' in input("Do you want to exit? "):
        break
