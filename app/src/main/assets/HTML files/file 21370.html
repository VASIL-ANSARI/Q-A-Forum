<p>you want to look into <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html" rel="nofollow"><code>AlarmManager</code></a>. think of it like unix cron for your android app. in a nutshell, you schedule an <code>Intent</code> to fire in the future. You then write a <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> to handle the intent, and do whatever you want here. </p>

<p>of course, the devil's in the details. pay close attention to things like offloading any time-consuming work from  your broadcast receiver to a service thread, and ensuring that you grab a wake lock before hand. these are advanced topics that can't properly be covered in a SO answer.</p>
