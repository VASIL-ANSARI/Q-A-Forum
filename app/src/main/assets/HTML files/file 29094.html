<p>Change <code>LIKE</code> to <code>=</code> (you want an exact match), and add a join condition to prevent rows from joining to themselves:</p>

<pre><code>select p1.id, p1.frst_name, p1.last_name, p1.birth_date
from person p1
join person p2
on upper(left(p1.frst_name,2)) = upper(left(p2.frst_name,2))
and upper(p1.last_name) = upper(p2.last_name)
and p1.birth_date = p2.birth_date
and p1.id != p2.id
</code></pre>

<p>Without the addition of <code>and p1.id != p2.id</code>, every row would be returned, because of course every row would otherwise match itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>The question was tagged with both mysql and oracle. The above query works in mysql. For iracle, which doesn't support <code>left(col, 2)</code>, use <code>substr(col, 1, 2)</code> instead.</p>
