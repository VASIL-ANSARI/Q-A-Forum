<p>In answer to my own question, what happened is that optimizer took code that looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>int which = RANDOM % somecontainer.size();
std::advance(it, which);
</code></pre>

<p>and combined them.  This is why it appears the signal was raised from inside std::advance.  Following Oli's comment, SIGFPE can occur when you take the modulus with respect to 0, even though it isn't a floating point operation.  There was a different bug which allowed <code>somecontainer</code> to be empty in a corner case.  </p>
