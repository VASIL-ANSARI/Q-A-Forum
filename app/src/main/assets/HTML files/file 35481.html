<p>If you really want to do this without the <code>while</code> cycle, I have a method that works:</p>

<pre><code>((7 + (int)date.DayOfWeek) - (int)weekStart) % 7
</code></pre>

<p>This is the amount of days since the <code>weekStart</code> (in your case, <code>DayOfWeek.Monday</code>). So you could just do this:</p>

<pre><code>return date.AddDays(-((7 + (int)date.DayOfWeek) - (int)DayOfWeek.Monday) % 7;
</code></pre>

<p>Do make sure to make this a helper method, of course. It's quite annoying trying to verify those complex single-line expressions every time they're used.</p>

<p>Still, the <code>while</code> solution isn't really going to be a performance issue unless you're doing something very weird with the dates. You shouldn't really bother trying to (performance) optimize code that isn't a bottleneck in your processing. Date pickers usually aren't the bottleneck :)</p>
