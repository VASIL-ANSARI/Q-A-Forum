<p>You will likely need to store (a list of) the open menus in a cookie, localStorage or sessionStorage. Be advised that only the cookie method will be widely supported.</p>

<p>But, the basic idea will be to store the open menus as they are opened (and remove them from the list when closed). Then when the page loads, look for that list of open menus and if present, use that list to manually (programatically) open then again upon page load.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
