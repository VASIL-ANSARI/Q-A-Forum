<p>Because when using WCF over HTTPS; IIS manages the negotiation with the certificates (Just like plain SSL). Since there is no IIS server with that built in for TCP, you have to do it yourself. You are still doing stuff with certificates + WCF for HTTPS, but the configuration is done at IIS.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>For client side, you still have another piece of software. When browsing a website over SSL, the browser is handling all of that for you. SSL over HTTP has a standard negotiation pattern because it's part of the HTTPS protocol. For TCP, that isn't part of the protocol so the client has to take care of that itself. </p>
