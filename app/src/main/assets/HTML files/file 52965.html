<p>One easy way to debug this kind of issue is to use ImageMagick which is installed on most Linux distros and is available for OSX and Windows. First use the <code>identify</code> utility within the suite with its <code>verbose</code> option to find out everything about your <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> images like this:</p>

<pre><code># Find out all we know about first image and put in file "1.txt"
identify -verbose image1.tif &gt; 1.txt

# Find out all we know about second image and put in file "2.txt"
identify -verbose image2.tif &gt; 2.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Now use your favourite file comparison tool to see the differences:</p>

<pre><code>opendiff 1.txt 2.txt
</code></pre>
