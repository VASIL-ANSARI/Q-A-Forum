<p>You can't really do that. Images weren't here unless user selected them so why you do not want to let user delete them? in such case you will download it again or ask user to select. normal "cache" scenario. Not to mention you are in fact unable to protect these images  as user can always clear app data (including databases and internal storage). </p>
