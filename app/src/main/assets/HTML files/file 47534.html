<p><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-angulars-apply-digest/" rel="nofollow">Per This Article</a>:</p>

<p>"The $digest cycle starts as a result of a call to $scope.$digest(). Assume that you change a scope model in a handler function through the ng-click directive. In that case AngularJS automatically triggers a $digest cycle by calling $digest(). When the $digest cycle starts, it fires each of the watchers. These watchers check if the current value of the scope model is different from last calculated value. If yes, then the corresponding listener function executes. As a result if you have any expressions in the view they will be updated. In addition to ng-click, there are several other built-in directives/services that let you change models (e.g. ng-model, $timeout, etc) and automatically trigger a $digest cycle.</p>

<p>So far, so good! But, there is a small gotcha. In the above cases, <strong>Angular doesnât directly call $digest(). Instead, it calls $scope.$apply(), which in turn calls $rootScope.$digest(). As a result of this, a digest cycle starts at the $rootScope, and subsequently visits all the child scopes calling the watchers along the way.</strong>"</p>

<p>The rootscope variable is then updated and you see the change in your codepen.</p>
