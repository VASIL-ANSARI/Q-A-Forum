<p>And Postgres is probably right.</p>

<p>When you execute a UNION the column structure of what you are trying to unite must match. 'Summary' is certainly a char/varchar. I suspect OrderLine.ShopOrderID is an integer. There is no way you can use one same column to contain both type of data without typecasting. And the only typecast I see as possible is OrderLine.ShopOrderID to char/varchar... a bit ugly, but possible.</p>

<p>Another solution is to add a char/varchar column in front of these... put null or empty string or some text constant in the first select, and 'Summary' in the second. Then in second select you must also put NULL in the ShopOrderID column... just like you are already doing with Book.Title and OrderLine.UnitSellingPrice</p>
