<p>All you need is to preserve the lines that starts with <code>Test</code> in a set and check if you have it already just don't write it in output file : </p>

<pre><code>def delete_duplicate(inputfile,outputfile,seen={}):
    with open(outputfile, "w") as output,open(inputfile, "r") as input: 
      for line in input:
        if line not in seen:
             output.write(line+'\n')
        if line.startswith('Test'):
            seen.add(line)
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage of <code>set</code> is that its order is O(1) for check the membership and adding items.</p>
