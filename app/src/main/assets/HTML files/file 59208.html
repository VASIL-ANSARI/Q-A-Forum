<p>As per discussion in comments to question, having that each of below works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>Flavor.first.flavor_id
Flavor.first.attributes
</code></pre>

<p>means, that attributes reading is not broken. The only reason is that as per error: you are referencing bad/invalid/inexistent object <code>flavor</code>.</p>
