<p>I've found that creating a separate library project to store all of your theme is the best. This way you can have multiple applications reference the same styles and skins. It also forces you to organize your code, which can sometimes be daunting.</p>

<p>This is also especially useful for using the same theme across platforms, for example... imagine a mobile app, a native app, and a web app that all use the same styles, pretty sweet right??</p>

<p>See my attached screenshot of an example workspace.. and there is a ton of info out on the interwebs about creating a flex library project.</p>
