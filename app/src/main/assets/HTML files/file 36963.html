<p>It looks slightly worse than I would expect at random, using an approximation based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution</a>. If the expected number of entries in a bucket is 1/2, I would expect that the probability of 0 entries is about exp(-0.5) = 0.607, and the probability of 1 entry in a bucket is about half this, or 0.303. This leaves probability 0.09 that a bucket has two or more entries.</p>

<p>Are your integers all unique? If not, are you counting duplicate values as causing a hash collision?</p>

<p>In favourable circumstances, you can choose a hash function so as to give FEWER collisions that you would expect at random. Sometimes hash(x) = x % p, where p is a prime, will achieve this.</p>
