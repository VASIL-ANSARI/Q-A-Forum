<p>The app may be ended by the system if idle too long, but the example registers a <code>GcmBroadcastReceiver</code> that is started/invoked by the system whenever a GCM message arrives. That receiver in turn starts a Service which will then create the notification.</p>

<p>This pattern also works if the app is not running - actually, the system launches the app, resp. the broadcast receiver as part of the app, if necessary. If that is not the case with your app, you did something wrong.</p>

<p>Check your manifest file to see if the broadcast receiver and the service are specified correctly.</p>

<p>EDIT : Telling by your manifest file, I think you didn't provide the correct names for the broadcast receiver and the service. You have to provide either the fully qualified class name here (e.g <code>com.example.GcmBroadcastReceiver</code>) or you can leave the package name part of your app out but then you'd have at least to provide <code>.GcmBroadcastReceiver</code> (mind the leading dot!).</p>
