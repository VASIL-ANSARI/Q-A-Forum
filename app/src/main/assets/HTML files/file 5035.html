<p>You should obfuscate your application. To avoid any data binding errors a number of Obfuscators now provide silverlight / wpf obfuscation defaults that will help you avoid those errors. 
After obfuscation you can make a clickonce installer using mage.exe <br>

<br>Seriously DO NOT do the renaming. You are making your life more difficult. In fact as difficult as they guy you don't want stealing your code.
<br>Its just one bat file to make the clickonce after a build. </p>
