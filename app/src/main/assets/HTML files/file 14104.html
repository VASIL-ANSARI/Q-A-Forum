<p>What you're currently doing is printing out the python string representation of a tuple, i.e. the return value of <code>str(row)</code>. That includes the quotes and 'u's and parentheses and so on. </p>

<p>Instead, you want the data formatted properly for a CSV file. Well, try the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html"><code>csv</code> module</a>. It knows how to format things for CSV files, unsurprisingly enough.</p>

<pre><code>with open('output.csv', 'wb') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(['Column 1', 'Column 2', ...])
    writer.writerows(data)
</code></pre>
