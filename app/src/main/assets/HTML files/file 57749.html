<p>Usually in Firebase we:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>run the operations that interact with network and disk in a separate thread</p></li>
<li><p>surface the callbacks back on the main thread, so that your code can interact with the UI</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't verify for this specific case, but expect it to work the same. And that means that your infinite loop is preventing the completion block from being executed.</p>

<p>If you want to wait for a result, use semaphores as describes here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4326350/how-do-i-wait-for-an-asynchronously-dispatched-block-to-finish">How do I wait for an asynchronously dispatched block to finish?</a></p>
