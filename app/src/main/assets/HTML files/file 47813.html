<p>I assume you are using Microsoft SQL Server.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no in-built last-method.</p>

<p>But you could use <code>ordering</code> and <code>TOP</code> to get the last record..</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM your_table
WHERE (tech1 = 233 OR tech2 = 233 OR tech3 = 233)
ORDER BY iPersonID DESC
</code></pre>
