<p>One of the easier ways to measure your execution time and memory usage:</p>

<pre><code>$start = microtime(true);

instruction 1;
...
instruction N;

echo 'Execution time: ' . ( microtime(true) - $start ) * 1000 . ' seconds &lt;br /&gt;';
echo 'Memory usage: ' . memory_get_peak_usage() / 1024;
</code></pre>

<p>You can ofcourse place the echo rows between your instructions to measure the time from start of the script till the end of that instruction. This will provide insight which instruction takes the longest to complete.</p>
