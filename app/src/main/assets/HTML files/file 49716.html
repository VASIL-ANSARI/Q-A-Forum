<p>When you're in the background, your code is not running.  However, If you click on your project in Xcode, and go to "Capabilities" and then into "Background Modes" and click "Remote Notifications."  Then your app will be awakened at times known only to Apple, and then your code will be run provided it lasts no more than 30 seconds.  You can use the Xcode menu item "Simulate Background Fetch" in the Debug menu to send a fetch message when your app is being debugged, to test.</p>

<p>Note that this may or may not run your code in 4 seconds - as Apple decides when to wake up your background app.  I've seen it wake up every 5 minutes, or even after  a couple of hours.</p>
