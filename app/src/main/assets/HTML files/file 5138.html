<p><code>COUNT()</code> is an aggregate operation on the table that returns just one row, which is why you're not getting 5 results as you expect from your query when including it.</p>

<p>One way you can get what you want is by using a <code>SUBSELECT</code> clause in your query:</p>

<p><code>SELECT (SELECT COUNT(ID) FROM tablename) as counter, ID, fname, lname FROM tablename WHERE fname LIKE ? or lname LIKE ? ORDER BY ID LIMIT 5</code></p>

<p>This will return the 5 results you expect, with a full count of the rows in the table as a column in each row.</p>
