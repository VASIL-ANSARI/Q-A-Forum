<p>As I see it, only streams are supported by the Process class, see
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html</a></p>

<p>The idea of streams IS the sequential access, so unless your process doesn't have some Java interface API (like OJDBC for accessing Oracle databases), you can only iterate through your stream until you got to the last line, I'm sorry.</p>
