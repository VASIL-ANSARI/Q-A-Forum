<p>You're going to potentially have a unique intersection between Rect1 and every rectangle in the RectSet union. So you are going to have do the intersection between Rect1 and each rectangle in the union separately. The intersecting area is the union of all intersecting sections between Rect1 and the rectangles in the union.</p>

<p>An optimization is to create a abounding rectangle for the union of rectangles (hopefully done as the union is created). If Rect1 doesn't intersect with this bounding rectangle, you can the skip doing any further intersections and the area in null.</p>
