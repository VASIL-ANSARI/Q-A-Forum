<p>There are many ways to do it. I will roughly describe two of them.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Build a web service which retrieves data from an SQL database. Then serialize the results in a JSON format and return them to your client application. Since you use C#, I would suggest to build it in WCF. You could follow <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/167159/How-to-create-a-JSON-WCF-RESTful-Service-in-60-sec" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You could use a database storing data in json format directly. These databases are NoSQL databases and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" rel="nofollow">MongoDB</a> is one good example.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope I helped!</p>
