<p>OK, I feel a little bit stupid. Both of the above methods DO actually work, however you will NOT see the results in an Eclipse debugger session. In another section of code I used Criteria and the</p>

<pre><code>setFetchMode("field",FetchMode.JOIN);
</code></pre>

<p>method and in this case the debugger object DOES contain all the data, so I expected to see the full object in the debugger using the above strategies, but it didn't happen.</p>

<p>Also for ohers to note you cannot run test cases in the code back to back on the same object because of Hibernate caching the object. The debugger might or might not show anything meaningful.</p>
