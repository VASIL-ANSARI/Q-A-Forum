<p>You are using <code>$scope.$apply(...)</code> inside the function <code>changeLang</code> so you are getting the common 'already in a digest' error. You don't need to put the call to <code>getTranslation</code> inside a $scope.$apply(...) block because <code>ng-click</code> already has you taken care of. Yank that out and it should just work. Also, I'd recommend running with a non-minified version of angular for dev so you can see better errors in your console. </p>
