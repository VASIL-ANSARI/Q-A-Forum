<li><p>Since you have predefined intervals, (daily, weekly, monthly), you can just have one command that handles everything. </p></li>
<li><p>You might want to include a field which keeps track of when the last email was sent out, which is updated every time email is sent out for the user.  </p></li>
<li><p>No, cron is like a polling system - executes a piece of code if certain conditions are valid. However, the developer can define when and how frequently the cron executes</p></li>
<li><p>I would implement it as a straight forward management command for simplicity. If it is really complex, consider using django-celery (I would rather keep it simple)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One more thing you can do is add options to Management command which gives more control over things like - run command for only <code>preference_type=daily</code> or for specific user, etc if you want more flexibility. </p>
