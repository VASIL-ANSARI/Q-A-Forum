<p>Hmmm... My sgen'ed XML serialization assemblies are in the same folder with their original dll.</p>

<p>E.g. for <code>MyAssembly.dll</code> I have <code>MyAssembly.XmlSerializers.dll</code> right next to it.</p>

<p>Also, make sure that both assemblies declare the same Assembly Version in their properties.</p>
