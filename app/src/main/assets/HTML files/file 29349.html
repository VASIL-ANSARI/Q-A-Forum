<p>I believe the answer is <em>"Yes, for regular AJAX requests you should be able to set the proper auth headers"</em>.</p>

<p>However, you're not making a standard XHR call when you use JSONP (based on the example), <strong>which changes the answer to "No"</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're stuck using JSONP, I don't think you can send any auth headers. JSONP simply doesn't work the same as Angular's <code>$http.get</code> for example.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://schock.net/articles/2013/02/05/how-jsonp-really-works-examples/" rel="nofollow">http://schock.net/articles/2013/02/05/how-jsonp-really-works-examples/</a> for the details, but the short version is JSONP puts down a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that fetches some data. The data returned  calls the function you provide (<code>JSON_CALLBACK</code> in your example) around the data that the server provides. Because of that, you can't change the headers -- the request is an HTTP GET request exactly as if you'd pasted the URL for the script tag into your browser's location bar.</p>
