<p>I think <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Mutation_events" rel="nofollow">DOM mutation events</a> are available in Mobile Safari but may not be forever since they are deprecated and replaced by mutation observers. Therefore I'd suggest using mutation observers where possible and falling back to DOM mutation events.</p>
