<p>The answer is that it's good practice to put all of your code into functions. You should write very little code on the global scope. </p>

<p>While this might come with a performance increase as you've apparently pointed out, the reason to do this is because it stops you from putting properties on the window that may result in name conflicts with other libraries.</p>

<p>So, yes, it's good practice, but not just for this reason.</p>
