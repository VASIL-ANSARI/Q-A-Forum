<p>You can check for <code>querySelector()</code> support using:</p>

<pre><code>if('querySelector' in document)
</code></pre>

<p>Or more simply:</p>

<pre><code>if(document.querySelector)
</code></pre>

<p>You don't want to cause your script to perform extra work unnecessarily. If the pure function of the library is to act as a shim / shiv for <code>placeholder</code> attributes, it'd be better to check whether these attributes are supported and handle them natively before running any more of your library.</p>
