<blockquote>
  <p>I can create arraylist for both schools and students, but they don't
  seem to know correctly which school has which students.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy way:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a <code>HashMap</code> in <code>DIRECTORY</code> for schools with School ID as Key, and
SCHOOL as Object.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement <code>SCHOOL getSchoolById(String id)</code> method which return SCHOOL 
object by ID.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Like,</p>

<pre><code>public class DIRECTORY {
       private Map&lt;String, SCHOOL&gt; schools = new HashMap&lt;String, SCHOOL&gt;();


        public void setSchools(Map&lt;String, SCHOOL&gt; schoolsMap) {
        this.schools =  schoolsMap;
        }

     public Map&lt;String, SCHOOL&gt; getSchools() {return this.schools;}


     public void addSchool(String schoolId, String schoolName) {
         SCHOOL school = new SCHOOL();
         school.setSchoolId(schoolId);
         school.setSchoolName(schoolName);
         schools.put(schoolId,school);

    }

   public SCHOOL getSchoolById(String schoolId) {
         schools.get(schoolId);
    }

   }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, your code looks like,</p>

<pre><code>DIRECTORY directory = new DIRECTORY();
directory.addSchool("A1", "Point Grey");
directory.addSchool("B1", "Prince of Wales");

SCHOOL schoolA1 = directory.getSchoolById("A1");

schoolA1.addStudent("kent", "43");
schoolA1.addStudent("Winnie", "19");
schoolA1.addStudent("Jane", "18");

SCHOOL schoolB1 = directory.getSchoolById("B1");
schoolB1.addStudent("Steven", "11");
schoolB1.addStudent("Michelle", "30");
schoolB1.addStudent("Ronald", "20");
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use List with compare methods or other third party library to get school object from school list.</p>
