<p>Look carefully at this line. </p>

<pre><code>arrayEncrypted[i] = (char) (arrayEncrypted[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>Unless I'm totally misinterpreting it, what you're doing there is... actually, <em>absolutely nothing</em>. You're taking the character found at position <code>i</code> in the array, and placing it at position <code>i</code>. What you want to do is something like</p>

<pre><code>encryptionResult[i] = (arrayEncrypted[encrypt[i]]);
</code></pre>

<p>as you're trying to <em>rearrange</em> the characters.</p>
