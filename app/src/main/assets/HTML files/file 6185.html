<p>How did you specify the classpath of your application? If it was not through the CLASSPATH environment variable, it will not be inherited.</p>

<p>Runtime.exec method can invoke any native application, and the envp here refers to system environment, not your java environment.</p>

<p>If you want to pass your classpath to the child java process, you can do so explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>String[] cmdarray = new String[] {
  "java", "-classpath", System.getProperty("java.class.path"), "com.example.MyChildApp", "appParam"};

Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmdarray);
</code></pre>
