<p>I see the same issue with Qt 5.4.1, but only on Windows 7. On Windows 8 the removal of the dongle is detected.</p>

<p>It is actually the problems of the windows 7 itself. If you check with Device Manager you can notice that COM port remains on the list, if it has been open even in the case when dongle is removed.</p>
