<p>I could imagine that a new instance of your opengl activity is started when you return from your 2nd. </p>

<p>You might wanna put a specific intent to avoid that. </p>

<p>I would try FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP for example.</p>

<p>Give the developers Page on intents a look: <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html</a></p>

<p>All Flag`s are listed there with description.  </p>

<p>Hope that leadÂ´s to a solution for you! </p>
