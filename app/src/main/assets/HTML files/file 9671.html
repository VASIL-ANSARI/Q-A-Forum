<p>Basing my answer on your comment...</p>

<p>Instead of</p>

<pre><code>for word in text.lower().split():#split text into words
    [...]
    print (freq)
</code></pre>

<p>It should be</p>

<pre><code>for word in text.lower().split():#split text into words
    [...]
print (freq)
</code></pre>

<p>So that you're printing once all the words have been encountered.</p>

<p>Whenever you have a problem like this, it's always good to make sure your <code>print</code>s are where they should be.</p>
