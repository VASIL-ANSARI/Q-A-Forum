<p>Classes which are non-copyable should be the exception, not the rule. Your class should be non-copyable if and only if you cannot retain value semantics while copying- for example, named mutexes, unique-ownership pointers. Else, your class should be copyable. Many C++ libraries depend on copyability, especially pre-C++0x where they cannot be movable.</p>
