  <p>*will the entry be removed from the WeakHashMap i.e. will the size of Map be zero? *</p>

<p>If <code>emp</code> contained the last reference making the Employee <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/ref/package-summary.html#reachability">strongly reachable</a> then the entry in the map <em>may</em> be removed.</p>

<p>The Java docs sums it up pretty well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A hashtable-based Map implementation with weak keys. An entry in a WeakHashMap will automatically be removed when its key is no longer in ordinary use. More precisely, the presence of a mapping for a given key will not prevent the key from being discarded by the garbage collector [...]. When a key has been discarded its entry is effectively removed from the map, so this class behaves somewhat differently from other Map implementations. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>And will it be vice-versa in case of HashMap?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Removing the entry from the WeakHashMap will not affect any other references in the program.</p>
