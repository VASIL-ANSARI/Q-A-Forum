<p>You are adding the background color via CSS to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. You are targeting the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element with your jQuery. For all you know, the jQuery could be working properly, but you can't see it because the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element has a background color. </p>

<p>Try changing the jQuery to target the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element instead. Be sure to <code>return false</code> or use <code>preventDefault()</code> when targeting the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, unless you have something else going on which I don't know about, it would be more efficient just hard code the selection class to the first element instead of targeting it with jQuery. Just a tip.</p>
