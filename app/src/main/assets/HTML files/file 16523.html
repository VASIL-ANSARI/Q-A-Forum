<p>We are all familiar with SQL.  There is a new jQuery library called SPSQL.  This is really cool because you can query SharePoint using SQL syntax.  Just add the appropriate libraries and you are on your way.  See the example below and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spsql/" rel="nofollow">article</a> here.</p>

<p>To get items, just do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var result = SPSql.parseSQL('SELECT MyList.Field FROM MyList WHERE MyList.ID &gt; 10 ORDER BY  MyList.ID DESC');
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is possible to process all result rows:</p>

<pre><code>for (var row = 0; row &lt; result.length; row++) {
   for (var column in result[row])
      alert( column + ": " + result[row][column] );
 }
</code></pre>
