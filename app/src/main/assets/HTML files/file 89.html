<p>You don't test the converter, you test the final code. </p>

<p>If the code doesn't compile, clearly your converter is failing. If the code compiles and your functionality tests fail, then you can tweak the code so that it passes the test. If you are fairly successful you should see that you only need to fix the modules that actually fail.</p>

<p>Goodluck!</p>
