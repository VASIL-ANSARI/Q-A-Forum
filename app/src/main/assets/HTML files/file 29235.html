<p>After much digging around, I think I now have a better understanding of what Google Earth can and cannot do, (or is not designed to do).  It seems that Google Earth is not designed as a visualization tool for numerical data.  This does not mean it cannot be done, but that one must create the image files elsewhere, and then overlay them onto Google Earth.  For example, this link provides instructions for visualizing the output from a fire modeling code : </p>

<p>The instructions here suggests how pseudocolor plots can used in at least one special case to visualize output in Google Earth. </p>
