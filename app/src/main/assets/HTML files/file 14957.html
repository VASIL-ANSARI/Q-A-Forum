<p>Take a look at <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx" rel="nofollow">JSON.NET</a>.  It's a great library and it's used by a number of products/frameworks/projects out there.</p>

<p>You can download it from CodePlex here -- <a href="http://json.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://json.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<p>I've used it on a number of projects and can vouch for it.  It's simple to use and pretty extensible if you need it to be (for custom serialization/deserialization scenarios) both within and outside of ASP.NET projects.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.  Good luck!!</p>
