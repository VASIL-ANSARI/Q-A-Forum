<p>The first question is why?  Why do you want to add the radio buttons to a <code>JLabel</code>?</p>

<p>Having said that, you can set the labels layout manager to something other then it's default value of <code>null</code>...</p>

<pre><code>label.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
label.add(button1);
label.add(button2);
label.add(button3);
</code></pre>

<p>Next...your class extends from <code>JFrame</code>, but in your constructor, you are creating another <code>JFrame</code>, this means that when you do...</p>

<pre><code>JFrame helloWorld = new HelloWorldFrame();
helloWorld.setVisible(true);
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing will be displayed, because nothing has been added to the frame.</p>

<p>Instead, make your class extend from something like <code>JFrame</code> and then add that to your <code>JFrame</code> in <code>main</code></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong></p>

<p>I just did some testing and doing this (adding buttons to a label) won't work well, as the <code>JLabel</code> calculates it's preferred size based on the text and icon, not it's contents (like something like <code>JPanel</code> would)...just saying...</p>
