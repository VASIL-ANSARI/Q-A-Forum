<p>I've found a tool called Snap2HTML that does the trick for me. However, I would like it to be more tweakable, as in theme-able, but it's a start :) The tool I found is Snap2HTML <a href="http://www.rlvision.com/snap2html/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rlvision.com/snap2html/</a></p>

<p>If anyone knows a good alternative, please let me know.</p>
