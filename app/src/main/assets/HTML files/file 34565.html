<blockquote>
  <p>When I test these methods, the result is the same.</p>

<p>it depends on how you test your class, ie.:</p>

<pre><code>void foo (MyClass&amp; a);

MyClass a1;
MyClass a2;

foo(a1 = a2);
</code></pre>

<p>in case of second operator implementation (returning <code>MyClass</code>), above code (inside <code>foo</code>) will not modify <code>a1</code> instance, but a temporary value.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In almost book I see that the first method(MyClass&amp;) is used more than
  the second method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and thats correct, its more correct to return reference to <code>*this</code> in assignment operator</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what's different between them? Which method is really right and fast?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>first version is faster and correct because it does not do any copy of your object, also its more proper because thats how primitive types behave, ie:</p>

<pre><code>int n = 0;
int k = 10;
(n = k) = 1;
std::cout &lt;&lt; n;
</code></pre>

<p>here on output you will get 1, because <code>(n = k)</code> returns reference to <code>n</code>.</p>
