<p>use the <code>trim()</code> method of String. From documentation <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#trim%28%29" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#trim%28%29</a>:</p>

<p>"Returns a copy of the string, with leading and trailing whitespace omitted.</p>

<p>If this String object represents an empty character sequence, or the first and last characters of character sequence represented by this String object both have codes greater than '\u0020' (the space character), then a reference to this String object is returned.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if there is no character with a code greater than '\u0020' in the string, then a new String object representing an empty string is created and returned.</p>

<p>Otherwise, let k be the index of the first character in the string whose code is greater than '\u0020', and let m be the index of the last character in the string whose code is greater than '\u0020'. A new String object is created, representing the substring of this string that begins with the character at index k and ends with the character at index m-that is, the result of this.substring(k, m+1).</p>

<p>This method may be used to trim whitespace (as defined above) from the beginning and end of a string.</p>

<p>Returns:
    A copy of this string with leading and trailing white space removed, or this string if it has no leading or trailing white space."</p>
