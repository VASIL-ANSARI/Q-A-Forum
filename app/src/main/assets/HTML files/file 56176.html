<p>If a default implementation not make sense in your case I prefer a pure virtual approach, this prevent at compile time to your client to misuse your class, so for 1 consider <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/126-pure-virtual-functions-abstract-base-classes-and-interface-classes/" rel="nofollow">interface classes</a>.
For 2 you should be noticed, if your client not override what is the behavior? a message in runtime, "Please implement this"...
elaborate more on 3 please...</p>
