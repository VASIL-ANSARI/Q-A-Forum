<p>You're getting recursion error because you're calling self.save() inside of Organization.save(). Don't do this, if you want to save while overriding the save(),  call the superclass' version of save() instead of your own save().</p>

<p>Before adding an instance to an m2m relationship, both sides of the relationship must already have a primary key (i.e. already inserted to the db).  This means you can't add an unsaved, uncreated object to an m2m relationship.</p>

<p>Do this:</p>

<pre><code>organisation.save()
user.save()
organisation.administrators.add(user)
</code></pre>

<p>I'd recommend doing this inside the View or Form since it is quite unexpected if a model's save method saved the user's model as well (though it should work inside the model's save() as well)</p>
