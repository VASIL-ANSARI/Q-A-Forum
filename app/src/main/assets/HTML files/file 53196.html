<p>Honestly this would be better done from a network/firewall standpoint. You can do it in PHP, but it is way easier to fake.  </p>

<p>To do it in PHP, simply look up the IP address in the request on server B. Something like this: </p>

<pre><code>$access_allowed = FALSE;
   $allowed_ip = Server_A_ip;
   //check ip address
   if ($allowed_ip == $_SERVER['REMOTE_HOST']){
     $access_allowed = TRUE;
   }
   //exit if not allowed
   if ($access_allowed == FALSE){
     exit;
   }
</code></pre>
