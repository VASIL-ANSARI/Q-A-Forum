<p>You need to unpivot your data.</p>

<p>Try using a subquery along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 'FirstName' as [@name], FirstName as [*]
union all
SELECT 'LastName' as [@name], LastName as [*]
for xml path('field')
</code></pre>

<p>Or something along these lines...</p>

<p>I don't have SQL with me (on my iPhone today), but I'm thinking about:</p>

<pre><code>select 'Person.Contact' as "@name", 
(select (SELECT 'FirstName' as [@name], FirstName as [*]
union all
SELECT 'LastName' as [@name], LastName as [*]
for xml path('field')) from Person.Contact for XML path('row'), TYPE)
for XML path('entity'), root('querydata')
</code></pre>
