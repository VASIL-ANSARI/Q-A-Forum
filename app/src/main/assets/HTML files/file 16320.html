<p>You could iterate over two arrays using Enumerators instead of numerical indices. This example iterates over <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code> simultaneously, echoing the first word in <code>a2</code> that starts with the corresponding letter in <code>a1</code>, skipping duplicates in <code>a2</code>:</p>

<pre><code>a1 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
a2 = ["apple", "angst", "banana", "clipper", "crazy", "dizzy"]

e2 = a2.each
a1.each do |letter|
  puts e2.next
  e2.next while e2.peek.start_with?(letter) rescue nil
end
</code></pre>

<p>(It assumes all letters in <code>a1</code> have at least one word in <code>a2</code> and that both are sorted -- but you get the idea.)</p>
