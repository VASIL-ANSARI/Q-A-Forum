<p>There is a possibility that you may have consequences for without closing connection. <code>maximum open cursors exceeded</code> exception you may get. </p>

<p>from <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html" rel="nofollow">Java doc</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, only one ResultSet object per Statement object can be open
  at the same time. Therefore, if the reading of one ResultSet object is
  interleaved with the reading of another, each must have been generated
  by different Statement objects. All execution methods in the Statement
  interface implicitly close a statment's current ResultSet object if an
  open one exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you need to close all JDBC resources explicitly.</p>
