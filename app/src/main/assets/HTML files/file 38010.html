<p>You would have to do a custom search because your new object (the argument to <code>indexOf()</code>) is different to the ones in the array (unless of course you had a reference to the one you're trying to search for).</p>

<p>An easy way to do it would be...</p>

<pre><code>var match = {x:70, y:500};
for (var i = 0; i &lt; pointArray.length; i++) {
     if (match.x == pointArray[i].x &amp;&amp; match.y == pointArray[i].y) {
         break;
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>i</code> will be the index of where the result was found. You'd need to handle the case where it wasn't found.</p>
