<p>It usually means that it ends up creating a separate inlined method for every obj file that uses it at link time. It can also fail or refuse to inline many things, so this can cause a problem because you can wind up with bloated objs without getting the performance benefitting of inlining. The same thing can happen with virtual method inlining so it can be worth forcing inining and setting warning for inline failure (about the only useful warning message compilers give).</p>
