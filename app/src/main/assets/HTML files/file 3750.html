<p>iPhone OS had created another folder "/private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/101APPLE/" different from the default 100APPLE. </p>

<p>I realized that actually sometimes the photos are also saved in a folder 999APPLE, 102APPLE etc. This depends on how you delete, copy and create photos in the Camera Roll. </p>

<p>So your Camera Roll pictures could actually be stored in many different folders.</p>

<p>Therefore, not being able to execute <code>[NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:ImagePath];</code>, it throws exception:</p>

<p>"EXC_BAD_ACCESS"</p>
