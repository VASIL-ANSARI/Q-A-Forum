<p>Nope, last I checked you still can't delete App IDs.</p>

<p>IIRC, the reason given for this is that it's easy enough to simply create a new App ID for a new app, so why bother deleting old ones (or something like that).</p>

<p>Also, Apple seems to have a habit of making such things permanent and un-deletable (you can't delete Apple IDs, either).</p>
