<p>To be able to stop a <code>Parallel.ForEach</code>, you can use one of the overloads that accepts a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.paralleloptions.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ParallelOptions</code></a> parameter, and include a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.cancellationtoken.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>CancellationToken</code></a> in those options.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997364.aspx" rel="nofollow">Cancellation</a> for more details.</p>

<p>As for <em>pausing</em>, I can't think why you'd want to do that, in general. You might be looking for a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.barrier.aspx" rel="nofollow">Barrier</a> (which is used to coordinate efforts between multiple threads, say if they all need to complete part A before continuing to part B), but I wouldn't think that you'd use that with <code>Parallel.ForEach</code>, since you don't know how many participants there will be.</p>
