<p>Unfortunately there is no easy way to do this, and it's something that PHP and web developers in general have maligned for years, because repopulating form fields is never easy AND clean.</p>

<p>Values in the form you aren't submitting wont be sent (via GET or POST), so you're left with writing a custom workaround.</p>

<p>While it's a bit Q&amp;D, I would recommend sending an Ajax call on form submit to store the values for your second form in the $_SESSION variable. </p>

<p>I'm sorry to say there's no easy alternative - due to the stateless nature of HTTP requests, this is something that every programmer has to struggle with.</p>
