<p>There is no way to know if it would help or not but as this is a reproducible problem, I suggest you try updating to Java 6 update 45 which is ~2 years older.</p>

<p>If possible I would suggest you move off using 32-bit JVM on a server.  I am probably wrong, but my first reaction would be that this will cause more problems than it will solve (unless you have some 32-bit shared libraries).</p>

<p>You might also want to update to JBoss 8.2 or 9 with Java 8 (the only version with public support)</p>
