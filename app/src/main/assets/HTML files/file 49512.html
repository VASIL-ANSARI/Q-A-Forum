<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0754/" rel="nofollow">PEP 754</a> specifically indicates PositiveInfinty/PositiveInfinity will return NaN.  (And talks about using PosInf = 1e300000 as a value for PositiveInfinity but also points out this isn't portable or non-ugly)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN" rel="nofollow">The wiki page for IEEE 754 NaN's</a> indicates the following additional examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operations with a NaN as at least one operand.</li>
<li>Indeterminate forms

<ul>
<li>The divisions 0/0 and Â±â/Â±â (as mentioned in your question and above respectively)</li>
<li>The multiplications 0ÃÂ±â and Â±âÃ0</li>
<li>The additions â + (ââ), (ââ) + â and equivalent subtractions</li>
<li>The standard has alternative functions for powers:

<ul>
<li>The standard <code>pow</code> function and the integer exponent <code>pown</code> function define 0^0, 1â, and â0 as 1. (Note that 0**0 which I would expect to either use or at least be similar to pow in python 2.7 returns 1)</li>
<li>The <code>powr</code> function defines all three indeterminate forms as invalid operations and so returns NaN.</li>
<li>Real operations with complex results, for example: [which for all the ones I tried, using math.sqrt, math.log, math.asin instead throw Math Domain Error in python versus returning NaN)]

<ul>
<li>The square root of a negative number. </li>
<li>The logarithm of a negative number </li>
<li>The inverse sine or cosine of a number that is less than â1 or greater than +1.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
