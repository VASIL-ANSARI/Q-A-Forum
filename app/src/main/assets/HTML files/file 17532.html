<p>You should be able to perform the calculation in one fell swoop instead of subquerying.  </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>select (val1+val2)*3 as ValMoreCalculated,* from my table
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit</em></p>

<p>I felt it necessary to address your comment.  If you want to conditionally multiple by 3, for example, you could do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>select (val1+val2)*CASE WHEN &lt;some expression&gt; = 'SomeValue' THEN 3 ELSE 1 END as ValMoreCalculated,* from my table
</code></pre>

<p><em>Working example:</em></p>

<pre><code>Declare @val1 int 
Declare @val2 int 
Declare @someExpression int 
Set @val1 = 1 
Set @val2 = 2 
Set @someExpression = 1

select (@val1+@val2)*CASE WHEN @someExpression = 1 THEN 3 ELSE 1 END as ValMoreCalculated
</code></pre>

<p>Also, to address your question edit:</p>

<pre><code>select ((val1+val2)*3)/(val1+val2) as ValEvenMoreCalc,* from my table
</code></pre>

<p>The key is if your calculation is 1-to-1 with a record, it is not required to subquery.  If, for example, you want any grouping, then you <strong><em>may</em></strong>.  If subquerying makes it more readable to you, then it's simply a matter of preference.  For clarity, I tend to use comments.  You can't get much clearer than that:</p>

<pre><code>--Calculates x based on y to get a gross profit %
select ((val1+val2)*3)/(val1+val2) as ValEvenMoreCalc,* from my table
</code></pre>
