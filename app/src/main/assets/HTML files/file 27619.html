<p>Correct me if I'm wrong.You need to insert data into two different tables, in two different databases?</p>

<p>for this you need two connection and an script for each one. check if the first script has succeeded then run the second.</p>

<p>but if you could somehow access both tables with one connection, you could run both your scripts in one action!</p>

<p>UPDATE: I think you need to get the ID of the inserted row in first table and use that for second table, right?</p>

<p>do like this : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7501464/how-to-get-the-id-of-inserted-row-in-mysql">How to get the ID of INSERTed row in mysql?</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: you can do multiple update, insert query you want done in a single action.like:</p>

<pre><code>$query = "UPDATE `tbl_something` SET col1 = 'first' WHERE col1 LIKE '%something%';INSERT INTO tbl_another (col1 , col2 , col5) VALUES ('firstValue' , 'secondValue' , 'fifthValue');UPDATE ... ; ";
</code></pre>

<p>then run it with mysq_query($query);</p>

<p>if you want you can get the id of effected row in the query, like I mentioned earlier and use it in the next one.</p>

<p>hope this helped</p>
