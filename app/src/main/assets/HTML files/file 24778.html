<p>Of course you are, your Shim has replaced the functionality completely, thus you're not seeing coverage. Since you're already making sure that <code>context.Authors</code> is overridden, why are you still overriding the <code>GetAll</code> method, which doesn't depend on anything you haven't already overridden?</p>
