<p>Your views are recycled, so by the time the async task finishes, the imageView has been reused and has a new image assigned to it.</p>

<p>What you can do is assign to the imageView a tag that is the file name of the file you are trying to load into it. You keep track of that same file name in the async task.  Then in your AsyncTask, in onPostExecute, you check if the tag the imageView has is the same file name that you just loaded. If it is, you go ahead and set the bitmap to the imageView. If it is not, then the view has been recycled and you simply drop the Bitmap you just created; another async task will be loading the right bitmap.</p>
