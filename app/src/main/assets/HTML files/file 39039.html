<p>I don't quiet understand the effect your going for. </p>

<p>If the text is appearing at the top it ussually points to the parent div having a height of 0px;</p>

<p>if you are floating .col-md-6 then that could cause a problem calculating height. In which case you would want to add a  after the last .col-md-6</p>

<p>if you are using a absolute positioned .col-md-6 then the size cannot be calculated and you will have to come up with a fixed width/height;</p>

<p>Here is a solution kinda that would work if the .row is full screen...</p>

<pre><code>.row {
    position:fixed; top:0px; left:0px; right:0px; bottom:0px;
}
.col-md-6 {
    position:absolute; top:0px; left:0px; right:0px; bottom:0px;
    text-align:center;
}
.col-md-6 img {
    height:100%;
}
.col-md-6 .top {
    position:absolute; top:0px; left:0px; right:0px;
}
.col-md-6 .bottom {
    position:absolute; bottom:0px; left:0px; right:0px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>the fiddle you provided has no css in it, It would help if you added some CSS to show the problem you are having.</p>

<p>UPDATED FOR COMMENT;</p>

<pre><code>.col-md-6 {
    float:left; height:100%; position:relative;
}
.col-md-6 img {
    height:100%;
}
.col-md-6 .top {
    position:absolute; top:0px; left:0px;
}
.col-md-6 .bottom {
    position:absolute; bottom:0px; left:0px;
}
</code></pre>
