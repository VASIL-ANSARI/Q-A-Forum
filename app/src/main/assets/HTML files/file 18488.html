<p><code>mysql_query()</code> returns a <em>resource</em> and you're handing that to <code>$this-&gt;load-&gt;view();</code> as the second parameter. If you dig into the underlying CodeIgniter source, you'll find that CodeIgniter does not know how to deal with Resources as this parameter - only Arrays and Objects.</p>

<p>Please refrain from using <code>mysql_query()</code> and it's friends. As per <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-query.php" rel="nofollow">PHP official documentation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use of this extension is discouraged. Instead, the MySQLi or PDO_MySQL
  extension should be used.</p>

<p>More importantly than this, if you're using CodeIgniter on-top of PHP, use the <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/index.html" rel="nofollow">Database Class</a> in conjunction with the <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/active_record.html" rel="nofollow">Active Record Class</a> to perform database queries. Hell, even use <a href="http://datamapper.wanwizard.eu/" rel="nofollow">Datamapper ORM</a> - please don't use <code>mysql_query()</code> or friends.</p>
