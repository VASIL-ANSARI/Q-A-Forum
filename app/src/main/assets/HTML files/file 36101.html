<p><strong>Option 2 is scale-able, option 1 isn't</strong>.</p>

<p>If you went with option 1, then decided to add a dozen more types of products, you'll need a new table for each, a new column in purchase_history for each, and to rewrite most of your queries and reports to suit.</p>

<p>Option 2 allows you not to worry about this, even if you stick with just the two types of products forever - at least you've only got one column to deal with in your purchase history table.</p>

<p>If it were me, I'd be combining the tickets and passes tables into a "products" table, and have an ENUM or similar field to differentiate them. Sure, the tickets table has more fields which passes doesn't need - but passes doesn't have any that tickets doesn't need, and you can just make the extras nullable and leave them there. Then just use product_id in your purchase history and do away with the product type table and field completely.</p>
