<p>First, Iâm guessing you want your image to âfold inâ from both sides, so youâll want to increase the imageâs left edge along with its right edge:</p>

<pre><code>g.drawImage(im.getImage(), x / 2 , 0, im.getIconWidth() - x, im.getIconHeight(), this);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the first int argument has been changed from <code>0</code> to <code>x / 2</code>.  Also, it is good practice to pass <code>this</code> as the ImageObserver argument when drawing images in a paintComponent method, since the component itself is the object which is interested in repainting itself when the image has finished loading in the background.</p>

<p>Second, change this:</p>

<pre><code>if (turning) {
    x = x + xspeed;
}
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>x = x + xspeed;
</code></pre>

<p>You donât need a flag to control the animation.  (The correct way to stop the animation is to call timer.stop(), which Iâll get to in a moment.)</p>

<p>Third, change this:</p>

<pre><code>if(x &gt;= im.getIconWidth()/2){ 
    turning = false;
    x = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>if(x &gt;= im.getIconWidth()){ 
    xspeed = -xspeed;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>As I said, the <code>turning</code> flag is not needed.</li>
<li>The reason for comparing <code>x</code> to the imageâs width, instead of half of the width, is that we want to change the image only when the first image has completely âfolded in.â</li>
<li>The negation of <code>xspeed</code> reverses the animation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, at the end of your actionPerformed method, youâll want to add this:</p>

<pre><code>if (x &lt;= 0) {
    timer.stop();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This halts the animation when the reverse image reaches its full size, which is why the <code>turning</code> flag is not needed.</p>
