<p>According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-201406-201407" rel="nofollow">StatCounter</a>, this is the use of old Firefox versions (July 2014):</p>

<pre><code>Version | 2.0 | 3.0 | 3.5 | 3.6 | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12  | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16
   â°    | .2  | .8  | .2  | 1.6 | .4 | .3 | .4 | .2 | .6 | .3 | .7 | .6 | 1.4 | .6 | .6 | .8 | 1.1
</code></pre>

<p>Suming them all, it's 10.8 â° = 1.08 %</p>

<p>It's you who should decide if it's worth implementing a workaround for those 1% or not.</p>
