<p>The issue is that the library you are using does not <em>stop</em> the connection when the app is backgrounded... however, Android may kill the process.</p>

<p>A <code>Service</code> exists specifically to prevent that problem. If you implement it in a <code>Service</code> it should solve your problem.</p>

<p>A word of caution: just because you <em>can</em> do this it does not mean that you <em>should</em> do this. Be careful about memory and battery usage when you implement a <code>Service</code>. They are intended to run in the background indefinitely - and you can make some users very unhappy if you have CPU/battery intensive code, or Android may kill the <code>Service</code> if it consumes too much memory.</p>
