<p>Somehow when you exported the file, the filters for the file dialog box (<code>*.jar;*.zip</code>) got attached to the filename, which is <code>graph3D.jar;*.jar;*.zip</code>, not <code>graph3D.jar</code>. Java can't find it because it doesn't have the name you supplied. Rename the file and pay close attention next time you export; either you fat-fingered something, or you're triggering a significant bug that needs fixing.</p>
