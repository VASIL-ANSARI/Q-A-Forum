<p>You can't do it easily with UILabel element on iOS 4. For example you can override UILabel class and play with calculating text width and then setting black views to the background, which is not an easy job.</p>

<p>I suggest you to use UIWebView instead. You can simply use HTML and CSS rules.</p>
