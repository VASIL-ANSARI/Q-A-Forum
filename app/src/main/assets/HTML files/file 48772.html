<p>And now it's up to me to disappoint Santa? Oh, my...</p>

<p>It is not possible.</p>

<p>You cannot check for typos. Example? Your example: gmial.com is valid.</p>

<p>You can do a rough check <code>one of more characters followed by an @ sign followed by two or more characters followed by a dot followed by two or more characters</code> There are a lot of regular expression to be found online, just ask Google for "regular expression email javascript". Please choose a simple one.</p>

<p>The only thing is hoping that the email-sending process is fast and add a line or two to ask them to check their email and if there is nothing in it in a minute or two they have to check if their email is correct. You may have the password-input on the same page they send you their data, to raise the chance they keep that page open.</p>
