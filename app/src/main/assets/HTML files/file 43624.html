<p>Because the operator <code>/</code> with two <code>int</code>s as operands always performs an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_%28mathematics%29#Of_integers" rel="nofollow">integer division</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to perform a real division, you need to convert the operands to a non-integer numeric type (<code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>decimal</code>). In other words, you have to perform the conversion <em>before</em> the division happens, not afterwards.</p>
