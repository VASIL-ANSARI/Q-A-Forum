<p>If you don't mind outputing the importance:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT keyword, match(keyword) against ('The cracy fox jumps over the red cow') as importance
from db.words
WHERE match(keyword) against ('The cracy fox jumps over the red cow')
ORDER BY importance
LIMIT 2;
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, you can use a subquery:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT keyword
FROM (SELECT keyword, match(keyword) against ('The cracy fox jumps over the red cow') as importance
      from db.words
      WHERE match(keyword) against ('The cracy fox jumps over the red cow')
      ORDER BY importance
      LIMIT 2
     ) k;
</code></pre>
