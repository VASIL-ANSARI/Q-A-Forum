<p>A boolean result is always true or false, and in C true is represented by <code>1</code> and false by <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>The logical not operator <code>!</code> gives a boolean result, i.e. <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>. So if an expression is "true" (i.e. non-zero) then applying <code>!</code> on that expression will make it false, i.e. <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>In your example you have <code>!x || !y</code>. First <code>!x</code> is evaluated, and it evaluates to false, leading to <code>!y</code> being evaluated, and it also evaluates to false, so the while expression becomes false, i.e. <code>0</code>.</p>
