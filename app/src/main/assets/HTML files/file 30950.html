<p>I ended up figuring this out. I built the code below. I just have to restructure all the links and it will work.</p>

<p>Here is the HTML</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href="javascript:navigator_Go('hello.php');"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

<p>Here is the javascript I run on the top of everypage. It gets all of the web pages and keeps them inside the full screen mode. If their is a lot of content on the new page it may take half a second longer to load but get the job done. </p>

<p><code>function navigator_Go(url) {
    window.location.assign(url); // This allows links to stay in full screen mode
}</code></p>
