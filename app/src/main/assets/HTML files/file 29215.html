<p>See i was going through the animation on dependency property and found an intereting point I thought I should share</p>

<p>To be animated, the animation's target property must be a dependency property. Also, to be animated, the target property's value type must be supported by one of the existing <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.media.animation.timeline.aspx" rel="nofollow">Timeline</a>-derived animation types. When an animation is applied and running, the animated value operates at a higher precedence than any value (such as a local value) that the property otherwise has. Animations also have an optional HoldEnd behavior that can cause animations to apply to property values even if the animation visually appears to be stopped.</p>

<p>I dont know may be This will help Here's the link to the documentation</p>
