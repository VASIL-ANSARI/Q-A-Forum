<p>The <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code> requires 64 bits in order to fit inside a long variable.</p>

<p><code>Math.pow(2,63)</code> returns a double. A double uses the same number of bits (64) to approximate much larger floating point numbers (some of the bits are used by the exponent), so <code>Math.pow(2,63)</code> can't be equal to <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code>, since <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code> can't be accurately represented by a double variable.</p>

<p>EDIT :</p>

<p>Actually, <code>Math.pow(2, 63)</code> can be represented accurately in a double variable, since it's a power of 2 with a relatively small exponent. However, when you subtract 1 from it, you get a number that can't be represented accurately in a double variable.</p>
