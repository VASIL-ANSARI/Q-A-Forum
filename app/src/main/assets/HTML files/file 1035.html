<p>This is .NET Generics.  The type within the &lt; > denotes the type of element contained in the list.</p>

<p>with ArrayList you'd have to cast the elements inside...  </p>

<pre><code>int x = (int)myArrayList[4];
</code></pre>

<p>with List you can avoid that step because the compiler already knows the type.</p>

<pre><code>int x = myList[4];
</code></pre>

<p>Generics are available in .NET 2.0 and later.</p>
