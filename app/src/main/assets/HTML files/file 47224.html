<p>You can try to compress your array. There are several algorithm you can find and this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/16469857/5076707">post</a> may help you. It provides an explanation for the three most known lossless algorithm :<br>
 1. Huffman a tree based algorithm it has a lot of applications and specialization<br>
 2. RLE for Run-length encoding  is well suited for icons compression<br>
 3. LZ77 which use a dictionnary and is a basis to a lot of different algorithms</p>

<p>A lossless algorithm is what you need because you don't want to lose the datas in your array. That's why I wouldn't recommend UDP since it does not check if the data has been received. </p>
