<p>The problem with stopping the event processor from reading is that you introduce a race condition: What happens if the server sends an event right after you terminated the read? The "response" that you read would wind up being an event.</p>

<p>The proper way to do this is to do all your reading, both events and responses, in one place and handle the responses like an event also. Right before you send a command, register a listener for the response, then send the command. When the reading thread sees a response, have it find the proper listener and notify it that the response has been received.</p>
