<p>I would put the background image in differently.</p>

<pre><code>#home_request {
   background-image: url(http://blmprinthouse.com/blm_revamp/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DontBeBoring_1_Web2.jpg);
   background-size: cover;
   background-position: center;
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   background-attachment: fixed;
   position: static;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should do the trick and show up on all browsers. Delete the CSS you have under "#home_request:before"</p>

<p>Also, if you're making this responsive, and mobile friendly, you're going to want to add this in your mobile media queries:</p>

<pre><code>#home_request {
  background-attachment: initial;
}
</code></pre>
