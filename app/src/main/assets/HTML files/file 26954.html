<p>Quick and dirty way to achieve this is to create another windows form that will have same buttons as message box but that will also have an image.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lxloz.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<ul>
<li>Create public Boolean property in this form that will be named something like OKButtonClicked that will tell you whether OK or Cancel was clicked</li>
<li>Set ControlBox property to False so that minimize, maximize and close buttons are not shown</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a code behind for this form </p>

<pre><code>public partial class MazeForm : Form
{
    public MazeForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private bool okButton = false;

    public bool OKButtonClicked
    {
        get { return okButton; }
    }

    private void btnOK_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        okButton = true;
        this.Close();
    }

    private void btnCancel_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        okButton = false;
        this.Close();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally in your main form you can do something like this </p>

<pre><code>MazeForm m = new MazeForm();
m.ShowDialog();

bool okButtonClicked = m.OKButtonClicked;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is something I quickly created in 15 min and that it probably needs more work but it will get you in the right direction.</p>
