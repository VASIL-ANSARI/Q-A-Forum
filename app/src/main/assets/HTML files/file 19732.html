<p>data-no-turbolinks is not the issue here... </p>

<p>It appears bootstrap js out of the box monitors only document.ready, and bootstrap JS may need modified to check for page:load as well</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/js/bootstrap-modal.js#L222" rel="nofollow">Look at line 222</a></p>

<p>This will only fire on the first request in which bootstrap is included. It needs modified to fire on page:load as well.</p>

<p>One suggestion I can make is to use gem 'twitter-bootstrap-turbo' for getting bootstrap. This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/davydotcom/twitter-bootstrap-rails" rel="nofollow">twitter-bootstrap-rails</a> , with the addition of turbolinks handlers.</p>
