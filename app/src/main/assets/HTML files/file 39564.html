<p>Core Location has a set of APIs for specifically this use-case, which Apple refers to as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/LocationAwarenessPG/CoreLocation/CoreLocation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009497-CH2-SW8" rel="nofollow">Significant Location Change Monitoring</a>.</p>

<p>From the documentation: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The significant-change location service delivers updates only when there has been a significant change in the deviceâs location, such as 500 meters or more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This API only updates your location when and if you've traveled the specified distance. It does not provide constant updates. If you need constant updates, you will have to use the standard location service. </p>
