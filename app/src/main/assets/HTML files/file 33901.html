<p>That character is <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f60a/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Unicode Character 'SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES' (U+1F60A)</a>.</p>

<p>U+1F60A is in plane 1, the Supplementary Multilingual Plane, but MySQL's utf8 supports only plane 0, the Basic Multilingual Plane. So you'll have to use utf8mb4.</p>

<p>That symbol is also not widely supported in fonts, so you may have a hard time displaying it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Re your comment, here's a demonstration of filtering out characters beyond the basic plane.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$str = "Ñí ½í¸Ñ-Ðµ Ð² ÑÐµÑÐ½Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐµ";
$str = preg_replace('/[^\x{0000}-\x{ffff}]/u', '', $str);
echo $str . "\n";
</code></pre>

<p>But if it wasn't clear from my answer above, MySQL <em>does</em> support the supplemental plane in utf8mb4.</p>
