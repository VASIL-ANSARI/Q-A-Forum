<p>It's simple: <strong>don't edit the designer code.</strong>  Those warnings are there for a reason, and for Visual Studio to work correctly it needs to <em>own</em> that file.  </p>

<p>This is a partial class: everything you need to do, you can do in the matching non-designer file for that class; this includes all your control declarations and other things.  Since you're trying to avoid the designer entirely, let visual studio have that file and just put everything in your normal .cs file.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> 
Based on the comment, I want to add the following &mdash;<br>
Either use the designer or don't use the designer.  Don't be wishy-washy about it.  If you're using and relying on the designer for some things, you <strong><em>MUST</em></strong> leave the designer's file alone.  </p>

<p>If you're avoiding the designer, then really avoid the designer.  <em>Everything</em> it does you can do in your own code (except of course for the visual queues, but even that can be done better via prototyping).  You can even create your own additional file for the partial class to keep designer-like code in.</p>

<p>If you're only using the designer as an occasional code generator to help reduce some boring typing, do that in a separate project or on a throw-away form in your existing project and just copy/paste the code over.</p>
