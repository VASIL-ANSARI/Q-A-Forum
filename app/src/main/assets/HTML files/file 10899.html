<p>There's no way to filter message on the server today, but you can block messages to the caller from the client side. If you look at some of the samples on signalr, you'll see that they assign each client a generated id to the client in a method (usually called join). Whenever you invoke a method from the hub, pass the id of the calling client, then on the client side do a check to make sure the id of the client isn't the same as the caller. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>public class Chat : Hub { 
    public void Join() {
        // Assign the caller and id
        Caller.id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    }

    public void DoSomething() {
        // Pass the caller's id back to the client along with any extra data
        Clients.doIt(Caller.id, "value");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Client side</p>

<pre><code>var chat = $.connection.chat;
chat.doIt = function(id, value) {
   if(chat.id === id) {
      // The id is the same so do nothing
      return;
   }

   // Otherwise do it!
   alert(value);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
