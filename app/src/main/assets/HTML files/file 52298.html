<p>No, GLSL runs on the GPU, and therefore, the memory needs to be mapped on the GPU for it to be able to access and modify the texture. GLSL can only process OpenGL objects, since that is the way OpenGL was designed.</p>

<p>However, using a <a href="http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_pbo.html" rel="nofollow">PBO</a>, you can improve the time it takes to upload/download the texture to/from the GPU.</p>
