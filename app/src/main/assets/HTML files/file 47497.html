<p>Turns out I had to run <code>python manage.py makemigrations</code> locally before <code>eb deploy</code>. That way, the migration files are created and when <code>migrate</code> is ran on the eb instance, it knows how to change the database accordingly.</p>

<p>My .config file is now:</p>

<pre><code>container_commands:
  01_migrate:
    command: "source /opt/python/run/venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; python manage.py migrate --noinput"
    leader_only: true
  02_createsu:
    command: "source /opt/python/run/venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; python manage.py createsu"
    leader_only: true
  03_collectstatic:
    command: "source /opt/python/run/venv/bin/activate &amp;&amp; python manage.py collectstatic --noinput"
</code></pre>
