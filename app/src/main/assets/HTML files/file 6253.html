<p>If I understand correctly : your dispatching thread is blocked on some system call (say <code>select</code> or <code>poll</code>), and you would like the <code>onData</code> member function to follow the same notification path.</p>

<p>Using a <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/pipe" rel="nofollow">pipe</a> seems like a good solution to me without hurting the design too much :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>select</code> monitors one end of the pipe</li>
<li>the 3rd library callbacks 'rings' the other end of the pipe when called</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows for a 'thread jump', the only issue being that the pipe should only be used as a notification facility : the parameter to the <code>onData</code> function will have to be queued somewhere between the pipe notification and the processing thread wake-up.</p>
