<p>If your code is consistently indented as in your question, you can manage with a regular expression like this:</p>

<p>Capture:</p>

<pre><code>(?s)^(\s*)if.*?\1\{.*?\1\}
</code></pre>

<p>Replace:</p>

<pre><code>$0 //if
</code></pre>

<p>Where the <code>(?s)</code> at the start turns on single-line mode (meaning dots match newlines), and the backreferences ensure that the if statement and braces match in indentation and are therefore matching.</p>
