<p>This is not a complete answer, but the very strength you cite can also be its principal weakness.  Consider what would happen if action listeners were implemented weakly: </p>

<pre><code>button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    // blah
});
</code></pre>

<p>That action listener is going to get garbage collected at any moment!  It's not uncommon that the only reference to an anonymous class is the event to which you are adding it.</p>
