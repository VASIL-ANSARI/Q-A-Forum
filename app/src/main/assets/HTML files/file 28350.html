<p>When dealing with this type of problems, first think about the data you're trying to capture.</p>

<p>Dealing with implicit cursors in PL/SQL require 1-row, so you need to make sure you understand the data.</p>

<p>In this case, you pass in a variable that you don't use in any of your queries, so I suggest you re-evaluate.</p>

<p>I don't have a database at hand to run this, but you should be able to work this out and hopefully get you a bit closer. I put it in an anonymous block so that I can write it really quick.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE
    PROCEDURE model_details_sp (p_model IN VARCHAR2, p_noofcars OUT NUMBER)
    IS
        p_description   VARCHAR2 (200);
    BEGIN
        --2
        SELECT COUNT (model_name)
          INTO p_noofcars
          FROM i_car
         WHERE model_name = p_model;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line ('No of Cars for model: ' || p_noofcars);

        --3
        SELECT model_description
          INTO p_description
          FROM i_car --the table should be the car_model table so that only one record is returned
         WHERE model_name = p_model;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line ('Model Desc' || p_description);
    END model_details_sp;
BEGIN
    dbms_output.put_line('');
END;
</code></pre>

<p>To @David Aldridge comment:</p>

<p>Try running this--the result should be a failure--as you cannont select multiple rows using the into CLAUS, unless you aggregate the data:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE
  p_num NUMBER;
BEGIN
  SELECT LEVEL INTO p_num FROM DUAL CONNECT BY LEVEL &lt;= 10;
  dbms_output.put(p_num);
END;
</code></pre>

<p>The error you should see is this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error report:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>ORA-01422: exact fetch returns more than requested number of rows
