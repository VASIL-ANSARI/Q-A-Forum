<p>Here are some things I would try. I don't have comment privileges yet, otherwise I would ask for elaborations: </p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any outputs in the console for Xcode? Generally when Autolayout is forced to break constraints, it tells you about it in the logs. </li>
<li>So to be clear, for the Content View, you have a constraint that sets the width equal to the ScrollView, as well as constraints to match the Leading and Trailing edges to the ScrollView? </li>
</ol>

<p>If the constraint is not being followed then either the ScrollView is also expanding somehow, or the constraint conflicts with another constraint, and the width-matching constraint got broken somewhere along the way. </p>
