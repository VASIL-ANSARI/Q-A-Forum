<p>If you're brute-forcing to find which points are part of the hull, you might as well continue doing ugly things to find the order of the points.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with the upper-leftmost point.</li>
<li>Calculate the angles from that point to all other points. </li>
<li>Pick the point with the angle closest to 0 degrees. This is the next point clockwise around the hull.</li>
<li>Rinse, lather, repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>You have to adjust the target angle as you go around the hull, but this works (and it's one way you'd do it on paper.)</p>
