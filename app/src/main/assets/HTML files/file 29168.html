<p>I converted this project to arc after removing the line about [_window release]; and fixing the IS_IPAD definition to just be 0 for now, without issue. (via the Edit menu, under Refactor, convert to Arc)</p>

<p>If you copied some of the project to your own, the error is probably due to either not implementing the KZDefaultColorControllerDelegate properly, or you're missing the pickerChanged: method in your code.. or not converting to arc first.  Commenting out release statements won't necessarily fix all arc issues.</p>
