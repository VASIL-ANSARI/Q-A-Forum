<p>One approach that might work would be to do something like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the window handle (FindWindow() or something similar, there are a few ways to do this)</li>
<li>get the window dimensions (GetClientRect() or GetWindowRect())</li>
<li>get the device context for the window (GetWindowDC())</li>
<li>get the image data from the window (BitBlt() or similar)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible that you will need elevated privelages to access another processes window dc, if so you may need to inject code/dll into the target process space to do this.</p>

<p>HTH.</p>
