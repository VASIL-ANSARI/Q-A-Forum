<p>If I'm understanding correctly, I think you just need to mark the element as optional in the schema. Set minOccurs to 0 and maxOccurs to 1 to create an optional element.</p>

<p>EDIT: After rereading, it seems that if you don't have a detailedErrorMessage, your if block will throw a NullPointerException. When you chain together a bunch of method calls like that where any of them could be null, you are playing with fire. Validate that each child exists before you check the value.</p>
