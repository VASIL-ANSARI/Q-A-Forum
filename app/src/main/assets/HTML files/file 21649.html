<p>(See comments below the question - now I know what happens to you)</p>

<p>Ahhh - you cannot solve this without Javascript: quick (double?) click on the TEXT ITSELF is interpreted as "select text" by the browser, and it does not send the event to the checkbox when that happens. With Javascript you can force "un-select" of the text on click.</p>

<p>Click "slowly" - avoiding double click text selection - and it will work (just to show the cause of the problem, no solution without Javascript or proprietary CSS).</p>

<p>Try adding this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/880512/prevent-text-selection-after-double-click">Prevent text selection after double click</a></p>

<p>Maybe you should use a full Javascript Checkbox-Button solution instead of trying to accomplish it with just CSS.</p>
