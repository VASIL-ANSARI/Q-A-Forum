<p>You need to create a local config file for your local environment.
Create a folder in app/config (laravel 4) and name it YOUR_FOLDER_NAME. THen edit /bootstrap/start.php for laravel 4 :</p>

<pre><code>$env = $app-&gt;detectEnvironment(array(
  'YOUR_FOLDER_NAME' =&gt; array('YOUR_HOSTNAME'),
));
</code></pre>

<p>Then copy database.php which is located under app/config/ and paste in to YOUR_FOLDER_NAME. Then you edit this file that you pasted with your local configs. This will make all the configs in YOUR_FOLDER_NAME overwrite global app configs located in app/config.</p>
