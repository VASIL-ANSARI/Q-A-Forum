<li><p>Regarding your original question, "how do I recognize the path of a newly added header"?</p>

<p>a) The easiest way is to just add the .h file directly from your project:</p>

<p>b) Alternatively, you can edit your project's include path:</p>

<p>Project > Properties > VC++ Directories >
  &lt;= add the directory with your new header(s) to the end of the existing path</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding your new question:  "Unable to start ... HelloWorld.exe":</p>

<p>It sounds like you have compile errors, and the .exe never built.</p>

<p>Run "Build > Build solution", and fix any errors.</p></li>
</ol>
