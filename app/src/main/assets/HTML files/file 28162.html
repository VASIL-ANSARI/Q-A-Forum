<p>For structured markup like HTML, it is better to use a parser like <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="nofollow">BeautifulSoup</a> than regular expressions. A few reasons for this include better results for malformed HTML and decreased complexity (you don't need to reinvent the wheel).</p>

<p>Considering the question at face value though, it seems easier to split the HTML up into lines using <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=readlines#file.readlines" rel="nofollow">readlines</a> so that you are dealing with only one line at a time when applying regular expressions.</p>
