<p>It is possible to run benchmarks to see. I did for PHP 4 and discovered that doing string concatenation was much faster (an order of magnitude? I don't remember exactly) than embedded variables. By comparison, plain strings in double quotes were only very slightly faster than single quotes.</p>

<p>But that was for PHP <em>4</em>. I ran the same tests later for PHP <em>5</em> and the difference in performance is pretty much negligible. </p>
