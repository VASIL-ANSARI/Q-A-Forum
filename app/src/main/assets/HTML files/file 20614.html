<p>To call a function, you need to use parentheses: <code>Part1();</code>. The parentheses contain the arguments that will be passed to the function, but in your case there are none so the parentheses are empty.</p>

<p>Also, the index of your first <code>for</code> loop is incorrect. Your array's indices start at 0 and end at 9. You seemed to get this correct in the second <code>for</code> loop but not in the first. It should be <code>for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++)</code>.</p>
