<p>You could solve this problem by having <code>replace: true</code> option in your directive, which will basically replace your directive DOM with the template which you have given from your directive.</p>

<p><strong>Directive</strong></p>

<pre><code>.directive('myDir', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    template: "&lt;div class="layout"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;",
    replace: true //added replace true property
  }
})
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Resultant HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="layout"&gt;..Content..&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Like above I shown, you could get rid off the unnecessary HTML tag by simply using <code>replace</code> option of directive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
  
  <p>As per Angular Docs <code>replace</code> option has been deprecated in Angular2,
  but in your case you can avoid that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you really wanted to go avoid the use of <code>replace</code> option of directive then I'd suggest you to use your directive as an attribute instead of going for an <code>element</code> but then you need to take <code>&lt;div class="layout"&gt;</code> outside and then your could put your directive over that like <code>&lt;div class="layout" my-dir&gt;</code>. But if you again think over it in Angular2 perspective, you are changing your component structure to old angular way using <code>attribute</code>/<code>class</code></p>
