<p>This isn't a full answer to your question, but you can create html in your tags via the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/TagHelper.html" rel="nofollow">content_tag</a> method. My guess as to why would be cleanliness of code.</p>

<p>Also, content_tag allows you to nest tags in blocks. Check out this <a href="http://tuples.us/2007/05/03/content_tag-is-fixed/" rel="nofollow">blog post on content_tag</a>.</p>
