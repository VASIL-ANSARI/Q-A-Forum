<p>I suspect you're writing a portable class library or something like that - if you look at the list of supported platforms in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fysy0a4b(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>StreamWriter(String)</code></a> it's considerably smaller than the list of supported platforms in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wtbhzte9(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>StreamWriter(Stream)</code></a>. I suggest you just open a stream in whatever way is suitable for your target, and then wrap that in a <code>StreamWriter</code>.</p>
