<p>Although you have not provided enough information for a full assessment, most likely you want to use the regular MVC Template.</p>

<p><strong>MVC Template</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ASP.NET MVC was designed to facilitate patterns-based development
practices such as test-driven development, separation of concerns,
inversion of control, and dependency injection. The framework
encourages separating the business logic layer of a web application
from its presentation layer. By dividing the application into models
(M), views (V), and controllers (C), ASP.NET MVC can make it easier
to manage complexity in larger applications.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Single Page Application Template</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Single Page Application (SPA) template creates a sample
application that uses JavaScript, HTML 5, and KnockoutJS on the
client, and ASP.NET Web API on the server.</li>
</ul>

<p>So the choice is quite easy. Unless you are planning to build a SPA using KnockoutJS, go with the regular template.</p>
