<p>First off.. <code>live()</code> is deprecated, you should be using <code>on()</code>.</p>

<p>It seems that everytime you click on <code>#acalendar_left</code>, creating the whole calendar again, but i don't see where you unregister the event; so the <code>live()</code> event will be firing 2 times at the next run, etc, which should explain why it's getting slower and slower.</p>
