<p>Apparently the issue was the use of the PixelFormat.Gray8.  I changed it to PixelFormat.Indexed8, using BitmapPallettes.Gray256 for my pallette, and that seemed to fix my issue.</p>

<pre><code>var src = BitmapSource.Create(NumberOfColumns, NumberOfRows,
                                96, 96,
                                PixelFormats.Indexed8, BitmapPalettes.Gray256,
                                scaledData,
                                NumberOfRows);
</code></pre>

<p>Still don't understand what was going on.</p>
