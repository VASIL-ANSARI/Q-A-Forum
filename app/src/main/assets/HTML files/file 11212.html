<p>Have you checked out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-examples/wiki/project_UrchinTracker" rel="nofollow">UrchinTracker</a> example on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-examples/" rel="nofollow">gwt-examples</a>? It's pretty well documented and easy enough to use. If you're using History Tokens, you can use the implementation <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gwt-examples/wiki/project_UrchinTracker#Anchor_Tag_Parameters" rel="nofollow">shown here</a>. That would be the most automatic/generic way I can think of. You can certainly call the native methods from anywhere, but that's not very efficient. Another option is to make an abstract class that you implement for your UI files that takes care of firing off the appropriate native calls.</p>
