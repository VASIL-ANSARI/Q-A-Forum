<p>You have to use either <code>style.backgroundColor</code> or <code>style['backgroundColor']</code> to set the background-color. Either of these methods should work across browsers. I have tested in FireFox 23, Opera 15, Chrome 31 (Dev Build) and IE10.</p>

<p>You can refer <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/hari_shanx/xH42x/2/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a sample fiddle. The fiddle has three <code>div</code> with <code>id</code> as <code>aa</code>, <code>bb</code> and <code>cc</code> respectively.</p>

<p>When you do <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code>, you will find that it affects all three <code>div</code> in Chrome, IE10 and Opera. But in FireFox, it affects only the first and third <code>div</code> because the second <code>div</code> uses <code>style['background-color']</code> and is not recognized by FireFox.</p>
