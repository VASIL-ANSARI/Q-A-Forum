<p>You can use fabric.js.
In fabric.js you can easily manage events. For example see <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ali_soltani/qqn7u9f0/17/" rel="nofollow">this fiddle</a>. In this I created rectangle and add to canvas.I managed mousedown with <code>canvas.on('mouse:down', function (options)</code> in it.</p>
