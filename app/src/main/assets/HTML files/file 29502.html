<p>It sounds like your app doesn't have a bundle identifier</p>

<p>Do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right click on your .plist file,</li>
<li>Click open as -> Source Code</li>
<li>Copy and paste that code onto your post so we can take a look at your plist configuration. Chances are something is missing and that something needs to be added such as your bundle identifier key</li>
</ol>

<p>Once youve updated your post and i've had a chance to take a look at it, I can update my post to help correct your situation</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>It turns out that the problem occurred due to a space character found in the filename which must not occur. Taking out the space character solves the problem.</p>
