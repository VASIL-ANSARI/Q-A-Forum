<p>Please include code when asking for help, it makes it hard for us to decipher what you're saying with only words.</p>

<p>From what I understand, the 'Churvaness' will drop down to the row where 'Login' sits. When that happens, there's an empty space above 'Churvaness'; therefore, you'd like to expand your 'Product/Price Cell Sheet' to fill that extra space.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>Use <code>android:layout_height="match_parent"</code> on your 'Product/Price Cell Sheet'</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Update your question if you'd like a more accurate answer.</p>
