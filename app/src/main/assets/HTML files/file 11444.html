<p>When you want to access any DOM element, you should do it after domready event. As it might be possible while script execution that element doesn't exist.</p>

<p>So any DOm related function such as <code>$("elementid")</code> should be used only after domready event. For doing this Jquery provide <code>$.ready()</code> function.</p>

<p>So, if you put all your code inside <code>$.ready()</code>, it will work correctly.</p>

<p>It was working in Jsfiddle, because you have selected to place JavaScript in body tag (notice no wrap body). So it will get executed when webpage is loaded.</p>
