<p>In standard SQL this is a simple query on the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROLE_TABLE_GRANTS view.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROLE_TABLE_GRANTS WHERE GRANTEE = 'THE_ROLE_NAME'
</code></pre>

<p>Some database systems do not support this view, but have alternative views containing the roles and the granted privileges. Among open source databases, <a href="http://hsqldb.org" rel="nofollow">HSQLDB</a> supports a large number of INFORMATION_SCHEMA views, including the above.</p>
