<p>Ask for a pipe:</p>

<pre><code>int p[2];
pipe(p);
</code></pre>

<p>Before the <code>exec()</code> of the first program, bind its standard output to it, and close the other fds:</p>

<pre><code>dup2(p[0], STDOUT_FILENO);
close(p[0]);
close(p[1]);
</code></pre>

<p>Before the <code>exec()</code> of the second program redirect its standard input:</p>

<pre><code>dup2(p[1], STDIN_FILENO);
close(p[0]);
close(p[1]);
</code></pre>

<p>You will also have to close both ends of the pipe in the master program after the <code>fork()</code>s, and you are done (for the pipe setup).</p>
