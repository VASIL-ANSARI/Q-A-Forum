<p>No, you cannot select a subset of your rows before running a full-text query on it. If you take a look at the query plan generated you will see that the full-text execution is at the bottom of the tree with results being filtered up to the WHERE clause.</p>

<p>Since the row selection is 'dynamically determined' creating a ft-index on a view of the table doesn't seem to be an option either. </p>
