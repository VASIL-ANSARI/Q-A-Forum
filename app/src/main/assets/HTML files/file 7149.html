<p>Looks like at the time of your .jar deployment something has already instantiated the <code>TimerServiceFactory</code>.</p>

<p>Check your dependencies, I once had a similar problem where one of the jars I had as a maven dependency actually had a jboss.xml in its META-INF folder and was binding a bean I was using to a JNDI name I was already using.</p>

<p>Its a pain to search your dependencies, but this looks like its conflicting with something.</p>

<p>Its possible that one of your dependencies depends on an older version of <code>interface org.jboss.ejb3.timerservice.spi.TimerServiceFactory</code> and it gets instantiated before yours.</p>

<p>Check your .m2 folder and see if you have 2 versions of jboss-ejb3-timerservice-spi downloaded.</p>
