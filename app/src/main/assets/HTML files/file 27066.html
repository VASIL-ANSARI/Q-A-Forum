<p>I notice that it appeared in 9.2. In version 9.1, the out field was named <code>procpid</code>:</p>

<pre>
 parameter_mode |  parameter_name  
----------------+------------------
 IN             | pid
 OUT            | datid
 OUT            | procpid
 OUT            | usesysid
 ...
</pre>

<p>Looking for the change in postgres git history leads to this commit:</p>

    Separate state from query string in pg_stat_activity

    This separates the state (running/idle/idleintransaction etc) into
    it's own field ("state"), and leaves the query field containing just
    query text.

    The query text will now mean "current query" when a query is running
    and "last query" in other states. Accordingly,the field has been
    renamed from current_query to query.

    Since backwards compatibility was broken anyway to make that, the procpid
    field has also been renamed to pid - along with the same field in
    pg_stat_replication for consistency.

<p>Among the lines that changed, here is the one of interest:</p>

<pre>
-DATA(insert OID = 2022 (  pg_stat_get_activity         PGNSP PGUID 12 1 100 0 0 f f f f t s 1 0 2249 "23" "{23,26,23,26,25,25,16,1184,1184,1184,869,25,23}" "{i,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o}" "{pid,datid,procpid,usesysid,application_name,current_query,waiting,xact_start,query_start,backend_start,client_addr,client_hostname,client_port}" _null_ pg_stat_get_activity _null_ _null_ _null_ ));
+DATA(insert OID = 2022 (  pg_stat_get_activity         PGNSP PGUID 12 1 100 0 0 f f f f t s 1 0 2249 "23" "{23,26,23,26,25,25,25,16,1184,1184,1184,1184,869,25,23}" "{i,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o,o}" "{pid,datid,pid,usesysid,application_name,state,query,waiting,xact_start,query_start,backend_start,state_change,client_addr,client_hostname,client_port}" _null_ pg_stat_get_activity _null_ _null_ _null_ ));
 </pre>

<p>In this pre-digested form, it's plausible that the authors didn't notice the double-use of <code>pid</code>, or else they didn't care since it's harmless in practice.</p>

<p>It is let through because these internal functions are created by <code>initdb</code> in a fast path that skips the create checks of normal user functions.</p>
