<p>I use <a href="http://brackets.io/" rel="nofollow">Brackets</a>. It is one of the finest editor. Also updates the page as soon as you make changes in code. So need not to refresh.</p>

<p>Edit: Even it is open source. You can see code <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/releases" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
