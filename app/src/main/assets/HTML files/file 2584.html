<p>You can install own exception handlers. One technique for Swing is explained here: <a href="http://ruben42.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/catching-all-runtime-exceptions-in-swing/" rel="nofollow">http://ruben42.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/catching-all-runtime-exceptions-in-swing/</a>. Eric Burke also has <a href="http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2007/10/07/programmers-notebook-uncaught-exception-handlers/" rel="nofollow">nice article on this topic</a>. Another general technique is using <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler%28java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler%29" rel="nofollow"><code>Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler</code></a>, which is called when thread dies due to exception (according to comments in the first referenced article, Swing thread doesn't die, so setting uncaught exception handler doesn't work for Swing, but Eric's article uses this technique).</p>

<p>Your exception handler can then display error, log it, or do anything you want, without caring about other code using standard output/error streams.</p>
