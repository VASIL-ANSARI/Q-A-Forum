<p>I managed to solve the problem so I'll answer here in case someone has the same problem.</p>

<p>The function <code>shell_exec</code> works like this:</p>

<pre><code>$var = shell_exec('python path/to/your/python/script.py '.$var1.' '.$var2. ...);
</code></pre>

<p>The arguments you wanna pass to your python script MUST be separated by a white space, that's how python will interpret the multi variables you are sending.</p>

<p>The string "Green Day" has a white space within it, so it was like sending</p>

<pre><code>$var = shell_exec('pyhon path/to/your/python/script.py Green Day');
</code></pre>

<p>So when I'd do <code>sys.argv[1]</code> in Python, it would get only "Green" cause "Day" would be the "second" parameter.</p>

<p>So just loop through your <code>sys.argv</code> in Python and concatenate the strings like this:</p>

<pre><code>string = ''
for word in sys.argv[1:]:
    string += word + ' '
</code></pre>
