<p>Here's an unoptimized version:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM table_name as T
WHERE ( 
        number in (SELECT number
                   FROM table_name
                   WHERE status = 'Completed')
        AND statusdate &lt; (SELECT MAX(statusdate)
                          FROM table_name
                          GROUP BY number
                          HAVING number = T.number)
    )
    OR
    (
        number in (SELECT number
                   FROM table_name
                   WHERE status = 'Processing')
        AND statusdate &gt; (SELECT MIN(statusdate)
                          FROM table_name
                          GROUP BY number
                          HAVING number = T.number)                   
    );
</code></pre>

<p>These are the records it deletes:</p>

<pre><code>id  number      status      statusdate
2   12121312    Processing  February, 06 2015 13:37:00
3   12121312    Processing  March, 06 2015 14:29:00
4   99999999    Processing  March, 06 2015 15:33:00
5   99999999    Completed   March, 06 2015 18:39:00
6   99999999    Completed   April, 06 2015 19:39:00
</code></pre>

<p>Just replace <code>SELECT * FROM</code> to <code>DELETE FROM</code> in the <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/b0192/2" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a>.</p>
