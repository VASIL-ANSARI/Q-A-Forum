<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: It is not possible.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer</strong>: It is possible through some hacks.</p>

<p>Actually there are 2 possibilities that pop into my mind that would accomplish this (they are not tested, not sure if they work out finally tough):</p>

<ul>
<li>In your IIS you can define which filetype gets handled by which interpreter. You can try to define .css files to use the same interpreter as ASP.NET pages. (not sure if this works)</li>
<li>You can create an .aspx file instead of a .css file where you output the css code you need dynamically. Set the MIME type of the return stream from this dynamic css aspx page to the MIME type of CSS. Then reference your aspx page as css file </li>
</ul>
