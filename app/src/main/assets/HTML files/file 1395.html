  <p>Can I ask which font covers the full
  Unicode range?</p>

<p>None. Citing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_typefaces" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Currently (August, 2008), no single
  "Unicode font" includes all the
  characters defined in the present
  revision of the ISO 10646 (Unicode)
  standard. In fact, it would be
  impossible to create such a font in
  any common font format, as Unicode
  includes over 100,000 characters,
  while no widely-used font format
  supports more than 65,535 glyphs. So
  while one could make a set of related
  fonts to cover all of Unicode, a
  single Unicode font is not possible at
  this time.</p>
