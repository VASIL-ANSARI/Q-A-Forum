<p>Zapier has an internal Action called "Formatter by Zapier" that will do this type of calculation for you.</p>

<p>Check out: <a href="https://zapier.com/help/formatter/#date-time" rel="nofollow">https://zapier.com/help/formatter/#date-time</a></p>

<p>It looks like <code>input.date-zap</code> is being fed from a prior Action or Trigger, so you can add the "Formatter by Zapier" to manipulate the date and then use the output of that Action as in input your "Code by Zapier" Javascript.</p>

<p>May not be the perfect Javascript solution, but should get you what you are looking for.</p>
