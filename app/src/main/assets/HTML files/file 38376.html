<p>So first of all, to enable Push notifications for your app, you're going to have to follow these steps:

<p>This tutorial gets you all set up with parse push notifications in your app, but that doesn't answer your question. To answer your question, you probably want a cloud code script that runs every day and creates a PFQuery based on your stored items that you have, and based on if a user has favorited an item create a PFPush instance for that User's installation. You can then create a directed push to that user. I have personally never used Cloud code for push (only client side), but this should work. Since Cloud Code is just javascript, you can create a scheduling type event in cloud code and run your push from there. </p>
