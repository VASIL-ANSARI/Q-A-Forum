<p>I found the problem finally.
when I start a download operation and close the application without cancelling the operation the BackgroundDownloader keeps the operation for the next application start.
when the number of download operations reach the maximum allowed simultaneous operations(I think 5) the next operations will be on the waiting list() till the previous operations finish.
so I had to stop all the uncompleted operations when the application starts like this:</p>

<pre><code>Task.Run(async () =&gt;
        {
            var downloads = await BackgroundDownloader.GetCurrentDownloadsAsync();
            foreach (var download in downloads)
            {
                CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
                download.AttachAsync().AsTask(cts.Token);
                cts.Cancel();
            }
            var localFolder = ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;
            var files = await localFolder.GetFilesAsync();
            files = files.Where(x =&gt; x.Name.EndsWith("_")).ToList();
            foreach (StorageFile file in files)
            {
                await file.DeleteAsync(StorageDeleteOption.PermanentDelete);
            }
        });
</code></pre>
