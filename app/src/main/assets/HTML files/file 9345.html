<p>Well, the error sis telling you that there's no "nivoSlider" method on a certain object.</p>

<p>Looking into your code, the object it's trying to call that method on is: $('.nivoSlider')</p>

<p>Is it possible that when you load your subpage that the item that has the nivoSlider class either doesn't exist - or is something that you didn't expect?</p>

<p>Or (FTW) that there is more than one of them... and thus it's returning an array (instead of a  single object)  and thus needs to be run using "each"</p>
