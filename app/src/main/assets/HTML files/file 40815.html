<p>What you basically need is to take a look at <a href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex37.html" rel="nofollow">HashMaps</a> which are ADT's specifically for this purpose. Their structure is as follows:<br>
    -key1 : value1<br>
    -key2 : value2<br>
    .....<br>
    -keyn : valuen<br>
your key here should be your score (but it can be anything). The value will be the name associated to the score.<br>
Then , you can create a method sortKeys, depending on your implementation, which would take each key in the HashMap, move it at the end or at the beginning, while pointing to your name. <br>
But please note that some HashMaps are randomly stored, so you will have to possibly make an array to write the sorted order of keys (and then lookup the key's value in the HashMap).</p>
