<p>I suggest you always work with your domain types and not use String just because that's the way HTTP sends params. If a field has type double, you will use it as such in your code and also store it as such in the database. Let Spring convert the request params to your needed type.</p>

<p>Data binding is useful for allowing user input to be dynamically bound to the domain model of an application (or whatever objects you use to process user input). Spring provides the so-called <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/api/org/springframework/validation/DataBinder.html" rel="nofollow">DataBinder</a> class to do exactly that.</p>

<p>You can register those in the <code>initBinder</code> method of your controllers and will allow you to transform the Strings from your request into the desired type. See for example the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/CustomNumberEditor.html" rel="nofollow">CustomNumberEditor</a> class used to parse user-entered number strings into Number properties of beans. You can then combine this with the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.8/reference/validation.html" rel="nofollow">Validator interface</a> for more complex checks.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Spring binding uses <code>typeMismatch</code> error codes for binding errors when a conversion fails (<code>required</code> code if you specify a field as required but you donât supply it). In your case it defaults to showing the exception message. To change the message to a more friendly one, you must supply a bundle key in your property file using the <code>typeMismatch</code> prefix.</p>

<p>This is specified by the <code>DataBinder.setMessageCodesResolver</code> and defaults to <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/api/org/springframework/validation/DefaultMessageCodesResolver.html" rel="nofollow">org.springframework.validation.DefaultMessageCodesResolver</a>. In the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/api/org/springframework/validation/DefaultMessageCodesResolver.html" rel="nofollow">javadoc</a> of <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/api/org/springframework/validation/DefaultMessageCodesResolver.html" rel="nofollow">DefaultMessageCodesResolver</a> you can see complete examples, but basically, you just have to add an entry like this in your properties file:</p>

<pre><code>typeMismatch.yourField=Your user friendly error message goes here
</code></pre>
