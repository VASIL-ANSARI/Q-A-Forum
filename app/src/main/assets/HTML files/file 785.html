<p>Nope, unless you have direct answer to hardware. There is a chance that variable will be cached somewhere. Sensitive data can even be stored in swap :) If you're concerning only about RAM, you can play with garbage collector. In high level langs usually you don't have a direct access to memory, so it's not possible to control this aspect. For example in .NET there is a class SecureString which uses interop and direct memory access.</p>
