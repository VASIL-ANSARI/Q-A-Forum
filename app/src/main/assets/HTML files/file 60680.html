<p>The problem doesn't come up when serializing but rather when unserializing.
You see, your Event uses the <code>SerializesModels</code> trait. This trait has the following method:</p>

<pre><code>protected function getRestoredPropertyValue($value)
{
    if (! $value instanceof ModelIdentifier) {
        return $value;
    }

    return is_array($value-&gt;id)
            ? $this-&gt;restoreCollection($value)
            : (new $value-&gt;class)-&gt;newQuery()-&gt;useWritePdo()-&gt;findOrFail($value-&gt;id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This trait serializes models as a <code>ModelIdentifier</code>, which just holds the class name and the id. When unserializing, the model is fetched fresh from the database using that information. In your delete case, the <code>findOrFail</code> makes it, well, fail.</p>

<p>I guess you can think of a solution that suits your needs now. This one, for instance, I guess should work for different models; if you know you just want this for Car models you can make a more straightforward one.</p>

<pre><code>protected function getRestoredPropertyValue($value)
{
    if ($this-&gt;type == 'delete' &amp;&amp; $value instanceof ModelIdentifier) {
        $model = (new $value-&gt;class);
        $pk = $model-&gt;getQueueableId();
        $model-&gt;$pk = $value-&gt;id;

        return $model;
    }


    return parent::getRestoredPropertyValue($value);
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Probably it's cleaner to have separate Events as you suggest. All constructors should receive a Car model, and for the delete case you create a simple object with the attributes you need. </p>

<pre><code>abstract class CarEvent extends Event implements ShouldBroadcast
{

    use SerializesModels;

    public $car;
    protected $type;

    public function __construct(Car $car)
    {
        $this-&gt;car = $car;
    }

    public function broadcastOn()
    {
        return ['car'];
    }

    public function broadcastAs()
    {
        return $this-&gt;type;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>class AddCarEvent extends CarEvent
{

    protected $type = 'add';

}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>class DeleteCarEvent extends CarEvent
{

    protected $type = 'delete';

    public function __construct(Car $car)
    {
        $this-&gt;car = (object) ['id' =&gt; $car-&gt;id];
    }
}
</code></pre>
