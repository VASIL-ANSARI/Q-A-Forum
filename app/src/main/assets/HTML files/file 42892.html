<p>the first element of the third line doesn't float until the left edge because of the height of the first element in the second line (the title âThe phantom of the Operaâ fills two lines of text) which is stopping the correct alignment of that element</p>

<p>to prevent this unintended behaviour when using floated elements, you should set a left clearing to each <code>5n + 1</code> element of the list</p>

<pre><code>#movies ul li:nth-child(5n + 1) {
   clear: left;
}
</code></pre>
