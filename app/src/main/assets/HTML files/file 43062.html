<p>The materializecss initialisation function for the dropdown component (<code>component.dropdown(...)</code> in your code) modifies the DOM.</p>

<p>You can observe this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>adding a significant delay in your <code>setTimout(...)</code> call (I added 30000, so 30sec)</li>
<li>run the jsfiddle</li>
<li>open your Chrome Dev Tools, locate the big (+) element, take a screenshot of the source code around it</li>
<li>after 30s you will see the DOM changing, you can take another screenshot and compare.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I saw is that your <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> is moved by materializecss at the bottom of the body (just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>) which means it is outside your <code>&lt;div id="container"&gt;</code> and outside of react's reach.</p>

<p>So basically react and materializecss don't play well with each other.</p>

<p>React does not watch the DOM, it works on a virtualDOM, computes diffs when something changes, and applies the minimum mutations necessary to the actual DOM. So react expects to be the only one doing mutations on the subtree that it manages (inside <code>&lt;div id="container"&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>As for a solution, you can look at this for example:
