<p>Here are the problems I can find:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't include sortBS.h from within UList.h. UList does not require sortBS to exist (it'd work fine without it), so it shouldn't be included as such. Plus since that file is being included before you define what UList actually is, you get errors saying sortBS doesn't know what UList is.</p></li>
<li><p>sortBS declares a variable named List then doesn't use it, and tries using a variable named "items" which does not exist. Rename one of those to match the other one.</p></li>
<li><p>The last part of sortBS can be simplified to this:</p>

<p>if (items[index] > items[index+1]) std::swap(items[index], items[index+1]);</p></li>
</ul>
