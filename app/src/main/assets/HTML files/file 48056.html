<p>If I understand you correctly, I think you want to create a ManyToOne relashionship between your two entities. Once it is created, you do not have to think about foreign keys, as they are managed by Doctrine. You can simply use your property like you would do with any other. For example : </p>

<pre><code>$user = new User();
$apartment = new Apartement();
$apartment-&gt;setAddress('12 xxx street');
$user-&gt;setApartement($apartment);
</code></pre>

<p>And you can access your user's appartment like this : </p>

<pre><code>// Displays '12 xxx street'
$user-&gt;getApartment()-&gt;getAddress();
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
