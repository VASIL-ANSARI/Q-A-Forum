<p>If you're talking about the if-else statements in <code>calculate()</code>, you can't replace it directly with a switch statement. The case values in a switch statement need to be compile-time constants (either integers or enum values). Besides, the if-else here perfectly expresses the logic of what you are trying to do.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> compute a "switch test value" based on the states of radio15, radio18, and radio20 (say, an integer from 0 to 8, based on the eight possible combinations of values) and switch on that, but I would strongly recommend against such an approach. Not only would it needlessly complicate and obscure the logic of what's going on, you would be cursing yourself if you needed to maintain the code six months from now after you had forgotten the clever trick.</p>
