<p>Generics is meant for type-safety at compile time and not for achieving polymorphism at run-time. So I don't think what you're asking is possible. </p>

<p>In your scenario, you should consider creating an interface. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface PropInf{
  String getProp();
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would then have to implement this interface in both your classes. Using a reference variable of this interface, you can then achieve polymorphism.</p>
