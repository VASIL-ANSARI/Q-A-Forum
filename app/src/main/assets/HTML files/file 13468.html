<p>I've also been looking for a C# Voronoi library but couldn't find anything other than this;</p>

<p>Used it in a small project last year, it works but you'll probably want to improve it ( maybe change same structures and output etc )</p>

<p>also if there is any other library you found, please let me know.</p>
