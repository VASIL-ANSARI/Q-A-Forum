<p>It turns out that sending a message with WM_VSCROLL, LVM_SCROLL (as well as calling SetScrollInfo()) do work for setting the scroll position of the ListView shown as a dropdown by a ComboBox; the issue is with the DropDown event, which gets raised before the ListView has actually been shown. I figured this out because GetScrollInfo() returns a min, max of 0 when called in the DropDown event. Setting a timer for a 1 second delay from when DropDown was fired and calling GetScrollInfo() after that delay returns a sensible min, max; setting the scroll position after that delay also works.</p>

<p>I am obviously not fond of the delay, but I don't think there is an event available for when the ListView has been shown? Is it possible to create some event?</p>
