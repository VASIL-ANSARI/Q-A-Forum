<p>This is what you want to do:</p>

<pre><code>select * from (
    select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
    where table_name = 'T1'
) dt
</code></pre>

<p>You cannot use <code>SHOW COLUMNS</code> in a subquery, but by using the <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS</code> table, you have much more information available, not only the column name, for instance.</p>
