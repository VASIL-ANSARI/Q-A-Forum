<p>It's a synchronize call during the block, you can treat the block as a function that compares two objects. With this compare function, system can sort the array. Explain by code:</p>

<p><code>function : ^NSComparisonResult(id a, id b)</code> - provided by you in the block code.</p>

<p>NSArray sortedArrayUsingComparator do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get two objects from the array.</li>
<li>Compare this two objects by the compare function in the block. (get result of NSOrderedAscending, NSOrderedSame,NSOrderedDescending )</li>
<li>Put the object to new array according the the compare result.</li>
<li>Continue one if there are still object left in origin array.</li>
<li>return the new array after all objects sorted.</li>
</ol>

<p>(The operation for 1,4 may be different based on the sort algorithm but the basic ideas is the same.)</p>
