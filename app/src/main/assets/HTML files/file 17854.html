<p>You'll want to look into the .load function which you supply a source URL to. All you need to do is figure out a way to save your source as a variable and patch it into the load function. If you were to click on thumbnails then: 
Then whenever .pdf is clicked, first save the src: var src=$(this).parent('a').attr('src');
Then you can use .load and target the iframe using the src variable. It should become pretty clear when looking at the API docs for .load. A couple things to mention about loading offs into iframes: 
Iframes are meant for external html documents, whereas the object tag is used for external files such as flash, PDF, video, etc. You might want to look into the object tag.</p>

<p>Iframes are extremely difficult to setup any error handling so if your PDF doesn't load, displaying an error can be extremely difficult. There are some workarounds but none I've seen that are good, they mostly rely on setting a timer to see if the iframe has loaded, and some sites/pdfs might take a long time to load resulting in a false error.</p>

<p>Pdfs are tricky to work with as the browser requires a plugin. What about users that don't have a PDF reader installed, again there's no way to error check in this case.</p>
