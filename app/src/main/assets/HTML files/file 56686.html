  <p>Is <strong>del</strong> really a destructor?</p>

<p>No, <code>__del__</code> method is not a destructor, is just a normal method you can call whenever you want to perform any operation, but it is always called before the garbage collector destroys the object.
Think of it like a clean or last will method.</p>
