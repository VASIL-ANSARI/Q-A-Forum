<p>SQLite is designed as an embedded database, i.e., to be used together with a 'real' programming language.
To be able to use such dynamic constructs, you must go outside of SQLite itself:</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    sql = "SELECT ... FROM {} WHERE ...".format(row[0])
    cursor.execute(sql)
</code></pre>
