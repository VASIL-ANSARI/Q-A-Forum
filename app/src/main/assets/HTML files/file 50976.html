<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSUserDefaults_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSUserDefaults/synchronize" rel="nofollow">NSSynchronize</a> is not guaranteed to succeed and returns a BOOL. 
Note that syncrhonize simply writes the data to disk but NSUserDefaults keeps the data in memory as well. Calling it after every write is probably not needed, though I've done it myself and many examples on the net do that.</p>

<p>From the Apple documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>use this method only if you cannot wait for the automatic synchronization (for example, if your application is about to exit) or if you want to update the user defaults to what is on disk even though you have not made any changes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disclaimer: speculation<br/>
It's possible that the act of failed synchronize is causing objectForKey to fail. The class knows the data it has may be wrong and so returns nil instead. This is more likely if you are calling synchronize successively and excessively or otherwise doing IO intensive operations.</p>
