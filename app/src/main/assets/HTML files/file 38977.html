<p>This problem:</p>

<pre><code>Name   Sala  Ag
Steve  1000  30
John   2000  25
</code></pre>

<p>Can be solved like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Name,
       CAST(Salary) AS VARCHAR(6) AS Salary,
       CAST(Age) AS VARCHAR(3) AS Age
FROM Employee;
</code></pre>

<p>Note, once again... this is not what the query is returning, but how the client is displaying the results.  Use a different client it would work differently.  In this case the client is formatting the columns based on the column data type.  When it sees a varchar (like name) it goes to the max data size.  So we give it a bigger string data it will look ok.</p>

<p>This is NOT part of what is happening on the Server -- this goes to how the client displays.  So if the query is going to be used by a different client (eg web page or application call) this won't matter when it is actually used by those clients.</p>
