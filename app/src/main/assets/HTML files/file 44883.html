<p>Forgive me for not just commenting, but I don't have the rep for that yet...</p>

<p>As someone who runs their own forum, I would say, "please don't."  No one likes bots, and while they're useful for things like analytics and crawling, posting on forums is just annoying, unhelpful, and usually an instant ban.</p>

<p>As a JavaScript dev, I would ask how you're trying to do this?  Is it just code that you put into your console?</p>

<p>Console code, and JavaScript in particular, is scoped to the page you're on.  If the page redirects, everything that was running is no longer running.  Even if you're putting this into something like a Chrome Extension, every time the extension is activated it's going to run the code for that page and then automatically stop as soon as you navigate anywhere, and give you a blank slate for the freshly loaded page.</p>
