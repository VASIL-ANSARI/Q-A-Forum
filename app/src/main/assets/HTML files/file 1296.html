<p>Feel free to subclass <code>BigDecimal</code> and add that method. Beyond that, what do you expect? You know where to find the API and confirm that the class you would like to have that method doesn't. Personally, I'd say the functionality is so trivial that there wouldn't be much of a point in having it in the standard API.</p>
