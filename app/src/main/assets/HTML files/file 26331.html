<p>There is no way to elevate your privileges once you start the process. However, you can require for higher privileges when starting a new process. As you're on Windows, just use <code>ShellExecuteEx</code> and set <code>runas</code> in <code>lpVerb</code> field of <code>SHELLEXECUTEINFO</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    SHELLEXECUTEINFO shExInfo = {0};
    shExInfo.cbSize = sizeof(shExInfo);
    shExInfo.fMask = SEE_MASK_NOCLOSEPROCESS;
    shExInfo.hwnd = 0;
    shExInfo.lpVerb = _T("runas");                 // Operation to perform
    shExInfo.lpFile = _T("regsvr32.exe");          // Application to start    
    shExInfo.lpParameters = _T("npmyplugin.dll");  // Additional parameters
    shExInfo.lpDirectory = 0;
    shExInfo.nShow = SW_SHOW;
    shExInfo.hInstApp = 0;  

    ShellExecuteEx(&amp;shExInfo);
    return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>To use this in a Qt application, just <code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;</code> and make sure include and lib variables are set properly for the Windows SDK.</p>
