<p>Document-based apps don't have a "main" window -- by definition, a document-based app is based on a UI involving one window for each document. If, when creating a new app project in Xcode, you want an app whose UI centers on a single window (like iTunes or System Preferences), uncheck "Create Document-Based Application" after choosing the Application template.</p>

<p>If you want to create an app that uses the document-based workflow but also has non-document-specific windows, you can create separate nibs for those windows and implement logic to show and control them someplace outside of your document class. (For example, you could create an <code>NSWindowController</code> subclass for a preferences window, with accompanying nib for that window's user interface, and instantiate/show that window from a menu command implemented in your application delegate.)</p>
