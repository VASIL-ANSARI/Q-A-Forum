<p>Have you tried this in your .htaccess?</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(.+)\.html$ $1.php
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: doing this would mean you'd need to convert your .html files to .php files
Which you can do with a PHP file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    $files = scandir(getcwd());
    foreach($files as $file) {
        if(pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) == 'html'){
            rename($file, pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_FILENAME) .'php');
        }
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>
