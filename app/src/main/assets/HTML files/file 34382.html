<p>Really strange. I wasn't notified of this problem before, but the application no longer was able to determine the HABTM relationship between Wines and Recipes. I updated my models to include the <code>join_table</code> argument and I no longer get the 'undefined constant' errors. I only found this out because I loaded the app in the browser and got a better error message to deal with. Still getting problems with 'duplicate entry' issues.</p>

<p>Also, I removed the destroy_all calls on each model as I think it's unnecessary considering DatabaseCleaner runs after each task.</p>
