<p>No, it doesn't. Each class knows only it's own class hierarchy. However it also knows when it goes to make a method call, create an object, etc the expected signature of that method, type of that object, etc.</p>

<p>If nothing is available matching that expectation then you will get the class not found error (or other similar errors depending on exactly what the miss-match is).</p>
