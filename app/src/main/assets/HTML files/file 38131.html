<p>Setting up a Global Library ensures that the library is defined, however it is <em>not</em> automatically added as a dependency to new projects.</p>

<p>You must go into <code>Project Structure</code> -> <code>Modules</code>, click the <code>Dependencies</code> tab and press the green <code>+</code> to add it to your project.</p>

<p>Or, instead, (and if IntelliJ is smart enough) after hitting <code>F2</code> to navigate to one of the compile errors in your source code, <code>Alt-enter</code> might allow a quick fix to add the dependency (you'd have to try it...).</p>
