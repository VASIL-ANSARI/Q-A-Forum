<p>After twisting my head for about 24 hours, I was able to derive the right query from a similar post (however lot less complicated query) here at Stack Overflow:</p>

<pre><code>select @index := @index + 1 as `Index`, `Date`
from
(
  select date_format(calendar.dy, '%Y-%m-%d') as `Date`
  from
  (
    select date_add(date('2015-10-01'), interval (a2.digit * 100) + (a1.digit * 10) + a0.digit day) as dy
    from digits a2
    cross join digits a1
    cross join digits a0
    where date_add('2015-10-01', interval (a2.digit * 100) + (a1.digit * 10) + a0.digit day) &lt;= date('2015-12-31')
    order by date_add('2015-10-01', interval (a2.digit * 100) + (a1.digit * 10) + a0.digit day)
  ) calendar
  inner join
  (
    SELECT `ID`, `from`, `to` FROM `tbl_cards`
    UNION
    SELECT `ID`, `from`, `to` FROM `tbl_shoppingcart`
  ) t
  on calendar.dy between t.`from` and t.`to`
  group by calendar.dy
  having count(calendar.dy) = 3
) dts
cross join ( select @index := -1 ) params
;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously I didn't know enough about derived tables and subqueries, otherwise this would have been an easy customization. Seems like I've learned something new today as well :)</p>
