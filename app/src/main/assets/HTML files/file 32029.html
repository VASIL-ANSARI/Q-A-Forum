<p>You can use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/load/" rel="nofollow">jQuery with <code>load()</code></a> to achieve something like that <strong>after</strong> asking for permission from the admins of the site where you're stealing from.</p>

<p>"Stealing" might sound a bit harsh for you but that's how the admins of the other site will see it. If they notice what you're doing, your server will be added to their firewall under the <code>BLOCKED</code> section.</p>

<p>Note that if the other site is running on a different domain, trying to do this JavaScript will fail because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy" rel="nofollow">Same-origin Policy</a>. In that case, you'll have to add code to your own server which gets the data from the other site and offer it in a useful form to your own JavaScript running in the client (like using jQuery's <code>load()</code> function).</p>

<p>If your server is written in JavaScript, <a href="http://hc.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Apache HttpComponents</a> is your friend.</p>
