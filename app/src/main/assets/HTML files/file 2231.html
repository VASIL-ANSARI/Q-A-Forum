<p>you might just want to try putting the actual dot com in your /etc/hosts file.</p>

<p>ie:</p>

<pre>
127.0.0.1 sub1.myapp.com
127.0.0.1 myapp.com
127.0.0.1 anyothersubdomains.myapp.com
</pre>

<p>what this usually does is trick your computer into thinking it is the host of all of those, so you can't go to the real site anymore in a web browser.</p>

<p>if you do want it to be .local, presumably so that you can refer to the real online site while working on a local copy, you should probably take a look in app/controllers/application_controller.rb (sometimes application.rb) and look for logic in there that helps determine what to do depending on the subdomain.  maybe its hard coded to only look for a .com or something.</p>
