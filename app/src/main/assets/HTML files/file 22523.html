<p>Something like this?</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; files.length; i++) {
   alert(files[i][0].name);
   if (files[i][0].name == 'file.jpg') {
      files.splice(i, 1) //remove the item
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is, there is always one file in each FileList due to the way you select it. So for each filelist you are only interested in the first file in it. For each file you can just get the properties as defined here: <a href="http://help.dottoro.com/ljbnqsqf.php" rel="nofollow">http://help.dottoro.com/ljbnqsqf.php</a></p>
