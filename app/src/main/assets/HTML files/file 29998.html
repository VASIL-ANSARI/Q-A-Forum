<p>You could set a script to run a check grab every client, then check each client through the events to see if they have an even, if so is it 45-30 days before that event? If so shoot out an email to them. Loop through the clients until finished.</p>

<p>Set this cron job up to run whenever you want, I don't suggest too frequently tho. You can set this cron job up via your cPanel or other panel depending on your host.</p>
