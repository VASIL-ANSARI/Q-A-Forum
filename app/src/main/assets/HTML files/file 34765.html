<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To configure keyboard shortcuts and mouse shortcuts </p>

  Select one of the pre-configured Keymaps,
  which you want to use as the base for the new one, and click Copy. Accept the default name, or change it as required.</p>
  
  <p>In the content pane
  of actions, select the desired action.</p>
  
  <p>Configure keyboard shortcuts.
  To do that, follow these steps:</p>
  
  <p>Click  properties on the toolbar, or
  right-click the selected action, and choose Add Keyboard Shortcut.
  Enter Keyboard Shortcut dialog box opens.</p>
  
  <p>Press the keys to be used as
  shortcuts. The keystrokes are immediately reflected in the First
  Stroke field. Optionally, select the check box next to Second Stroke
  and press keys to be used as alternative keyboard shortcuts.</p>
  
  <p>As you
  press the keys, the Preview field displays the suggested combination
  of keystrokes, and the Conflicts field displays warnings, if some of
  the keystrokes are already assigned to the other actions.</p>
  
  <p>Click OK
  with the mouse pointer to create a shortcut and bind it with an
  action.</p>
