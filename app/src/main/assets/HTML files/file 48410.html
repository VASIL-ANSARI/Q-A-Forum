<p>Finally I resolved the mentioned issue myself, I posting here the solution for those who got this issue
we need to open jquery.dataTables.columnFilter.js and find the following function:
roughly line number is 565
 function fnCreateCheckbox(oTable, aData)
in the very end of this function 
you will find 
oTable.fnFilter(search, index, true, false);</p>

<p>you need just replace the parameter 'index' with this.value
your problem will be resolve..</p>

<p>after this the reset button won't work, so don't worry about this just go to roughtly line number 590</p>

<p>you will find Jquery UI dialog plugin which have same method which you changed above 
 oTable.fnFilter('', index, true, false);
you need just replace the parameter 'index' with this.value</p>
