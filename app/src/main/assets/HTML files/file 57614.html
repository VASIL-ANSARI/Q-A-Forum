<p>I found something in projects.rb:</p>

<pre><code>  def project_condition(with_subprojects)
    cond = "#{Project.table_name}.id = #{id}"
    cond = "(#{cond} OR (#{Project.table_name}.lft &gt; #{lft} AND #{Project.table_name}.rgt &lt; #{rgt}))" if with_subprojects
    cond
  end
</code></pre>

<p>I think even though Redmine Knownledgebase tutorial is a good introduction, it's really full of bas examples if you want to make your own plugin.</p>
