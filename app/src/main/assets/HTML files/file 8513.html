<p>In Xcode 4, your entitlements file should not contain the application identifier.  Only on your Target -> Summary tab.  Also, get-task-allow should be set to False for AppStore submission.</p>

<p>To fix, I would delete your current entitlements.plist file and create a new one using File -> New -> New File.  Just use the key get-task-allow = FALSE and try that.  Make sure you put your application identifier on the Target -> Summary tab.</p>
