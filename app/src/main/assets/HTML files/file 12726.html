<p>I think you can do combinations, but in your case, I think it would be simpler to get the 3rd td of each tr and get the title inside. And again, try not relying on the style, it is not very semantic.</p>

<p>You need to learn xpath, and you can learn it at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xpath_intro.asp" rel="nofollow">w3schools</a>, for instance. Also, if you use firebug, you can right click on any element in the html tab and get its xpath. Here is what I get for the first title : <code>//*[@id="td_threadtitle_3499047"]</code>... not very good.</p>

<p>For the thread table, I get this: <code>//*[@id="threadslist"]</code>... this is better, there is no number.</p>

<p>Now let's get every 3rd td in it: <code>//*[@id="threadslist"]//td[3]</code></p>

<p>And now the second link, which must correspond to the title : <code>//*[@id="threadslist"]//td[3]/div/a[2]</code> . Get it? Maybe I'm wrong, but I  hope you got the idea...</p>

<p>Relying on the position is not very semantic either, but you don't seem to have very much choice in that matter...</p>
