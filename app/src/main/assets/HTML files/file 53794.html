<p>I had the same issue and updated the <strong>Android Support Repository</strong>, <strong>Android Support Library(22.2.1)</strong> and <strong>Android SDK Tool(24.1.2)</strong> using SDK manager now its working fine. Once update finish rebuild the project. </p>

<p>Then add the dependency in your Gradle file
dependency</p>

<pre><code>compile 'com.android.support:design:22.2.1
</code></pre>
