<p>The <code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code> method is not called for the initial render. What could do, if you only intend to use the data from props as the initial data, is something like:</p>

<pre><code>getInitialState () {
  return {
    contacts: this.props.data.contacts
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/props-in-getInitialState-as-anti-pattern.html" rel="nofollow">React docs</a> they suggest you name the props initialContacts, just to make it really clear that the props' only purpose is to initialize something internally.</p>

<p>Now if you want it to update when <code>this.props.contacts</code> change, you could use <code>componentWillReceiveProps()</code> like you did. But I'm not sure it's the best idea. From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using props to generate state in getInitialState often leads to
  duplication of "source of truth", i.e. where the real data is. This is
  because getInitialState is only invoked when the component is first
  created.</p>
  
  <p>Whenever possible, compute values on-the-fly to ensure that they don't
  get out of sync later on and cause maintenance trouble.</p>
