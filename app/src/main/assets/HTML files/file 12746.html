<p>It's <code>std::function&lt;bool(int)&gt;</code>. Or possibly just <code>bool(*)(int)</code> if you prefer, since the lambda doesn't capture.</p>

<p>(The raw function pointer might be a bit more efficient, since <code>std::function</code> does (at least in some cases) require dynamic allocation for some type erasure magic.)</p>
