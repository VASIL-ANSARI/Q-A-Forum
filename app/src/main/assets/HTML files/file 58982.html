<p>No, VoIP apple push is nothing to do with SIP or SIP invite.</p>

<p>In reality when end-user device gets push, device needs just to register to remote server and after this to receive a call. Below you can find full steps:</p>

<p>1) A calling B via SIP. SIP Invite from A received by PBX/sip proxy or server. </p>

<p>2) PBX suspend this transaction/call and runs some custom script to send APNS push </p>

<p>3) Push is received by B device. </p>

<p>4) B device registers to PBX via SIP. </p>

<p>5) PBX see that now B device is available and it sends call to B via SIP protocol.</p>
