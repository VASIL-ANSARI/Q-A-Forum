<p>EDITED.. Sad to say but there isn't really better solution than this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    window.onbeforeunload = function(event)
    {
        event = event || window.event;

        // For IE and Firefox (older versions)
        if (event) {
            event.returnValue = 'Are you sure you want to do this?';
        }

        // For Safari
        return 'Are you sure you want to do this?';
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>--- Just wanted to add the following:</p>

<p>Hey, I've been playing around with the code i posted above.. i wasn't able to notice that it was actually still refreshing.. the only possible solution is to raise the popup dialog, which confirms from the user if they really want to leave/refresh the page.</p>

<p>I'm updating my code to reflect what i just said.</p>
