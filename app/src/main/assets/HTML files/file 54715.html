<p>For custom sources, com.google.android.exoplayer.upstream.DataSource interface has to be implemented.</p>

<p>In the callback you mentioned, store the data and in the read function of new datasource, provide the stored data.</p>

<p>For supporting RTP in exoplayer for a previous project, I did the same and it worked perfectly. </p>
