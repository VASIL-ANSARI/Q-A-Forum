<p>One technique is to summarize the tables, then JOIN on those tables.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(m.nameFirst, " ",m.nameLast) AS Name
    , b.G AS G, b.AB AS AB
    , p.W as WINS
FROM Master m
LEFT JOIN 
  (SELECT playerID, SUM(g) AS G, SUM(ab) AS AB
   FROM Batting
   GROUP BY playerID) AS b
    ON m.playerID = b.playerID
LEFT JOIN 
   (SELECT playerID, sum(W) AS WINS
    FROM Pitching
    GROUP BY playerID) AS p 
  ON m.playerID = p.playerID
WHERE birthMonth = 6 and birthDay = 15
</code></pre>

<p>You could always move the subqueries into the SELECT structure</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(m.nameFirst, " ",m.nameLast) AS Name
    , (SELECT SUM(g)
       FROM Batting AS b
       WHERE m.playerID = b.playerID) AS G
    , (SELECT SUM(ab)
       FROM Batting
       WHERE m.playerID = b.playerID) AS AB
    , (SELECT sum(W)
       FROM Pitching AS p
       WHERE m.playerID = p.playerID) AS WINS
FROM Master m
WHERE birthMonth = 6 and birthDay = 15
</code></pre>
