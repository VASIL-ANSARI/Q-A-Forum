<p>First, make the 2 variables instance variables rather than static variables.</p>

<p>Second, synchronize the methods of the singleton:</p>

<pre><code>public synchronized void add(LinkedHashMap lhm){
    //steps
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would avoid lazy instanciation of the singleton. Most of the time, there's no added value:</p>

<pre><code>private static final Sample INSTANCE = new Sample();

public static Sample getInstance() {
    return INSTANCE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you really want to keep is lazily initialized, then the <code>getInstance()</code> method should also be synchronized, alse two threads might get two different instances of your singleton.</p>
