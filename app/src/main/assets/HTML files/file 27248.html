<p>To get the total number of numbers (assuming only the first element in each row is a letter you want to skip) you can just use</p>

<pre><code>total_numbers = sum(map(len, partition2d)) - len(partition2d)
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. summing the length of all rows and subtracting the number of rows.</p>

<p>Then you can get the result you're looking for with</p>

<pre><code>result = [guest * (len(row) - 1.0) / total_numbers
          for guest, row in zip(guest_list, partition2d)]
</code></pre>

<p><code>zip</code> is used to get pairs with one element (<code>guest</code>) from <code>guest_list</code> and one <code>row</code> from <code>partition2d</code>. Then the result is computed.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>1.0</code> is there (instead of a simple <code>1</code>) to ensure that division is done in floating point because having <code>guest_list</code> containing integers would give surprising results in Python 2.x (this has been fixed in Python 3.x, but in Python 2.x <code>3/4</code> by default gives <code>0</code> as result).</p>
