<p>You can't directly call a shell script using ajax/javascript. User some server such as <code>appache</code> and a server side scripting language like PHP in case of <code>appache</code>(I recommend installing <code>wamp/xamp/lamp</code>). You can call your shell script using php code using shell_exec() or can use directly use php file writing function to read and write the file. This PHP file can be easily called via AJAX with suitable parameters. </p>

<p>I have done a similar project for my college where I turned on and off a led using arduino and gprs module to send command through internet to a web server.</p>

<p>If you are interesting in executing shell commands from js you need to be very platform specific. In Windows Scripting, you do things like:</p>

<pre><code>var shell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell");
shell.Run("command here");
</code></pre>
