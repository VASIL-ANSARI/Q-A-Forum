<p>You can (and of course <em>always should</em>, hat tip @DaveRandom) do a <code>htmlspecialchars()</code> after <code>strip_tags</code> in order to prevent some clever construction from getting past the tag stripper. I have never seen a working exploit doing that successfully but it can't hurt taking additional precautions.</p>

<p>If you do all that, this looks safe.</p>

<p>Note that there is a limit on the maximum size of a GET request - 1kb is a safe maximum amount.</p>
