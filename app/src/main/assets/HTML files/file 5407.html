<p>I had faced the same problem in the past. I had it solved, using your ontology, with a static method in the activity table the call was something like:</p>

<pre><code>Activity::addNew($favouriteID, Activity::FAVOURITE);
</code></pre>

<p>and yes it looks un-natural.
You are talking about Aspect Orientation here, I'm afraid...</p>

<p>Another way to do it (but did not choose it for other reasons), would be by adding a trigger to the database, which would populate
activity, each time a favourite was added. I did not want to go there because it is overstated in the literature that triggers soon
get out of control. This depends on how much application logic you want to have on database level...</p>
