<p>This is how I do this:</p>

<p>I have an action creator that sends a post request to my API to create a new post. My API saves the new post in MongoDB, which generates an ID. You could also send a unique slug if you want prettier URLs. The API returns the ID of the created post in its response with a 200 status. The ID of the post is then used to redirect to a different component like so:</p>

<pre><code>browserHistory.push(`/posts/${response.data.postId}`);
</code></pre>

<p>The component at /posts/:postId uses another action to send a get request to my API for the post ID from the params in the URL used to access the component. For example:</p>

<pre><code>getPost(this.props.params.postId);
</code></pre>

<p>I use Axios to send my requests and I believe the official recommendation from React is to place actions for AJAX requests in the componentDidMount lifecycle method. Hopefully this clears things up.</p>
