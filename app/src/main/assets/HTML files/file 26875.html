<p>I tried with nearest neighbor (the default) <code>image.resize((800, 533))</code> and anti-aliasing <code>image.resize((800, 533), Image.ANTIALIAS)</code>. However the resulting file size was 751KB and 747KB, including the icc profile, which is far less than the original picture.</p>

<p>However it is possible that a JPEG becomes larger in file size after it was modified and saved again, when you saved the JPEG with a higher quality (less compression) as when it was initially saved. Or when formerly saving and compressing it added artifacts, that make further compression less efficient.</p>
