<h2>First Question:</h2>

<p>As you said the regex is a little tricky ...</p>

<pre><code>        string[] tableNames = new string[] { "table1", "table2" };
        List&lt;string&gt; fields = new List&lt;string&gt;();
        Regex rgx = new Regex(@"\w+(?=\s?,?)");
        MatchCollection matches = rgx.Matches(textBox1.Text);
        foreach (Match m in matches)
        {
            if (!tableNames.Contains(m.Value))
            {
                fields.Add(m.Value);
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>If U can convince your users that separate fields with <code>,</code> this works fine ;)</p>

<p>If my pattern does not match with your name styles you can make your own patterns and here is some instructions:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Second Question:</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>The way that users enter their own query is not good, because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For this kind of queries you have to inform users about table and field names. this means you let your guard down and accept some security risks.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not user friendly. Filling a text box with bunch of names and some hard rules is not simple for users. Note that for being a good developer you have to imagine all users are lazy and idiot.</p></li>
<li><p>You can not prevent users's access. If user can make their own query so they can simply make all queries for all of your records and tables. In that case maybe some information have to stay in shadows and you can't guaranty.</p></li>
<li><p>You can not convince users to fallow rules in making new queries and it will cause errors for you and users.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You can simply make your own interface.</p>

<ul>
<li>A new interface is a new experience for users so they will loved that.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
