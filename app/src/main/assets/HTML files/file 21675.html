<p>I can confirm that this is a Google Maps issue and has nothing to do with the code I am using for CarouFredSel...I have tried several Google Map plugins for WordPress and the crazy scrolling happens regardless of the plugin.</p>

<p>So, here's what I did...instead of using the Google Maps plugin called: "MapPress", I am using the MapQuest plugin called: "MapQuest Map Builder for WordPress"</p>

<p>Now, on any post or page with a map the CarouFredSel code works without glitch or error :-)</p>

<p>Yay!</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
Josh</p>
