<p>I think the direction you are going is great.  The interface would have the methods setData/getData.  Your implementation would implement those methods and for convenience you could implement __set / __get to call the interface methods.</p>

<p>IF another programmer wanted to extend the functionality or add a plugin to your system he would need to make sure his classes implemented your setData/getData method. </p>
