<p>For Problem 1, the test is sliced out because it is always true since <code>option</code> is set to 1 in the main function. If you want to keep the test, you have to make <code>option</code> an entry (either external global variable or a parameter of <code>main</code> for instance), but then, there will be nothing to slice in the <code>math</code> function... The slicing tries to keep only what is strictly necessary, and the test is not in your case.</p>
