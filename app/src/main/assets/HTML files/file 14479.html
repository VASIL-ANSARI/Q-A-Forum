<p>I would use a combination of criteria and update all.  For instance:</p>

<pre><code>Foo.where(country: nil).update_all(country: "USA")
</code></pre>

<p>If you're trying to do it via a Rails update, then @apneadiving is correct in that you need to enable <code>accept_nested_attributes_for</code> in the parent model.</p>
