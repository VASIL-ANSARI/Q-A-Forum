<p>You call the method on the same line where you think you bind it. Instead of passing the method, you pass the return value of the method called.</p>

<p>In this line, the second parameter is a method:</p>

<pre><code>bindMethod(new, self.newFile)
</code></pre>

<p>In this line, the method is called and second parameter is whatever is returned, e.g. None:</p>

<pre><code>bindMethod(save, self.saveFile(self, self.f1)) 
</code></pre>

<p>When you bind methods, the parameters and not used, so you bind to the method name and do not call it at that place. The wxPython should call the bound method with correct parameters when event is fired.</p>

<p>That also probably means that you cannot use parameters that you have, as callback for <code>wx.EVT_MENU</code> is given. You would need to create some kind of file dialog to get those parameters in the <code>saveFile</code> method.</p>
