<p>You need to declare the function in the derived class:</p>

<pre><code>class MyList : public List
{
public:
    int search(const string searchCharacters, bool caseSensitive);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the declaration and defination are not the same thing in C++. In this case, you can't define the member function in cpp file without declaration. If you don't declare (and define) it, then derived class will inherit it from the base class, including the defination.</p>

<p>And if you want it to be polymorphic you need to make it virtual in the base class, and it's better to make the destructor virtual at the same time if you'll use them by base class's pointer:</p>

<pre><code>class List
{
public:
    virtual int search(const string searchCharacters, bool caseSensitive){return 0;}
    virtual ~List() {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>As @SergeyA pointed, you can also make it a pure virtual function to make it be similar with java-style interface more. In this case you don't need to provide defination for it. (You still could provide one)</p>

<pre><code>class List
{
public:
    virtual int search(const string searchCharacters, bool caseSensitive) = 0;
    virtual ~List() {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>At last, C++ and Java are totally different. If you want to master C++, try to think in C++ style.</p>
