<p>I can't see a scenario in which this would happen however, when deleting it can be better to do it in reverse to avoid a changing array size giving misleading results that could be symptomatic of what you are seeing.</p>

<p>Try the below: -</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub PicturesDeleteAll()
Dim LngCounter As Long

For Each LngCounter = ActiveDocument.Shapes.Count to 0 Step -1
    ActiveDocument.Shapes(LngCounter).Delete
Next 
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub PicturesDeleteAll()
Do Until ActiveDocument.Shapes.Count = 0 
    ActiveDocument.Shapes(1).Delete
Loop 
End Sub
</code></pre>
