<p>RichEdit seems to be primarily developed at Microsoft as part of Office, with only versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.1 being included in Windows at various times.</p>

<p>Other, later versions of RichEdit can be found inside Microsoft Office installations: you would have to LoadLibrary() them explicitly from their location under "Program Files" if Office is installed. If Office isn't installed you are out of luck: these other versions are not present in bare Windows, and there's no redistribution licence to allow you to distribute them with any appropriate you write.</p>

<p>So, basically, you're out of luck. Sorry.</p>
