<p>I think the stream is throwing this exception, so your try is scoped to narrow to catch it.</p>

<p>Add a few more try catch combos around the different scopes until you catch it where its actually being thrown, but it appears to be happening either at our outside of your using, since the stream object is not created in the using's scope.</p>
