<p>I think you're overcomplicating things.</p>

<p>Specification pattern is cool if used in a very general method signature that takes specifications as parameters, or if you have a whole family of specifications. With just one or two particular conditions to test, it might be overkill.</p>

<p>Also, trying to inject a Repository into a domain object (as I guess you are) may be causing you more trouble than good. String length is most probably not a domain rule and uniqueness <a href="http://gorodinski.com/blog/2012/05/19/validation-in-domain-driven-design-ddd/" rel="nofollow">may not be either</a>. You might be better off checking those constraints at the Application Service (or Controller) level, directly calling the Repository there for uniqueness, which will spare you all the injection trouble.</p>
