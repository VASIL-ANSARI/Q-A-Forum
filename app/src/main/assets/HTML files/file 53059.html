<pre><code>$("#apaid1").keyup(function(){ 
    var textinput = $('#apaid1').val(); 
    var textinput1 = $('#epayment1').val(); 

    /* I'm assuming that the "#bl1" tag is the input where you want to store the product of "textinput" and "textinput1"? */
    $("#bl1").val(textinput1 - textinput);

    //if the value is less than zero (e.g: a negative number), send an alert to the user.
    if ($("#bl1").val() &lt; 0) {
        alert("Hey! Your answer resulted in a negative. Try again");
    };

});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not entirely sure why you set your condition as "if ($("#bl1").val() &lt; textinput1) ... " and why you tried to recalculate the value when you fulfill that condition. It seems rather strange to me. So if you have a reason for doing that, or if I misunderstood your question, do elaborate.</p>
