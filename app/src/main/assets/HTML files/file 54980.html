<p>For users to update from one version to another, the APK needs to be signed with the same keys and the package name of the application needs to remain the same.</p>

<p>If your debug builds are signed with a different key than your release builds, then you cannot provide an update to your users unless they uninstall the old version first.</p>

<p>If you uploaded the debug build to the Google Play Developer Console, then you are stuck using the debug key for future release unless you remove the old application from the Play Store and create a new one.</p>
