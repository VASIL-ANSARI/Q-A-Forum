<p>I did some research on the net and in my code and found out that were many memory leaks. I changed a few things to get rid of that error.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I made sure that my context was not being cached in any of my helper classes (basically my utility classes) </p></li>
<li><p>Also I was not using a holder class in my listview</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I added the following declaration in my Custom Adapter class</p>

<pre><code>  static class ViewHolder {
      TextView name;
      ImageView imageView;
  }

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    ViewHolder viewHolder = new ViewHolder();
    ....
    convertView.setTag(viewHolder);
}
</code></pre>
