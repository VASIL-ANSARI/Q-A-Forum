<p>I don't believe <code>:hover</code> can be applied directly to a pseudo-element. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#pseudo-elements" rel="nofollow">Selectors Level 3 specification states</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only one pseudo-element may appear per selector, and if present it must appear after the sequence of simple selectors that represents the subjects of the selector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I may be wrong, but I believe pseudo-classes (like <code>:hover</code>) are part of the <em>subjects of the selector</em>. This itself means that specifying a pseudo-class <em>after</em> a pseudo-element is invalid.</p>

<p>This in turn means that it isn't possible to apply <code>:hover</code> styling specifically on the pseudo-element, however as others have stated in the comments you can do this on the element they belong to instead.</p>

<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>*::before:hover {
  /* This markup is INVALID as pseudo-class selectors
   * cannot be placed after pseudo-element selectors.
   */
}

*:hover::before {
  /* This would apply styling to the pseudo-element
   * when the containing element is hovered over.
   */
}
</code></pre>
