<p>You have an error in your query... Your parameter is not quoted...</p>

<pre><code> $query = "SELECT *
     FROM ptb_forum, ptb_profiles
     WHERE ptb_forum.id = '$forum_id'";
</code></pre>

<p>However... I suggest that you refrain from using the <code>mysql_</code> family of functions. They are deprecated and due to be removed from PHP in a future release. You should be using parameterized queries using MySQLi or PDO.</p>

<p>Also, <code>global</code> is evil. I've never had a need to use it in 10 years of PHP programming. Neither should you.</p>
