<p>Follow the suggestions from Facebook for image sizes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use images that are at least 1200 x 630 pixels for the best display on
  high resolution devices. At the minimum, you should use images that
  are 600 x 315 pixels to display link page posts with larger images.</p>
  
  <p>You should use a 1.91:1 image ratio, such as 600 x 314 px.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...thatÂ´s all you can do, Facebook decides about how it will look like, depending on many factors - for example, how many users liked stuff on that domain (i guess).</p>
