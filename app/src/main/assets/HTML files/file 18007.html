<p>Right, so thanks to catflier who pointed me in the direction of render states, I fixed the problem:
* First, "RenderState" is an XNA3 term; XNA4 simply allows a few state flags directly on the GraphicsDevice object.
* The problem is that Nuclex is secretly setting the GraphicsDevice.DepthStencilState and leaving it instead of restoring it to its previous value after use (naughty!!).
* So the solution is, at the top of your Draw method, to add a line like so:</p>

<pre><code>GraphicsDevice.DepthStencilState = DepthStencilState.Default;
</code></pre>
