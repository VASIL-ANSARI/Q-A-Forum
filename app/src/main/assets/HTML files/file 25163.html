<p>You can not style elements from an iFrame as technically they don't exist on the page but exist on another server. You can however style if the iFrame comes from the same server - its a security issue.
3rd party nightmares I know but that's the way it is. You can only ask them to install your style on their server or ask them to change the styling of the content themselves to suit you.</p>
