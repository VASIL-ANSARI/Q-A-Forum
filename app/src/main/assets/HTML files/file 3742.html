<p>Looks like you found a bug in the RC. You should <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/content/content.aspx?ContentID=12362" rel="nofollow">report it here</a>, as soon as possible.</p>

<p>That said, I'm not sure you actually need to do what you're trying to do. Can you explain what your goal is? For a simple case of using the EF, you should not have to run EdmGen manually.</p>
