<p>You need an <code>and</code> between the conditions in the parentheses.</p>

<p>Boolean logic is tricky, and if often helps to go through with examples. Consider this line:</p>

<pre><code>FAILED blah blah Date: blah
</code></pre>

<p>So, going through your conditions one by one:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failed is in the line, so let's check the next condition.</li>
<li>"Result:" is not in the line, so that part is true.</li>
<li>We've got an OR, and we already have a True result, so there's no need to even check if "Date:" is in the line.</li>
<li>So both sides of the AND are true, so the whole thing is true.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, exactly the same would happen if the line contained "Result:" but not "Date:".</p>

<p>If you had AND inside the parens, it would need to check that <em>both</em> "Date" was not in the line and "Result" is not in the line, rather than being happy if <em>either</em> were not there.</p>

<p>A different way to express the condition which might be clearer is this:</p>

<pre><code>if "[FAILED]" in line and not (("Result:" in line) or ("Date:" in line)):
</code></pre>
