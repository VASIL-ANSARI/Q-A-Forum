<p>in Oracle databases it will if you reference the leading index columns. ie the columns declared first..</p>

<p>so in your case yes the index would be used.  and could be check be using an explain plan.</p>

<p>if MS SQLSERVER is different (and i suspect it might) you'll need a new answer.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Should also mention it will only <strong>consider</strong> the index for use.. that does not necessarily mean it WILL use it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong>
Oracle 11g now has an option that will allow it to skip columns in an index.</p>
