<p>The problem with your query is the field <em>UserInfo.Id</em>, in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189499.aspx" rel="nofollow">SELECT</a> clause.  Because it is not part of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177673.aspx" rel="nofollow">GROUP BY</a> SQL Server doesn't know what to do with it.</p>

<p>When using GROUP BY any field that does not appear in the grouping must be aggregated, using one of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/ms173454.aspx" rel="nofollow">aggregate functions</a>.</p>

<p>Consider this example table:</p>

<pre><code>Country Sales
UK      10.10
UK      20.10
USA     15.25
</code></pre>

<p>Grouping by country would return:</p>

<pre><code>Country
UK
USA
</code></pre>

<p>Adding sales to the SELECT causes a problem.  There are three sales values and only two rows.  SQL Server needs instruction on how to turn the three source rows into 2 output rows.  You could <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/ms187810.aspx" rel="nofollow">SUM</a> the sales.  That would return:</p>

<pre><code>Count   Sales
UK      30.20
USA     15.25
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could always add Sales to the group by.  That would return the original three rows.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, when using GROUP BY any field not included in the grouping must be wrapped in a aggregate function (SUM, MIN, MAX, etc).</p>
