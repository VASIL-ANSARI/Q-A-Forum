<p>The tabs plugin sets the tab panels to <code>display: none</code>, which means the Flash doesn't get started right away. You could try hacking it with CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.container.ui-helper-hidden {
    display: block !important;
    position: absolute;
    left: -99999px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will override the <code>display: none</code> and instead position the panel off the screen - this way the content is loaded and the panel is measured, but won't be visible to the user. (This is the same way the <code>.ui-helper-hidden-accessible</code> used to work)</p>
