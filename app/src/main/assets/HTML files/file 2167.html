<p>If the game has a single window, than as far as I can tell the distinction is purely a matter of taste.  If however, you have (or are planning to have, or cannot positively rule out the option of having in the future) multiple windows, then windows messaging can get tiresome.  </p>

<p>Problem is that by default keyboard/mouse messages are routed only to the window currently in focus, and typically in games you want to be able to switch focus (to a hi-score view, enemies on radar view or whatever) and still maintain interactivity. The easy solution would be for every module which requires keyboard/mouse input to query for it directly, and not rely on message forwarding - hence, DirectInput.</p>

<p>I can't say much about your specific scenario, of course - just my 2c.</p>
