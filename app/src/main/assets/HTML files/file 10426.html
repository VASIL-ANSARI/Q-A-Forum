<p>You can add the same project to multiple VS solutions. If you save the project in one solution and switch to another solution which references it, Visual Studio should prompt you that the project has been modified and would you like to reload it.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you don't want to include the project in multiple solutions (probably wise if number of solutions > ~2) then a rebuild will suffice. For example, if you have two solutions:</p>

<h3>Solution A</h3>

<ul>
<li>Contains the shared class library</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution B</h3>

<ul>
<li>References the shared class library in the same way you'd reference any other external assembly (like log4net)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then to propagate changes to the shared library from <strong>Solution A</strong> simply build <strong>Solution A</strong> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>). Now when you switch to <strong>Solution B</strong> the changes should get automatically picked up (IntelliSense knows about new properties etc.)</p>
