<p>Use a regex with the pattern</p>

<pre><code>.split("[^0-9][.,]|[.,][^0-9]|\\s+|(?![.,])\\p{Punct}")
</code></pre>

<p>That will split anything that doesn't have a number on both sides of a period or comma, or any other punctuation that isn't a period or comma. The 3rd section between pipes covers any spaces. That last part is based on a negative lookahead which is discussed in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8200935/90322">this answer</a> to prevent the already matched commas and periods that we kept safe from splitting numbers from being matched here.</p>
