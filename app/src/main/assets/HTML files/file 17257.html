<p>It sounds like you may be using jQuery 1.8.0.</p>

<p>jQuery 1.8.0 introduced a bug that caused the ready method to fire too early in IE9.</p>

<p>The bug was fixed in 1.8.1, and is still fixed in 1.8.2. Upgrading to either of those two versions should fix that problem if you are currently using 1.8.0.</p>

<p>The bug was mentioned in the release notes for 1.8.1 <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/30/jquery-1-8-1-released/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/30/jquery-1-8-1-released/</a></p>

<p>Here's the ticket: <a href="http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12282" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12282</a></p>
