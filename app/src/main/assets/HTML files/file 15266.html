<p>well, in c# you do actually use pointers, tho not explicitly. Think of delegates, anonymous types etc etc. the garbage collection in c# can also take a hit if you are not managing your use of these reference types efficiently.</p>

<p>in obj-c, the playing surface is a little more exposed. I'd imagine that approach has as many cons as it has pros for exactly the reasons you stated above re the danger of memory gpf's etc.</p>
