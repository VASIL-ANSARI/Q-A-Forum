<p>Because <code>TaskFactory.StartNew&lt;TResult&gt; Method (Func&lt;TResult&gt;)</code> must return a result and given that lambda expression is evaluated from the right to left to determine the result you will need state to  infer the result  type  as <code>Func&lt;object, TResult&gt;</code> must receive an object as first argument and return a result </p>
