<p>Your question is valid, although the goal is misconstrued. It is paramount to <em>correctly define variables</em>, but not because of mysterious performance.</p>

<p>It is to ensure correctness. Comparing unsigned integer with signed one is a ticking bomb, as well as (most usually) comparing <code>size_t</code> with integer.</p>

<p>For example, consider following snippet:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; vec.size(); ++i) { }
</code></pre>

<p>For all you know, this code can lead to undefined behavior! If the size of the vector is bigger than maximum size signed integer can hold (which is usually the case with 64bit systems) your integer will be overflowing, which is undefined. Compiler might just remove the loop altogether, if it can proove that size of the vector is bigger than maximum int!</p>

<p>Similar looking (and incorrecet as well) line </p>

<pre><code>for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; vec.size(), ++i) { }
</code></pre>

<p>Is not going to cause undefined behaviour, but it will hang the program when vector size is greater than maximum int. No good thing either.</p>

<p>And of course, the correct way of doing this is</p>

<pre><code>for (decltype(vec.size()) i = 0; i &lt; vec.size(), ++i) { }
</code></pre>
