<p>"Return Values
The return value of a route block determines at least the response body passed on to the HTTP client, or at least the next middleware in the Rack stack. Most commonly, this is a string, as in the above examples. But other values are also accepted.</p>

<p>You can return any object that would either be a valid Rack response, Rack body object or HTTP status code:</p>

<p>An Array with three elements: [status (Fixnum), headers (Hash), response body (responds to #each)]
An Array with two elements: [status (Fixnum), response body (responds to #each)]
An object that responds to #each and passes nothing but strings to the given block
A Fixnum representing the status code"</p>
