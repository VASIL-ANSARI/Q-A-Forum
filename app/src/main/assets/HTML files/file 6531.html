<p>There are a number of ways of determining the distance between two points, but for plotting points on a 2-D graph you probably want the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Distance.html" rel="nofollow">Euclidean distance</a>. If <code>(x1, y1)</code> represents your first point and <code>(x2, y2)</code> represents your second, the distance is</p>

<pre><code>d = sqrt( (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 )
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding grouping, you may want to use some sort of 2-D mean to determine how "close" things are to each other. For example, if you have three points, <code>(x1, y1)</code>, <code>(x2, y2)</code>, <code>(x3, y3)</code>, you can find the center of these three points by simple averaging:</p>

<pre><code>x(mean) = (x1+x2+x3)/3
y(mean) = (y1+y2+y3)/3
</code></pre>

<p>You can then see how close each is to the center to determine whether it should be part of the "cluster".</p>

<p>There are a number of ways one can define clusters, all of which use some variant of a <a href="http://home.dei.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/" rel="nofollow">clustering algorithm</a>. I'm in a rush now and don't have time to summarize, but check out the link and the algorithms, and hopefully other people will be able to provide more detail. Good luck!</p>
