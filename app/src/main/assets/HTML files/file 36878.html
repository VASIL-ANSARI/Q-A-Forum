<p><code>SurfaceView.setZOrderOnTop(boolean)</code> was added in <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.0.html" rel="nofollow">API 5 (Android 2.0)</a>.</p>

<p>You can always check for API level compatibility by looking at the Android docs. In your case, the <code>VideoView</code> extends <code>SurfaceView</code>. The method you are interested in comes from the <code>SurfaceView</code> class, so look at the docs here:</p>

<p>If the goal is to hide the video preview window, I know that one workaround used is to make the view really small (1x1) and place it in a corner of the screen.</p>

<p>That way the system still has a view to preview onto, but the user does not have to see the video stream.</p>

<p>This is often used by "Flashlight" apps that require a video preview window before being able to turn the LED on.</p>
