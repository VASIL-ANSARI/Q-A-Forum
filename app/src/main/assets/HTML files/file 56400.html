<p>You can simplify it a bit:</p>

<pre><code>if sys.version_info[0] == 3:
    xrange = range
</code></pre>

<p>I would do it the other way around:</p>

<pre><code>if sys.version_info[0] == 2:
    range = xrange
</code></pre>

<p>If you ever want to drop Python 2.x support, you can just remove those two lines without going through all your code.</p>

<p>However, I strongly suggest considering the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/six/"><code>six</code> library</a>. It is the de-facto standard for enabling Python 2 and 3 compatibility.</p>

<pre><code>from six.moves import range
</code></pre>
