<p>You could iterate from <code>S.lower_bound(a)</code> to <code>S.lower_bound(b)</code> and collect all the integers that you don't find:</p>

<pre><code>auto end = S.lower_bound(b);
int seen = a;

for (auto it = S.lower_bound(a); it &lt; end; ++it) {
   for (int i = seen+1; i &lt; *it; ++i)
      v.push_back(i);
   seen = *it;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It contains an explicit loop, but somehow you'll have to look at all the integers in <code>[a,b]</code>.</p>
