<p>You should rethink your design. Why are you using heap allocation of objects when it would be perfectly acceptable in this situation to have them on stack? Why are you not using inheritance and having B inherit from A? This whole quandry goes away when you don't force yourself to do unnecessary things.</p>

<p>If, for some reason you're <em>forced</em> to have have disparate heap-based objects then do something like wrap the allocated instance into a <code>unique_ptr&lt;&gt;</code> and pass the instance around or alternatively, as stated in Chad's answer, wrap it into a <code>shared_ptr&lt;&gt;</code> and maintain a <code>weak_ptr&lt;&gt;</code> reference for usage.</p>
