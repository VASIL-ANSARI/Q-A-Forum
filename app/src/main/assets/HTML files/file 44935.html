<p>Though its not mentioned in <a href="https://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/email.html" rel="nofollow">CI docs</a></p>

<p>There is a config item called <code>smtp_crypto</code> which you can find in <code>Email.php</code> class in your system libraries.
Which in your case needs to be set to <code>tls</code>.</p>

<p>So your config becomes</p>

<pre><code>$config['smtp_crypto']= 'tls'; 
$config['smtp_host'] = 'smtp.office365.com';
</code></pre>
