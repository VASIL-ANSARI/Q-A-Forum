<p>If you want to use memcached as a session store, you just need to <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/memcached.sessions.php" rel="nofollow">change the <code>session.save_handler</code> configuration to <code>memcached</code></a> for that to work automatically. Other extensions may offer similar predefined session handlers.</p>

<p>If there's no session handler that you like, you can create your own and register it using <code>session_set_save_handler</code>. Otherwise, don't reinvent the wheel.</p>
