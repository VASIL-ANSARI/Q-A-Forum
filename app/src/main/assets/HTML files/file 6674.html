<pre><code>$result = mysql_query ("SELECT * FROM test order by id desc limit 1");
</code></pre>

<p>As for your id question...that's how ids work. They don't fill in gaps.</p>

<p>On a side note: Never ever put user submitted data directly into the query string. Always escape them with mysql_real_escape_string(). </p>
