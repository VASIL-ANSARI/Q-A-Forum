<p>There are a lot of people out there that still don't use storyboards, and the fact that now by default when you create an app is done using storyboards doesn't mean you cannot use the previous approach.</p>

<p>Just create a simple app, with no view, and then create and add a new view controller with a xib. </p>

<p>Then, in your delegate, in the didFinishLaunch set the self.window.rootViewController to that view controller:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    self.window = [[[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]] autorelease];
    UIViewController *viewController1 = [[[FirstViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"FirstViewController" bundle:nil] autorelease];
    self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController1;
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>
