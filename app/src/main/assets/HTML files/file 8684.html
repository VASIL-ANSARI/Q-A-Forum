<p>Well you have an <code>XDocument</code>, so you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387098.aspx" rel="nofollow">Linq to XML</a> to query it for the value. Put that in the textbox when the page is rendered. Of course when you POST the value you'll have to load the file a second time, query the <code>XDocument</code> again, and then update the XML element with the new value before saving.</p>
