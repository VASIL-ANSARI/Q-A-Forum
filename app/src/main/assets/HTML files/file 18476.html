<p>I don't know about Matlab, but I do know that the arguments to a <code>scanf</code> call should be <em>pointers</em>, and unless <code>real_T</code> is typedefed as a pointer already it will not work.</p>

<p>Besides, you are using <code>fscanf</code> which is for reading from a <code>FILE</code> pointer.</p>

<p>I don't know if this will work or not, by try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>sscanf(pwork[0], "%f %f %f", &amp;y[0], &amp;y[1], &amp;y[2]);
</code></pre>
