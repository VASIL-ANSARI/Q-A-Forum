<p>Here about two things you have to be careful.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Operator precedence </p>

<p>When you are saying </p>

<pre><code>var middle = m.length - 1 / 2;
</code></pre>

<p>It is same as </p>

<pre><code> var middle = m.length - 0.5; //Because / has much precedence than -
</code></pre>

<p>So you should say </p>

<pre><code> var middle = (m.length - 1) / 2;
</code></pre>

<p>Same problem with <code>m.length - 1 % 2</code></p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> You are not rounding <code>middle</code> so it's looking for decimal indexes in array. Which I think will return <code>undefined</code>.</p>
