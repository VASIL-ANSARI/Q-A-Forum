<p>I've found the reason why the method #2 didn't work... Turns out I had a folder from which I was uploading the files?? And that folder had its own config inside it self... All I had to do was to insert this into my folder's web.config file like following: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;system.web&gt;
    &lt;authorization&gt;
      &lt;deny users="?"/&gt;
    &lt;/authorization&gt;
    &lt;httpRuntime executionTimeout="100000" maxRequestLength="214748364" /&gt;

  &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note you can limit the file size to something about ~25-30 MB, since it's not recommended to allow users or anyone else to upload large files onto your server.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
