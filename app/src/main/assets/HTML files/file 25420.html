<p>There might be several reasons for this exception. First you need to verify if that <code>@Service</code> annotation is properly inserted just before the class definition. If your service is UserService, the following pattern should be followed.</p>

<pre><code>@Service
public class UserService{

 // attributes and methods 

}
</code></pre>
