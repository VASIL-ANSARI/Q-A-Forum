<p>A scrollview's bounds change for every scroll movement. The bounds are essentially the currently visible rectangle in the scrollview. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>frame: {0,0,320.0,480.0}
contentSize: {320.0, 1000.0}
contentOffset: {0, 100.0}</p>

<p>bounds will be: {0, 100.0, 320.0, 480.0}</p>

<p>So for every change to contentOffset the bounds change. This causes layoutSubviews and didScroll to be called continuously while scrolling.</p>
