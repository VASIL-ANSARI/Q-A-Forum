<p>What you are talking about is a "Component" which is any class derived from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.component(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>System.ComponentModel.Component</code></a>. A control is a special type of component which derives from the class <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>System.Windows.Forms.Control</code></a>.</p>

<p>If you want to make your own component just make your class derive from <code>Component</code>, which is what your friend did with the <code>:Component,IDisposable</code>. The IDisposable part was not needed because <code>Component</code> already implements <code>IDisposeable</code> and could be left off.</p>
