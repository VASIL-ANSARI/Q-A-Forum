<p>I don't see anything wrong with what you have, but it could be reduced to a single line:</p>

<pre><code>print(max(words, key=len))
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to keep that dict structure then:</p>

<pre><code>longest = max(words, key=len)
longestWord = {'value': longest, 'len': len(longest)}
</code></pre>
