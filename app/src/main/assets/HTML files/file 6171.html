<p>If you can handle not auto-generating the key then <a href="http://www.grc.com/passwords" rel="nofollow">http://www.grc.com/passwords</a> is a good source of VERY random key material.</p>

<p>Base64 wouldn't reduce the underlying entropy of the byte array.  You could generate the key and use it in its raw form, but Base64 encode it to transport it to where you need it to be.  You'd then Base64 decode it back to the raw form before you use it in the new location.  There is no loss of entropy in this operation.  The Base64 encoding reduces the entropy to 6-bits per byte instead of 8, but the result of the coding is longer, so overall the entropy is the same.</p>

<p>The other way you could do it would be to get 24 random bytes for 192-bits worth of entropy.  Base64 encoding this would give you a 32 character string (256-bits) which still has the original randomness and 192-bits of entropy.  You could use this as your shared key directly.</p>
