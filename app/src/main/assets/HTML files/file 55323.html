<p>You are including jQuery.js twice. The second version is loading after the datepicker plugin has extended the original jQuery object and wipes it out .</p>

<p>You likely are seeing error <code>datepicker is not a function</code> or similar. You made no mention of errors thrown which is always the first thing to look for</p>

<p>Only include jQuery.js once and before all dependent plugins and code.</p>
