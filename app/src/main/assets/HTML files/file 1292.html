<blockquote>
  <p>The problem however is that the
  warning clutters the log file and
  makes debugging harder than needed. It
  is easy to suppress it though and I
  will show you how.</p>
  
  <p>First, locate jboss-log4j.xml file which should be found under
  ${JBOSS_HOME}/server/default/conf. If you are using a runtime
  configuration other than default, locate the file under configuration
  that you actually use. This file is used to configure logging output
  of the JBoss.</p>
  
  <p>Inside the file search for âLimit categoriesâ â you should find a list
  of  definitions. Edit it to look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- ================ --&gt;
&lt;!-- Limit categories --&gt;
&lt;!-- ================ --&gt;

&lt;!-- Suppress EJBTHREE-1337 warning --&gt;
&lt;category name="org.jboss.ejb3.stateless.StatelessBeanContext"&gt;
  &lt;priority value="ERROR"/&gt;
&lt;/category&gt;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You are basically telling JBoss to suppress any WARN or lower messages
  from the class that generates those warnings. Now just restart JBoss
  and the warning should disappear.</p>
