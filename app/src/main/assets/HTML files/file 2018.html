<p>Might this example at the IronPython Cookbook help?  It is on how to call your python class methods from c#...but it contains a working example of loading a script from a file as well.  The example works on IronPython 2.6 (you have to be careful which version as they have been changing the Hosting around quite a bit).</p>
