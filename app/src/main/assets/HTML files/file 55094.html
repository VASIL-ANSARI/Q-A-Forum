<p>Since you mention that you click on an element to trigger file modification, I assume that your React program runs in a browser. While <code>fs</code> is part of the Node runtime, for security reasons there is no such thing in browser runtimes, except for some proprietary <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/" rel="nofollow">extensions</a>.</p>

<p>As a workaround, the React page could send the JSON document to the server, which is able to store the file, or download it back to the client machine.</p>
