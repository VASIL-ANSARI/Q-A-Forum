<p>The API docs state that the 'drag' event fires repeatedly while the marker is dragged. So I figured it's calling <code>getevents()</code> quickly several times in a row.</p>

<p>You should use 'dragend' instead, with the drawback that it might introduce a delay for markers to appear while the geocoder runs. (If that becomes a problem, try leaving getevents outside the geocoder call?)</p>
