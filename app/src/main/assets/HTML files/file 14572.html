<p>To access all the documents of a group, just call <code>#documents</code> on the specific group model. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Group.find(params[:id]).documents #=&gt; Collection of groups documents as Array
</code></pre>

<p>You might run into a problem though because it looks like you're never assigning the new document to a group. You can do that several ways, one possible way is adding the following before <code>@document.save</code> in <code>DocumentsController#create</code> (assuming you have a parameter named <code>group_id</code>)</p>

<pre><code>@document.group = Group.find(params[:group_id]) 
</code></pre>
