<p>Reading binary files is not a simple operation, because they're compiler dependant in the sense that their structure, either for writing or reading, depends on the layout of the <code>struct</code> that generates the data or used to read it.</p>

<p>In your binary files records look like structured in this way:</p>

<pre><code>0x59563238323700 (flight number 7 bytes)
0x4B434C5400 (original airport 5 bytes)
0x4B53525100 (dest airport 5 bytes)
0x000000 (3 bytes padding)
0x2C83D052 (4 bytes timestamp)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the first three fields are 7+5+5 = 17 bytes, but <code>int</code> data type for timestamp requires <code>4</code> bytes alignment in the program that generated that binary data so data is padded to <code>20</code> bytes with 0s.</p>

<p>This means that you must make sure that the layout of your <code>struct</code> is exactly the same of the one that generated that binary data, or read it field by field by taking into account the padding after reversing the original data format.</p>
