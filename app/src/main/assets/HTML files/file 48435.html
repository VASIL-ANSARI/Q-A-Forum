<p>Hey thanks for your suggestion but I think it was meant for addon domains? I only wanted a subdomain for testing purposes. </p>

<p>What I ended up doing was to avoid installing Silverstripe on the server and instead install it on my laptop and then upload that to the server. It worked fine after copying the appropriate database and fixing Silverstripe's BaseURL to '/'</p>
