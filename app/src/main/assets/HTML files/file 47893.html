<p>You're passing object. You can use in controller. Here is something from the doc</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not use select as and track by in the same expression. They are not
  designed to work together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should use it like</p>

<pre><code>ng-options="obj.label for obj in royaltyOptions track by obj.value"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In controller</p>

<pre><code>console.log($scope.calc.details.option.value)
</code></pre>
