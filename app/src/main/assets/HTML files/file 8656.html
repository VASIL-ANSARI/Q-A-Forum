<p>Yes, this is doable. Here are a few pointers:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use LinqToXML to read the definition file (XSD), with the important properties (type, use, etc.)</li>
<li>Having your definitions in your hands, you should implement a class responsible for creating the fields
<ul>
<li>This class must have one method that creates one field based on one definition, using the important properties</li>
<li>This class must be able to group fields properly, according to the elements grouping in the definitions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You must decide what approach to use regarding positioning. There's no positioning information in the definition file and you have not reported whether this is WinForms, WebForms, Silverlight,etc.</li>
</ul>
