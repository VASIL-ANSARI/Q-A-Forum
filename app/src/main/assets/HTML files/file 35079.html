<p>The line:  </p>

<pre><code>if (strcmp(URL, "/") == 0) {  
</code></pre>

<p>Is testing to see if the string URL exactly matches the string literal "/".  If so, it returns <code>0</code>.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>, if you wanted to test to see if the string <code>URL</code> <em>contained</em> "/", then use:  </p>

<pre><code> if (strstr(URL, "/") != NULL) {   
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding <em>But how does 'if (strcmp(URL, "/") == 0)' determine if the URL is good?</em><br>
It does not.  More would be needed than a single character to determine if URL was good, it appears that the comment, as written, is not really expressing what that code block actually does. </p>
