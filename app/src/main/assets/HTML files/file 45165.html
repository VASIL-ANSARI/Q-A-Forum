<p>If all you need is the name, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>select studentName, avg(studentScore) as avgStudentScore
from students
group by studentName
order by avgStudentScore desc
limit 1
</code></pre>

<p>This will return only the first row of the query. Since it's ordered by <code>avgStudentScore</code>, it will return the student with the top average.</p>

<hr>

<p>The above solution is the simplest and fastests, but it's not the only one. If you want to do it "the hard way" (with subqueries), what you need to do is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Calculate the average for each student</li>
<li>Get the highest average</li>
<li>Filter the student with the highest average</li>
</ol>

<p>So... let's do it the hard way ;)</p>

<pre><code>select a.studentName
from 
    (
        select studentName, avg(studentScore) as avgStudentScore
        from students
        group by studentName
    ) as a
where 
    a.avgStudentScore = (
        select max(avgStudentScore) 
        from (
            select avg(studentScore) as avgStudentScore 
            from students 
            group by studentName
        ) as a
    )
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that with this approach the final result might not be unique (i.e. there may be one ore more students with the same average and that average is the highest).</p>
