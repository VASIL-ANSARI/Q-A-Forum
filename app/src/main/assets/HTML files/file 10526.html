<p>This makes absolutely no sense to me. What makes an ID more readable than a class? There's no point assigning unique identifiers to each of a group of related elements if there's no benefit in having identities.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, realize that a single element can have both classes and an ID. If your elements need to be uniquely identified somehow, give them IDs. If multiple elements should be styled identically and are all similar in purpose anyway, use classes. <em>If your elements fit both criteria, give them both attributes</em>, and use each attribute accordingly.</p>
