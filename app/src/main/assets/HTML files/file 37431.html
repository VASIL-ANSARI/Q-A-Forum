<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" rel="nofollow">two's complement</a> (which is the representation used by almost all modern computers), the range of a signed integer of <code>k</code> bits is <code>-2<sup>k-1</sup> &mdash; 2<sup>k-1</sup>-1</code>, inclusive. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations#Signed_magnitude_representation" rel="nofollow">sign-magnitude and one's complement</a> representations, there are two possible representations for 0 and the range is symmetric: <code>-(2<sup>k-1</sup>-1) &mdash; 2<sup>k-1</sup>-1</code>.</p>

<p>If you need to represent this in portable C, you need to worry about integer overflow. Also, without <code>limits.h</code> you have no good way to know what the bit-length of an <code>int</code> is. Non-portably, if you believe that <code>int</code> has 32 bits (which is <em>not</em> guaranteed), then you could use <code>((1UL&lt;&lt;31)-1)</code> as the largest possible signed integer.</p>
