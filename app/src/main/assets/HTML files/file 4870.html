<p>The numbers generated by each <code>Random</code> instance will be uniformly distributed, so if you combine the sequences of random numbers generated by both <code>Random</code> instances, they should be uniformly distributed too.</p>

<p>Note that even if the resulting distribution is uniform, you might want to pay attention to the seeds to avoid correlation between the output of the two generators. If you use the default no-arg constructor, the seeds should already be different. From the source code of <code>java.util.Random</code>:</p>

<pre><code>private static volatile long seedUniquifier = 8682522807148012L;

public Random() { this(++seedUniquifier + System.nanoTime()); }
</code></pre>

<p>If you are setting the seed explicitly (by using the <code>Random(long seed)</code> constructor, or calling <code>setSeed(long seed)</code>), you'll need to take care of this yourself. One possible approach is to use a random number generator to produce the seeds for all other generators.</p>
