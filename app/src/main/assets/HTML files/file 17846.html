<p>The cause of my issue was a misplaced range object. I had unwittingly placed the range inside another content control, which still contained placeholder text. Unfortunately, the error message said nothing to this effect.</p>

<p>To determine whether you're making the same mistake, try calling <code>r.Select()</code> at the end instead of whatever action may be causing this exception, and see where the cursor is placed. Be sure that the document is not limited to editing in fields when you do this (<code>Review&gt;Protect Document&gt;Restrict Editing and Formatting</code>), otherwise it may automatically move to the beginning of the document, or into a content control, before you can see it.</p>
