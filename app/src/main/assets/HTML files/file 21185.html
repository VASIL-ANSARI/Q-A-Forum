<p>Your mouseEnter function is being called outside the scope of your widget (scope in JS refers to the value of the "this" variable). This is a common problem and dojo has a simple solution, the function lang.hitch can be used to tie a function to a certain scope. (and more, I would recommending reading the docs on it). Here's how you should use it in this scenario :</p>

<pre><code>// Set up our mouseenter/leave events - using dojo/on
// means that our callback will execute with `this` set to our widget
on(domNode, "mouseenter", lang.hitch(this, function (e) {
    this._changeBackground(this.mouseBackgroundColor);
}));
on(domNode, "mouseleave", lang.hitch(this, function (e) {
    this._changeBackground(this.baseBackgroundColor);
}));
</code></pre>
