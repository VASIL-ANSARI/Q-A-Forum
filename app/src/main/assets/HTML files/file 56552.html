<p>The problem is using pseudo element on an input element, it does not work in IE, use a label as target instead ... it actually shouldn't work in Chrome either as pseudo element is suppose to not work on single tag elements.</p>

<p>I changed this rule to show how you could do, so you'll see it now works with FontAwesome</p>

<pre><code>#dlg-audit-intake-compliance-checklist label:before {
    font-family: FontAwesome;
    content: "\f10c";
    font-size: 25px;
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 0px #ddd;
    margin-bottom: 10px !important;
}
</code></pre>
