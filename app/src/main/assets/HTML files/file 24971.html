<p>Of course you need a controller. Not necessarily the same controller, but one is needed.</p>

<p>The controller is needed to connect the view and the model. Without it when you submit your data there is no action to send it. Obviously, the database won't be modified this way. You can't even display your view without an action in the controller. </p>

<p>Models without corresponding containers are only used when it is closely attached some other model, like a forum-comment pair. So you can let the user controller to handle business data, but that is not really recommended.</p>
