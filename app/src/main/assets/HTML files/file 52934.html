<p>Have you tried a moving average? That can be tailored to however you want and will appear to "smooth" out the graph. Here's a very simple sample of how to amend your code with that.</p>

<pre><code>// get the last 4 points to average out (plus analogDataIn1)
int pointsToAverage = 4;
int pointCount = chart2.Series[0].Points.Count();
var buffer = chart2.Series[0].Points.Skip(Math.Max(0, pointCount - pointsToAverage)).Select(dp =&gt; dp.YValues[0]);
// calculate the average Y from these points (along with analogDataIn1)
double avgAnalogDataIn1;
if (buffer.Count() == 0)
{
    avgAnalogDataIn1 = analogDataIn1;
}
else
{
    avgAnalogDataIn1 = (buffer.Sum() + analogDataIn1) / (double)(buffer.Count() + 1);
}

DataPoint dp0 = new DataPoint(x, avgAnalogDataIn1);
chart2.Series[0].Points.RemoveAt(0);
chart2.Series[0].Points.Add(dp0);
x++;
</code></pre>

<p>This example uses 5 points to average on. You can quickly increase the number of points to average on by bumping up the <code>pointsToAverage</code> to, say, <code>10</code> and that will make the graph even smoother. Note that the lines will still have 'sharp tips' - there is no <code>ChartType</code> that smooths the lines for you.</p>
