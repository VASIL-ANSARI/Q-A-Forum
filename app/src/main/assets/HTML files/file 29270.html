<p>After several more weeks experience with this plugin I have a better answer for you.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try not to pin to the element you are affecting,  use containers so that you are pushing around.  So have a container wrapping the main-1 so that you aren't playing with your container so much.</p></li>
<li><p>Width issues can be problematic with this plugin,  I was not able to get a good margin: 0 auto; to work in several places I had to do a max-width or width of 100% to make sure it would look right.</p></li>
</ol>
