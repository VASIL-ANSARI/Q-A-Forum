<pre><code>SELECT employee_ID, sum(session_duration)
FROM event_user_login
GROUP BY employee_ID;
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need a nested select or anything complicated like that. What you're chasing is a very simple aggregation query. The above is essentially saying:</p>

<p>Give me all of the employee_ids, group them so the same ids are together, then add up all of the session_durations for each group of ids, and then return each group, and that sum.</p>
