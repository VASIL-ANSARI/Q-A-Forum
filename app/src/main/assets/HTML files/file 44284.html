<p>I hope this will solve your problem:</p>

<p>You can split your string in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>String A = "AB-CDFER-GTDOL";
 String[] parts = A.split("-");
</code></pre>

<p>Now your parts array will have the following values:</p>

<pre><code>parts[0] = "AB";
parts[1] = "CDFER" etc..
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly you can use these value in your sql query as needed. </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
