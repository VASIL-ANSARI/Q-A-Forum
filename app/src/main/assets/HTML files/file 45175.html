<p>I believe your error is in your aspx on this line </p>

<pre><code>SELECT [Description] FROM [tblCodesWorkNotRec] ORDER BY [Description]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>order by description</code> is going to be what is giving you that error. You can fix this by casting to a <code>varchar</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [Description] 
FROM [tblCodesWorkNotRec] 
ORDER BY Convert(varchar(max), [Description])
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why you would want to order by a description field however.  Perhaps its best just to do away with the <code>order by</code>.  The error may also have occured on the <code>order by [time]</code> line.  But if this is a <code>DateTime</code> field its fine.  This field should probably be renamed to something that is not a keyword, like <code>CodeTime</code></p>

<p>Some other notes on your code, Refactoring this is a good idea. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>As a recommendation, I would make a <em>single class that talks to your database</em>. Dont put sql connections in your code behind, <em>much less in your aspx</em>. (if you are going to do that, pick one location, not both) This class will have all your sql and returns just the values you want.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Consolidate your sql</em>. There is no reason to make 3 calls to the same table to get one value from each call. Make one call to get 3 things. I'm speaking of the firstname, lastname, employeeid calls. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Dont put business logic in event handlers</em>. Notice your Page_Load method. This is an event handler. Any code that you put here cannot be called from somewhere else, so you end up copying code over and over. Simply move the calls to their own method, and call that method from Page_Load. (<a href="http://www.dofactory.com/net/facade-design-pattern" rel="nofollow">GoF pattern - Facade</a>) </p></li>
<li><p><em>Put your UI elements in their own div tag and align them with CSS.</em> Get rid of (or at least think hard about) the <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> and <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> markup and use things like margin in css to move your elements around. Also move all the inline style tags to css.</p></li>
</ol>
