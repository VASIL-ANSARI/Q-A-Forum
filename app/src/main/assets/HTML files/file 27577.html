<p>Because in Python 2, <code>print</code> is a statement. But <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print()</code></a> is now a function in Python 3. However, <code>print(...)</code> is still valid syntax in Python 2, and you can also do <code>from __future__ import print_function</code> to get Python 3's print function in Python 2.</p>

<p>Don't expect python 3 to be compatible with 2; <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html" rel="nofollow">there are many other changes</a>. For example, <code>reduce()</code> was removed, and most built-in functions now return generators that once returned lists (eg <code>map()</code>, <code>zip()</code>, and <code>filter()</code>).</p>
