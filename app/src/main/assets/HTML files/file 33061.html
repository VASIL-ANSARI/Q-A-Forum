<p>Incoming texts can't be intercepted in iOS as far as I know.</p>

<p>For Android you can use intents to intercept incoming texts but that's a bit of a pain you would need to write Android native code for that which you can do with <a href="http://www.codenameone.com/how-do-i---access-native-device-functionality-invoke-native-interfaces.html" rel="nofollow">native interfaces</a> in Codename One.</p>

<p>I'm not very familiar with the Vimeo API but if its a REST API then you can pretty much map to it with Codename One's networking API using <code>NetworkManager</code>, <code>ConnectionRequest</code> etc.</p>
