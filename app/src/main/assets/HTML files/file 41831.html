  <p>Example - What if I want to run 20 services etc</p>

<p>docker will create entries in etc hosts file for each of the linked containers using their alias. So If you link a lot of containers you can just address them using their alias name. Do not map the port to a public port using -p 9000:9000. This way all your services can be on port 9000 on their own docker host which can be looked up from /etc/hosts</p>

<p>This is an open question, here is some <a href="http://progrium.com/blog/2014/07/29/understanding-modern-service-discovery-with-docker/" rel="nofollow">good reading</a> on the topic. <a href="https://github.com/crosbymichael/skydock" rel="nofollow">SkyDock</a> and SkyDNS get you most of the way of service discovery and <a href="https://github.com/zettio/weave/" rel="nofollow">weave</a> gets you easy to use networking between remote docker containers. I have not seen a better end-to-end solution yet although there may be some out there.</p>
