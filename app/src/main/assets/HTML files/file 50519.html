<p>In your if statement, you're attempting to compare an int to a, presumably, ZipCode. Your method declaration should instead be</p>

<pre><code>public ZipCode findZip(ZipCode zip){
  for (int i = 0; i &lt;= myZips.size() - 1; i++)
  if (zip == myZips.get(i)) 
    return myZips.get(i);
  else
    return "null";
</code></pre>

<p>You would then of course need to pass in a ZipCode to your method, rather than an int</p>
