  <p>This uses a jquery datepicker and will work fine normally, but not when being appended then compiled in my directive.</p>

<p>And this is really the core of your issue. You cannot expect jQuery plugins to work properly inside of Angular application, simply because their lifecycles are not very good coincides. I will explain better.</p>

<p>When you run application, some HTML with directives and binding Angular gets parsed and compiled by Angular. this i fine. At this point your jQuery plugins will probably even initialize properly, because they usually just need to have DOM rendered. However what's going to happen when you append newly compiled dynamic HTML? Angular will pick it up well because you call <code>$compile</code>. But jQuery might get desynchronized and never reinitialize plugins.</p>

<p>That's the main reason why you should not use jQuery the way we are all used to. Ideally jQuery usage (and DOM manipulation in general) should be limited to custom directives only. This is the only way to be 100% sure that both Angular and jQuery update/initialize their stuff at the right moment.</p>

<p>So.. You need a datepicker? Great! There are many Angular directives available (for example, <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/datepicker" rel="nofollow">Angular UI</a> datepicker)that simply wraps jQuery plugins into linking function, thus making it compatible with Angular workflow and digest cycles.</p>
