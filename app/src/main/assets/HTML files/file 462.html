<p>Absolutely position divs over the text area with a z-index higher and give these divs a transparent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format" rel="nofollow">GIF</a> background graphic.</p>

<p>Note after a bit more thought - You'd need to have these 'covers' be linked so clicking on them would take you to where the tab was supposed to, which means you could/should do this with the anchor element set to <code>display:box</code>, width and height set as well as the transparent background image.</p>
