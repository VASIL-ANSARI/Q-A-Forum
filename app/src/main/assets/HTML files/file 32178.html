<p>The arrays are not equal. 
<a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/kvesJ" rel="nofollow">Example</a>. In my example if you view the javascript console, you will see one logs an Array[1] of one array. And the other logs an Array[3] of 3 strings.</p>

<p>It appears you are casting the arrays to strings when you add them to the pre-existing string in the log. Those two arrays casted to strings are identical.</p>
