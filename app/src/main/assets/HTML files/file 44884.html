<p>A tab is not four spaces. <code>bluej.editor.tabsize=4</code> means that the BlueJ system is rendering the tabs as if they were four spaces.</p>

<p>However, no matter how they are rendered, tabs are still tabs, something completely different from a space. <code>'\t' == 11</code>, while <code>' ' == 32</code>, and <code>"    "</code> can't even be compared to an <code>int</code> since it's a <code>String</code>, not a <code>char</code>.</p>

<p>For the expected String, use <code>"\t"</code> instead of <code>"    "</code>.</p>
