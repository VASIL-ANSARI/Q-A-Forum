<p>If you want to wrap native C++ code for .NET, use C++/CLI. For simple C-style API it is possible to use PInvoke.</p>

<p>If you want to wrap native C++ code both for .NET and COM clients (like Internet Explorer, MS Office, scripting languages etc.), use COM. </p>

<p>To my opinion, writing COM wrapper is more complicated task. But COM guru can have another opinion - it depends on your experience in these technologies.</p>
