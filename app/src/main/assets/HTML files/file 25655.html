<p>WebSockets, Server Sent Events, and Forever Frame all utilize a client side keep alive which is used to ensure client connectivity.  However, Long Polling does not utilize the client side keep alive feature due to technical limitations and has no guarantee of connectivity for events such as pulling the network cable out.</p>

<p>When I say no guarantee I'm simply stating that the Long Polling transport is no longer able to be ensured by SignalR but instead relies on the Browser to trigger the correct events  on Long Polling's ajax connection (through which SignalR can respond to).</p>

<p>Keep in mind though, if the client does happen to regain connectivity with the server after pulling out the network cable it will receive any messages that it missed during its down time.  So messages are not missed, they're just delayed.</p>

<p>Lastly in the case that the server does not see the client for an extended period of time the OnDisconnected event WILL be triggered.  For this to happen in a situation such as pulling the network cable out the server will first timeout the current connection's request and then will timeout the connection itself. This means that you can still rely on the OnDisconnected event, it may just be delayed based on network conditions.</p>

<p>Soooo what you're seeing is 100% by design =)</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
