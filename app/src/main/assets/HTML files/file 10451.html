<p>As proposed in another answer you can output a Javascript call whenever the page is loaded.</p>

<p>However, if your event cannot wait until the page is reloaded, then I suggest you setup some javascript to poll a page every X number of seconds (using AJAX) and do something when the values change.</p>
