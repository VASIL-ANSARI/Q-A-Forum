<p>The more I look at it, and after running more tests, I'm thinking the bug may be in the Sql Server Query Visualizer plugin for Visual Studio, not actually in Linq to SQL itself. So it is not nearly as bad a situation as I thought - the query will return the right results, but you can't trust what the Visualizer is showing. Not great, but better than what I thought was going on.</p>
