  <p>"Merely using display:none will not automatically trigger a penalty.
  The key is whether or not there is a mechanism - either automatic or
  one that is invoked by the user - to make the content visible.Google

  such mechanisms.If you use valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you have
  nothing to worry about. Good luck!"</p>
