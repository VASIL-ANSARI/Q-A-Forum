<p>as you can see in this code:</p>

<pre><code>CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    'add-every-30-seconds': {
        'task': 'tasks.add',
        'schedule': crontab(hour=7, minute=30, day_of_week=1),
        'args': (16, 16)
    },
}
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>celery beat</code> is actually the process itself,think of it like a function  with settings.
the function is the task and the settings are the arguments,name and schedule, here comes the crontab, its a period of a time that tells celery when to cycle through it.</p>

<p>you can also see <a href="http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html#crontab-schedules" rel="nofollow">here</a> a list of <code>crontabs</code> types.</p>
