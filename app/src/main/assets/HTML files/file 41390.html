<p>.on events are only picked up for elements that exist at the time of the declaration.</p>

<p>From the jQuery docs - <a href="http://api.jquery.com/on/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/on/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they
  must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on().</strong>
  To ensure the elements are present and can be selected, perform event
  binding inside a document ready handler for elements that are in the
  HTML markup on the page. If new HTML is being injected into the page,
  select the elements and attach event handlers after the new HTML is
  placed into the page. Or, use delegated events to attach an event
  handler, as described next.</p>
  
  <p>Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from
  descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time. By
  picking an element that is guaranteed to be present at the time the
  delegated event handler is attached, you can use delegated events to
  avoid the need to frequently attach and remove event handlers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to use delegated events you want to attach the on event to the parent element e.g. if you are attaching the new comments to an element #container</p>

<pre><code>$("#container").on('click','input[type=submit]',function(event){
   // send AJAX to Django views.py
});
</code></pre>
