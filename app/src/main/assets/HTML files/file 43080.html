<p>Not sure what the real issue was however when I changed the line</p>

<pre><code>$process = new Process("exec php {$console} {$commandSlug} {$time} &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null &amp;");
</code></pre>

<p>to use a temp output file:</p>

<pre><code>$process = new Process("exec php {$console} {$commandSlug} {$time} &gt; /tmp/output.log 2&gt;/tmp/output.log &amp;");
</code></pre>

<p>everything started to work properly. Can anyone shed some light on this?</p>
