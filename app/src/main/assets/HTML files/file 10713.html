<p>If your using eclipse you can just stick this above the declaration.</p>

<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings("unused")
AccelerometerLogger accelerometerLogger = new AccelerometerLogger();
</code></pre>

<p>I guess because this annotation is provided, creating unused objects isn't seen as evil or anything. The warnings are really annoying though so it's great they have these kind of annotations.</p>
