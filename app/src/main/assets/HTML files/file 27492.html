<p>Spring or JSP have nothing to do with it, the only way to force user's browser to open a link in a new tab is to use client-side Javascript. <code>window.open()</code> allows configuring the popup to hide certain interface elements (see all options in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.open#Toolbar_and_chrome_features" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>)</p>

<p>Your code would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="button" value="Show Log" onclick="showLog(logName)"&gt;

function showLog(logName) {
    var url = "/path-to-your-controller.html?logName=" + logName;
    window.open(url, "LogPage", "toolbar=no,location=no,menubar=no");
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I don't think using a customised browser popup is a good solution; it's been disappearing from the web for a reason. It would be more elegant to fetch raw data using AJAX and display  it in a JS popup: it wouldn't interfere with user's page navigation (you tagged the question with jQuery, you could use jQuery UI for that).</p>

<p>What is more, I wouldn't be surprised if <code>window.open</code> wasn't supported by all browsers in the same wayâ  - something to keep in mind if you're targeting a wider audience.</p>

<p>â  <em>seems that Chrome ignores <code>location=no</code>, for instance</em></p>
