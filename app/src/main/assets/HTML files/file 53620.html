<p>So my issue was that I was using the wrong debug.keystore.  My Mac has both Android Studio and Xamarin Studio installed.  I had incorrectly assumed that Xamarin was using "~/.android/debug.keystore" but it turns out that they put theirs in "~/.local/share/Xamarin/Mono for Android/debug.keystore" changing to using the SHA1 from this key fixed my issue.  For my info on Xamarin keys:
