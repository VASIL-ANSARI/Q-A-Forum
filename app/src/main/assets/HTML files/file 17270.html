<p>There's a couple of things wrong. First is that this line</p>

<pre><code>$("#detailviewernav").appendTo(".fancybox-wrap");
</code></pre>

<p>You're actually moving the element from its position in the dom initially and appending it to <code>.fancybox-wrap</code>. The problem with that is once the next image loads, it loads inside <code>.fancybox-wrap</code> and when your code executes that line again, there isn't a <code>#detailviewernav</code> in the DOM anymore.</p>

<p>So you can swap it to with </p>

<pre><code>$("#detailviewernav").clone().appendTo(".fancybox-wrap");
</code></pre>

<p>to clone it before moving it so that you have access to it again. (You might want to use a class instead of an ID so that you don't end up with multiple elements with the same IDs.</p>

<p>The second thing is since the DOM is being manipulated, you'll need to delegate the events.</p>

<pre><code>$('body').on('click','.fancybox-wrap #detailviewerprev',function(){
        $.fancybox.prev();
    });

    $('body').on('click','.fancybox-wrap #detailviewernext',function(){
      $.fancybox.next();
    });
</code></pre>
