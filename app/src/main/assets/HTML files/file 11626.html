<p>heap allocations are done with the <code>new</code> keyword</p>

<p>C++ has no garbage collection, heap allocations are never automatically freed</p>

<p>you can free them with the <code>delete</code> keyword</p>

<p>you need to keep a pointer for that, for example by returning it from the function, or by assigning it to a global variable</p>

<p>destructors are called on <code>delete</code> and are used to free resources, for example network sockets</p>

<p>so the code would be, for example <code>return new MyObject("foo");</code></p>
