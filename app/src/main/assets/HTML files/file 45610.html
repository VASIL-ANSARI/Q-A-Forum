<p>If you are using StructureMap it uses "Greedy Initialization", meaning when the constructor is called it will call the constructor with the most amount of arguments or parameters passed in. </p>

<pre><code>private IFDGService service;

public MyController(IFDGService service)
{
    this.service = service;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>service</code> will be available after <code>IoC.Configure()</code> is called.</p>

<p>Call <code>IoC.Configure()</code> whereever the application is started. google "where does Mvc start" or something like that. </p>

<p>to change the company code set it somewhere other than an instance variable in the controller, like a <code>static</code> class, I know static is bad, get it working and then make it better, since that would be complex to modify, and then <code>get; set;</code> when you need to. </p>

<p>I have to go to meeting, kinda rushed, hope that helps</p>
