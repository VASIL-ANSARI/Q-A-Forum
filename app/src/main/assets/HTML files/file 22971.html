<p>This is a great question. It does not seem that the zip function has the ability to zip sub folders. The reason that your script doesn't work is because you only select the <em>files</em> from the folder.</p>

<p>A solution would be to zip each of the subfolders and store that in the one zipped file. You can use the function that I wrote for this.</p>

<pre><code>function zipFolder(folder) {
  var zipped_folders = [];
  var folders = folder.getFolders();
  for(var i in folders)
    zipped_folders.push(zipFolder(folders[i]));
  return Utilities.zip(folder.getFiles().concat(zipped_folders),folder.getName()+".zip");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This recursively zips all subfolders. Then you need to create the file with something like</p>

<pre><code>DocsList.getFolder("path/to/folder/to/store/zip/file").createFile(zipFolder(folderToZip));
</code></pre>

<p>I will put in a feature request to allow subfolders to be zipped.</p>
