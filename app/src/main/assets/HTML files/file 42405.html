<p>This looks like its a known issue on the <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=588369#588369" rel="nofollow">AWS Forums</a>.  Looks like an issue between pip version and the version of python installed. The steps to fix are on the <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=588369#588369" rel="nofollow">AWS forums</a> but it looks like it is as simple as downloading the bootstrap action and  tweaking some symlinks.</p>
