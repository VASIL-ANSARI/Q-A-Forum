<p>Yep, that's not going to work the way you think.  The results of Paint aren't forwarded to the device (screen) until some time after the method returns; this allows the windowing system to do some optimizations.  So your Paint method basically draws <em>all ten images</em> before anything is sent to the screen.</p>

<p>The reason you don't see <em>anything</em> until you click the form is because Paint is only called when the Form thinks it needs to be redrawn.  Simply changing a Control's content may not cause that to happen.  Take a look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAAahUKEwjW5rWExvzIAhXK6CYKHTXEDEg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2F598t492a(v%3Dvs.110).aspx&amp;usg=AFQjCNHmzwNjJr34YpFYdgRIWA7bDEzDxQ&amp;sig2=voHWt12iW_OXRK7AYqFE-A&amp;bvm=bv.106923889,d.eWE" rel="nofollow" title="System::Windows::Forms::Control::Invalidate&#40;&#41;">Control::Invalidate()</a> method.</p>

<p>What you might consider is using a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAAahUKEwjol73vxfzIAhWCRyYKHcalAaE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2Fsystem.windows.forms.timer(v%3Dvs.110).aspx&amp;usg=AFQjCNExmJnHGdGUlTDUW3Y_i7TSoF7dNQ&amp;sig2=gWHFa2ALsE6uNaDqEY7p7g&amp;bvm=bv.106923889,d.eWE" rel="nofollow" title="System::Windows::Forms::Timer">System::Windows::Forms::Timer</a> to periodically update the image and invalidate the control (if needed).  This keeps it all on the Forms thread and also allows you to have some control over the rate at which the images change.  Your button click could start the timer.</p>

<p>I also suggest loading all the images into memory ahead of time instead of reading each one from file at the moment you intend to display it.</p>
