<p><code>Module</code> is the superclass of the class <code>Class</code> so if a suitably generic name could be thought of then the methods for defining accessors could be put on <code>Module</code> and it would work for modules and classes. Notice that the follow works:</p>

<pre><code>class Bar
  mattr_accessor :test
end
</code></pre>

<p>but</p>

<pre><code>module Foo
  cattr_accessor :test
end
</code></pre>

<p>wouldn't work.</p>

<p>Having a <em>c</em> prefix on the methods that should be used inside classes and an <em>m</em> prefix on the methods for use inside modules just helps to make your code a bit clearer.</p>
