<p>Even I had faced the same problem with collada models and internet explorer, the code u have given is working fine in rest of the browsers like chrome and mozilla.</p>

<p>check out <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/yourworldin3d/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a>, but in this case they are loading a kml file and not directly loading collada models into the browser using javascript.</p>
