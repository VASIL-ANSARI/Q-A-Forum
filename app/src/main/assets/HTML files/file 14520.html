<p>Looking at the source code for the default system progress bar at <a href="https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/android/widget/ProgressBar.java" rel="nofollow">ProgressBar.java</a> shows that there is hardcoded limit of two bars at once...</p>

<p>The easiest way for you may probably be copying the progressbar source to your project and add another bar by yourself.</p>

<p>Since there is a secondary progress bar already present, additional ones should not pose any extra difficult challenge (just follow the example of the secondary one).</p>
