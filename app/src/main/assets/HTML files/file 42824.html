<p>If your goal is to share messages (like A site iframe loading, or pass event from A site iframe to parent B site), i think you should to use post Message. </p>

<p>With a few lines of code, you can create a two-way communication between the B site and the A site iframe. You'll need to write a simple Javascript in Site B for the reception of the message, specifying the site's domain of sender(origin), and a simple Javascript code within the site A (which will reside inside the iframe ) to send the message . Once in javascript, you can decide the time you send out the message from the site A.</p>

<p>The postMessage technology was used for so long by the various Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and allows you to solve this problem of cross domain.</p>
