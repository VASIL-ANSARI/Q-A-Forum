<p>The indexes you use in <code>$_POST</code> have to match the parameter names in the <code>$.ajax</code> <code>data:</code> parameter. You have <code>date=</code>, <code>Species=</code>, etc. in the parameter, but you're trying to access <code>$_POST['tDate']</code>,  <code>$_POST['tSpecies']</code>, etc. You need to change one of them to match the other.</p>

<p>Also, I recommend you use an object rather than a string as the <code>data:</code> parameter. The values need to be URL-encoded if they contain special characters, and you're not doing that. If you use an object, jQuery takes care of formatting and encoding it for you. So it should be:</p>

<pre><code>data: { tDate: tDate, tSpecies: tSpecies, tSqrNum: tSqrNum, ... },
</code></pre>

<p>BTW, EcmaScript6 provides a shorthand for objects where the property names are the same as the variables containing their values:</p>

<pre><code>data: { tdate, tSpecies, tSqrNum, ... },
</code></pre>
