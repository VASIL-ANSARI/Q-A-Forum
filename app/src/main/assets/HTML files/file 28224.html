<p>The primary purpose of giving an assembly a strong name is preventing malicious users of someone else's code that uses your assembly from substituting your code with their own.</p>

<p>Consider this situation: you make a <code>TransmitSecret.dll</code> assembly that you give to your customers so that they could communicate with your server in a secure way. If <code>TransmitSecret.dll</code> is not signed, malicious users would be able to write their own module that presents the same interface as yours, wrap your code in their own malicious code, intercept all of "secure" transmissions of your customer, and send a copy to their own server. They would be able to do it without having access to the source code of your customers, simply by replacing your <code>dll</code> with theirs.</p>

<p>If <code>TransmitSecret.dll</code> is signed, however, and your customers' code is linked against it, the trick with swapping the assemblies is not going to work: when your customers' code would try loading <code>TransmitSecret.dll</code>, .NET would notice the change, and stop the program from starting up.</p>
