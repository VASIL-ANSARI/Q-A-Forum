<p>Your <code>ParentCategoryId</code> is already optional based on the fact that it is nullable. If it wasn't nullable, it would be required. You don't need to configure it further.</p>

<p>Note, you don't need to configure <code>CategoryId</code> as the Key for <code>Category</code>. It will be configured as the key because it already follows the naming convention for an entity key. </p>
