<p>This was actually an issue with using routing over multiple databases. In my development server no authentication is taking place - so the database is not interacted with. </p>

<p>What I found was that Django was trying to communicate with the 'auth' and 'sessions' database alias'. I was not handling these names properly in my router.py, so they were not being allowed to read and write data.</p>
