<p>See the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.array.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN Array class</a>. This looks like it is c#. Maybe try the <code>Array.Find&lt;T</code>> method.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
For Java, I'd recommend looking at <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#binarySearch%28int%5B%5D,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">Arrays (Java 2 Platform)</a>:</p>

<p>binarySearch</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>public static int binarySearch(int[]
  a,
                                 int key)</p>
  
  <p>Searches the specified array of ints for the specified value using the binary search algorithm. The array  must be sorted (as by the sort method above) prior to making this call. If
  it is not sorted, the results are
  undefined. If the array contains
  multiple elements with the specified
  value, there is no guarantee which one
  will be found.</p>

<pre><code>Parameters:
    a - the array to be searched.
    key - the value to be searched for. 
Returns:
    index of the search key, if it is contained in the list; otherwise,&gt; (-(insertion point) - 1). 
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The insertion point is defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into the list: the index of the first  element greater than the key, or list.size(), if all elements 
  in the list are less than the specified key. Note that this guarantees that the return value will be >= 0 if and only if the key is found. See Also:  sort(int[])</p>
