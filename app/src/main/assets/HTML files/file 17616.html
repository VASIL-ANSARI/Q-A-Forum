<p>What if your Error class were to hold a XmlRpcStruct variable:</p>

<pre><code>public class Error
{
    public string status;
    public XmlRpcStruct xmlstr;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can assign your XmlRpcStruct to the Error object's variable:</p>

<pre><code>object ret = proxy.login("admin", "1234");
Type t = ret.GetType();

if (t == typeof(XmlRpcStruct))
{
    Error err = new Error();
    err.xmlstr = (XmlRpcStruct)ret;
}
else
{
    string result = (string)ret;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you'll still have access to the original XmlRpcStruct through the Error class's variable without losing it to a try statement.  There might be a better way to achieve this with inheritance, but this is a quick fix.</p>
