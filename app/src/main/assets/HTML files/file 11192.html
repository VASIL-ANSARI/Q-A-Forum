<p>Sounds like:</p>

<pre><code>if (AndSets.Contains("0"))
{
    OrSetFinalResult = false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>No need for LINQ at all. It'll still loop internally of course, but it's still a lot simpler.</p>

<p>EDIT: As noted in comments, you could also use:</p>

<pre><code>OrSetFinalResult = OrSetFinalResult &amp;&amp; !OrSet.Split('&amp;').Contains("0");
</code></pre>
