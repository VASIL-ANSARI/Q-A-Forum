<p>It doesn't have a problem with <code>char</code>, it has a problem with <code>char *</code>, also known as "c-style strings".</p>

<p>There is no <code>operator&lt;</code> for c-style strings (char *), so <code>std::max</code> doesn't work. You'll have to implement it yourself with <code>strcmp</code> OR use <code>std::string</code> instead.</p>
