<p>I'm not sure if there are any static analyzers which can check the validity of jQuery code in depth, but for the Javascript syntax itself, there are non-web versions of <a href="http://www.javascriptlint.com/" rel="nofollow">Javascript Lint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint" rel="nofollow">JSLint</a> you could use.</p>

<p>If you're using Visual Studio, you could also give <a href="http://jslint.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">JSLint.VS</a> a try for better integration.</p>
