<p>I'm not sure if I understood your problem, but it looks like you just need to overwrite the padding for when the browser is less than 768 pixels.</p>

<p>To do this, you just need to add, at the end of your main css (or in a new one, but called after the other one):</p>

<pre><code>@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
   .columns.eight.offset-two {
   padding: 6%;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means that this style will only be applied <strong>if</strong> the browser is smaller than 768px, and once it gets bigger, it will bring back the 'default' padding for your element. You don't need to specify the padding again for bigger resolutions,l because the second the browser gets past the number, it completely forgets about the media query (it's like it doesn't exist anymore). The only thing you need to keep in mind is, unless you set another smaller media query after this one, it will apply the 6% to all smaller sizes. </p>

<p>It's important that you keep your media queries at the end, because css is read from top to bottom, and the last style read will be the last applied.</p>
