<p>Unfortunately it's not supported neither in V2008 nor in VS2010 :(</p>

<p>I'm not sure about particular reason, but most likely because there weren't enough requests to implement it from customers both internally and externally of Microsoft.</p>

<p>We might consider implementing it in VS.next though. It would help if you file it as a bug on Microsoft Connect (<a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio" rel="nofollow">http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio</a>) - then (provided there is a real demand for this feature) people would vote for it creating a pressure on Microsoft to implement it.</p>
