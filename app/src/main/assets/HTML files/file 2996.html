<p>I don't think you can do a deep-copy per se, as the pointers will have a memory address assigned to the pointers, the best way I can think of a deep-copy is to simply allocate a new graph structure and copy the data (not pointers) and build it up from there by <code>malloc</code>ing the new pointers and adjust the pointers in the <code>ex_node</code> structure. That would be a more thorough solution...</p>

<p>Hope this helps,
Best regards,
