<p>By default, Oracle isn't going to track this sort of thing.  You would need some sort of audit table, a column in the table, an audit log, etc. to properly retrieve this sort of information.</p>

<p>Assuming that you are using a reasonably recent version of Oracle (10.2 or later, certainly), the <code>ORA_ROWSCN</code> pseudocolumn may be close enough.  This is an upper bound on the system change number (SCN) that the row was last modified.  Unless the table was built with <code>ROWDEPENDENCIES</code> enabled, however, the <code>ORA_ROWSCN</code> is only tracked at the block level, not at the row level.  That may be close enough if you assume that all rows in a block are inserted at roughly the same point in time.  Of course, that is not going to be perfect-- particularly in the case where rows were deleted from a block and a subsequent insert at a much later point in time filled up the space that <code>DELETE</code> operation freed up.  If you happen to get really lucky, though, the table was built with <code>ROWDEPENDENCIES</code> enabled and <code>ORA_ROWSCN</code> will give you the SCN where the row was last modified (inserted or updated).</p>

<p>The <code>SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP</code> function can be used to convert an SCN to a timestamp but only for a relatively limited period of time (generally a matter of days) and with a limited level of granularity (+/- either 5 minutes or 3 seconds depending on the Oracle version).  That's used in most of the examples of using the <code>ORA_ROWSCN</code> but, unfortunately, probably isn't going to be terribly helpful for you.</p>
