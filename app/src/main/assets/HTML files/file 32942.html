<p>Assuming you know the name of the EXE the service uses <strong>and</strong> there is exactly one of them:</p>

<pre><code>int procID = Process.GetProcessesByName("yourservice.exe")[0].Id;
</code></pre>

<p>The method <code>Process.GetProcessesByName("yourservice.exe")</code> returns an Array of Processes with your specified name, so in case you don't know how much of <code>"yourservice.exe"</code> runs simultaniously you might need a foreach loop.</p>
