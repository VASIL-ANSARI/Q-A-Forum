<p>This plugin doesn't actually submit a form. You'll need to add a bit of code to the .ajaxForm callback function to cause an event in GTM. Add the following line to your callback:</p>

<pre><code>dataLayer.push({'event': 'my_event_name'});
</code></pre>

<p>This will push an event to your dataLayer. You will also need a rule to detect the event and a Google Analytics event tag to send the event to Google Analytics. Substitute an appropriate event name for my_event_name in the code above.</p>
