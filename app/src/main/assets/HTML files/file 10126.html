<p>What about calling InvalidateArrange(); or InvalidateVisual(); I can't recall which of those functions are available for Canvas vs Panel and Silverlight vs WPF, but I know some of them are.</p>

<p>If Canvas doesn't offer what the appropriate invalidation method, you can always inherit panel and create your own "Canvas" and override InvalidateArrange() to do what you need.</p>
