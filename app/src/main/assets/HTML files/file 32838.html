<p>This is precisely what PHP's <a href="http://www.php.net/money_format" rel="nofollow">money_format</a> function is for. (As an added bonus it'll use your current system locale to add commas/period delimiters as required.)</p>

<p>N.B.: I don't believe it's available on Windows. (At least according to the docs.)</p>
