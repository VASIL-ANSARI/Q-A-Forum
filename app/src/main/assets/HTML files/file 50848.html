<p>try using <code>delegate</code></p>

<pre><code>$(document).on('beforeItemRemove', 'input', function(event) {
   // event.item: contains the item
   // event.cancel: set to true to prevent the item getting removed
});
</code></pre>

<p>though, I just went to the link you provided, attached your handler in the developer console and <code>destroy</code> / <code>initialzer</code> and it only fired once for me. Therefore it could be something else in your code which is causing you the issue.</p>
