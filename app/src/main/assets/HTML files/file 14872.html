<p>There is a bit missing from your plan. The 'bluetooh chip' needs a controller that tells it how to behave.<br> This would normally mean some sort of microcontroller, but there are Soc (system on chip) that include all of the radio, bluetooth stack and controller on one device.<br>
There are bluetooth modules that include both the bluetooth and the controller and you can sometimes change the firmware on it to tailor it to some bespoke task like yours.<br></p>

<p>Secondly there is the problem of when you 'turn it off' how do you turn it back on?<br>
I assume the device would have a battery?<br>
When you add a battery to a design you have to consider low power design and battery charge management.<br>
Of course you also need the additional electronics to handle the battery.</p>

<p>Start by trying to find a development kit or evaluation board that has all the parts you need.  I've not spent time studying it's documentation, but something like this <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/cc2541emk" rel="nofollow">Texas Instruments CC2541</a></p>
