<p><strong>EU::MM does not know how to create executable</strong>. If you need to do this, you will need to take into account various compiler toolchains. I've done this at least <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/LEONT/App-a2p-1.007/Makefile.PL#L77" rel="nofollow">once</a>, but I don't claim it's completely portable (just portable enough).</p>

<p>A long term solution would be a proper compilation framework, I've been working on that but it's fairly non-trivial.</p>
