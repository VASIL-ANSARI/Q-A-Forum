<p>Attachments are BASE64 encoded, so they actually take up more space than you think.  If you look at any binary file, for example, a JPG, the attached size is a lot bigger than the file would be on disk. The larger size is actually quite accurate, that's the actual number of bytes that the attachment takes up while in attachment form.</p>

<p>Once downloaded, the attachment will of course no longer be in BASE64 (or similar) format, and will once again be the exact size it is supposed to be.</p>

<p>From what I can tell looking at email formats, there's no easy way to retrieve the size of the attachment without decoding the BASE64 string first.</p>
