<p>Well, suppose it was the other way round. It sounds sensible to decrypt-while-writing to a file, but the data still has to come from somewhere.  </p>

<p>Meaning you would need a <code>Stream.CopyTo()</code> and the occasional MemoryStream. And those are the tools you can use now as well. </p>

<p>The choice may have been slightly arbitrary but you need to pick a direction, and encrypt-while-writing seems (to me) the most natural. </p>
