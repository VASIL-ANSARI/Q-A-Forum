<p>It must be something related to your exchange server. there are transport rules in exchange which define how you can communicate with the outside world. </p>

<p>you must be getting some exception while sending email to outside network</p>

<pre><code>System.Net.Mail.SmtpFailedRecipientException: Mailbox unavailable. The server response was: 5.1.1 User unknown
   at System.Net.Mail.SmtpTransport.SendMail(MailAddress sender, MailAddressCollection recipients, String deliveryNotify, SmtpFailedRecipientException&amp; exception)
</code></pre>

<p>If this is error you are getting this mean your exchange is not supported to send email directly to outside network. as I am no MS exchange expert but i have been using a exchange server configured in my network that can't send email to outside network but we enable email forwarding to contacts. </p>

<p>May be this can help you. <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/configuring-exchange-2007-send-connectors.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petri.co.il/configuring-exchange-2007-send-connectors.htm</a></p>
