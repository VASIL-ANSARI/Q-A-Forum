<p>To do this you may need to change the structure of your table some, or change how you use the 'status' column.</p>

<p>Here is a potential solution which proposes a change to the table structure, but I can't be sure if it will work (or even be relevant) without more information:</p>

<hr>

<p>Right now your message table only has a <strong>'Status'</strong> column, what it really needs is a <strong>'Status Sender'</strong> column and additionally a <strong>'Status Receiver'</strong> column.</p>

<p>When the sender deletes the message <strong>set the 'Status Sender' value to 'dead'</strong>, and when the receiver deletes the message <strong>set the 'Status Receiver' to 'dead'</strong></p>

<p>This means when you are displaying <strong>messages in a users inbox</strong> that you need to query for <strong>'Status Reciever' = 'alive'</strong>, and when you are displaying <strong>messages in a users sent folder</strong>, you need to query for <strong>'Status Sender' = 'alive'</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Note: This design doesn't bode well for scenarios where a single user sends a message to multiple recipients.</em> </p>
