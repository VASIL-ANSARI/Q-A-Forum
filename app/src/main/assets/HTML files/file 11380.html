<p><strong>You already answered your own question</strong>: the <code>if</code> statement in your PHP code is not being triggered, which automatically implies that <code>$_GET['id']</code> is not set.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://api.jquery.com/load/" rel="nofollow">jQuery documentation on <code>.load()</code></a> is quite clear on this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise,
  GET is assumed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you are supplying <code>id</code> as an object, it will be available in <code>$_POST</code>.</p>
