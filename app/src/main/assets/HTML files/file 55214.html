<p>Ive seen it happen a few times on some websites but mainly when
A. the site is slow, so it takes the server time to feed the font depending on when the thing is being requested</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>B. the font itself is heavy.</p>

<p>You can maybe try putting the @font face, as high up as possible so it can start loading faster and also, try the google CDN for the roboto font.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto</a></p>

<p>Technically, once a persons computer downloads the font, it should stay there in cache/memory</p>

<p>Also, try a "fallback" font that is similar to the roboto one so it shows while roboto is loading.</p>
