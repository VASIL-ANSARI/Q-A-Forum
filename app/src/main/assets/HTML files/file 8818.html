<p>Keep images away from hitting PHP through either Apache/nginx. Will slow down the number of requests you can handle a lot.</p>

<p>If you want to handle it through routes.ini then you can use a regular expression based route type <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html" rel="nofollow">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.router.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>The RegExp you would need is - image-[a-z]*. Put this with the example they have given in the docs. The matched string can be put in a variable using which you can find out which image to display.</p>

<p>Still would advise against this. Would kill the server.</p>
