<li><p>No you should not be initializing your controller, this exactly what IoC and Ninject are for. When you initialize your view/form, Ninject should make the view fetch the controller it depends on, which will auto fetch controllers it depends on and so on.<br>
Of course this won't work like you've set it up right now. For starters, your view needs to know the controller it depends on.</p>

<pre><code>public partial class ApplicationShellView : Form, IApplicationShellView
{
    private IApplicationShellController _controller;

    public ApplicationShellView()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        init();

        //InitializeView()
    }

    private void init() {
        _controller = NinjectProgram.Kernel.Get&lt;IApplicationShellController&gt;();
        //Because your view knows the controller you can always pass himself as parameter or even use setter to inject
        //For example:  _controller.SetView1(this);
    }

    public void InitializeView()
    {
        dockPanel.Theme = vS2012LightTheme;
    }
}

public class ApplicationShellController : IApplicationShellController
{

    //Implementes functionality for the MainForm.

    public ApplicationShellController()
    {
        //Also possible to add other controllers with DI
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This does indeed look like a Service Locator, simply initializing your view should do be sufficient.</p>

<pre><code>public class NinjectProgram
{
    //Gets the inject kernal for the program.
    public static IKernel Kernel { get; protected set; }
}

public class Program : NinjectProgram
{
    [STAThread]
    private static void Main()
    {
        Kernel = new StandardKernel();
        Kernel.Load(new ApplicationModule());

        Application.Run(new ApplicationShellView());
    }
}

public class ApplicationModule : NinjectModule
{
    public override void Load()
    {
        //Here is where we define what implementations map to what interfaces.
        Bind&lt;IApplicationShellController&gt;().To&lt;ApplicationShellController&gt;();

        //We can also load other modules this project depends on.
        Kernel.Load(new NinjectModule());
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Don't try and make it too complicated, a good start is important but you can always apply changes when and where needed during development.</p></li>

<p>I believe the following GitHub project might be a good starting point: <a href="https://gist.github.com/dkellycollins/9c3fecaedd830094d7f2" rel="nofollow">Example of how you might use Ninject within a WinForms application.</a></p>

<p>If you have any more questions, just leave a comment and I'll try to answer them as soon as possible</p>
