<p>I think you should run Powershell script for such case, as you want to stop the process which is self as I understand. Meaning that after stop, your process will be killed and no update can be performed. With power shell you could stop process, copy over files and start over</p>

<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
Stop-WebSite 'Default Web Site'
#... copy files here
Start-WebSite 'Default Web Site'
</code></pre>
