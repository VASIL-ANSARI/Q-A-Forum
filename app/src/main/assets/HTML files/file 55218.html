<p>Change you for-loop to this:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; pics1.Length; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>That might already do the trick. If you check pics1[900] it will not return null, but it will throw the IndexOutOfRangeException, that is why you want to check for existing indices beforehand. Of course within the valid range pic1[i] may return null, if the index is defined, but no element was assigned.</p>
