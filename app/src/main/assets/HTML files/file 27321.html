<p>Since you have opted to use jquery (which I think may be the greatest invention of the computing age :) ), this is relatively easy.</p>

<p>You'll want to use the post command, which will post back to your app using AJAX.  So, in your case the coffeescript would be $('#player1').click -> $.post(route, data, success method, datatype) per <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/" rel="nofollow">the JQuery docs</a></p>

<p>The success method can then take the return data and deal with it.  If your html changes at this point, you can return html and replace the appropriate chunk of html with JQuery.  You can also return JSON, XML, etc. as you wish.  I think in this case it sounds like returning a chunk of html may be appropriate.  You'll need an appropriate view to render to do it.</p>
