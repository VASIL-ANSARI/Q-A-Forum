<p>You should simply be able to clear the floats:</p>

<pre><code>.col:nth-child(4) {
  clear: left;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to support older browsers, use this selector instead:</p>

<pre><code>.col1 + .col + .col + .col {
  clear: left;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need your 5th and 6th columns to be flush with the bottom borders of your 2nd and 3rd columns respectively, though, you can't achieve it with floats alone. You'll need to find another way around it, or use something like <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com" rel="nofollow">jQuery Masonry</a> to lay out your page.</p>

<p>The only possible reason why your 6th column isn't sticking up to your 1st column is because it's wrapping to a new line, and according to the float model a box cannot be higher than the bottom of its preceding floated boxes.</p>
