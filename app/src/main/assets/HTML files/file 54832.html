<p>You are using <code>auto-delete</code> queues, which means that if all consumers go down queue will be deleted automatically. Then another channel can recreate queue with same name.
So if you are creating queues with same names you can make sure it's bound avery time when created. Or you can add expiration TTL for auto-deleting queues to wait for some time before deletion (to allow another channel to start consuming).</p>
