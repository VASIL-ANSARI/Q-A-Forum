<p>You are saving only line vertexes in your code, missing all pixels between them:</p>

<pre><code>image1Pixel[currX][currY] = 1; // line vertex
G.drawLine(prevX, prevY, currX, currY); // this draws a whole line, no just two vertex points
</code></pre>

<p>You need to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>interpolate all pixels on that line. E.g., popular algorithm is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm" rel="nofollow">Bresenham's</a> </li>
<li>or get an image and read pixel color directly from it</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, note that lines don't cover single pixels (except exactly vertical or horizontal ones). So second option will work better for you, because you will not repeat drawing math after graphical library.</p>
