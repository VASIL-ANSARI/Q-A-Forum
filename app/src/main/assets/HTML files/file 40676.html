<p>You are missing a closing paren so you get an error each time, you should use <code>with</code> to open your file:</p>

<pre><code>with open("stuff.txt", "w") as f: # closes your file automatically
    f.write("Hello 1.\n")
    f.write("How are you? 2.\n")
    f.write("Goodbye 3.\n") # missing closing paren
</code></pre>
