<p>Ended up solving this by accident by using the Self-Executing Anonymous Functions pattern, as explained in <a href="http://enterprisejquery.com/2010/10/how-good-c-habits-can-encourage-bad-javascript-habits-part-1/" rel="nofollow">this article</a>.</p>

<p>I assume there must have been a naming conflict when I opened facebox, which was resolved once I put all my functions and members in their own namespace (using the aforementioned pattern).</p>
