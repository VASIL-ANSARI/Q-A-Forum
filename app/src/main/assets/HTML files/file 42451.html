<p>Javascript and CSS should not be in a cgi-bin, which serves files (typically with <code>.cgi</code> or - in your case - <code>.py</code> extensions) as cgi <em>scripts</em>. Instead, <code>.js</code> and <code>.css</code> files are usually in the website root folder or (for a Python app) served as static files in <code>my_site_root/html/js/</code> from somewhere public-readable by the app like <code>my_app/public/</code>.</p>

<p>So your cgi-bin shouldn't serve files directly readable via a web browser, like Javascript and CSS files. XAMPP will be set up that way by default.</p>

<p>The CDN URL will <em>always</em> work because it's making an http call to an external server - it doesn't look in your locally-served XAMPP install.</p>
