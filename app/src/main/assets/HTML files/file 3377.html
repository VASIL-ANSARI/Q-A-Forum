<p>I would do this as a UNION, even if you have the same table. Assuming that you are searching in two different columns.</p>

<p><code>SELECT PartNumber AS Term FROM Parts WHERE PartNumber LIKE 'input%'</code><br>
<code>UNION</code><br>
<code>SELECT Manufaturer AS Term FROM Parts WHERE Manufactuer LIKE 'input%</code>  </p>
