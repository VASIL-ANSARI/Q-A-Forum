<p>If you are using a GridView, this is the normal behavior. </p>

<p>Actually what happens is that, when you scroll through, the elements that are not visible or which are scrolled out of the screen are destroyed or in other words nullified. The reason is memory optimization and this is done by android. </p>

<p>If you have any textview in your Grid Element, it will be loaded faster when it gets back into the screen. But for Images, the ImageLoader might take a little time to load the images from the cache into the ImageView. This is normal in my opinion. </p>

<p>If you don't want the images to be destroyed, then you will run into OutOfMemory exception for which this is much more better.</p>
