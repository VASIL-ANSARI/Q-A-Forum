<p>I don't know how you are dynamically building this table, but when I have encountered this problem in the past, I am building it as a result from a SQL query which I'm looping over.  If that's how you're doing this, then the problem is likely that there are simply no records for those combinations of values (that particular well and genotype).  The solution that I've used is to alter the database query in such a way that will always return a row for each combination (well and genotype, in this case).  You can do that with an 'open' (also called cartesian) join between the base tables.  Then, left outer join back to the table that has the data you want to display there.  If you provide some SQL, I could assist with the construction of the query.</p>
