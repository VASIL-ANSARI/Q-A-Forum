<p>Idk how your folders are structured but chances are your <code>templateUrl</code>s are pointing to the wrong place.</p>

<p>It's very likely that you don't require <code>/app/</code></p>

<p>Try just <code>templates/contact.html</code></p>

<p>Side note: you have <code>.when('/content',</code> as one of your routes instead of <code>.when('/contact',</code></p>
