<p>It is unclear what is the proper relationship between customers and pets. From the functional dependencies it seams that all three entities are related 1:1, which means your first answer can work as long as the foreign keys are also unique (to prevent 1:N).</p>

<p>The second answer satisfies all three requirements for 3NF</p>

<ul>
<li>every field functionally depends on the key </li>
<li>the whole key (no composite keys)</li>
<li>and nothing but the key (no candidate keys)</li>
</ul>

<p>But I would keep the foreign keys away from the pet or customer table. Each can exist on their own and we want to avoid nulls in foreign key columns. The foreign keys belong in the transaction table because a transaction is what links a pet to a customer, regardless of the desired cardinality.</p>
