<p>You can set an EVENT in your parameter file (plain text or spfile) to force Oracle to dump a detailed trace file in the user_dump_dest, the object name might be in there, if not the SQL should be.</p>

<p>EVENT="942 trace name errorstack level 12"</p>

<p>If you are using a plain text file you need to keep all your EVENT settings on consecutive lines. Not sure how that applied to spfile.</p>
