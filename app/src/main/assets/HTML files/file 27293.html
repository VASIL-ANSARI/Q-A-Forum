<p>There is no obvious answer given the information you provided.</p>

<p>You described query patterns in terms of tables, joins, foreign keys. At first, I'd advice to think if it is possible to do data embedding, rather than referencing as between tables.</p>

<p>For our project early stage we've chosen mongodb and despite we're moving some things to Cassandra now, I really don't regret about making this choice.</p>

<p>Mongo is really simple, flexible. Very easy for development, applying schema changes, querying. It forgives a lot. I'd say it is nearly priceless for NoSQL newcomers.</p>

<p>Cassandra is much more advanced. It requires more thinking about schema design and query patterns. Horizontal scalability is one of the best in NoSQL market. Cassandra has a big advantage in write operations as well.</p>

<p>Many Mongodb users come two Cassandra then. But only in case there are real performance and scalability reasons</p>

<p>But since you are going to have single-machine installation - mongodb might be enough. It has a very good read-performance while data fits the RAM.</p>

<p>Both of these databases have well-supported drivers.</p>

<p>For Cassandra it's worth referring to new Datastax driver</p>

  <p>I know it's not necessary to use a NoSQL database in this small
  project, but I really want to try and learn one recently.</p>

<p>I'd recommend Mongodb then...</p>
