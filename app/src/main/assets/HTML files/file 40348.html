<p>You are only reading in one line with the method <code>readLine</code>. You need to loop over the file until you reach the end. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));

while (in.ready()) {
  String s = in.readLine();
  System.out.println(s);
}
in.close();
</code></pre>
