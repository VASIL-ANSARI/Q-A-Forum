<p>I come from a .net background - not a Java one, so I'm afraid I can't help you with Java specifics.</p>

    <p>The business logic layer has to be invoked somehow, right? So is the expectation that the implementation of the data-api (data-jdo, or something else depending on experimentation) is provided (appropriate to say/do injected?) by the invoker?</p>

<p>Yes.  In the .Net world I use a Factory (as in an instance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern" rel="nofollow">Factory Pattern</a>) that dynamically returns the data provider implementation (which one of those to use is set by config).  The data provider is returned by the factory as an 'object' and it's up to the calling business logic code to cast it to the correct type - as specificed by the interface that the business logic is working against.</p>

<p>I'v egot (another!) article on <a href="http://www.morphological.geek.nz/blogs/viewpost/Peruse+Muse+Infuse/An+Introduction+to+Dependency+Inversion.aspx" rel="nofollow">Dependency Injection</a> for .Net which might help explain with some of the issues, but I'm sure there are good java based ones around somewhere.</p>

    <p>Should I be using some framework like Spring to allow me to choose which implementation of my data-api is used, via XML?</p>

<p>Probably.  I'd say spend your time getting to grips with the concepts first, worry about "best practice" after that.  FYI, I learnt AJAX the hard way - by writting all the code myself.  These days I'd run straight to a good framework, but I only think I have the confidence to do that after having really grokked the basics by doing some hard graft at the coal-face :)</p>

<p>Yeah - it's <strong>never</strong>.  Use a Factory.</p>
