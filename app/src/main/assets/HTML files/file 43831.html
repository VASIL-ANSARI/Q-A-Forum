<p>You aren't passing a filename to the Document constructor, so its creating a new document with no info in it.  So it has no header.  And if you're reading in a pdf file to convert it to an image, you shouldn't need a pdf writer at all.  Your code is just really confused.  </p>

<p>Get rid of the Document and all mentions of PdfWriter.  Just do the parts with PdfReader</p>
