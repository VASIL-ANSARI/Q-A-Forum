<p>Can't you just make the image float left?  Or am I missing something from your question?</p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cGQ6K/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/cGQ6K/</a></p>

<p>edit- or did you want the image to disappear if there's an overflow on the paragraph or something like that?</p>

<p>edit2-after adding more text to my paragraph in my jsfiddle I think I know what you mean now...I'll try to work out a solution</p>

<p>edit3 - here is the solution you want : <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cGQ6K/7/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/cGQ6K/7/</a> It uses a little hack though.</p>
