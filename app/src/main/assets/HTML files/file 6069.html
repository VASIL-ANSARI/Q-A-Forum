<li>On the right, in the Actions pane, click Import Rules. </li>
<li>Copy your mod_rewrite rules and paste them into the Rewrite rules text box.</li>
<li>The Tree View tab of the Converted Rules box instantly shows the result of the conversion. You can also click the XML View tab to see how the rules are stored in the Web.config file.</li>
</ol>
