<li>Don't use java.awt.Canvas. Use a JPanel instead.</li>
<li>Draw in the JPanel's paintComponent method.</li>
<li>Don't forget to call your super's painting method which for <code>paintComponent</code> would be  <code>super.paintComponent(graphics)</code></li>
<li><strong>Never</strong> try to read in an image from within any painting method. That will slow down painting and make your program seem unresponsive. Why keep reading in the same image over and over again anyway? Read it in <strong>once</strong> and save it to a variable.</li>
</ol>
