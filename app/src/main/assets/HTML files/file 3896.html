<p>Use open mode <code>"r+"</code> (reading and writing). 7.19.5.3/4 of the C99 standard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opening a ï¬le with read mode ('r' as
  the ï¬rst character in the mode
  argument) fails if the ï¬le does not
  exist or cannot be read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means you need read permission on the file, though.</p>

<p>Failing that if you're on POSIX you can use <code>open</code> to open the file, then <code>fdopen</code> to get a <code>FILE*</code> for the resulting file descriptor.</p>
