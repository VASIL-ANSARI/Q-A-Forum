<p>If you want to perform some operation on the matched result, then you have to use an extra <code>StringBuffer</code> for that, and <code>Matcher.appendReplacement()</code> method.</p>

<p>You can however achieve this without that too:</p>

<pre><code>String result = "a b c d e f".replaceAll("(\\w) (\\w)", "$1$2");
</code></pre>
