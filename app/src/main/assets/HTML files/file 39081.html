  <p>Can MyBatis create the database schema?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm afraid not. In order to do that you need an ORM and MyBatis is not an ORM.</p>

<p>With an ORM solution (like Hibernate for example) you map tables to entities. The entity is the (object) representation of the (relational) table and contains all the metadata (getters/setters, annotations etc) necessary to create the table.</p>

<p>MyBatis does not map entities to tables, it maps methods to SQL statements. There is no way to determine from the methods or the SQL statements what the structure of the database should be. When you use MyBatis the tables must already exist.</p>
