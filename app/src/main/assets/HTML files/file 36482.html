<p><strong>**   When system calls GC? What GC in android counts as not needed?   **</strong></p>

<p>There are at least 5 different ways a garbage collector is called in android one of the common and I know you always see this when you look at the <code>logcat</code> is</p>

<pre><code>GC_CUNCURRENT
</code></pre>

<p>it is a <code>concurrent collection</code> that is triggered when the heap start to fill up.</p>

<pre><code>GC_FOR_MALLOC
</code></pre>

<p>it is called when <code>GC_CUNCURRENT</code> was not able to completed in time and that the heap is full and also device need to allocate more memory then this is triggered, the garbage collection directly  executed.</p>

<pre><code>GC_EXTERNAL_ALLOC
</code></pre>

<p>this is only called in <code>API below HONEYCOMB</code> where it is triggered when you release memory to the Bitmap pixel data by calling <code>recycle()</code> method of it.</p>

<pre><code>GC_HPROF_DUMP_HEAP
</code></pre>

<p>this is called when you create an <strong>hprof</strong> file from the <code>DDMS</code> for <code>memory analyzation</code> or locating the <code>memory leak</code>.</p>

<pre><code>GC_IMPLICIT
</code></pre>

<p>now this is called when you are calling the garbage collector itself through <code>System.gc()</code>, <strong>Beware:</strong> avoid calling this and that you should trust the <code>garbage collector</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Why GC skips bitmaps?</strong></p>

<p>That is because you need to implicitly call the recycle method of the Bitmap to call the garbage collector to recycle the bitmap pixel data of it. Every bitmap from <code>HONEY and above</code> are store in the <code>dalvik heap</code>.</p>

<p><strong>What does GC do with not needed object?</strong></p>

<p>As long as the object have <code>reference</code> somewhere it wont be garbage collected and will result to memory leak, you can use DDMS to check the memory leak of your application.</p>
