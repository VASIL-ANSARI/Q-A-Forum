<p>PHP uses only associative arrays. To determine if an array <em>could be</em> an indexed array from <code>0</code> to <code>size - 1</code> eg an array where elements have been <em>pushed</em>, or added using <code>array[] = x</code>,  the only method known is to check if all keys are from <code>0</code> to <code>size - 1</code>.</p>

<p>(Note that an array could be built via the "associative" way (ie providing both keys and values), using incremental keys from <code>0</code>, and there is no way to determine that it was not built using the method given above (<em>push</em> or <code>[]</code>), since, anyway, that makes no difference)</p>

<pre><code>$i = 0;
foreach (array_keys($array) as $key) {
  if ($key !== $i) break;  // Note the !== (not !=)
  $i++;
}

if ($i == count($array)) {
  // looks like array was built using indexing (see text above)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The final test <code>$i == count($array)</code>, if true, indicates that all keys where numeric, starting from 0, incremented by 1 for each element, until the last element.</p>
