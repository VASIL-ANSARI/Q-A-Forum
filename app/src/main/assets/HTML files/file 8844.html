<p>As long as the compiler sees the declaration of the method <code>run</code> prior to the call of the method, you will not see that error.</p>

<p>Usually, private categories are done like:</p>

<pre><code>#import "M.h"
@interface M(PrivateGunk)
.... declarations here ...
@end

@implementation M
@end

@implementation M(PrivateGunk)
.... impl here ...
@end
</code></pre>

<p>Though many of us have moved to sticking the private stuff in a class extension at the top of the file, which also allows for @properties, ivars, etc....</p>
