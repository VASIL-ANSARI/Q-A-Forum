<p>The <code>Fragment[State]PagerAdapter</code> uses the activities <code>FragmentManager</code> - or in case of a nested <code>ViewPager</code> in a parent fragment - that fragment's child <code>FragmentManager</code> to manage the fragments, just like normal fragments would do. Really, the only thing that these adapter implementations do is that they hide the nasty <code>FragmentTransaction</code> stuff for you.</p>

<p>I had never problems that particular lifecycle callbacks weren't called for me in my fragments, so I cannot say anything about that. One thing however that is important to understand and that many people get wrong is that the adapter's <code>getItem()</code> method is called only when a fragment is freshly created; if it is restored from a saved state this method is not called again and people tend to do all fancy things there to initialize their just "created" fragment, while they should really look into <code>instantiateItem()</code>, which either returns the instance you give the adapter via <code>getItem()</code> or returns the reference of the fragment that was automatically re-created for you.</p>

<p>Another thing that is good to know about fragments in pager is the method <code>setUserVisibleHint(boolean)</code>. Since fragments are usually recreated and resumed all at once (non-state adapter) or on demand (state adapter), its usually important to know when one instance is actually visible to the user. This can be achieved by overriding the aforementioned method in a custom fragment.</p>
