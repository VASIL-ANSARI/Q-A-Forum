<p>You show no code in your question, in a comment you state you have a <code>responseObject</code> but not how you came by it.</p>

<p>The JSON you are getting from somewhere will be text, you may have it as an <code>NSString</code>, <code>NSData</code>, an <code>NSArray</code> whose elements are these, etc.</p>

<p>You need to obtain that text and then parse it as JSON, the <code>NSJSONSerialization</code> class will handle the parsing for you, the first line of its description states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You use the NSJSONSerialization class to convert JSON to Foundation objects and convert Foundation objects to JSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have those Foundation objects - arrays, dictionaries, strings, numbers, etc. you can extract the fields you are interested in.</p>

<p>Once you've written some code to do this if it doesn't work and you are stuck ask a new question showing your code and someone will probably be able to help you further.</p>

<p>HTH</p>
