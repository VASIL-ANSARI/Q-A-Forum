<p>It has nothing to do with RoR; the various brackets are Ruby language constructs.</p>

<p><code>[]</code> is the array operator, for arrays and other classes that implement it (like a string taking a range to get substrings, or hashes to look up a key's value):</p>

<pre><code>a = [1, 2, 3]
a.each { |n| puts n }

s = "ohai"
puts s[1..-1]

h = { foo: "bar", baz: "plugh" }
puts h[:foo]
</code></pre>

<p><code>{}</code> is for hashes, and one of two ways of delimiting blocks (the other being <code>begin</code>/<code>end</code>). (And used with <code>#</code> for string interpolation.)</p>

<pre><code>h = { foo: "bar", baz: "plugh" }
h.each { |k, v| puts "#{k} == #{v}" }
</code></pre>

<p><code>()</code> is for method parameters, or for enforcing evaluation order in an expression.</p>

<pre><code> &gt; puts 5 * 3 + 5     # Normal precedence has * ahead of +
=&gt; 20
 &gt; puts 5 * (3 + 5)   # Force 3+5 to be evaluated first
=&gt; 40

def foo(s)
  puts(s)
end
</code></pre>

<p>They're sometimes optional if the statement has no ambiguity:</p>

<pre><code>def foo s
  puts s
end
</code></pre>

<p>(They're not <em>always</em> optional, and putting a space between the method call and its parenthetical parameter list can cause issues--best not to, IMO.)</p>

<p><em>(I probably missed something, too, but there's the nutshell.)</em></p>
