<p>Okay so i've found a solution but pretty sure its not the correct way as its not very elegant. Any suggestions for improvements welcome. I set explode $gift variable into an array and then produce several OR LIKE statements with wildcards to match. Lookily there are only 9 options in my multiselect box as this method would soon become tedious.</p>

<p>CODE:
RESULTS.PHP</p>

<pre><code>$gift=$_GET['gift'];
$gift=str_replace("\\","",$gift);
$gift=str_replace("'","%",$gift);
$gift=explode(",",$gift);

$sql= "SELECT * 
FROM $productstable 
WHERE gift LIKE '$gift[0]' 
OR gift LIKE '$gift[1]' 
OR gift LIKE '$gift[2]' 
OR gift LIKE '$gift[3]' 
OR gift LIKE '$gift[4]' 
OR gift LIKE '$gift[5]' 
OR gift LIKE '$gift[6]' 
OR gift LIKE '$gift[7]' 
OR gift LIKE '$gift[8]'
OR gift LIKE '$gift[9]'";

$result = mysql_query($sql) or die ('Unable to run query:'.mysql_error());
while($item = mysql_fetch_array($result))
{
code to view products here
}
&lt;? } mysql_close()  ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Not liking this method at all really as thought IN was supposed to do the same but just couldnt get it to work. Would this have negative implications with speed?</p>

<p>Also going to recode this using PDO later.</p>
