<p>Since <code>data</code> is a reference, you must initialize it at constructor initializer:</p>

<pre><code>AVLNode(T &amp; newData): data(newData) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>You may find this post useful: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12890438/reference-varable-with-error-must-be-initialized-in-constructor-base-member-ini">reference member variable must be initialized at constructor initialization list</a>. You may also need to understand the difference between <strong><code>initialization</code></strong> and <strong><code>assignment</code></strong> when you write a class's constructor. </p>

<p>Quoting from C++ Primer pp455:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some members must be initialized in the constructor initializer. For such members, assigning to them in the constructor body doesn't work. Members of a class type that do not have default constructor and members that are <strong>const or reference types must be initialized in the constructor initializer regardless of type.</strong></p>
