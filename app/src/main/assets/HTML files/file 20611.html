<p>In general, list comprehension (the second way) is faster than the for loop. I forgot the reason for it. </p>

<p>Also, if your have a large data set, using xrange() is faster than range() because xrange() returns a small generator, which generates data on the fly. Whereas range() returns the whole list [0 .. 300,000].</p>

<p>Finally, you should consider doing away with range(), xrange() altogether:</p>

<pre><code>dataset = [[word.replace('\n','').replace('"','') for word in line] for line in dataset]
</code></pre>

<p>Doing it this way is cleaner and should be faster, because you don't deal with array subscription, which takes time.</p>
