<p>You may find you can improve performance by inserting rows several at a time. Try this syntax:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO
    tbl_name (a,b,c)
    VALUES(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(7,8,9)
;
</code></pre>

<p>The number of rows you should group together will be best found by experimentation. It might be that the more you add in the one statement, the faster it will be, but equally that might be slow if you don't have auto-commit turned on.</p>

<p>As someone mentions in the comments, putting too many in at once may max out the CPU, and raise the eyebrows of the server admin. If this is something you need to be careful with on your host, try 200 at a time and then a small <code>usleep</code> between iterations.</p>

<p>It's worth looking at the connection to your database too - is this on the same server, or is it on another server? The connection may be slow. Add some timing for, say, how long 5,000 rows take to insert, and then play around to see how to reduce it.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/insert.html" rel="nofollow">manual reference</a> for <code>INSERT</code>; note that this is non-standard SQL, and it won't work on other database engines.</p>
