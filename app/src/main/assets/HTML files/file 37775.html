<p>I think this has probably been answered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2461522/how-do-i-perform-an-accent-insensitive-compare-e-with-%C3%A8-%C3%A9-%C3%AA-and-%C3%AB-in-sql-ser">here</a> but I'll re-iterate what's in there.</p>

<p>You should be able to force the comparison within a case-insensitive collation.</p>

<p>If you do a query like below (not sure of your schema)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE
event_name COLLATE Latin1_general_CI_AI Like '%eve%' COLLATE Latin1_general_CI_AI
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>Ã©vÃ©nement</code> will come back.</p>

<p>You won't be able to search for translations, however (as that isn't really a SQL issue) so the other thing you could do is keep a table of translations and lookup via that table.</p>
