<p>You just need to check if the collection exists I found this bit of code after a brief google. You need to use it to put an if clause around your create + insert so that it'll only insert if that collection doesn't already exist.</p>

<pre><code>public function collection_exists($collection){

    if ($this-&gt;db-&gt;system-&gt;namespaces-&gt;findOne(array('name'=&gt;'eI_db.'.$collection)) === null){
        return false;
    }
    return true;

}
</code></pre>

<p>where $this->db is the currently referenced database.  You may have to tweak it to test with your setup.</p>

<p>There's also some mongo wrapper libraries which may be of use to you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mongodb-morph/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/mongodb-morph/</a></p>
