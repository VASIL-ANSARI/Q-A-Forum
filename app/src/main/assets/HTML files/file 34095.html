<p>You can access the property <code>playing</code> directly on main thread because the operation is read, so it is safe I think :)</p>

<p>But you can't use it to judge if playback has completed as document says : <strong>Important: Do not poll this property to determine when playback has completed, instead implement the specified delegate method</strong></p>

<p>You should use delegate and implement the method <code>- (void)audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying:(AVAudioPlayer *)player successfully:(BOOL)flag</code>, if the method is called, it means the player  stop.</p>
