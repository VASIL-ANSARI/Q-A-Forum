<p>I found on <a href="http://taylor.fausak.me/2012/09/20/iphone-5-web-app-startup-image/">this post</a> that all that is required is that you remove <code>width=device-width</code> from the viewport meta tag. The blog talks about specifying a startup image, but this appears to be optional. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Original source of answer is <a href="http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/iphone-5-ios-6-html5-developers">Max Firtman</a>. He indicates it may be a bug as well (see comments), but for now, this solution works.</p>
