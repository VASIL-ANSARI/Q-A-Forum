<p>Your approach is not ideal.</p>

<p>For quad painting, you should iterate through the quadtree using a copy of your standard search function, inside that method you know the quad nodes rectangle.
Then transform that rectangle to a screen rectangle.</p>

<p>drawing the quadtree often shows errors in the quad tree orde itself. (exchanging S with N, East with West, messing up the what you call NE;NW, etc.</p>

<p>The quadtree search function will still work even when you (consistently) exchanged S with W, etc.</p>

<p>I still do not understand why (w,y,w,y) should paint NW. I think this is wrong.
if x,y denotes the SW corner of a quad node, then NW child should be: (x,y+w/2,w/2,h/2)</p>
