<p>I have solved this. I created two configuration files for each modem. And then wrote a random file picker function something as trivial as below</p>

<pre><code>def randfile():
  return random.sample([gammurc1_path, gammurc2_path], 1) [0]
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the sm.ReadConfig(FileName=randfile())</p>

<p>And it's working comfortably</p>
