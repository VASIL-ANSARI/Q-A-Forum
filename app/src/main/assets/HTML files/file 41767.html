<p>The usual way that Selenium people write tests is to open a separate browser per test class, which is sorta how "Selenium Grid" is designed to operate.   I usually put one test method per test class.  If you want multiple test methods per class, and the app your testing does not care about the order you run those methods, then in theory you could run those multiple test methods on a single browser.   I've done that before but, from my experience, it is not a good idea to design Selenium tests with that pattern, and so you can do it, but I recommend against it.</p>

<p>For example, with one test method per test class, in your @BeforeMethod you can instantiate the WebDriver browser instance and then in the @AfterMethod you can kill it.   With multiple tests per class, you'd have to use @BeforeTest and @AfterTest, which can be done but your results may vary depending on how careful you are.</p>
