<p>If you are doing a common search on all the elements indexed. You should use <strong>copyField</strong> to index them to a single field and then retireve it.</p>

<p>There is something like a copy Fields in solr. Copy fields can copy your indexes to a common field. So then if you query on that field all the data will be searched.</p>

<p>You should define copy fields as</p>

<pre><code>&lt;copyField source="id" dest="text"/&gt;
&lt;copyField source="name" dest="text"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here dest stands for the destination field... check what is the default query field for your solr distribution and use it in the destination.</p>

<p>Please check your defaultsearchfield tag in schema.xml it should be</p>

<p>text</p>

<p>for this particular case.</p>

<p>Then you can search it without specifying a particular field.</p>

<p>Regarding your second doubt</p>

<p>There is a difference b/w 'P' and 'p'. Since you are using descpt as string field, it will match the exact expressions. so if you search for descpt:Phone it will work</p>
