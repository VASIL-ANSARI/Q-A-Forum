<p>This would be one way of doing it, although by no means the most efficient:</p>

<pre><code>class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   has_many :tagazations
   has_many :tags, :through =&gt; :tagazations

   def find_with_all_tags(tag_names)
     # First find the tags and join with their respective projects
     matching_tags = Tag.includes(:projects).where(:name =&gt; tag_names)
     # Find the intersection of these lists, using the ruby array intersection operator &amp;
     matching_tags.reduce([]) {|result, tag| result &amp; tag.projects}
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>There may be a couple of typos in there, but you get the idea </p>
