<p>Unless the method provides a "limit" parameter (which it doesn't) your best option is to go with a simple loop that removes the items that match, breaking when your incremented "match counter" hits your limit.</p>

<p>That's pretty much how the internal function works anyway, but in a more optimized way.</p>
