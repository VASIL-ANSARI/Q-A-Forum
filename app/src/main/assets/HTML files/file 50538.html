<p>You could do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Determine width of the map (in pixels).</li>
<li>Determine how many tiles your grid should have on this map</li>
<li>Divide the width of the map by the number of tiles</li>
<li>Hold this number</li>
<li>Divide the maximum longitude by the same number of tiles (point 2)</li>
<li>Divide the yet to place longitude by the result </li>
<li>Multiply the result of that by the number you held before</li>
</ul>

<p>ofcourse do the same for latitude</p>
