<p>I'd actually suggest:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loading the string with something like SimpleXML.</li>
<li>Removing the attributes you are interested in flushing.</li>
<li>Saving it back to a string.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a bunch of namespace issues that I'm not sure how you'd have to handle, but that will probably be cleaner/happier than trying to build one or more regex expressions and make sure you don't miss anything.</p>

<p>EDIT: turns out SimpleXML won't work (limited modification capabilities) but DOM will. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$data=&lt;&lt;&lt;END1
&lt;body itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage"&gt;
&lt;div itemprop="maincontent"&gt;content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
END1;

$xml=new DOMDocument();
$xml-&gt;loadXML($data);

// find every relevant node
$xpath = new DOMXPath($xml);
$attr = $xpath-&gt;query("//@itemscope|//@itemprop|//@itemtype");
foreach ($attr as $entry) {
  $entry-&gt;parentNode-&gt;removeAttribute($entry-&gt;nodeName);
}
echo $xml-&gt;saveXML();
</code></pre>

<p>You'd have to modify it to include all the attributes you want to remove, and like I said I have no clue how it would deal with namespaces, but its a start.</p>
