<p>You can't change an object without having a reference to that object. You don't have a reference to the object you wish to modify (the dictionary), so the answer to your question is no.</p>

<p>You can modify an object <em>in</em> a dictionary so long as it's a mutable type (for example, if a dictionary item is a list, you can change it) but the dictionary itself can't be modified.</p>
