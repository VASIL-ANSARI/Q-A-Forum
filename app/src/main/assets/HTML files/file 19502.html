<p><em>Libraries</em> don't generally have configuration files. When an application loads, the configuration it loads will be the one associated with that <em>application</em> - not the libraries within it.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> create app config files for libraries, and load them explicitly - but it's a bit of a pain. Consider exposing configuration directly in your API, and allowing the application <em>consuming</em> the library to provide the configuration appropriately.</p>
