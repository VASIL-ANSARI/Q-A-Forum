<p>I think you can try with proxy socket :</p>

<p><code>root@serverA:~# ssh root@serverB -D 1337</code></p>

<p>It'll tell ssh on serverA to listening on the <code>localhost:1337</code>, change the port <code>1337</code> to use the one of the database (like the distant) and it should be "remotely at home"...</p>
