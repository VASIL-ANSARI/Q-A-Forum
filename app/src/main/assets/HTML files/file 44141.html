<p>You're adding the pNum and newbDate Strings to another String while their still null. Then you change pNum and newbDate to hold values, but the other String won't change nor should it change. Strings are immutable, and even if they were mutable, objects dont' change by magic, you have to set the String variables with new updated data for the data to show.</p>

<p>In a nut shell this is what you're doing:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
  String foo = null;
  String bar = null;
  String baz = "foo: " + foo + "; bar: " + bar;

  foo = "FOO";
  bar = "BAR";

  System.out.println(baz);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This returns:</p>

<pre><code>foo: null; bar: null
</code></pre>

<p>Please understand that the String baz won't change by magic just because you've changed foo and bar <strong>after</strong> the fact. If you want baz to change, <strong>you</strong> need to change it when the need arises:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
  String foo = null;
  String bar = null;
  String baz = "foo: " + foo + "; bar: " + bar;

  foo = "FOO";
  bar = "BAR";

  // change baz with new data
  baz = "foo: " + foo + "; bar: " + bar;

  System.out.println(baz);  // now this works!
}
</code></pre>
