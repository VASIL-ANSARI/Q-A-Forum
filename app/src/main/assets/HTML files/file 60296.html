<p>I would consider making regular Java games to practice before diving into Android games. Look <a href="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a good start. There are plenty of others if you just search in google.</p>

<p>This forum is not meant for getting answers and tutorials to questions like that. This is for specific code problems. Hopefully this is enough to get you started.</p>
