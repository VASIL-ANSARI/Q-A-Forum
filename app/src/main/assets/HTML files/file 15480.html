<p>No; <code>inet_aton</code> and <code>inet_pton</code> are not compatible. Just look at the prototypes:</p>

<pre><code>int inet_aton(const char *, struct in_addr *);
int inet_pton(int, const char *, void *);
</code></pre>

<p>Totally different. Trying to swap one for the other will only result in pain and suffering (and a crash, most likely). If you've done this and it seems to be working, it's probably because the code which uses <code>inet_aton</code> isn't being called.</p>
