<p>The leak is caused by your autoreleasing an object without having an autorelease pool in place to take care of it. That usually happens when you're doing things apart from the main thread, via creating your own threads or just using the <code>-performSelectorInBackground:withObject:</code> convenience method. If you want to use the autorelease functionality (implied by the use of the <code>NSMutableString</code> class method here), you need to create an autorelease pool at the beginning of the block of code where you'll be using it and drain it at the end. In other words, something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)myBackgroundThing:(id)whatever
{
    NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];

    NSMutableString *srn = [NSMutableString stringwithCString:devSID];

    // etc...

    [pool release];
}
</code></pre>
