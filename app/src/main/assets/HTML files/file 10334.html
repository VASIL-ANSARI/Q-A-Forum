<p>I'd would just set <code>$CXXFLAGS</code> to <code>-I~/lib</code>, it's its job -- unless you are using the dumb makefile default configuration from mingw project, $CXXFLAGS will be recognized automagically, as long as your <code>&amp;makeprg</code> still points to <code>make</code> and not directly to g++ or any other compiler (I don't know what c.vim does with this vim setting as I don't use it).</p>

<p>As I suspect you don't have any Makefile in your directory but just a monofile project, I'd prefer an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lh-vim/source/browse/misc/trunk/plugin/let-modeline.vim" rel="nofollow">extended modeline</a> over <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/456792/vim-apply-settings-on-files-in-directory/456889#456889">project settings</a>.</p>
