  <p>I can't get that the program display all the image automatically, it only display the last image</p>

<p>You are not using Threads correctly. Invoking the run() method is not how to start a Thread. Also, the Thread.sleep() causes the Event Dispatch Thread to sleep so the GUI can't repaint itself until all the code in the loop has been executed.</p>

<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't keep an array or JLabels. Instead keep an Array of Icons. Then you just create a single label that you display on the GUI. For your animation you simple change the Icon of the label by using the <code>setIcon(...)</code> method.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't attempt to use Threads. Instead you should use a Swing Timer for the animation. You start the Timer and every time the Timer fires you change the Icon of the label. Read the section from the Swing tutorial on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html" rel="nofollow">How to Use Timers</a> for a simple animation example.</p></li>
