<p>An easy way to achieve this would be to actually start Activity A from your Notification with a flag to call Activity B instantly.</p>

<p>So you just have to put an extra to your intent you are starting in your Notification and you have to check in Activity A if this extra exists and if it exists then you start Activity B.</p>

<p>Update: another way, but in my opinion not so good, would be to override the onPause() method of your Activity B and call Activity A there. </p>
