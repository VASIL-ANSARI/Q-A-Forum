<pre><code>sizeof(data)
</code></pre>

<p>Above gives the size of <code>data</code> which is of type <code>my_data *</code>, 4 bytes on your system. To get the number of records, follow the same logic as how you allocated the memory (i.e., <code>i+1</code> records). Note that you have reassigned <code>i</code> to <strong>0</strong> in the for loop initialization expression.</p>
