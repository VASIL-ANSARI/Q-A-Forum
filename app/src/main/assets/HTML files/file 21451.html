<p>I think you will need to be aware of the Keyboard layout, I am not sure if there is some built-in function to specify the locale to the <code>Robot</code> class, but you can find an wrapper implementation for <code>Robot</code> class that support different keyboard layouts <a href="https://code.google.com/p/windowlicker/source/browse/trunk/src/core/main/com/objogate/wl/#wl/robot" rel="nofollow">see this library</a> </p>
