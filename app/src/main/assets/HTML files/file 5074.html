<p>Running a form in a form's constructor is generally going to end badly. I would separate these out, i.e. in your <code>Main()</code> method</p>

<pre><code>bool loggedIn = false;
using(var loginForm = new SignInForm()) {
    if(loginForm.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK) {
        loggedIn = true; // plus whatever else you need; maybe a "Principal"
    }
}
if(loggedIn) {
    using(var mainForm = new SomeOtherForm()) {
        Application.Run(mainForm);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would also change the login form to set the <code>DialogResult</code> appropriately.</p>
