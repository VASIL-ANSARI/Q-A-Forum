<p>You can do this with <code>strcpy()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>strcpy(arr[0], "Douglas");
</code></pre>

<p>When using <code>strcpy()</code>, you will have to ensure that there is enough space in the destination to hold the string you're putting there (plus the terminating NUL character). In this case there is, because you have allocated 12 bytes for each string and <code>"Douglas"</code> will take 8.</p>
