<p>When you use blending you need to render back-to-front. So you need to z-order your models or even triangles.
Typically you first render all opaque stuff in arbitrary order, and then blended stuff back-to-front.</p>

<p>Since all shadows have the same color, isn't that bad for you. Just render the shadows after rendering the geometry.<br/>
There are other methods for rendering shadows which look better and don't have this problem(for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_volume" rel="nofollow">marking the shadowed parts of the geometry in the stencil buffer</a>).</p>

<p>There are some techniques to render complicated alpha-blended scenes (for example "Depth peeling") which avoid the ordering problem and even work for intersecting geometry, but they are rather expensive.</p>
