<p>If you are using php (as the tag suggests), run <code>SELECT * FROM table;</code> then generate a random number based on the number of results in the query. For example:</p>

<pre><code>i = floor(random()*query.length);
</code></pre>

<p>Then seek to the record indicated <code>seek(i)</code> and viola, you have a random entry =)</p>

<p>You'll have to use your own knowledge/documentation for the exact syntax, I haven't touched PHP in a while, but the logic is sound.</p>
