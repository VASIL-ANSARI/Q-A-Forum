<p>Not sure what is wrong with your cancel selector, but your done selector is incorrect.  Should be </p>

<pre><code>@selector(emailAddressSelected:)
</code></pre>

<p>But it won't pass a NSString to your method there.  It will pass the sender which in your case is the  UIBarButtonItem.  </p>

<p>So that should be </p>

<pre><code>    -(void) emailAddressSelected:(UIBarButtonItem * )sender
</code></pre>
