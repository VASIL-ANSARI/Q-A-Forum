<p>You can use the wrapper, where you can set a theme (style) to anything in the current context. You can set R.style.MyTheme as style to the alert dialog and customize that view to your own taste.</p>

<pre><code>ContextThemeWrapper ctw = new ContextThemeWrapper( this, R.style.MyTheme );
AlertDialog.Builder builder= new AlertDialog.Builder( ctw );
</code></pre>
