<p>You don't appear to be checking the status of the user. All you are doing is initializing Facebook, you don't even know if the user is logged into Facebook or has a Facebook account. You need to call FB.getLoginStatus and check if they are "connected". If they aren't connected, there is no possible way to get an access token. If they are connected, then you get an access token.</p>
