<p>I'm the author of the <em>Cloning Internet Applications with Ruby</em> book. I tried running the code  in the GitHub repository, and barring for a few changes (due to changes in Sinatra) I can run it successfully. Perhaps you can try the answer given by Prakash Murthy, to upgrade to EventMachine 1.0.0 but I'm running the same version as you are (0.12.10) and that doesn't give me any problems.</p>

<p>If you drop me an email directly we can figure this out (and update Stack Overflow later).</p>
