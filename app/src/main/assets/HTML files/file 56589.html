<p>I think you are trying to get the path to the file that is being uploaded to the Blob Storage using standard ASP.NET methods and local context. Files uploaded to the blob will not be accessible that way.</p>

<p>Seems like you upload your blob properly. Now, if your file uploaded successfully, your method should return blockBlob.Uri.ToString(), which is the link to your file - you may store it somewhere in the database or anywhere else. </p>
