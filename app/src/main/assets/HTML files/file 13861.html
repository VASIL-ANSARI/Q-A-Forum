<p>The reason that it is <em>approximate</em> is because the number could change during the calculation; you're multi-threading. Before the calculation completes a different number of threads could now be active (A thread that was inactive when checked is now active).  </p>

<p>When you say "particular time instance" ... that doesn't really mean anything. The calculation isn't instantaneous. The number you get back is the best possible answer given the fluid/dynamic nature of the pool.  </p>

<p>If by <em>chance</em> the calculation starts and completes while none of the threads in the pool change state, then yes that number is "exact" but only until a thread in the pool changes state, which means it might only be "exact" for 1ms (or less). </p>
