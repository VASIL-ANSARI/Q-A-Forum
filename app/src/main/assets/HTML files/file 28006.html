<p>What I did was that I now created a completely new and empty WP8 project and then I copied over all the old code from the WP7 project to this new WP8 project and I then rebuilt the solution. I did no code modifications whatsoever from the version that I had when I wrote this post, I converted from a WP7 project to an WP8 and that has issues.</p>

<p><strong>Audio player is again able to play the audio files.</strong></p>

<p>So an advice to anyone with WP7 projects: Do not convert them in Visual Studio to WP8 projects as wierd things can happen. </p>
