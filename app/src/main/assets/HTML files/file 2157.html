<p>Multi-threading is definitely not a must as you have already come up with an alternative.  We can't really use absolutes like <em>always</em> or <em>never</em> as each case has unique requirements and constraints.</p>

<p>Yes, adding a new thread/socket for each connection will consume more resources.  It sounds like you need to get a good definition of how many connections you will need.  Then you can determine if you will have sufficient resources or not.</p>

<p>If the resources constraints are not a concern, I would choose the simpler solution.  Is it easier to use the tools you already have (i.e. well tested functions to handle threads and sockets) as opposed to writing a new body of functionality (the linked list suggestion)?  What about code maintenance?  If another programmer works on this project in the future, would it would be easier for them to understand an implementation with standard operating system calls they are already familiar with or a linked list?</p>
