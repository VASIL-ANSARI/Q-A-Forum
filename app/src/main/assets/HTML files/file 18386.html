<p>If I am not wrong you want indexPath of cell on button clicked.You can get the cell of that button(in button action) as follows:</p>

<pre><code>UIButton *theButton = sender;
CreatedCell *cell = (CreatedCell *)[[theButton superview] superview];
</code></pre>

<p>After getting cell, you can get indexPath of that cell as follows:</p>

<pre><code>theIndexPath = [[m_TableView indexPathForCell:cell] retain];
</code></pre>
