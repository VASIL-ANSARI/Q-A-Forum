<p>The documentation is slightly outdated. You should be able to always use the "Instance connection name" property from the SQL properties page to construct the unix socket path; just append that value after the "/cloudsql/" prefix.</p>

<p>For second generation, the connection format is project:region:name. In your example, it maps to "hello-world-123:us-central1:sqlsomething3", and the unix socket path is "/cloudsql/hello-world-123:us-central1:sqlsomething3".</p>
