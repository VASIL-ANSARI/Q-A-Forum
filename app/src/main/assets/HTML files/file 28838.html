<p>Suppose your client has 100 posts in its local cache. Then when the client inserts a new post, it's inserted directly into the client cache (so it does now contain 101 posts) and in the background it's sent to the server. The server inserts it into the real database, and then tells the client to remove one of it's cached posts, since it's supposed to only store 100 posts in it's cache. This is probably what's happening to you.</p>
