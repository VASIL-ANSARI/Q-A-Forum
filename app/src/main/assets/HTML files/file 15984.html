<p>This can be done by writing your own <code>TabbedPaneUI</code> by extending <code>BasicTabbedPaneUI</code> or <code>MetalTabbedPaneUI</code>. But this would be difficult to write.</p>

<p>I belive that you want to implement something like close button (below will work with JLabel as well)</p>

<ul>
<li>I would try to implement this button on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/rootpane.html#glasspane" rel="nofollow">GlassPane</a> and Layers</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>(if your JDialog is not resizable) you can <code>setLayout(null)</code> and provide hardcoded values for position and size of the components and add <code>JButton</code> over <code>JTabbedPane</code></li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>you can override paintComponents on your content pane and draw your own button (or provided by "fake" JButton). Next - you have to <code>setMouseListener</code> on JTabbedPane and check if mouse click position is in button's bounds. Of course - you will need to implement button visual state (pressed, hover, etc.) or just pass event to <code>faked</code> JButton instance.</li>
</ul>
