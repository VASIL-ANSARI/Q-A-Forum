<p>hope you may be able to show the first page with a single question. Now use buttons id as the next div id of the question. Let me clear you if a next button with id 2 has been clicked the next div with id 2 will be shown and remaining div &amp; buttons less then 3 or greater then 3  will be hidden. At last you may determine the last page by the id of the  last finish button can be shown.</p>
