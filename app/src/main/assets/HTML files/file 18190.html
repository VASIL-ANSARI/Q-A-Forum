<p>As <code>class B</code> <em>extends</em> <code>class A</code>, class B has every <em>protected</em> and <em>public</em> method that A has also.</p>

<p>By calling <code>B:aa()</code> the compiler looks if <code>B:aa()</code> is overridden in class B, and if not, it calls the parent class, which is class A in this case.</p>

<p>In Object Oriented Programming (OOP) extending a class is also know as inheritance, Class B inherits all the public and protected methods from class A</p>
