<p>As you can see in this fiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/UnNbv/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/UnNbv/</a> (code reproduced below), if you put the transition duration only on active pages, you will get the effect you desire.</p>

<p>Example from fiddle (animates on hover, jumps on mouse out):</p>

<pre><code>.test {
    position: relative;
    width:100px;
    height:100px;
    background:#FF0000;
}

.test:hover {
    top:10px;
    -webkit-transition: all .6s ease-in-out;
    -moz-transition: all .6s ease-in-out;
    -o-transition: all .6s ease-in-out;
    -ms-transition: all .6s ease-in-out;
    transition: all .6s ease-in-out;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To apply it to your situation, just apply the transition to the <code>.active</code> class instead of the <code>.page</code> class.</p>

<p>And to get the reverse effect (animating out but not in), you could use <code>.page:not(.active)</code> (the <code>:not</code> pseudo-class is supported by everything which supports transitions)</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If you want to have the new page slide over the top of the old page, <code>step-end</code> is your friend (I've often wondered what use it could serve; now I know!). Specifically, code like this:</p>

<pre><code>.page {
    position:absolute;
    -webkit-transition: top .6s ease-in-out;
    -moz-transition: top .6s ease-in-out;
    -o-transition: top .6s ease-in-out;
    -ms-transition: top .6s ease-in-out;
    transition: top .6s ease-in-out;
}
.page.active {
    top:0;
    z-index:1;
}
.page:not(.active) {
    top:100%;
    -webkit-transition-timing-function: step-end;
    -moz-transition-timing-function: step-end;
    -o-transition-timing-function: step-end;
    -ms-transition-timing-function: step-end;
    transition-timing-function: step-end;
}
</code></pre>
