<p>You could create a new SKAction that encloses both of these two actions. See the Sprite Kit Programming Guide section called <strong>'Creating Actions That Run Other Actions</strong>' here <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/AddingActionstoSprites/AddingActionstoSprites.html" rel="nofollow" title="Adding Actions To Nodes">Adding Actions To Nodes</a></p>

<p>Take a look at the SKAction member waitForDuration: too, you may be able to avoid passing in the single texture that way. Have the first SKAction run your animation, then have the second SKAction waitForDuration. Then your enclosing SKAction runs through these two actions forever or as long as needed.</p>
