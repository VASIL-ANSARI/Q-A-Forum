<p>You're actually putting quotes in the filename. Remove them, you would only need actual quotes around it on the command line and such. When you're giving a filename to <code>FileReader</code> (or any other method that expects a filename, not a command line), you just give the filename (even if it has spaces in it).</p>

<p>E.g.,</p>

<pre><code>filePathJson = "\"D:\\files\\test.xlsx\"";
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>filePathJson = "D:\\files\\test.xlsx";
</code></pre>
