<p>I cannot confirm your observations in my browsers.  However, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-html5-20140204/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute" rel="nofollow">the HTML5 <code>hidden</code> attribute</a> indicates that the element <em>should not be rendered</em>. This may have to do with your problem.</p>
