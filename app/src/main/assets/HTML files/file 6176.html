<p>It doesn't look like you're actually <strong>using</strong> the regex. It seems like maybe this is what you're trying to do?</p>

<pre><code>Assert.assertTrue(driver.getTitle().matches("*TST-*[0-9]{5}"));
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT #1:</p>

<p>It also seems like your regex might not be quite right, try:</p>

<pre><code>Assert.assertTrue(driver.getTitle().matches(".*TST-\\d{5}.*"));
</code></pre>
