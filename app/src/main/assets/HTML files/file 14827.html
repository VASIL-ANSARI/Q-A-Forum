<p>I can think of two reasons why this may be happening:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you create controls dynamically it is VERY difficult to
retrieve the values in the code behind after postback</li>
<li>Your controls have the read-only attribute set in the raw HTML</li>
</ol>

<p>You may want to try old-fashioned methods such as Request.Form <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms525985%28v=vs.90%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms525985%28v=vs.90%29.aspx</a></p>
