<p>You're setting up the <code>window.ENV</code> object in the initializer that runs after the <code>'simple-auth'</code> initializer so Ember Simple Auth cannot actually see the values that you set when its initializer runs. Make sure the values are set <strong>before</strong> the <code>'simple-auth'</code> initializer runs.</p>

<p>Also you should switch to Ember CLI of course ;)</p>
