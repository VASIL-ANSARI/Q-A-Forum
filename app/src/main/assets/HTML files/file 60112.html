<p>This is because when running from the command line you're using a different version of Python to the one in IDLE (with different installed packages). You can find which Python is being used by running the following from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>python -c "import sys;print(sys.executable)"
</code></pre>

<p>...or within IDLE:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
print(sys.executable)
</code></pre>

<p>If those two don't match, there is your problem. To fix it, you need to update your <code>PATH</code> variable to put the <em>parent folder</em> of the Python executable referred to by IDLE at the front. You can get instructions of how to do this on Windows <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9546324/adding-directory-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows">here</a>.</p>
