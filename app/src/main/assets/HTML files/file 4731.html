<p>What you are describing is in fact not  a service in background but replacing the keyboard app itself..take a look at the SWype app.</p>

<p>You do not have to create a service to do this as you want just the your own keyboard layout coming up when entering text, etc.</p>

<p>The sample of replacing a default app in the sdk is the homescreen but the keyboard app can be replaced as well..</p>
