<p>Short answer to "Can a member variable (attribute) reside in a register?": yes.</p>

<p>When iterating through a buffer and writing the temporary result to any sort of primitive, wherever it resides, keeping the temporary result in a register would be a good optimization. This is done frequently in compilers.  However, it is implementation based, even influenced by passed flags, so to know the result, you should check the generated assembly.</p>
