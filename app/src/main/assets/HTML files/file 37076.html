<p>I suspect (could you clarify?), that you are calling the static function initialize() from another statically initialized class? Since this would all be done at program startup (and C++ does not guarantee any static initialization order between files), initialize may be called before <code>ServLoc::theNullMonkey;</code> has been constructed?!</p>
