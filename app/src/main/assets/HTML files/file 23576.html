<p>You could use a JavaScript function to test this via AJAX, but if the user deactivates JavaScript? It should be on server-side.</p>

<p>Before you run that UPDATE SQL query, you should SELECT the row, test against the last_updated timestamp you got, and use something like this</p>

<pre><code>if ( strtotime('-12 hours') &lt; $query['last_updated_time'] )
// RUN SQL code here
else
// Show a error to user 
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this answer is clear.</p>
