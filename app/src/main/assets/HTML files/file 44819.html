<p>You might be getting the concept wrong. <code>sencha</code> provides you a command line tool, that wraps cordova/phonegap commands and provides additional goodies. <code>d3.js</code> is a library and does not come with a command line tool such as <code>sencha</code>. What you need to do is use cordova/phonegap commands inside your <code>d3.js</code> directory to create/build and run the project on your device.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>phonegap create my-app</code> initializes project</li>
<li><code>phonegap local run android</code> adds, builds and runs project on your android device.</li>
</ul>
