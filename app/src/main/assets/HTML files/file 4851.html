<p>A constructor doesn't return anything.  A constructor is called to initialize an object.  A constructor can only be used to initialize an object; you can't actually call a constructor explicitly (for one thing, constructors do not have names).</p>

<p>In the example you give, <code>empty()</code> is not a function call expression, it is value initialization.  It creates a value-initialized temporary object of type <code>empty</code>.</p>
