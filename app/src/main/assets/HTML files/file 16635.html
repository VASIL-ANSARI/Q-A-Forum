<p>Try setting your region explicitly, e.g. for EU you need to call:</p>

<pre><code>$myDynamoDbObject-&gt;set_region('dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com');
</code></pre>

<p>It might also be that you have two tables in different regions, your application work with one of them and you trying to read (or track with web console) another one because of different default regions applied.</p>

<p>If you're tracking number of items in the table, keep in mind that it is not a real time figure, it is only updated every 6 hours or so. So the way use can ensure your item is indeed written by trying to read it back immediately after you receive the "OK" response for your put request.</p>
