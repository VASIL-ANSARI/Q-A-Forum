<p>After much digging and research I figured it out!  I just had to add this code to my my RegisterRoutes.cs file:</p>

<pre><code>routes.Add(new Route("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}", new StopRoutingHandler()));
</code></pre>

<p>I found the answer at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668201.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc668201.aspx</a>.  It doesn't really explain it but after doing some digging I realize what my issue was. It was replacing the code in my webresource.axd file, which is generated by IIS7, with my default not found page NotFound.aspx. While the above code would seem to break things it actually fixes it by stopping the linked code from being overwritten</p>
