<p>A few comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">Nyquist frequency</a> is half the sampling rate.</li>
<li>You are working with regularly sampled data, so you want a digital filter, not an analog filter.  This means you should not use <code>analog=True</code> in the call to <code>butter</code>, and you should use <code>scipy.signal.freqz</code> (not <code>freqs</code>) to generate the frequency response.</li>
<li>One goal of those short utility functions is to allow you to leave all your frequencies expressed in Hz.  You shouldn't have to convert to rad/sec.  As long as you express your frequencies with consistent units, the scaling in the utility functions takes care of the normalization for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's my modified version of your script, followed by the plot that it generates.</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import butter, lfilter, freqz
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    nyq = 0.5 * fs
    normal_cutoff = cutoff / nyq
    b, a = butter(order, normal_cutoff, btype='low', analog=False)
    return b, a

def butter_lowpass_filter(data, cutoff, fs, order=5):
    b, a = butter_lowpass(cutoff, fs, order=order)
    y = lfilter(b, a, data)
    return y


# Filter requirements.
order = 6
fs = 30.0       # sample rate, Hz
cutoff = 3.667  # desired cutoff frequency of the filter, Hz

# Get the filter coefficients so we can check its frequency response.
b, a = butter_lowpass(cutoff, fs, order)

# Plot the frequency response.
w, h = freqz(b, a, worN=8000)
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.plot(0.5*fs*w/np.pi, np.abs(h), 'b')
plt.plot(cutoff, 0.5*np.sqrt(2), 'ko')
plt.axvline(cutoff, color='k')
plt.xlim(0, 0.5*fs)
plt.title("Lowpass Filter Frequency Response")
plt.xlabel('Frequency [Hz]')
plt.grid()


# Demonstrate the use of the filter.
# First make some data to be filtered.
T = 5.0         # seconds
n = int(T * fs) # total number of samples
t = np.linspace(0, T, n, endpoint=False)
# "Noisy" data.  We want to recover the 1.2 Hz signal from this.
data = np.sin(1.2*2*np.pi*t) + 1.5*np.cos(9*2*np.pi*t) + 0.5*np.sin(12.0*2*np.pi*t)

# Filter the data, and plot both the original and filtered signals.
y = butter_lowpass_filter(data, cutoff, fs, order)

plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(t, data, 'b-', label='data')
plt.plot(t, y, 'g-', linewidth=2, label='filtered data')
plt.xlabel('Time [sec]')
plt.grid()
plt.legend()

plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.35)
plt.show()
