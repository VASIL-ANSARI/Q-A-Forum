<p>Please try change the event subscribe from FB.Event.subscribe('auth.authResponseChange' to 
"auth.login".  This will trigger your code only the first time when user login in.</p>

<p>Below is taken <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.getLoginStatus/" rel="nofollow">from fb documentations</a> </p>

<p><strong>auth.login</strong>
This event is fired when your app first notices the user (in other words, gets a session when it didn't already have a valid one).</p>

<p><strong>auth.logout</strong>
This event is fired when your app notices that there is no longer a valid user (in other words, it had a session but can no longer validate the current user).</p>

<p><strong>auth.authResponseChange</strong>
This event is fired for any auth related change as they all affect the session: login, logout, session refresh. Sessions are refreshed over time as long as the user is active with your app.</p>

<p><strong>auth.statusChange</strong>
Typically you will want to use the auth.authResponseChange event. But in rare cases, you want to distinguish between these three states:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connected      </li>
<li>Logged into Facebook but not connected with your  </li>
<li>application Not logged into Facebook at all.</li>
</ul>
