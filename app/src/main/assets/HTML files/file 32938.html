<p>What should the MCU chip do with a printf string since there is no console? That's what is happening. libc needs low level functions that is platform dependent and shall not be included in the libc.</p>

<p>You need a retarget.c or a syscalls.c file that defines all these missing symbols and properly retarget the printf output to a serial line that you have access from the outside of the chip. </p>

<p>I strongly recommend you to use the <a href="http://www.yagarto.org" rel="nofollow">yagarto</a> toolkit, they provide a <a href="http://www.yagarto.de/download/yagarto/syscalls.c" rel="nofollow">syscall.c</a> file with what's necessary to build a project when linking against libc, as you are doing. </p>

<p>If you want to try the short path, include the <a href="http://www.yagarto.de/download/yagarto/syscalls.c" rel="nofollow">syscall.c</a> file to your project and reprogram its functions internals to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Linking bare gcc toolchain against libc in the microcontroller world is not for beginners. My recommendation is always to follow step by step yagarto's tutorials.</p>
