<p>OK, so I finally got it working by replacing Rhino with Node.js (I'm required to use jRuby so therubyracer was apparently not a good option either).</p>

<p>==============================================</p>

<p>UPDATE: It's been quite a while and I had pretty much forgotten about this post, but now I have come across it again I feel there's something I should mention: Although my original solution of using Node.js worked, it turned out to be more of an inadverted workaround than anything else. </p>

<p>As I found out some time later, the source of the problem was that, due to my lack of experience with Linux, I was pretty sure that the locale was set up properly when it wasn't at all. Once I configured my locale correctly, it fixed this and quite a few other locale-related problems I was experiencing.</p>
