<p>The error seems gone when I remove the </p>

<pre><code>@using BeginForm
</code></pre>

<p>from my table...</p>

<p>I could not remember why am I including that but so far it still work fine without it.. I guess the error is triggered by the "default" validation apply to anything in the form tag..</p>

<p>Any comments and feedbacks are still welcomed and appreciated.. Thanks....</p>
