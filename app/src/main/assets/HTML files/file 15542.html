<p><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html" rel="nofollow">Twitter Bootstrap</a> has some really attractive styling for things of this nature. It has form some form specific classes, tooltips, as well as alert functionality built in. I would suggest though that you use the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/download.html" rel="nofollow">customize</a> feature to only use the parts of the framework that you need.</p>

<p>I also stumbled across <a href="http://www.formee.org/" rel="nofollow">Formee</a> but I still prefer bootstrap.</p>
