<p>AsyncTask and Thread+Handler are not carefully designed and implemented. RxJava, Akka and other frameworks for asynchronous execution seem more carefully developed.</p>

<p>Each technology has its limitations. AsyncTask is for a single parallel task with ability to show progress on UI. However, if activity is regenerated (e.g. because of screen rotating), connection to UI is lost (one possible solution for this problem is at <a href="https://github.com/rfqu/AsyncConnector" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rfqu/AsyncConnector</a>).</p>

<p><code>Thread+Handler</code> keeps memory for thread stack even when there is no messages to process. This limits the possible number of threads. You can have much more <code>Akka actors</code> or <code>RxJava Subscribers</code> than handler threads, with similar functionality.</p>
