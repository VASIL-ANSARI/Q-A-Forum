<p>If it is acceptable, the best solution may be to create a managed C++ dll that sits in-between.  Managed C++ code is the best/most-efficient way to bridged managed and unmanaged code.</p>

<p>You <em>really</em> don't want to add COM into the mix.  That will slow things down much more.</p>

<p>Also, are these "performance reasons" to avoid managed code actually quantified?  It sounds kind of like an anecdote thrown out to avoid something they just don't want.  Also, you could point out that they are <em>already</em> using managed code, since C# is in the mix.</p>
