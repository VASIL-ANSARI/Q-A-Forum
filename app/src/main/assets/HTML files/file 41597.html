<p>There is some information <a href="http://www.experts-exchange.com/Software/Office_Productivity/Office_Suites/Lotus_IBM/Q_26421684.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> that might help you. </p>

<p>There are pointers for adding an attachment to a memo, but the same class (<code>NotesUIDocument</code>) seems to be used.</p>

<p>[from source]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Workaround #1: Copy the file to the clipboard, then use
  NotesUIDocument.Paste.  Not my favorite because it obviously destroys
  anything the user had on the clipboard, but this is pretty easy to do.</p>
  
  <p>Workaround #2: Create the email using only back-end classes, then
  display it to the user using the NotesUIWorkspace.EditDocument method.
  I notice puru1981 mentioned using NotesRichTextItem and
  NotesEmbeddedObject, but I find using richtext a bit clunky.  Instead,
  I'm using the newer mime classes (NotesMIMEEntity for example).  I
  don't have any examples using OLE or C#, but here's a COM/VBA solution
  that you can use to get started.</p>

  <p>A couple of things to keep in mind:</p>
  
  <p>1) I cannot think of a situation where you would need to call
  CreatObject.  That is a LotusScript/VB command that should be reserved
  for extending the client from within.</p>
  
  <p>2) Only call CreateInstance for NotesSession and NotesUIWorkspace. 
  Those are the root objects in Notes land.  NotesSession for back-end
  access, NotesUIWorkspace for GUI access.  All other handles should be
  obtained from one of these objects or a child thereof.</p>
