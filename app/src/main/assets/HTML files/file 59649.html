<p>What you are looking for is a simple aggregation where you group by category and count items.</p>

<pre><code>select 
  c.category_id,
  c.category_name,
  count(*) as items
from categories c
join items i on i.category_id = c.category_id
group by c.category_id
having count(*) &gt;= 2
order by c.category_id
limit @skip, @show;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to know how many categories match your condition:</p>

<pre><code>select count(*)
from categories c
where 
(
  select count(*)
  from items i 
  where i.category_id = c.category_id
) &gt;= 2;
</code></pre>
