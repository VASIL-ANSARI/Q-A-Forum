<p>You were very close! You just need to set the value of the select with the abs value of 11 like so:</p>

<pre><code>$("#map_abs").click(function (event) {
   $('#strength_exercise_muscle_group_id').val(11);
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you are listening for change events on the selects, you can even trigger one when you change the value by doing <code>$('#strength_exercise_muscle_group_id').trigger('change')</code>. Hope this helps.</p>
