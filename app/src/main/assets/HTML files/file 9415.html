<p>Checksums work well for comparison of byte by byte exactness. If that's what you are looking for, then read the bytes of each document into a stream and use a <code>SHA256Managed</code> or <code>MD5CryptoServiceProvider</code> to generate a checksum for each file. If the two checksums are the same, then the two documents are most likely the same.</p>

<p>MD5 is not suitable for security purposes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5 - see "Security") but it should be fine for comparison purposes where you are in control of both documents. Also keep in mind that checksums are not 100% unique, so there is always the remote possibility of collision.</p>

<p>However, if you are comparing section by section, then you may need to open the document up as more than raw bytes and deal with it in a structured fashion, e.g. section by section. You can programmatically open a .docx file using c# (using a variety of means); perhaps you can then perform a checksum against the contents of each section?</p>
