<p>If you want to load an assembly from the GAC, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ky3942xh.aspx">load it by using its fully qualified name</a>: </p>

<pre><code>Assembly.Load("SampleAssembly, Version=1.0.2004.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=8744b20f8da049e3");
</code></pre>

<p>If it's found in the GAC, it will be loaded from there. </p>

<p>You should <strong>never ever</strong> hardcode the path of the GAC anywhere. It could change at any time, even between service packs or patches, and it's an implementation detail that you cannot rely on.</p>
