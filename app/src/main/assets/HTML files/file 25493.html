<p>You probably want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var filteredProjects = sourceFolders
    .Select(sf =&gt; new { 
        Project = projectNames.FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; sf.Contains(x)),
        Folder = sf
    })
    .Where(o =&gt; o.Project != null);
</code></pre>

<p>This projects each source folder into an instance of an anonymous type with <code>Project</code> and <code>Folder</code> properties; the latter is the source folder, and the former is the name of the project (which may be <code>null</code> if <code>projectNames</code> has no match for a particular folder).</p>

<p>The result is then filtered to eliminate objects that correspond to folders which could not be associated with a project.</p>

<p>There is also the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.tuple.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Tuple</code></a>-powered equivalent</p>

<pre><code>var filteredProjects = sourceFolders
    .Select(sf =&gt; Tuple.Create(
        sf, projectNames.FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; sf.Contains(x))
    ))
    .Where(t =&gt; t.Item2 != null);
</code></pre>
