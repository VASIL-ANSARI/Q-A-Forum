<p>Changing column names is probably something you want to do manually instead of as a mass change. You can get a list of all the columns in all tables in your DB using the <code>sys.all_columns</code> table so something like</p>

<pre><code>select      all_objects.name as Table_nm, all_columns.name as Column_nm
from        sys.all_columns
inner join  sys.all_objects
    on      all_objects.object_id = all_columns.object_id
where       all_columns.name like '%$%'
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like renaming columns is done through a Stored Procedure, so you could take the output of that query to create a string of other queries to update all the offending records.
