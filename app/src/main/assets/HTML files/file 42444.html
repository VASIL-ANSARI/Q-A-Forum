<p>Try adding the queue name to your Start:</p>

<pre><code>bool startResult = SqlDependency.Start(connString, queueName)
</code></pre>

<p>I also had to add the service name and timeout to my SqlDependency constructor to get things to work right. (its in VB, but you get the idea)</p>

<pre><code>dependency = New SqlDependency(command, "Service=" + SERVICE_NAME + ";", Int32.MaxValue)
</code></pre>
