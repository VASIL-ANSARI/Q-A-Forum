<p>I believe you're looking for this:</p>

<pre><code>public &lt;T&gt; T lastAddedObj(ArrayList&lt;T&gt; list) {
  return list.get(size - 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> </p>

<p>when you're calling this method using an <code>ArrayList&lt;Mat&gt;</code>, the <code>Mat</code> type is inferred and the <code>T</code> (the generic type) is replaced by <code>Mat</code>. Some comments on my answer suggested that you should also mark the method as <code>static</code>, but this is not required.</p>

<p>Here is a tutorial about generics: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/methods.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/methods.html</a></p>
