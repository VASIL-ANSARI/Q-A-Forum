<p>You have two issues with your approach: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>a text editor does not output text written in it when closing the editor. So why would you expect to receive the text when firing the editor by means of an <code>exec()</code> call? </p></li>
<li><p>you miss understood how the <code>exec()</code> command actually works, I assume you did not really read the documentation of the <a href="http://php.net/manual/de/function.exec.php" rel="nofollow"><code>exec() function</code></a> which clearly states that the return value of an executed command is <em>the last line of its output</em>. That is not what you want. </p></li>
</ol>
