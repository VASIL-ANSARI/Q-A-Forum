<p>Since you're creating the table dynamically, you can't reference it like controls that are statically embedded on the page. To get a reference to the Table object you'll need to find it in the Page's ControlCollection and cast it out, just like in the example:</p>

<pre><code>Table table = (Table)Page.FindControl("Table1");
</code></pre>

<p>The Table class contains a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.table.rowcontrolcollection.aspx" rel="nofollow">table row collection</a> which you will then need to loop over. Each row in the row collection has a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.tablerow.cells.aspx" rel="nofollow">collection of cells</a>, each of which will contain <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.tablecell.aspx" rel="nofollow">child controls</a> (see: Controls property) which will be your textboxes.</p>
