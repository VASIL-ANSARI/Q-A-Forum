<p>First is that you don't need nested <code>LinearLayout</code> to achieve what you want. So you can remove your second <code>LinearLayout</code>.</p>

<p>To make views occupy height of screen evenly, you can use <code>android:layout_weight="1"</code> then set your <code>android:layout_height="0dp"</code>. Set those attributes to the views you want to have equal height.</p>

<p>Also, remove your <code>weightSum</code> in the <code>LinearLayout</code>, because by setting the <code>layout_weight</code> of your views equal to 1, you are implicitly telling that the <code>weightSum</code> is 2 and that your views are sharing it equally.</p>
