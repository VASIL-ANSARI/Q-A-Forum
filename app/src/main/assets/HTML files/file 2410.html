<p><strong>1</strong> Did the escape analysis show up as being enabled in JConsole?  You need make sure you're running the VM with the -server option.  I assume you had this working, but I just thought I'd check.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> I don't think escape analysis will help the situation with Scala Actors. You might see a big gain if you do something like:</p>

<pre><code>def act():Unit = {
   val omgHugeObject = new OMGHugeObject();
   omgHugeObject.doSomethingCrazy();
 }
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above the EscapeAnalysis would make it so <code>omgHugeObject</code> could be allocated on the stack instead of the heap and thus not create garbage. I don't think it is likely that the escape analysis will help with actors. Their references will always "escape" to the actor subsystem.</p>

Are you on the most recent release of Scala?  There was a memory leak that I believe was fixed in a recent version.  This even caused <a href="http://liftweb.net/" rel="nofollow">Lift</a> to spawn off its own Actor library that you might look into.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> You might try the G1Garbage collector You can enable it with:</p>

<p><code>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC</code></p>
