<p>As a general rule, the composition of your WPF app will not affect whether the CPU (software rendering) or the GPU (hardware rendering) is used. WPF will always use hardware rendering when it is available on the machine, and will fallback to software rendering if it can't find hardware support.</p>

<p>Having said that, there are some things that WPF will always render using software rendering. E.g. the legacy effects derived from BitmapEffect.</p>

<p>You can use the WPF perf tools to see whether software rendering is being used:</p>

<p>The Perforator tool has an option to highlight sections of the app rendered in software with a purple tint.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, pretty much any WPF app you can create will use hardware rendering, just don't use anything derived from BitmapEffect. You can double check that software rendering isn't used by running the app on your desktop first and using Perforator to profile it. Once you've confirmed it doesn't use any software rendering you can test it in your Citrix environment with/with-out 3D hardware installed to see what kind of performance improvements you get.</p>
