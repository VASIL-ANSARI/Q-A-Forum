<p>As pointed out by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35654390/displaying-upcoming-facebook-events-on-site-works-for-one-page-and-not-the-othe#comment58989480_35654390">Aaron</a> in the comments, the problem is not code-related, it is simply not working because the facebook page "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheMazeRio" rel="nofollow">TheMazeRio</a>" is not visible to users not logged in to facebook.</p>

<p>Here are the main factors that prevent "guests" from viewing a facebook page:</p>

<p><strong>1 â Country Restriction:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case you have applied this, Your page will not be visible to fans
  of other countries. Country restricted pages can only be visited by
  logging in. So make sure there should be no country restrictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2 â Age restriction:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Age restriction is also a constraint that makes your Facebook page
  visible for selective users/fans or for a particular age group. Make
  sure there is no age restriction on your page otherwise it will not be
  visible to certain users without logging in to Facebook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3 â Profanity Blacklist:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have selected an option other than ânoneâ your page will not be
  public. Users must be logged in to view your page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>4 â Moderation Blacklist:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there is anything written in that box, your  page will not be
  public. Someone must be logged in, in order to view your
  page. Restrictions are a good tool to make your Facebook page more
  compliant with your business or product.</p>

<p>P.S. You can always test the public visibility of a facebook page easily by opening the page link in a private/incognito browser window, or logging out of your facebook.</p>
