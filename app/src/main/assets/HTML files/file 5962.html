<p>I cannot figure out from your question which side is the server and which is the client, and maybe it doesn't matter. Although I'm not that familiar with those servers, I have seen similar errors when the server is not able to find its RSA private key, either due to misconfiguration or more often misunderstanding. The server must have access to <em>both</em> a private key and its matching public key (contained in its certificate) in order to complete an authenticated connection. </p>
