<p>The coefficient <code>amountOfVotes[i] / total</code> in <code>(amountOfVotes[i] / total) * 100.0</code> is evalated in <em>integer arithmetic</em>: i.e. any fraction is discarded.</p>

<p>So you end up with <code>0 * 100</code> for all cases where <code>amountOfVotes[i]</code> is less than <code>total</code>.</p>

<p>The solution is to rearrange the formula to <code>100 * amountOfVotes[i] / total;</code>, or, even better <code>100.0 * amountOfVotes[i] / total;</code> which will force evaluation in double precision floating point - you are in danger of overflowing an <code>int</code> which, on some systems, can have an upper limit as low as 32767.</p>

<p>That's not immediately obvious even when using a line-by-line debugger. But do use that debugger to work out the other "kinks".</p>
