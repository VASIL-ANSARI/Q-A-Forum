<p>When you call .remove on the $('body'), you're telling it to remove a string. That's not going to work. You would need to tell the browser instead to remove the actual script element.</p>

<p>However, that still wont solve your problem. Once a script has been loaded, it's functions and values are in memory - and removing the script element will not remove those functions/values from memory.</p>

<p>I suggest you take a different approach, and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
  if(!(/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) ) {
    var script = $("&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/jQuery-Before-After-Image-Slider-Plugin-imgSlider/js/imgslider.js' /&gt;");
    $('head').append( script );
  }        
});
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, use javascript to only load the script if it is not a mobile device.</p>

<p>edit: Also, it's bad practice to depend on scripts on other domains. Go download that script and host it yourself!</p>
