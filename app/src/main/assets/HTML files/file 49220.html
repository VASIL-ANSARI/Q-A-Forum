<p>I found an answer while was writing this question :)
To update/delete properties at 'Object' I had to use this way:</p>

<pre><code>    if(role!='none')
        user.set('usedIn.'+projectId,role);
    else
        user.set('usedIn.'+projectId,undefined);
</code></pre>

<p>Now it works great with creating/updating/removing properties. If someone can explain why this way worked - you are welcome :)</p>
