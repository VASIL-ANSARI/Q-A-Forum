<p>To use libraries installed with NPM in the browser, you traditionally need to use a build tool like Browserify or Webpack. Asking how to use an npm library in the browser is too broad of a question for StackOverflow.</p>

<p>If you aren't familiar with those tools and want to get up and running quickly, you can just include <a href="https://github.com/i18next/i18next/blob/master/i18next.min.js" rel="nofollow">browser ready Javacript file</a> in a script tag. Hit the "Raw" button, download the file, then include the downloaded file in your project like any other script file.</p>
