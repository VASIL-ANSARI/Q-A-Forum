<p>It looks like the line</p>

<pre><code>head = (Node*) malloc( sizeof( Node ) ); //line 21
</code></pre>

<p>is outside the <code>main()</code> function. You can't do that, because you can't execute code outside  functions. The only thing you can do at global scope is <em>declaring variables.</em> Just move it inside the <code>main()</code> or any other function, and the problem should go away.</p>

<p>(PS: Take a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/605845/do-i-cast-the-result-of-malloc">this question</a> on why you shouldn't type-cast <code>malloc</code>)</p>
