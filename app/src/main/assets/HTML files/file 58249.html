<p>Check your input naming. It is <code>name</code> in your HTML and <code>firstname</code> in your php.
Also make sure to use a semi-colon after each line in your php or else it will have errors. <code>echo "Hello $v! &lt;br&gt;";</code></p>

<p>Not an error, but maybe confusing, your options in the drop down have different values than the use might expect <code>&lt;option value = "0"&gt; 1 &lt;/option&gt;</code>. This will mean they are told they rated 0 when they rated 1. Also means your if will include ratings 3 or lower in the <code>sorry</code> option.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: with your edited code, the first <code>echo</code> line in your php will cause an error due to no semicolon. </p>
