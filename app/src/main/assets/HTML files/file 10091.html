<p>If you initialize an UIImage with a transparent or semitransparent image form disk, all the pixels that were transparent, still remain transparent. What is it that you actually want to achieve, maybe Iâm misunderstanding something.</p>

<p>Anyway, just save a transparent image (PNG would probably be best) to disk, add it to XCode project and then just:</p>

<p><code>something = [UIImage imageNamed:@"some.png"];</code></p>

<p>Has worked fine for me so far.</p>
