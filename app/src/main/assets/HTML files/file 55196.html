<p>There's no shortcut, you have to sum up the lengths of the arrays. If you only have two dimensions, then:</p>

<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var matrix = [1,2,3,4,5,6, [1,2,3,4]];
var sum = matrix.reduce(function(acc, entry) {
    return acc + (Array.isArray(entry) ? entry.length : 1);
}, 0);
console.log(sum);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>If you may have more dimensions, you'll need recursion. As squint pointed out in a comment, making the above recursive is just a matter of giving our <code>reduce</code> callback a name and then doing <code>reduce</code> again instead of just using <code>array.length</code>:</p>

<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var matrix = [1,2,3,4,5,6, [1,2,[3,4]]];
var sum = matrix.reduce(function callback(acc, entry) {
    return acc + (Array.isArray(entry) ? entry.reduce(callback, 0) : 1);
}, 0);
console.log(sum);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray" rel="nofollow"><code>Array.isArray</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce" rel="nofollow"><code>Array#reduce</code></a> were added in ES5 (in 2009) and so should be available in just about any modern browser (so, not IE8); they can both be shimmed/polyfilled on older browsers.</li>
<li>JavaScript doesn't actually have multi-dimensional arrays. It has arrays of arrays.</li>
<li>The recursive example above uses a construct called a <em>named function expression</em> for <code>callback</code>. NFEs have a bad name because years ago browsers got them wrong several different ways, but these days they're fine. (If you used the above on IE8&nbsp;&mdash; including polyfills for the things it's missing&nbsp;&mdash; even <em>it</em> would work even though <a href="http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2010/09/double-take.html" rel="nofollow">IE8 gets NFEs wrong</a>.)</li>
</ul>
