<p>Anyways, if you're looking for an app, you can try this <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rocketstartups.weartaskmanager&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Task Manager For Android Wear</a> that is available in the Play Store. It can list all running processes on your watch and it can help you to stop any of the tasks easily and quickly.</p>

<p>You can also check this <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/performance.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for tips for conserving power and improving performance. You need to ensure that your watch face performs computations only when active; use callbacks in <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/wearable/watchface/WatchFaceService.Engine.html" rel="nofollow"><code>WatchFaceService.Engine</code></a>. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.wearable.app&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Android Wear companion app</a> also enables developers and users to see how much battery is consumed by different processes on the wearable device (under Settings > Watch battery).</p>
