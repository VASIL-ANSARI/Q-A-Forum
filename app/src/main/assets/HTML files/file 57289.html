<pre><code>Array.apply(null, {length: 10})
</code></pre>

<p>creates an array of length 10 with all elements being <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<pre><code>.map(Number.call, Number)
</code></pre>

<p>will invoke <code>Number.call</code> for each element with the arguments <code>(element, index, array)</code> and setting <code>this</code> to <code>Number</code>. The first argument to call will be taken as <code>this</code> (not relevant here), and all the other arguments are passed as they are, with the first one being the index. And Number will now convert its first argument, <code>index</code>, to a number (here: will return the index, as it is a number), and that's what map will write to its return array.</p>
