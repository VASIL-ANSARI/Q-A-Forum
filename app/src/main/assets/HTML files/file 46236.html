<p>The title and the question do not have anything in common, also you should format your code. Nonetheless here's my answer to the question which you probably would've asked had you written an appropriate title.</p>

<p>Well actually 0 != '0' in programming, because '0' is translated to it's integer value which in ASCII is 48 and the comparison is between 0 and 48. 
So your isalpha method should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>boolean isalpha(char a)
{
    if((a&gt;='a' &amp;&amp; a&lt;='z')||(a&gt;='0' &amp;&amp; a&lt;='9'))
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, there are these neat little methods with which you don't need to check characters' ASCII code to compare them. I personally prefer this approachh as it is more simple and concise. It would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>boolean isalpha(char a)
{
    return Character.isDigit(a) || Character.isAlphabetic(a);
}
</code></pre>
