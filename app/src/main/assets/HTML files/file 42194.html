<p>Firstly, you need make your SQL more readable. Something like this</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM sell
WHERE draft = 0
AND ID NOT IN (SELECT id_ FROM skipped WHERE uid = '0')
AND ID NOT IN (SELECT id_ FROM followed WHERE uid = '0')
ORDER BY raised DESC LIMIT 15
</code></pre>

<p>Then, what do you want? Add data to <code>sell</code> table through single request? This can be done with such request</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO sell (key1, key2, keyN)
VALUES 
('aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'),
('ddd', 'eee', 'fff');
-- and so forth.
</code></pre>
