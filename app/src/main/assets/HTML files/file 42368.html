<p>If you have any watchers in your controller, you might want to unwatch them in $destroy listener.
Like `</p>

<pre><code>var $unwatch = scope.$watch(something, somethingElse);

$scope.$on('$destroy', function () {
    $unwatch();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I would recommend not using <code>$scope.$$listener = [];</code> in your code, at least since <code>$$listener</code> is a local variable of angularjs, and it's name might change with upcoming versions of angular.</p>
