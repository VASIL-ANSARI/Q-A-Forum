<p>edit: Refactoring Example:</p>

<p>Suppose your code is:</p>

<pre><code>void Button1_Click() {
    function1();
    function2();
    function3();
    function4();
    function5();
}    
void Button2_Checked(int variable0) {
    if (variable0) {
        function1();
        function2();
    } else {
        function1();
        function2();
        function3();     
        function4();
        function5();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Step 0-10 is to find meaningful names for all, the buttons, the functions, 
the variables, the parameters (only rename one entity a time; I skipped this for sake of post):</p>

<pre><code>void orderPizzaButton_Click() {
    requestSalamis();
    requestAnchovis();        
    requestShitake();        
    requestCheese();
    requestGroundMeat();
}    
void lasagnePervesityLevel_Changed(int newValue) {
    if (newValue &lt;= 0) {
        requestCheese();
        requestGroundMeat();
    } else {
        requestSalamis();
        requestAnchovis();        
        requestShitake();
        requestCheese();
        requestGroundMeat();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Step 11 is to find commons in those functions, and extract a new, re-usable function
from them:</p>

<pre><code>void orderPizzaButton_Click() {
    requestStrangeIngredientCombination();
}    
void lasagnePervesityLevel_Changed(int newValue) {
    if (newValue &lt;= 0) {
        requestCheese();
        requestGroundMeat();
    } else {
        requestStrangeIngredientCombination();
    }
}

void requestStrangeIngredientCombination() {
    requestSalamis();
    requestAnchovis();        
    requestShitake();
    requestCheese();
    requestGroundMeat();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Step 12 is to refine your search of common code (think of it as a kind of normalization):</p>

<pre><code>void orderPizzaButton_Click() {
    requestStrangeIngredientCombination();
}
void lasagnePervesityLevel_Changed(int newValue) {
    if (newValue &lt;= 0) {
        requestStandardComponents();
    } else {
        requestStrangeIngredientCombination();
    }
}

void requestStandardComponents() {
    requestCheese();
    requestGroundMeat();
}
void requestStrangeIngredientCombination() {
    requestSalamis();
    requestAnchovis();        
    requestShitake();
    requestStandardComponents();
}   
</code></pre>

<p>While in this example it seems that you didn't save code, in reality it often <strong>will</strong>. Also, saving lines of code is not the important thing here, the thing is about reducing redundancy, because once you decide your perverse lasagne and strange pizza should also hold chilis and an image of Sylvester Stallone, you will not only have code-duplication, but <strong>work-duplication</strong>; and most importantly, there is the potential to forget the new features in some places of your code. This, of course, is very bad and even business critical. Suppose your customers expect an image of Sylvester Stallone on their lasagne, just as your marketing campaign promised, and then no one who ordered pizza ever gets that image, but just those ppl who ordered lasagne. </p>

<p>Many more refactorings and designs exist, depending on the actual code. I really
recommend to get the following books. Also, most important rule of thumb: One step a time. Do exactly one small refactoring, compile, test.</p>
