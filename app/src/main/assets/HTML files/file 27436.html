<p>Each request of any users to your asp.net app will run in its own thread. To synchronize that traffic you can create a singleton object and build a method which uses lock.
Lock will actually lock all threads out until the current thread finished.</p>

<p>So if you see the need to put a timeout, build a lock block and inside put a timeout.
Now all threads will have to wait...</p>

<p>Something like this
</p>

<pre><code>public class ThreadLock
{
    private static readonly object myLock;

    public void LockTimeout()
    {
        // --&gt; first thread will trigger the following code. 
        // All other threads will wait 
        // &lt;-- HERE 
        // until the first went through 
        lock (myLock)
        {
            //... do some timeout work
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anyways, I don't really get why you ever want to do something like this because usually we are all happy about having asynchronously working applications... anyways. Hope this helps</p>
