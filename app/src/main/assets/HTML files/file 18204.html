<p>I don't see something wrong with your code, so i think the problem will be in <strong>access rights</strong> given to account. You should <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html" rel="nofollow">modify mysql access rights</a> and <code>Grant</code> the user rights to <strong>CREATE</strong> (which is a privilege for both: database &amp; table creation)</p>
