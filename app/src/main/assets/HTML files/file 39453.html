<p>I would advice to refactor your code and extract as much as possible to add it into your own Framework if you really want to keep it clean and have a good way of providing support to your customers. (refactor in a way so that it is easy to use for external projects, for example providing delegates/blocks in a matter that is straight-forward to implement).</p>

<p>A great starting point for learning how to create (Objective-C) iOS Frameworks can be found at <a href="https://github.com/jverkoey/iOS-Framework" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jverkoey/iOS-Framework</a>.</p>

<p>Any dependency (external library) you use for building the Framework will become a dependency for the project that will use your framework, unless you can add the source in your Framework.</p>

<p>Also take a look into providing documentation using Doxygen, AppleDoc, etc ;-)</p>
