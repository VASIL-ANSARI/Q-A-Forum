<p>It turns out that my counter was not incrementing properly and the problem was simply down to not giving the image a unique key in the following line</p>

<pre><code>CCSprite* answerMenuNormalSprite = [CCSprite spriteWithCGImage:graphImage.CGImage key:   [NSString stringWithFormat:@"answerMenuNormalSprite_%f", i]];
</code></pre>
