<pre><code>extern int *exitDirection;
</code></pre>

<p>Here you actually declared pointer to the int, you probably (depending on how you create it and set value to it) need just plain int here:</p>

<pre><code>extern int exitDirection;
</code></pre>

<p>Also with that declaration you just tell compiler that exitDirection is created somewhere outside of the current scope, the variable itself is not created. You need to actually create (and probably set some initial value to it) in some implementation file, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>// Constants.m
int exitDirection = 0;
</code></pre>
