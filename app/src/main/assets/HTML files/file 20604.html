<p>Again, as someone has already said, use strtok. If you need to know more about it,
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strtok/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strtok/</a></p>

<p>If you want to do it without using any existing API's (I don't know why you would want to do that unless it's a class project), then create a simple algorithm with a pointer to traverse the string and skip spaces while incrementing count.</p>

<p>As people have said before, this will be a good exercise for you, so don't ask for code. And there's always google..</p>
