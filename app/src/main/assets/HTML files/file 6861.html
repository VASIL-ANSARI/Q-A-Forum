<p>What you really want is to install Apache HTTP server and configure it running as reverse proxy with mod_proxy like</p>

<pre><code>ProxyRequests Off
&lt;Proxy *&gt;
Order deny,allow
Allow from all
&lt;/Proxy&gt;
ProxyPass / http://foo.example.com:8080/myapplication
ProxyPassReverse / http://foo.example.com:8080/myapplication 
</code></pre>

<p>The configuration should transform for instance request to /myservlet to :8080/myapplication/myservlet . Please notice that putting stuff at the exact root is not always a good idea, because after that you can not use it for other needs (without more advanced configuration, probably involving mod_rewrite).</p>
