<p>I assume that Put method which you use is to transfer the file from the local computer (the client) to the remote server. The method is not suitable for moving files on the remote server. </p>

<p>To move files you need to either use the SSH client and issue commands for remote shell to interpret (if you know it's linux, then running "mv" in shell will do the job), or, if you have no SSH access, you can try using a decent SFTP client (such as our SecureBlackbox) which supports "Rename" SFTP command (remote file can be "renamed" this way). Not all servers support this command, though. </p>
