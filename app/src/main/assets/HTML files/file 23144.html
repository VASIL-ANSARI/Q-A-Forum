<p>I don't get the createUser() function. </p>

<p>First: You pass $email as a param, but don't use it, i.e. you use $value2 instead which is in global scope and you can't access it unless you pass it as a parameter ($email in your case) or declare global in function body. It seems it should be:</p>

<pre><code>function createUser($email){
   $sql = "SELECT count(email) FROM fusiodoseOne WHERE email='$email'" ;

   $result = mysql_result(mysql_query($sql),0) ;

   if( $result &gt; 0 ){
    die( "There is already a user with that email!" ) ;
   }//end if
</code></pre>

<p>Second: At what point exactly is the function called? This is a definition, but where and how is it used?</p>
