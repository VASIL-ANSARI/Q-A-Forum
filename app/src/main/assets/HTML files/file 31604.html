<p>To be honest, dragging and dropping is probably one of those activities that MVVM finds most difficult to fit naturally into it's paradigm. However, the most common way of doing this is by using <strong>Attached Behaviours</strong>. A <code>DragDropBehaviour</code>, sub-classing <code>Behavior&lt;T&gt;</code> will allow you to hook into those events on the <code>ListBox</code> and have the advantage of being totally re-usable.</p>

<p>A good example of this can be found <a href="http://codeblitz.wordpress.com/2009/06/26/wpf-itemscontrol-drag-drop-behavior/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
