<p>From Python 2.5 onwards you can do:</p>

<pre><code>value = b if a &gt; 10 else c
</code></pre>

<p>Previously you would have to do something like the following, although the semantics isn't identical as the short circuiting effect is lost:</p>

<pre><code>value = [c, b][a &gt; 10]
</code></pre>

<p>There's also another hack using 'and ... or' but it's best to not use it as it has an undesirable behaviour in some situations that can lead to a hard to find bug. I won't even write the hack here as I think it's best not to use it, but you can read about it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F%3a#Python">Wikipedia</a> if you want.</p>
