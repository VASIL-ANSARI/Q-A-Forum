<p>I would suggest to go with object oriented 'typed' approach. After all this is why you probably want to use typescript and not javascript. 
So in typescript you would do this in the following manner. To give meaning to 'this' you must refer to it inside some class. It your case it could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Test
{
    private myTextA = "Hello!";
    private myTextB = "Goodbye!";
    private textList = ["A", "B"];

    public callMe()
    {
        console.log("I want to say " + this["myText" + this.textList[0]]);
    }
}

console.log((new Test()).callMe());
</code></pre>
