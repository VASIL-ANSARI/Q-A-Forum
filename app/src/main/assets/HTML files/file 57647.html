<p>In your current implementation, you are capturing images using MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE intent. The intent is sent to the camera application to capture an image and return it. 
Hence, the image capture screen is not within your app. And so you will not be able to add any view to it.</p>

<p>For your requirement, you will have to implement your own camera. Check out the section '<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera.html#custom-camera" rel="nofollow">Building a Camera App</a>'. Then you will be able to add whatever views you want to it.</p>
