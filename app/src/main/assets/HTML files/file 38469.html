<p>You haven't said which server you're using, but typically an application server has multiple classloaders involved - some shared, and some per-application. The Tomcat documentation has a <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html" rel="nofollow">good explanation of its classloaders</a>, for example.</p>

<p>If there's actually just <em>one</em> jar file, and it's in a location loaded by a shared classloader, then there's only one variable.</p>

<p>However, if the two applications each have their own copy of the jar file (for example if it really is embedded within the EAR file) - or it's in a common location but is loaded by a separate classloader for each application - then there'll be two variables.</p>

<p>Basically, each type in each classloader has its own separate static variables.</p>

<p>Of course, if you've got two completely separate server instances, when you're not just in different classloaders but different processes - at which point they will <em>certainly</em> be separate variables.</p>
