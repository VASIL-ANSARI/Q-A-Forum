<p>I believe that, as of the latest version WebApi OData v4 (5.4.0), DateTime is supported to a degree. It still is defined as DateTimeOffset in the metadata, but at least your model can deal with DateTime. See <a href="http://odata.github.io/WebApi/datetime-support/" rel="nofollow">http://odata.github.io/WebApi/datetime-support/</a> for more details.</p>
