<p>No, it is not possible while keeping within the xml standard.</p>

<p>The allowable set of characters in a parsed XML entity is tab, carriage return, linefeed, and valid unicode characters.  There are various bytes that fall outside of this allowable range, most prominently 0x0, but also 0x1 - 0x8, 0xB - 0xC, and 0xE - 0x1F (i.e., most values that are classically ASCII control characters).</p>

<p>You can't even include them as numeric entities, since they aren't valid characters. i.e., the following will not validate:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;test&gt;
    Testing ^A: &amp;#x1;
&lt;/test&gt;
</code></pre>
