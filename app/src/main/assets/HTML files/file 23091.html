<p>It's only going to work in IE8 or greater, take a look here for website compatibility:</p>

<p>Also, notice your display: table-row element, needs to be nested inside a display: table element. Some other browsers might just be auto-correcting this for you.</p>

<p>I would avoid using display: table in my opinion because of this. You should usually be able to achieve the layout you want without it with a css grid like system with more compatibility.</p>
