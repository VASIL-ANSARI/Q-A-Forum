<p>Start your application in debug mode. <em>As long as no Bug occurs, there is nothing to debug.</em></p>

<p>If an Exception occurs in your console, jump into the line where it happened. Find out what the Exception means and work up along the stack-trace to find the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>If a (non-Exception-) logical error occurs, add a break point where the problem appears (i.e. in the view or console-printer). Restart the application. When it stops at the break point, work up along the stack trace again.</p>

<p>You have an inherent problem in your question: you assume that it is a good idea, to work from the <em>entry point</em> of your application, down to the bug. But eclipse plugins have more than one entry point (called <em>extension points</em>). Instead using the Bug as a starting point for your research and work towards an entry point is the better approach. This is also true for non-plugin applications with only one entry point.</p>

<p>In some cases it makes sense to work top-down, instead of bottom-up: e.g. if a Button-Click doesn't trigger anything. Then you start at the <code>onClick</code> method of the button and work yourself down though the code, to see why nothing is triggered.</p>
