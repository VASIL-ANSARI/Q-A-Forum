<p>You call memcached::get.</p>

<p>If the return value is not false, your value was in the cache and you now have it and can make use of it.</p>

<p>If the return value is false, it's not in the cache (never was or what was there has expired). Compute the value, save it into your memcache, then continue with your program.</p>

<p>The purpose of the cache is to save you from doing some resource-intensive task by doing it once, then caching it for a while and reusing the value on future requests.</p>
