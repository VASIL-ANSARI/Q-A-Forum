<p>Your <code>spacing</code> value is based on 360 degrees (or <code>Math.PI*2</code> radians).</p>

<p>Your starting value (see the <code>angle</code> calculation) is <code>Math.PI</code> (or 180 degrees).</p>

<p>Your span is therefore 180 degrees to 540 degrees (<code>Math.PI</code> to <code>3*Math.PI</code> radians).</p>

<p>You likely need to change your <code>angle</code> calculation (which should probably be renamed to <code>radians</code>) to have a different starting angle.</p>

<p>You also need to modify your <code>spacing</code> calculation to be based on the number of degrees/radians of your desired arc.</p>
