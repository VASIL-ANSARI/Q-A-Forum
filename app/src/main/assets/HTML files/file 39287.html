<p>To summarize the answer from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1511776/android-developer">@Android-Developer</a> and OP's comment discussion:</p>

<p>Google Play recognizes the app signature of APKs regardless of the installation source. As long as you use the same package name and keystore when generating your APK, Google Play will be able to detect newer versions and trigger an update.</p>

<p>To install the app without logging in to a Google account, enable the "Install from unknown sources" option in Settings. You can disable it once the installation is complete.</p>
