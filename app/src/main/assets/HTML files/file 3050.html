<p>The values of <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html#LENGTH_SHORT" rel="nofollow"><code>LENGTH_SHORT</code></a> and <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html#LENGTH_LONG" rel="nofollow"><code>LENGTH_LONG</code></a> are 0 and 1.  This means they are treated as flags rather than actual durations so I don't think it will be possible to set the duration to anything other than these values.</p>

<p>If you want to display a message to the user for longer, consider a <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html" rel="nofollow">Status Bar Notification</a>.  Status Bar Notifications can be programmatically canceled when they are no longer relevant.</p>
