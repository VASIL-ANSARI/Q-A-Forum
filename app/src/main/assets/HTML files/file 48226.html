<p>What is the data you are storing? Do you get the same problem using a similarly shaped/sized np.randn?</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is probably useful to know that you can assign names to the arrays you store with np.savez by specifying them as kwargs, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>np.savez("File", data_array=data_array)
</code></pre>

<p>then you can use</p>

<pre><code>a = np.load("File.npz") 
b = a['data_array']
</code></pre>

<p>Also, note that (iirc) np.savez compresses files, so the problem might be due to the sheer size of your array, even if the resulting file is not so large.</p>
