<p>That's absolutely not how or why you use a Thread.  First off, if this is the UI thread you should never pause it for 3 seconds.  Second, the entire point of a Thread is to work in parallel.  You never want one thread to pause and wait for another.  If you need something on Thread A to occur only when Thread B is done, you send a message via a handler, semaphore or other method to Thread A when Thread B is done.  </p>

<p>Looking at your code, it seems like you should throw it out and reimplement it with a timer.</p>
