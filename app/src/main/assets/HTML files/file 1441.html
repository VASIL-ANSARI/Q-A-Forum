<p>In the second method you first ask <code>self</code> to dismiss. Then you ask <code>self</code> again to present a new view controller. This is not correct. You want to ask the 'parent' of AnotherViewController to show the UIImagePickerController.</p>

<p>One thing you could try is to move the dismiss <em>after</em> the present.</p>
