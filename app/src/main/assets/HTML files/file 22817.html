<p>You might consider using the Django web framework. You could set up a small app with your python scripts as different views. <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.djangoproject.com/</a></p>

<p>And if you don't want to put that much effort into creating a friendly UI you could use twitter bootstrap.  <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</a></p>

<p>Then just run the app internally to gather and display data either via HTTP GETs or via e-mail.</p>

<p>edit: I'm sorry I did not read carefully "pros and cons are of using C#/WCF vs. something like Django". I recently made a Django app and it was fairly straight forward. </p>
