<p>The validation is more or less the same regardless of the way you configure your <code>ApplicationContext</code>. The validation simply consists of an initial check of the bean relationships. For example, if you declare a bean <code>firstBean</code> which references a bean <code>secondBean</code> in one of its properties, but <code>secondBean</code> isn't declared in the context, then that will cause the container to fail before it even tries to initialize the beans themselves.</p>
