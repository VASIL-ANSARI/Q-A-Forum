<p>Android has removed Permission to read and write bookmark after API>=23. Pls refer this link <a href="https://developer.android.com/intl/ko/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes.html#behavior-bookmark-browser" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/intl/ko/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes.html#behavior-bookmark-browser</a></p>

<p>You have to use workaround in implementing your own browser app and then save bookmarks locally in your own sqllite database. </p>
