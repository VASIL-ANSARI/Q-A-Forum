<p>remove WS_CLIPCHILDREN from your parent windows window style. This will allow the parent window to paint over the real estate of the child window, then the child window will effectively paint over that during it's paint call. The parent window's paint gets called first, then any child windows get their paint called. Good luck Seth!</p>
