<p>The problem was indeed in the version: Maven doesn't have 2.2, although the JOD converter website does. I made a local maven repo by copying the 2.1 POM file into the 2.2 directory automatically created by leiningen, and adjusting the POM with new version info. I pasted in the 2.2 JAR that I got from the website. After that, it worked fine and the missing classes functioned properly. </p>
