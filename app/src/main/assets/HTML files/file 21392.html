<p>The <strong>#</strong> sign is not an issue at all. <code>dialog</code> method is not part of jQuery itself, but it is a part of <a href="http://jqueryui.com/" rel="nofollow">jQuery UI</a>. Did you include jQuery UI library as well, as compatible version of jQuery? Comment out/remove <code>$("#divModal").dialog</code> call and see if everything is fine. I tested this with and without this part and with this line it was not executing the line after the one that was causing error. When I included jQuery UI it started to work.</p>

<p>In general, if you're not sure what could be wrong with your code, try commenting out some parts you think may be causing problems as long as commenting something out/removing will fix the problem. It's much easier to find out what's going on by elimination of possible "trouble-makers" one by one. And, of course, use debugger - for Firefox the <a href="https://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a> extention with JavaScript console is very usefull. You can read error messages that can lead you the the real source of the problem.</p>

<p>And BTW, if you don't want browser to follow clicked link, consider adding <code>return false;</code> to the <code>OnClientClick</code> like that:</p>

<pre><code>lnkDetails.OnClientClick = "openDialog('" + var1 + "');return false;";
</code></pre>
