<p>Why do you want the signal to be an instance method? There doesn't seem to be any reason for it. You just need to ensure that when you write the signal function itself, it passes the relevant instance - eg as an <code>instance</code> kwarg - exactly as the built-in <code>pre-save</code> and <code>post-save</code> signals do.</p>

<p><strong>Added after edit to question</strong> But that is exactly how signals are supposed to work. There's a single signal function, which sends the signal along with any association information, and any number of receivers that listen to the signal. But the receivers themselves aren't associated with particular instances - they can't be, an instance only exists when you actually instantiate it(!) and otherwise it's just a row in a database.</p>

<p>Perhaps your receiver function could query for the relevant objects itself, and update them there - or even better, do an <code>update</code> query to change them in-place.</p>
