<p>One of the biggest problems with this I see is that NSTimer will be consuming time on whatever thread it's registered with.</p>

<p>In most cases for me this is my main thread, sleeping inside of your main thread would be a <em>bad thing</em> as far as I can see.</p>

<p>A few alternative designs that may be better for you.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't sleep.  Have the selector called by the timer do a 'am I paused' check and exit early if it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Invalidate the NSTimer when pausing and recreate it when unpausing (Note: you can't just reschedule the old timer).</p></li>
<li><p>Spawn a background thread with it's own RunLoop or even your own while loop that just handles the rescheduling with sleeping.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Those are also roughly in the order I'd do them, as No. 1 seems the cleanest to me, followed by No.2.  No.3 while viable could introduce a lot of potential nastiness (threading issues, clean shutdowns, etc)</p>
