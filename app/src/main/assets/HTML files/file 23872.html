<p>Your version of Eclipse looks OK, based on the filename.</p>

<p>To check your version of Java, run java -version in a console. On Windows 7 with 64-bit Java 6 I get:</p>

<p>java version "1.6.0_27"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_27-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.2-b06, mixed mode)</p>

<p>Check that this is the version being used by Eclipse, as shown in your error code. If not, call that version explicitly, e.g.</p>

<p>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe" -version</p>
