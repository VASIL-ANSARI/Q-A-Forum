<p>Because of your 5 years of experience with PHP, I would say stick with that. You may not have trouble learning a new language, but you're most likely aware of the intricacies and 'gotchas' of PHP. Also, with PHP you can hit the ground running, versus getting up to speed with Rails.</p>

<p>If you do go with PHP, look at either Symfony or Zend Framework. Both are mature, robust frameworks that should handle most of the heavy lifting for you. I'm suggesting these two versus some of the other well-known frameworks (CakePHP, Code Igniter) because common consensus is that they're easier to extend which quickly becomes invaluable.</p>

<p>Remember that plans rarely work out exactly how you first envision them. You can reduce a lot of potential problems by sticking with a technology you already know.</p>
