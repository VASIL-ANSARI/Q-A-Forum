<p>Looks like you need to adjust your position when you adjust the anchor point.  See this previous post:</p>

<p>The link in that post is old, the new one is here:

<p>Looks like the key sentence is under "Anchor Points Affect Geometric Manipulations" which is "The position property is always specified relative to the layerâs anchor point".</p>
