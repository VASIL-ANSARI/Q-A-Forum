<p>Any android device have a shared directory that can be edited by all the applications. In most of the cases it will be your SD-CARD how ever it dose not have to be like that.</p>

<p>When you mount your device to PC, and use the "mount as driver" option. You should access to this directory from your PC.</p>

<p>How ever in my opinion to improve the user experience you should develop a desktop side application that will communicate with your phone and extract all the data that it needs. Also sending the information using email could be an option.</p>
