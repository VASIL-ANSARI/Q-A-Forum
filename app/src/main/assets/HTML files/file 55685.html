<p>The <code>hasFocus</code> binding works with <code>Document.activeElement</code> to determine which element is in focus:</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/knockout/knockout/blob/master/src/binding/defaultBindings/hasfocus.js#L17" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/knockout/knockout/blob/master/src/binding/defaultBindings/hasfocus.js#L17</a></p>

<pre><code>var ownerDoc = element.ownerDocument;
if ("activeElement" in ownerDoc) {
  var active;
  try {
    active = ownerDoc.activeElement;
  } catch (e) {
    // IE9 throws if you access activeElement during page load (see issue #703)
    active = ownerDoc.body;
  }
  isFocused = (active === element);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When stepping through this binding in your fiddle, I noticed it returns the <code>body</code> element as the document's <code>activeElement</code>, making <code>isFocused</code> to be <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/activeElement" rel="nofollow">MDN documentation</a> page about <code>activeElement</code>, I then read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: On Mac, elements that aren't text input elements tend not to get focus assigned to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, to me, suggests there's simply no support for this binding in a <code>number</code> input.</p>

<p>I'd suggest to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>stick with the text input and add custom up and down buttons and key listeners</li>
<li>create a custom binding that's based on event listeners rather than <code>document.activeElement</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The knockout developers probably had a good reason to stick with the <code>activeElement</code> approach. In their comments they state:</p>

<pre><code>// Where possible, ignore which event was raised and determine focus state using activeElement,
// as this avoids phantom focus/blur events raised when changing tabs in modern browsers.
// However, not all KO-targeted browsers (Firefox 2) support activeElement. For those browsers,
// prevent a loss of focus when changing tabs/windows by setting a flag that prevents hasfocus
// from calling 'blur()' on the element when it loses focus.
// Discussion at https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/pull/352
</code></pre>

<p>So it might be wise to go for the first option...</p>
