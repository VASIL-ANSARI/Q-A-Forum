<p>The <code>-0500</code> at the end isn't milliseconds (the <code>S</code> format character), it's an ISO-8601 timezone indicator (the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html" rel="nofollow"><code>X</code> format character</a>, in current versions of Java; note that it was added relatively recently, in Java 7). The <code>-</code> is part of the timezone indicator, not a separator, so you don't want <code>-</code> in your string.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssX")
</code></pre>

<p>In Java 6 and earlier, you might get by with the <code>Z</code> timezone format character rather than <code>X</code>. But Java 7 came out over three years ago, so...</p>
