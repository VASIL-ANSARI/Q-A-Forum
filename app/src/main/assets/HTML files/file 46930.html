<p>Try unchecking the <strong>under bottom bar property</strong> of the view controller from storyboard. If it doesn't work also uncheck the <strong>Adjust ScrollView Inset</strong> property over there.</p>

<p>Also you must be sure that bottom Layout constraint must be set to Bottom Layout Guide instead of superview.</p>
