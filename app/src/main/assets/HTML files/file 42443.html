<p>Months ago I found out that this problem is well known as c10k problem.<br/>
It has to do amongst other things with how the kernel allocates and processes tcp connections internally.<br/>
The only efficient way to address the issue is to bypass the kernel tcp stack and implement various other low-level things by your own.<br/>
All good approaches I know are working with low-level async implementations<br/>
There are some good ways to deal with the problem depending on the scale.<br/>
For further information i would recommend to search for the c10k problem.</p>
