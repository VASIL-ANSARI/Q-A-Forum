<p>I noticed the same problem when I upgraded to Xcode 5.1  When I ran "xcrun -find clang", it said "You have not agreed to the XCode license agreements.  You must agree to both Xcode license agreements below in order to use Xcode."  It spewed out the agreements and gave me an opportunity to agree, which I did.  And that fixed the problem.  Go figure.</p>
