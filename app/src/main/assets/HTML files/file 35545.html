<p>There's a builtin for that.</p>

<pre><code>'4582'.isdigit() == True
'458dfr'.isdigit() == False
</code></pre>

<p>"Under the hood" this probably looks a lot like:</p>

<pre><code>def isdigit(self):
    return all(ch in "0123456789" for ch in self)
</code></pre>

<p>That said, if you're trying to USE it as an int, just use it as an int.</p>

<pre><code>data = "123456"
try:
    data = int(data)
except ValueError:
    # handle this if your data is not a number
</code></pre>

<p>Never test for something to see if it's able to be transformed THEN try to transform it. This goes for <code>int</code> casts as well as checking for the existence of a file before opening it. It creates a race condition where if <code>data</code> can be turned to a number when you check but then another thread takes over and changes it before it gets cast to <code>int</code> you get an error. Similarly with files if you check that the file exists but something deletes it before it can be opened, you're SOL.</p>

<p>Instead, do the thing you're trying to do, and "ask forgiveness" if it causes an error. It's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow">Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission</a>.</p>
