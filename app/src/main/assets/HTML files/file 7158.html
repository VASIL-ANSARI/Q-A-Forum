<p>Apart from putting a table inside a div itself, or 4 other divs inside the div, there is a CSS3 Grid Column property but it isn't currently supported by any of the major browsers, you can see the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_pr_grid-columns.asp" rel="nofollow">information here</a></p>

<p>The only other alternative I know (that I use in 1 site) is supported in all browsers except for IE, the CSS3 <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_multiple_columns.asp" rel="nofollow">Multiple Columns</a> property. I nest 2 divs inside a container div, 1 top and 1 down then use this property. </p>

<p>I hope it helps.</p>
