<p>From what I understood about your question, you should probably be using <code>whichChart IN %@</code> instead of <code>whichChart = %@</code>.</p>

<p>And also, you should probably just be doing:</p>

<pre><code>[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"whichChart IN %@", listChartToDownload]
</code></pre>
