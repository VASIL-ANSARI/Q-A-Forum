<p>By default, PHP's file-based session handler uses the session ID as part of the filename that the session data is stored in. Storing the ID inside the session data itself would be somewhat redundant. </p>

<p>At best the code snippet would simply verify that the session was properly initialized by your own code, and isn't just some random session that got attached somehow to this user. But ANY key/value pair you store in the session could be used for that - it doesn't have to be the session ID at all. e.g. checking for this:</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['everything is ok'] = "Yay, it's working"
</code></pre>

<p>would be just as good.</p>
