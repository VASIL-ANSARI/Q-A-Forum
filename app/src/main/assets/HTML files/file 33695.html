<p>Server socket will accept only one at a time . </p>

<p>When you have multiple sockets on select i.e after accepting a client if you register that socket for OP_READ event then you might get two keys when accept and read event happens on the two socket.</p>

<p>You will get two or more keys selected only when event happens before executing the statement 
selector.select();</p>

<p>when you are blocking in the select , it will come out after a single event it wont block for multiple events to occur. 
select() blocks until at least one channel is ready for the events you registered for.</p>

<p>In your case you have registered only one server socket . so you will get only one key .
I think this answered your question . </p>
