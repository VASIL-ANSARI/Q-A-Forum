<p>Parameter types and number of parameters - these are the only ways to distinguish overloaded functions. That covers everything related to parameters, including <code>int/int &amp;/int &amp;&amp;</code> distinction, since these are formally different parameter types.</p>

<p>Your <code>const/non-const</code> distinction (and don't forget about <code>volatile</code>) can be considered as part of parameter type even when it is applied to class method, since in that case it really qualifies the implicit <code>this</code> parameter. It is up to you, whether you want to consider this as a parameter-based overloading or as a separate kind of overloading.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by mutable/non-mutable.</p>

<p>It also has to be said that the language specification has a set of rules that define the concept of <em>equivalent parameter declarations</em>, which implies that different (by type) parameter declarations might still be considered equivalent for the purposes of overloading.</p>
