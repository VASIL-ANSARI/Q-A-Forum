<p>When you do this:</p>

<pre><code>thisArmor = baseStats;
</code></pre>

<p>you're <strong>not</strong> making a copy of the "baseStats" object. Since both methods in the module modify and return a reference to that same object, you get the effect you observe.</p>

<p>There are several ways to implement a shallow copy operation for Node; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6089058/nodejs-how-to-clone-a-object">see this Stackoverflow question</a>. With one of those approaches, you'd start those methods off with a local copy of "baseStats".</p>
