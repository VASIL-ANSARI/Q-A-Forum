<p>I'm not sure you could modify your existing regex to match both tables easily, but if you had the second table in a string, you could use:</p>

<pre><code>$string = "PLAIN TEXT TABLE DATA HERE";

preg_match('/Gold\s+(\d+\.\d{2})\s+(\d+\.\d{2})/',$string,$matches);

$goldBid = $matches[1];
$goldAsk = $matches[2];
</code></pre>
