<p>You cannot have no direction arrows with a UIPopover.  If you just want a view that appears than you will need to make your own custom UIView and hide it or turn the alpha to 0 and fade it in when you need it.  As far as view layout goes you can set the frame property of your image views that you are showing to control where they are placed.  </p>
