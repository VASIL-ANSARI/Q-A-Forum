<p>The setup projects available in Visual Studio only cover a tiny subset of the functionality of Windows Installer. Have a look at <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">WiX</a> from Microsoft. It exposes pretty much all Windows Installer functionality without having to buy expensive commercial products. It integrates into Visual Studio, so you can create a "WiX setup project" as easily as a built-in one.</p>
