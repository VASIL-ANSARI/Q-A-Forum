<p>Looks like you are referencing a path in some recipe with <code>\cygdrive\&lt;letter&gt;\...</code>. <code>bash</code> interprets a single backslash as an escape character and therefore ignores the <code>c</code> directly following it.</p>

<p>Solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you want the <code>Makefile</code> to be portable to Unix systems, just write forward slashes in paths like this <code>/cygdrive/&lt;letter&gt;/...</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you instead want the <code>Makefile</code> to be compatible with <code>cmd</code>, too, use double backslashes like <code>\\cygdrive\\&lt;letter\\...</code> -- both <code>bash</code> and <code>cmd</code> will understand this.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, such a path should be in a <code>make</code> variable because it is probably completely different on another machine.</p>
