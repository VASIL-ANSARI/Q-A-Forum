<p>The clientside flow sends the oauth_token in the hash part of the URL (<code>/path?#access_token=abcdef</code>), not in a query part. It is then a good idea for the receiving client to store it in a <code>sessionStorage</code> (or something else) and finally use <code>window.location.hash = '';</code> to remove it from the URL.</p>
