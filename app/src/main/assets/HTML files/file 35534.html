<p>Adding my own answer in the incredibly small chance someone else has a similar problem.  </p>

<p>Our many various projects had wildly differing .net versionsâ3.5, 4.0 and 4.5.  As such, with NuGet trying to sort out which version to give which project, it turns out the compiler thought I was on an older version of the AWSSDK that had this timeout property on the PutObjectRequest object, while at runtime we were hitting the most recent, which does <em>not</em> have this property, hence the runtime error. </p>
