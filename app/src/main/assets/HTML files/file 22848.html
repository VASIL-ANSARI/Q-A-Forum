<p>NoClassDefFoundError means class is found at compile time but not at run time, so it's thrown by JRE. </p>

<p>In your case problem is about the <strong>tilesConfigurer</strong> bean not about the <strong>SpringWildcardServletTilesApplicationContext</strong> class. Make sure bean's all superclasses and dependent jars of these superclasses are included.</p>

<p>Also you can check classpath with <a href="http://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-print-out-the-current-project-classpath/" rel="nofollow">SystemClassLoader</a>.</p>
