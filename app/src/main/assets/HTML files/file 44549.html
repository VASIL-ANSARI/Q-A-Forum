<p>Your goal may not be unreachable, but it is certainly not a easy one. While GWT-compile the <em>com.google.gwt.i18n.rebind.LocalizableGenerator</em> is invoked and performs its I18N-magic. This involves checking the keys which is causing the stated exception. The good news is that generator are very powerful and you can roll your custom implementation. The bad news is that generators are somewhat complicate to write and not very well documented. The <a href="http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodingBasicsDeferred.html#generators" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a> mentions generators just briefly.</p>

<p>So in a first attempt I would suggest to replace the default <em>LocalizableGenerator</em> with your own version. In your own version of the generator you can then suppress the exception and add your own resource loading logic (you may end up overriding some more classes...). I'm quite sure you can override what generator is called in your local module configuration (the XML file). Although I have not tried it.</p>

<p>If that fails, the only option I see is to run your own I18N implementation. I mean a complete one, your own annotations with custom generators and linkers to create the necessary output...</p>
