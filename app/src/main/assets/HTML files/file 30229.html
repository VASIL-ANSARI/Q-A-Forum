<p>HTMLPurifier logically will remove any iframe, so it cannot work. Why not create a new HTML tag, specific to your website for this. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;yourwebsite-music source="hulkshare" id="1234"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you set HTMLpurifier to leave this tag and your render it yourself using PHP (by replacing the tag with an iframe). Doing so will also allow you to add other media sources later on, and it gives you more control over what's happening in user's posts.</p>
