<p>Once clear the issue with the class, there are only 2 issues pending.
The background position should be left instead of center, and the selector for the a doesn't work. You can keep the style that you where using for the previous elements, it is even more clear:</p>

<pre><code>.header nav &gt; ul &gt; li:first-of-type {
    background: url('http://placekitten.com/20/60') no-repeat left top;
    -webkit-transition: background-position 0.3s ease-in; 
    -moz-transition: background-position 0.3s ease-in; 
    -o-transition: background-position 0.3s ease-in; 
    transition: background-position 0.3s ease-in; 
}


.header nav &gt; ul &gt; li:first-of-type:hover {
    background-position: left bottom;
}

.header nav &gt; ul &gt; li:first-of-type a {
    color: transparent;
}
</code></pre>

<p>BTW, the important was not necessary</p>

<p>(Just change the kitten image for another that fits better)</p>
