<p>If there is no possibility of overflow, the overflow-safe way of computing the midpoint is technically unnecessary: you can use the unsafe formula if you wish. However, it's probably a good idea to keep it there anyway, in case that your program gets modified some day to break your assumptions. I think that adding a single CPU instruction to make your code future-proof is a great investment in maintainability of your code.</p>
