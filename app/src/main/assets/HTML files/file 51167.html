<p>You can try this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#q1').load('christmas_quiz/quiz_q1.html', function() {
    $(this).ready(function(){
        $('#q1').slideDown(1600);    
    })      
});
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>While JavaScript provides the load event for executing code when a
  page is rendered, this event does not get triggered until all assets
  such as images have been completely received. In most cases, the
  script can be run as soon as the DOM hierarchy has been fully
  constructed. The handler passed to .ready() is guaranteed to be
  executed after the DOM is ready, so this is usually the best place to
  attach all other event handlers and run other jQuery code. When using
  scripts that rely on the value of CSS style properties, it's important
  to reference external stylesheets or embed style elements before
  referencing the scripts.</p>
