<p>When <code>Integer.parseInt</code> is called and <code>null</code> is returned, this means that the string has 0 length. I would check the elements of the array before you pass them into the <code>parseInt</code> method.</p>

<p>FYI, here is the relevant section from the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first argument is null or is a string of length zero.</p>
