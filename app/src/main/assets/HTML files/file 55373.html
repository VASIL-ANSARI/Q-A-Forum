<p>It does not work because the bundle extension's load method responsibility to load service configuration related to the bundle it belongs to and only for that. The container you get as the argument of the load method is just a copy of the app container, it does not contains everything (only just parameters) <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/bundles/extension.html#using-the-load-method" rel="nofollow">[#using-the-load-method]</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using the load() Method</p>
  
  <p>In the load() method, all services and parameters related to this extension will be loaded. This method doesn't get the actual container instance, but a copy. This container only has the parameters from the actual container. After loading the services and parameters, the copy will be merged into the actual container, to ensure all services and parameters are also added to the actual container.</p>

<p>As you said you can use the prepend method to provide a sensible default configuration for other bundles and ease the use of yours <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/bundles/prepend_extension.html" rel="nofollow">[prepend_extension]</a>.</p>
