<p>You call it the same way you call any other method.  You write the name and pass it the arguments it expects:</p>

<pre><code>Main(string[]{});
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want the program to continue doing what it was doing after it finishes calling <code>Main</code>, you'd want to make sure that it stops executing gracefully after that point.</p>

<p>Having said all of that, making <code>Main</code> recursive isn't exactly a solution to that problem that I would advise.  I'd strongly suggest simply applying a loop in your main method that continually performs the logic that you have until you want it to stop, and have each iteration of the loop finish when you either need to restart, or are completely done.</p>
