<p>You're doing the right thing (<code>fgets</code>) int the first few prompts, then you switch to <code>scanf</code> which is the source of your problem. Use <code>fgets</code> (and <code>strtol</code>) instead of <code>scanf</code> and you will be fine. (And, the first <code>scanf</code> which causes the problem described in your question.)</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>scanf</code> <em>only</em> reads the digit part of whatever you enter. That means if you type <kbd>1</kbd><kbd>2</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd>, then the <code>scanf</code> reads the <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> but leaves the <code>Enter</code> in the input buffer for the next call to <code>fgets</code> or <code>scanf</code>. On the other hand, <code>fgets</code> reads everything you type including the <code>Enter</code>, avoiding this problem.</p>
