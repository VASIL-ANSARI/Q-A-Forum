<p>THis means you don't have mod_rewrite enabled in your server. See: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10144634/htaccess-invalid-command-rewriteengine-perhaps-misspelled-or-defined-by-a-m/10144709#10144709">.htaccess: Invalid command &#39;RewriteEngine&#39;, perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration</a></p>

<p>You need to either turn it on using </p>

<pre><code>sudo a2enmod rewrite &amp;&amp; sudo service apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>if you're using ubuntu, or edit your <code>httpd.conf</code> file and uncomment the mod rewrite line.</p>
