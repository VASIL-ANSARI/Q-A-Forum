<p>I got mine working now!! Not really sure what I did, at all, but I just deleted the Xcode 8 .app entirely and then I redownloaded it, opened up my project in it, did a pod install and pod update, and it's running in the simulator just like normal! Not sure what I did at all, but redownloading is worth a try, it is in fact possible to fix.</p>
