<pre><code>var result = (from c in dbContext.Course
             select c).First();
if(!result.Department.IsLoaded)
   {
      result.Department.Load(); //this will load the course.Department navigation property

   }

//Assuming you have 1 - 1 relationship with course to department
string departmentName = result.Department.Name;
</code></pre>

<p>or if you have 1 - M relationship with the department then:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(Department d in result.Department)
{
Console.WriteLine(d.Name);
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: 
<br/> Instead of trying to load Department do the following</p>

<pre><code>if(!result.DepartmentReference.IsLoaded)
{
result.DepartmentReference.Load()
}
</code></pre>
