<p>I don't know much about the specifics of the Java implementation.  However, based on my experience working with a compiler for a different language, I think that since a class can extend only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces, the process of searching for the right method may take slightly longer since there's some additional complexity in the data structures needed to support dynamic dispatch.  So this result doesn't surprise me.  </p>
