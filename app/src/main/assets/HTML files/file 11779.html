<p><code>findViewById</code> will find a view within the object you call it on. Usually it's called on an activity, but can also be called on any <code>ViewGroup</code> that has children.</p>

<p>On your case, you call it on a <code>Button</code> object. I doubt this button contains a child with id <code>R.id.classmode</code>.</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>c.findViewById(R.id.classmode)
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: you should post a LogCat with the actual exception you're getting, else we're only guessing)</p>
