<p>SQL server should be able to handle update of a text field fast enough so that it would not lead to concurrency issues. I would advise you to use a profiler and figure out where exactly the latency is. </p>

<p>After doing that, if you still wish to queue your calls, I am not sure whether it could be done by queuing ajax, as ajax are handled in IIS worker processes in a multi-threaded environment.
Having said that, there is the option of implementing your own process queue, using singleton pattern.</p>

<p>In this case, you will create a static class in the application scope which will implement a command list. Your Ajax post handler will register the SQL command with the list and immediately exit. The class itself will process each command off the list in a serial fashion on a separate thread.</p>

<p>As you can see, you will have to do a bit of plumbing to get it working, so the best option may still be to figure why sql server (or any intermediate layer) is taking longer than it should to process the query.</p>
