<p>I'm not completely sure, but I think it was a memory issue.  I found a way (from another stackoverflow entry) to delete variables I don't need.  Per my example above, if I only want to keep 'time_' and parameters 'a_','b_','c_','d_' and 'e_', I run the following at the end of my main code:</p>

<pre><code>graph_array = np.array([time_, a_, b_, c_, d_, e_])

#Delete variables that aren't going to be plotted in order to free up memory
attributes = sys.modules[__name__]

for name in dir():
   if name[0]!='_' and np.all( name!= np.array(['graph_array', 'attributes','np', 'gc', 'graph_parameters']) ):
     delattr(attributes, name)

gc.collect()

graph_parameters(*graph_array)
</code></pre>

<p>Basically what the for loop does is keep private and magical function names and names of specified variables, and deletes all other names.  I got this idea from the answer to the following link. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3543833/how-do-i-clear-all-variables-in-the-middle-of-a-python-script">How do I clear all variables in the middle of a Python script?</a></p>

<p>I watched my task manager as the code ran, and there was a significant drop in memory usage (~1,600,000 K to ~100,000 K) by Python right before plots began being saved, indicating that this method did free up memory.  Also, no crash.       </p>
