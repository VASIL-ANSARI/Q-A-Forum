<p>To find infinite loops, I do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the page</li>
<li>Open dev tools</li>
<li>Set a breakpoint for the function that i believe is causing the problems</li>
<li>Reload the page (this way, you can break on the first time the function is called, often helpful)</li>
<li>Perform the action</li>
<li>Debug as normal (step, continue etc..)</li>
</ol>

<p>To view the function call stack, click the "Sources" tab at the top of chrome's dev tools. When your program hits your break point, or you click the pause button (looks like this: | |), you can click the triangle "call stack" item on the right panel. This will show you what functions are currently on the stack.</p>

<p>To view the actual stack with variable data, you need to record a profile or a timeline. To record a profile, click the "profile" tab, and click "take heap snapshot". I like to wait until my program has hit the break point for the area i believe is the problem, then take a snapshot. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/tips-and-tricks#three-snapshot-technique" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for details on snapshotting. </p>

<p>Recording a timeline can be helpful to. Timelines let you record all the events, frames, and memory allocations that occur over a time period. To take one, click the Timeline tab. Then, click the black circular icon at the bottom, next to the magnifying-glass icon. The icon will turn red, indicating that it is recording. At this point, you should perform the action you believe is causing the trouble, and immediately after, click the button again to stop the recording. Combining the timeline with standard debugging techniques allows you perform a rather nifty trick. You can set breakpoints, start recording a timeline, and then manually step through your code. This allows you to pause execution of your code, stop recording the timeline, and review what's going on.</p>
