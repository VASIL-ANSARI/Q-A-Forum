<p>if you use url segment is correct. It wont show error it call the class and its function no need to create a route for that. For example</p>

<pre><code>domainName.com/myClass/firstFunction
</code></pre>

<p>from above code my class name is <code>myClass</code> so it call the class if the class exist then it goes to the function that is <code>firstFunction</code> and execute that function.</p>

<p>If you want to hide the class name and function name then the route helps in this case</p>

<pre><code>domainName.com/home/homeFunction
</code></pre>

<p>And my route as follows</p>

<pre><code>$route['home/homeFunction'] = 'myClass/firstFunction';
</code></pre>

<p>I hope you understand this... If you still have doubt on this I'm happy to guide you...</p>
