<p>If there are only a few pages you could just leave them there with <code>Response.StatusCode = 410</code> and a simple <code>window.location = basepage</code>.  </p>

<p>If it is a dynamic list that can grow large i would put it in your application error handler:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_Error(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (/*requesting a deleted resource*/) 
    {
        //return status 410 and a javascript redirect
    }
}
</code></pre>
