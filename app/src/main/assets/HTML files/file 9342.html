<p>It's not clear from the documentation whether you can have child views in a <code>&lt;fragment&gt;</code>. Given none of the fragment samples do this then I suspect it is not the way that they are meant to be used. You could try changing <code>&lt;fragment&gt;</code> into a <code>&lt;FrameLayout&gt;</code> and adding the fragment into it at run-time if you really want to, to see if that works.</p>

<p>However, I think your best solution is to put your child views into a separate layout file and then in <code>onCreateView</code> inflate into the fragment's container via say:</p>

<pre><code>final View iv = inflater.inflate(R.layout.favourites, container, false);
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think that you will lose anything as a result of doing it this way.</p>
