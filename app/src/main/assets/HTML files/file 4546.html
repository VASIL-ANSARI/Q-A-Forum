<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Enumeration.html" rel="nofollow">scala.Enumeration</a> does exactly what you want already.</p>

<p>I think you may be confused by Scala 2.7 versus Scala 2.8. The old question you cite about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1321745/scala-doesnt-have-enums-what-to-use-instead-of-an-enum">emulating Java's <code>enum</code></a> was written in the days of Scala 2.7, and though I can't go test what functionality Scala 2.7's <code>Enumeration</code>s posessed, Scala 2.8's <code>Enumeration</code>s certainly possess everything you're looking for.</p>

<p>You can't define values with <code>object SUNDAY extends Value(1)</code> because <code>object</code>s are initialized lazily.</p>
