<p>I think you can do it simpler, by just creating something like:</p>

<p><code>protected GraphicObject getNewInstance ( GraphicObject decoratedGraphic ){
   ...
}</code></p>

<p>inside your <code>GraphicObject</code> class, so every class inhereting it will have this method, and you can call it directly from the object.</p>
