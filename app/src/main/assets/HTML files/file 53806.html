<p><code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec()</code> runs <code>/bin/sh -c &lt;command&gt;</code>. If this is or points to a bash shell on your system: A non-interactive bash does not read <code>.bash_profile</code> unless explicitly (<code>--login</code>) told to do so.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html#Bash-Startup-Files" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a little convoluted, but non-interactive, non-login bash instances don't read the profile files. </p>

<p>Your path settings does not get picked up by the subshell (which is actually <code>/bin/sh</code> which <strong>might not even be bash at all</strong>).</p>

<p>If you want, you can add the path to <code>adb</code> system wide by adding an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/path_helper.8.html" rel="nofollow">appropriate entry to to <code>/etc/paths.d</code></a>.</p>
