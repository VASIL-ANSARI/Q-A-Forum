<p>Finally my program has successfully ran. The only mistake i done in my project is to include the mismatched java runtime environment in my project. I have installed jdk1.7 and i had used the 1.4 complient version of the facet in my eclipse ide. After changing the java compiler path to 1.4 version in my project properties i got my error cleared in my project. Thank you.</p>
