<p>without being able to see the rest of the code for the page, it's tough to tell, but I think it 'be because you have nested labels and the outer one doesn't refresh until the page does.</p>

<p>Remember that the Label is used as text for an associated input box such as a textbox or dropdown, so it's not really being used properly here.  </p>

<p>Try removing the outer label, changing the inner on to a Literal, and then modifying changing the function to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:Panel ID="LoggedInPanel" runat="server" visible="False"&gt;
    &lt;asp:Literal ID="UserLoggedInName" runat="server" /&gt;
    - &lt;asp:HyperLink ID="LogOutLink" runat="server"&gt;Log out&lt;/asp:HyperLink&gt;
&lt;/asp:Label&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>LoggedInPanel.Visible = isUserLoggedIn;    
if (isUserLoggedIn)
        {
            UserLoggedInName.Text = String.Format("Logged in as: {0}",AuthHelper.getUserLoggedIn(Session).ToString());
// Set the logout URL here.
        }
</code></pre>
