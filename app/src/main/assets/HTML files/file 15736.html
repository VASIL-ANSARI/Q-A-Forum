<blockquote>
  <p>You will see that you need to: - Load the page - Choose subject area from pull down - Choose quarter from pull down - Choose class level from pull down - Trigger the search button</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ie. a POST request</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I have a few scripts to extract the data from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then all you need is the list of topics, quarters and levels, which you can get similarly from the same page.</p>

<p>you need an http library - curl, http components, whatever - and a loop.</p>
