<p><strong>Either</strong> </p>

<p>Add a length limit that is high but not dangerously high - e.g. 128 chars is more than most real people will ever use <strong>but</strong> add an appeals process, i.e. a link that people can click to request specific exceptions from a human being,</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong> </p>

<p>Have a javascript element compute the hash client side and only submit the hash - this is better for security anyway as the password never leaves the client.</p>
