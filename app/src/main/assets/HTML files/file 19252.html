<p>Inserting data into a database is really quite simple.</p>

<p>try:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$connect = mysql_connect("databaseserver", "username", "password");
if(!$connect)
{
echo 'Error';
}
mysql_select_db("databasename", $connect);
$fname = 'Tim';
$lname = 'Powell';
$email = 'tpowell@powellintellabs.com';
mysql_query("INSERT * INTO table (fname, lname, email) VALUES('$fname', '$lname', '$email')");
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This should insert information into the database "databasename" and the table "table". Also, if you're not familiar with databases, something has to be unique. If you name a column "id" as your primary key and set it to auto increment, it makes it a lot easier. You might want to also look into preventing mysql injection attacks. Let me know if it helps.</p>
