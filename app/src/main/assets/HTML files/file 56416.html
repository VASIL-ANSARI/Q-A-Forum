<p>You can set activities in CRM regarding any entity that has been enabled for activities. Out of the box Account, Contact, and Case (the display name for Incident) are all among the activity enabled entities.</p>

<p>It does not matter that we are talking about a custom activity: Any activity can be set regarding any activity enabled entity.</p>

<p>You should thus already be able to set RegardingObjectId to either Account, Contact, or Case (though only one at a time).</p>

<p>As I understand it, you want to have a lookup to either Account or Contact while on the same CustomActivity also having a reference to a Case. It is not possible to have multiple regarding-style fields. Instead, you can add a normal 1:N-relationship from Case to your CustomActivity and add that as a lookup field on your CustomActivity form. In that way the regarding-field would be used for Account/Contact, while the lookup would be used for Case.</p>
