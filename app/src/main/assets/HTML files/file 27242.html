<p>It's look like you are setting the variable before the record saves, so there is no record to set the variable with at that point. If you move the line down a few spaces, it should work.</p>

<pre><code>def create
  @skid = Skid.new(params[:skid])

  # Create record in the database, and return an appropriate message
  respond_to do |format|
  if @skid.save
    count = params[:skid_count].to_i    # if the record saves, create variable with the new params
    for i in 1..count                   # do your magic
      Skid.new(params[:skid]).save
    end
</code></pre>
