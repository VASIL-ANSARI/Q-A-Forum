<p>Just revisited this.  I saw in the Safari Web Inspector that I was getting a 500 error when trying to persist the account.  It just wasn't showing anything on the screen.  As per this post, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6101691/codeigniter-and-doctrine-500-internal-error">Codeigniter and Doctrine 500 internal error</a>, I wrapped everything in a try catch using \Exception instead of Exception and was able to get details about why it was crashing.</p>

<pre><code> try{
      ...
 }catch (\Exception $e) {            
      echo "&lt;pre&gt;Error: " . $e . "&lt;/pre&gt;";
 }
</code></pre>
