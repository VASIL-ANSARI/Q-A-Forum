<p>I think you can use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html#deleteIntent" rel="nofollow">deleteIntent</a> of <code>Notification</code> class.</p>

<p>I remember in one of my application I use use to fire a Broadcast (custom Broadcast) when a notification is cancelled or the Notification tray was cleared.</p>
