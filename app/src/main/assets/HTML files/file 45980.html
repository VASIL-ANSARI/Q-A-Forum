<p>Based on the limited information you've provided, your mDrawerLayout member is null.</p>

<p>This can happen if you have multiple versions of the same layout file in different layout folders that are inconsistent with one another.</p>

<p>I suspect you have a layout file named main_activity.xml in your res/layout folder that has declared a DrawerLayout view with the id main_DrawerLayout, and another version of this layout file (perhaps in your res/layout-land folder) that either does not have this DrawerLayout view, or has it but declared with a different view id.</p>

<p>As a result findViewById(R.id.main_DrawerLayout) is returning null from one of your alternate main_activity.xml layouts and you are getting a NullPointerException as a result.</p>
