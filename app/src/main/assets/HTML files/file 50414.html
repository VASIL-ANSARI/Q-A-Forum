<p>Looking at your constraints the conflict is that </p>

<p>The imageview height is set to 40, it is pinned to the top and bottom of the cell, while the cell height is 56. how big do you want the imageview 40 or 56?</p>

<p>You can solve this by removing the top and bottom constraints and just do a center vertical to the cell constraint. i.e. ImageView.centerY = centerY</p>

<p>Here's modified constraints for your project on the image view
