<p>Your primary concerns will be "is it ok if the user has my source code?" Usually it is fine, as users can deobfuscate things anyways.</p>

<p>That said, if you're using Sentry, you can actually use the <a href="https://gist.github.com/dcramer/619d53dabfbc2ed008a1" rel="nofollow">releases API</a> to avoid this problem. You'll still need to generate the artifacts, and set URLs (or something that the API can handle), but you don't have to expose them to the internet.</p>
