<p>Variables in the page are local to the instance of the <code>Page</code> class, and the instance is only used to handle one request. When you make a postback and the next request comes for the page, a new instance of the Page class is created, so you will get a brand new variable which starts out at zero.</p>

<p>To keep the value between requests, you either have to store it in a session variable, in the ViewState, in a cookie, or a hidden field in the form.</p>
