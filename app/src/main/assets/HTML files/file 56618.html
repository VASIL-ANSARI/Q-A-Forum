<p>I've determined the problem, and it's from using group.</p>

<p>By passing the chain signature an argument, it's automatically applied asynchronously. By using group, I'm grouping the asyncResult object, which doesn't make any sense. I've altered the execution thusly:</p>

<pre><code>def run_process(self, resource_generator, chain_signature):
    for resources in resource_generator:
        chain_signature(resources)
</code></pre>

<p>This effectively does what I wanted anyway.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
