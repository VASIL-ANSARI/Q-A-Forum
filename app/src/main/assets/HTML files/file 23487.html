<p>This is with reference to your fiddle:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * -- or whatever is your columns list.
  FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.Department_ID = d.id
 WHERE (e.Department_ID, e.Salary) IN (SELECT Department_ID, MAX(Salary)
                                         FROM employees
                                     GROUP BY Department_ID)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned in a comment below, if you want to see the IT department also, with all <code>NULL</code> for the employee records, you can use the <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> and put the filter condition in the joining clause itself as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.name -- or whatever is your columns list.
  FROM employees e RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.Department_ID = d.id
   AND (e.Department_ID, e.Salary) IN (SELECT Department_ID, MAX(Salary)
                                         FROM employees
                                     GROUP BY Department_ID)
</code></pre>
