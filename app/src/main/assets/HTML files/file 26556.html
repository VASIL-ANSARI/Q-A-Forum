<p>It seems that you have an error in your <code>.aspx</code> file which is triggered when you launch <code>this.DataBind()</code> in your <code>PageLoad()</code>. </p>

<p>I think that you are trying to get the parameter <code>value</code> from am object which is null, something like <code>&lt;%# YourObject.value %&gt;</code> and <code>YourObject</code> is null. After that you get <code>ArgumentNullException</code>. </p>

<p>Search your <code>.aspx</code> for the <code>value</code> and make sure that every instance of the owner is not null.</p>
