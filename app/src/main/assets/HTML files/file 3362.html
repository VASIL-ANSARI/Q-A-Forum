<p>You can't as far as I know. I'm not sure that Where is valid on a <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/fabio-maulo/nhibernate-chapter-6/1nr4enxv3dpeq/9#6%282E%293%282E%29%28C2%29%28A0%29Collections_of_Values_and_Many%282D%29To%282D%29Many_Associations" rel="nofollow">many-to-many</a> association.</p>

<p>I would handle this by creating an extension method on <code>IEnumerable&lt;Image&gt;</code> to allow easy filtering on image type. Then you could call Images.Landscape(), e.g., on any Images collection.</p>
