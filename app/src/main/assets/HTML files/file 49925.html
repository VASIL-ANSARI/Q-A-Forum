<p>Based on requirement 1, you'd have to <code>Add(Base c)</code> and determine the collection to add to from there. e.g. <code>(c is Teacher ? staff : students).Add(c)</code>. Normally such a class would have overloads (<code>Add(Teacher)</code> <code>and Add(Student)</code>) separately as well to be able to add directly.</p>

<pre><code>public void Add(Base c) 
{
    if(c is Teacher)
        staff.Add((Teacher)c);
    else
        students.Add((Student)c);
}
</code></pre>

<p>2 depends on the output type. With assignments outputting to the console is often enough, so you can use something like</p>

<pre><code>void Print(params Base[] peeps)
{
    foreach(var c in peeps)
       c.Print();
}
</code></pre>

<p>No matter how Print is implemented, step 3 is actually very easy. You can just call your Print(Base[]) as stated in the requirements. To get that array, you have to determine which collection to use, just as in req. 1. (it does sound like 2 separate collections are wanted, otherwise a single collection could be used where Base exposes the role of the person).</p>

<pre><code>public void Print(bool students = true)
{
    if(students)
       Print(this.students.ToArray());
    else
       Print(staff.ToArray());
}
</code></pre>

<p>PS, as mentioned in the comments the Students and Staff properties seem to expose some behavior that could be changed, but since that outside the scope of the question, won't go there unless you want us to ;)</p>
