<p>The connectivity status of your mobile device can change very often and unforeseeably, so checking it often is advisable.</p>

<p>Say, for example, that you check at app startup, and find that not network is available. You go to offline mode, but then in a few minutes you could get in a WI-FI area or your 3G signal might be stronger. If you don't check it again, you lose the possibility of going to online mode.</p>

<p>Indeed, checking for network availability is pretty fast compared to how long a network request lasts (say: sending a login request and waiting for the response), so you can safely do the check whenever you need it according to your policy, be it at each request, every 5 minutes, or whatever.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>about your concern as to the approval process: you should ensure that your app has a reasonable behavior when no connection it available. Simply showing an alert to the user (and not crashing) is enough for Apple, but you could also resort to disabling all your network related buttons, or whatever fits your app. The idea is that your app should not behave crazily when no connection is available.</p>

<p>If you want more advanced behavior, you can check reachability with each request.</p>

<p>You can also use the Reachability notification service (ASIHTTP-bundled Reachability includes that feature). You can find an how-to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1861656/iphone-reachability-checking">here</a>. But in my opinion is a bit easier to just do the check when you need it. YMMV</p>
