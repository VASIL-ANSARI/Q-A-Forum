<p>You need something server side to integrate with the socket.io script on the client side. The servers that I know that are written in Python and do this all use Tornado. You could look at an implementation like, Tornadio (<a href="https://github.com/MrJoes/tornadio" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/MrJoes/tornadio</a>) and see what methods and classes they used to hook Tornadio and Tornado together. This would give you a pretty good idea of how to integrate it with your twisted.web server. </p>

<p>We've just switched away from socket.io to <a href="https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client" rel="nofollow">sockJS</a> (which is also compatible with Tornado) and have seen large performance improvements. </p>
