<p>On executing the program, there is no output. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>for(short i=1;i&lt;5;i++)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement declares and initializes the variable i to 1, checks if it is less than 5 and then moves on to the next statement</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>for(j=0;j&gt;0;j--)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement initializes j to 0 (Note that j has to be declared previously), and then checks if j is greater than 0. As j isn't greater than 0, it doesn't move on to the next statement, i.e. <code>cout&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;"\t";</code> and continues the previous loop, the loop with the variable <code>i</code>. </p>

<p>The <code>i</code>- loop runs 4 times, and since anything isn't actually printed to the screen, you don't get any output.</p>
