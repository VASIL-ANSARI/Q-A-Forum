<p>Dont use <code>slideToggle()</code>, use <code>slideUp()</code> instead ;)</p>

<p>SlideToggel will slide eveything that is up down and everything that is down up.</p>

<p>You want everything to slide up so use slideUp()</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I modified your jsfiddle, and got it working. When a user clicks the button 'show all' it will check what the text is. So in this case 'show all' and it will all slideDown. It then changes the text to 'hide all'. If the user clicks on 'hide all', it will all slideUp. If you use slideToggle in this case, it will work also <strong>BUT</strong> if a user clicks on a question title, and it opens and then clicks on the show all it will <strong>CLOSE</strong> the question title that was clicked on and open all the others!</p>
