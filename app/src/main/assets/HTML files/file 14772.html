<p>Try This  </p>

<pre><code>- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event 
{
  UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];

  // Get the specific point that was touched
  CGPoint point = [touch locationInView:self.view]; 
  NSLog(@"X location: %f", point.x);
  NSLog(@"Y Location: %f",point.y);

}
</code></pre>

<p>You can use "touchesEnded" if you'd rather see where the user lifted their finger off the screen instead of where they touched down.</p>
