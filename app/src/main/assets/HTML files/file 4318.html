<p>Just read the excellent and thorough <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/" rel="nofollow">Django tutorial</a>. Django comes with a built-in simple web-server that you can run your websites on. It's just a Python script you run, and then you go to a port on <code>localhost</code> (by default port 8000). It's really quite simple and well-explained in the tutorial.</p>

<p>Specifically, look at the section named "The development server" in the page I linked to.</p>

<p>Personally I found this basic web-server to be very useful for all stages of website development. </p>
