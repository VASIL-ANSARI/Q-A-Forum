<p>There is no need to create another input field in html if data is not put by user. You can add child to your xml file.</p>

<p>add this line </p>

<pre><code>$xml-&gt;reports-&gt;addChild('time', date("Y-m-d H:i:s",time()-60*60));
</code></pre>

<p>this will add date which is one hour back as you suggested in comments. You can change date format to fit your needs. To find how to do it you can check <a href="http://pl1.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php" rel="nofollow">Date() in manual</a></p>
