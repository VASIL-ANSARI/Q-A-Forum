<p>Without seeing all of the code it's hard to tell, but I believe that the page is doing a <code>PostBack</code> when you click the linkbutton. When the page does a postback, it refreshes and therefore your <code>ModalPopupExtender</code> won't show. I think you're looking for and <code>Ajax</code> call to do what you want, which I'm pretty sure is showing a wait window while processing data.</p>
