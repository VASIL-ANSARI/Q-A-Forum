<p>The typical way to handle these are just:</p>

<pre><code>for line in fileobj:
    process(line)
</code></pre>

<p>There's no way to actually specify that <code>read</code> ends at the end of a line.  You could do something kludgy with <code>fileobj.seek</code>.  Basically, you'd read N bytes, find the last newline in the returned string (using <code>string.rfind</code>) you could seek backward that many bytes. </p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, if you have sufficient memory, you can read the entire file in at once:</p>

<pre><code>list_of_lines = fileobj.readlines()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>However, I'm really not positive that you'll see any noticeable speedup here.  Are you sure you're not optimizing before you need to?</p>
