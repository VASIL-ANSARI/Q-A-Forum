<p>Yes, you should prefer the JSR305 annotation if possible. Why? Because the JSR305 is a standard and it makes total sense to stick to the standards where possible. While porting my own applications I did not notice any problems or changes in behavior. Moreover, you can even define your own @NotNull annotation and findbugs will pick it up (as long as you name it NotNull) see <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/tor/entry/more_on_nullness" rel="nofollow">this blog entry for more details</a>.</p>

<p>As far as I can see by looking at the sources, findbugs is using the same analysis methods internally. The dispatching is done only based on the annotations name. As mentioned in the <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/tor/entry/more_on_nullness" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> linked above, have a look at the <strong>edu.umd.cs.findbugs.ba.NullnessAnnotation</strong> and <strong>NullnessAnnotationDatabase</strong> classes to get an initial view how this is done internally. Have a look at this package and you'll  find similar classes for the other annotations like the jcip ones.</p>

<p>So from an implementations point of view it really doesn't matter. For everybody still not sure which annotations to use I would consider using the standard annotations or self defined ones to avoid their code being dependent on the findbugs library.</p>
