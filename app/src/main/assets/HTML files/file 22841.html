<p>You should move </p>

<pre><code>Intent casesActivity = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), CasesActivity.class);
            startActivity(casesActivity);
            }else{
                Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(),"Incorrect Details",     Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            }
</code></pre>

<p>into LoginService's onPostExecute.</p>

<p>In this way you are sure the asynctask has finished its work.</p>

<p>In any case it's quite strange the other activity gets started, it might be because of an old assignement of loginSuccess to true</p>
