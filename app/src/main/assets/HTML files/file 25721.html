<p>I think the main problem here is that your execution task is executing in the main UI thread. In order to let UI thread do animation you need to push your <code>doFancyStuff()</code> function into something like <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2.2.1/#!/api/Ext.util.DelayedTask" rel="nofollow">http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2.2.1/#!/api/Ext.util.DelayedTask</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind though, that you would need to revert it your icon only after fancy stuff is complete.</p>
