<p>According to my reading of the manual, ProGuard <em>does</em> leave out unused classes for the JAR files that it process.  So I suspect that you are not processing the <code>pdfbox.jar</code> file; i.e. you just have it on the classpath.</p>

<hr>

<p>I recommend that you run Proguard from a script rather than the GUI.  This will allow you to incorporate the obfuscation step into your main build scripts, version control the scripts and ... show other people the script to get their advice / help.</p>
