<p>You should break the problem in two.  After writing, IF you defined part of your schema OR use te ASSUME keyword on the commandline cli, view the data in cassandra to see if it is correct.  PlayOrm has this EXACT unit test(which is on PlayOrm on top of astyanax not hector) and it works just fine....Notice the comparison in the test of -200.23...</p>

<p>Once down, does your data in cassandra look correct?  If so, the issue is on your reading the value in code, otherwise, it is the writes.</p>
