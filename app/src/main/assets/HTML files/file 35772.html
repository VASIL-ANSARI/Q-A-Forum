<p>OK, it turns out that the problems where related to database tables, when the application starts it was loading clients and role actions. There was a miss match on one of the tables, so the application was throwing an exception.</p>

<p>On the development database the tables where fine, but on the testing database the tables had the issue above, this is why it was hard to catch at first, but when I pointed the connection strings on development from the development database to the testing database I was able to catch and fix the issue.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses.</p>
