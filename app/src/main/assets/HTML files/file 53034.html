<p>You need to set the Linker Search Paths of the project for both your debug and release builds.</p>

<p>You can set to be something like: <code>$(PROJECT_DIR)/Library/Frameworks</code></p>

<p>Use the <code>$(PROJECT_DIR)</code> to align your search paths instead of just including a static path.</p>
