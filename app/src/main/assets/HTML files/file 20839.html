<p>You're doing a lookup through hibernate for the requester, which I assume is a string. Your id in the entity is a MemberInquiryLookupId. Hibernate does not know on which column it should match the given value.</p>

<p>A workaround could be to work with the criteria API or to write a HQL:</p>

<pre><code>FROM MemberInquiryLookup m WHERE m.id.email = :parameter
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me that hibernate reverse engineered your table in an incorrect manner. Do you have a composite primary key in your database? If not, you should definitely adapt your code to correct the error.</p>
