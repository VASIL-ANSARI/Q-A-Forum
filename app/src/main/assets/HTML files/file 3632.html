<p>Assuming A does not know about B: If B knows about A, then B can add one of its methods to the event in A.</p>

<p>If on the other hand neither A nor B has knowledge about the other, but they are still somehow related in the program, then there must exist code elsewhere that relates them to each other and has knowledge of both. In that case, this external code should make the connection.</p>

<pre><code>A a = new A();
B b = new B();
a.TEST += b.methodA();
</code></pre>

<p>Did that answer your question?</p>
