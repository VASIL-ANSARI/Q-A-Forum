<p>I think you are looking for cross-cutting exception handling and good news, you are working with <strong>Spring MVC</strong> yes you can use this feature.</p>

<p>All you need to do, is throw your <code>CustomExcptions</code> or whatever other <code>Exceptions</code> that are from your <em>services</em> to your <em>action</em> methods.</p>

<p>Let's say here is your service:</p>

<pre><code>@Service
public class MyService {
  public void someMethod throws RuntimeException {
  ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your controller method:</p>

<pre><code>@Controller
public class MyController {
  @Autowired
  MyService service;

  @RequestMapping("/someuri"){
    try {
      service.someMethod();
    } catch {
      throw new RuntimeException();
    }
  }

  @ExceptionHandler(RuntimeException.class)
  public ModelAndView handleException(RuntimeException ex) {
    ModelAndView model = new ModelAndView("errorpage");
    return model;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>handleException</code> method annotated with <code>ExceptionHandler</code> is your advice method for exception handling and it will be called anytime a <code>RuntimeException</code> is throw inside your controller and you can keep up like this for all other exceptions.</p>
