<p>You can subscribe to the process being exited, though I'm not sure that this will help you prevent the process from being killed.</p>

<pre><code>var myProcess =  Process.GetCurrentProcess();
myProcess.Exited += new EventHandler(myProcess_Exited);

private void myProcess_Exited(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
     //not sure if there is a way to prevent the process from exiting here.
}
</code></pre>
