<p>I hope, this answer can help: I would define the view, which can appear x times, in a separate layout file and use the layout inflater to add them dynamically / programmatically.</p>

<p>Sample code:</p>

<pre><code>LayoutInflater l = getLayoutInflater(); // is a method from activity class
for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)
{
    l.inflate(R.layout.custom_list_view_entry,  parentView);
}
</code></pre>

<p>custom_list_view_entry.xml in the res/layout folder define your list entry layout and contain all style information or a more complex view hierarchy. 
parentView is the view, which is the container for the list entries.</p>
