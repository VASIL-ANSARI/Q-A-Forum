<p>One solution is to use build time filtering. You would filter the right value (depending on the targeted environment) into <em>persistence.xml</em>. I've used this approach before and it works quite nicely. </p>

<p>An alternative would be to use a relative path. The directory gets then created relative to the directory in which the jvm gets started. </p>

<p>Last but not least, if you are using Spring you could have a look at this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9264931/set-dynamic-index-directory-for-hibernate-search-in-spring">post</a> as well.</p>
