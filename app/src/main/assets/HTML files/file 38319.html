<p>Since Internet Explorer's source code isn't freely available, only an IE developer should be able to answer your question with more degree of detail.</p>

<p>Web browsers implement asynchronousity using an execution queue. There's a single thread and it attends enqueued tasks from the UI and AJAX (and other task sources). That is, it can only happen an operation at once.</p>

<p>In the other hand, UI is prioritized over any other task, thus, DOM operations should be executed before an AJAX call. When you send an AJAX request, maybe there's a small CPU time to send the request, but if you do a lot of UI work, it might take longer to end the whole AJAX request because <code>UI &gt; AJAX</code> in terms of prioritization.</p>

<p>The case you're describing in your question is an implementation detail in Internet Explorer. Chrome and Firefox might work better in terms of task prioritization, but anyway, I don't imagine a case where you try to append 100 DOM elements at once while you send a bunch of AJAX requests. <em>It's you who needs to optimize your code rather than expecting your Web browser to optimize an academic/edge case</em>.</p>

<p>For example, you might not add 100 DOM elements one by one to the document element. You might create a container (i.e. <code>document.createElement("div")</code>), and later add 100 elements while container isn't attached to the DOM to finally add the whole entire container to the DOM. This will add these 100 elements in a single paint event, which is cheaper and other stuff like AJAX should be executed in less time because of task prioritization.</p>

<p>Also, I'm not sure if you know that Fiddler slow-downs requests (it's a debugger, there's a performance hit). </p>
