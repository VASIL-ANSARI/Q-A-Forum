<p>I do not know very much about the gradient descend, but we learned another way to calculate linear regression with a number of points:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression#Fitting_the_regression_line" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression#Fitting_the_regression_line</a></p>

<p>But if you really want to add the while loop, I recommend the following:</p>

<p>Eventually, theta0 and theta1 will converge to a certain value. This means that, no matter how often you apply the formula, it will always stay in the vicinity of that value. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit</a>).</p>

<p>So applying the code once again will not change theta0 and theta1 very much, only for a very small amount. Or: the difference between theta0(1) and the next theta0(1) is smaller than a certain amount.</p>

<p>This brings us to the following code:</p>

<pre><code>double little = 1E-10;
do {
$theta0 = theta0;
$theta1 = theta1;
// now calculate the new theta0, theta1 simultaneously.
} while(Math.abs(theta0-$theta0) + Math.abs(theta1-$theta1)&gt;little);
</code></pre>
