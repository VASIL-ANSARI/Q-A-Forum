<p>A Java array can have a maximum size equal to <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> (or in some cases a slightly different value) which is about 2.3 * 10^9, so creating that large an array is theoretically possible. However since 10^9 would mean the prefix giga (to make it easier to read) the array would have a size of at least 1GB (when using <code>byte[]</code>). Depending on the data type you're using the array probably just takes too much memory (an <code>int[]</code> would already take up 4GB).</p>

<p>You could try to increase the JVM's max memory by using the <code>-Xmx</code> option (e.g. to allow a maximum of 4GB you could use <code>-Xmx=4g</code>) but you're still limited by the maximum of adressable memory (e.g. IIRC a 32-bit JVM can only adress up top 4GB in total) and available memory.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could try and split the array over multiple machines or JVMs and employ some distributed approach. Or you could write the array to a (memory mapped) file and keep only a part of the array in memory.</p>

<p>The best approach, however, would probably be to check whether you <em>really</em> need that much memory. In many cases using some clever algorithms or structures can dramatically reduce memory requirements. What to use depends on what you're trying to achieve in the end though.</p>
