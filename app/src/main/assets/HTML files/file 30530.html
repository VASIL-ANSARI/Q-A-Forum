<p>This is because negative numbers are stored as <em>two's complement</em>:</p>

<pre><code>minusB = ~B + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>In your case, reversing the formula above:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-3</code> is stored as <code>~3 + 1</code>. So, <code>~-3</code> is equivalent to <code>-(-3) - 1 = 2</code>.</li>
<li><code>~3.346346</code> is first rounded to <code>3</code>, then <code>~3</code> can be read as <code>-3 - 1 = -4</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The reason why <em>two's complement</em> is used (instead of using a separate bit for sign), is that it makes subtraction and addition trivial, regardless of signs.</p>
