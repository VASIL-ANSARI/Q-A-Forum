<p>That method only skips sending of mail, that does not confirm the new mail which is stored in <code>unconfirmed_mail</code>. maybe you could just confirm the user manually like <code>u.confirm</code>.
<code>confirm</code> method works only after object is saved.</p>

<p>To skip reconfirmation email notification use : <code>skip_confirmation_notification!</code></p>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/88724e10adaf9ffd1d8dbfbaadda2b9d40de756a/lib/devise/models/confirmable.rb#L157" rel="nofollow">Code reference</a>.</p>

<p>Or try <code>skip_reconfirmation!</code> this may confirm new email and avoid sending email notification. I have not used it but I understand so from the comment in code reference above(next method of <code>skip_confirmation_notification!</code> defination). so try it and let me know.</p>
