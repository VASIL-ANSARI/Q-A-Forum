<p>If you don't want any richtext editor than I would personally recommend using reStructuredText with Sphinx: <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://sphinx-doc.org/</a></p>

<p>It is a very complete markup language with extensions to support pretty much anything. The entire Python documentation is written in reStructuredText and these days the html output generated by Sphinx.</p>

<p>Example of a project which does something similar: <a href="http://tinkerer.me/" rel="nofollow">http://tinkerer.me/</a></p>
