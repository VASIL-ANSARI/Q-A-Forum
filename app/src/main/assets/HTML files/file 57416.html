<p>Import has <em>nothing</em> to do with CLASSPATH.  It saves you keystrokes, allowing you to use short class names instead of full ones (e.g. <code>ResultSet</code> instead of <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code>) when you type your source code.</p>

<p>CLASSPATH matters at compile time, allowing the compiler to resolve static types, and at runtime when the class loader brings your byte code into the JVM at first reference.</p>

<p>You can't infer anything about CLASSPATH based on packages.  What if that class is in a JAR?  The CLASSPATH will refer to the JAR, not the package.  </p>

<p>Most of the applications I write use 3rd party JARs that I load in using Maven.  I maintain the pom.xml, not a CLASSPATH.</p>
