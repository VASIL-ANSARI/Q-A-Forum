<p>A 302 error means the web server thinks the page has moved.  <a href="http://www.checkupdown.com/status/E302.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.checkupdown.com/status/E302.html</a></p>

<p>I bet either you typed in the page wrong, or whoever setup the url didn't update it's redirection when the page was setup.  </p>

<p>Btw, you should be able to see a wsdl resolve in a browser as XML if you want to test it.</p>
