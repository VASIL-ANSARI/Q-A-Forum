<p>There is an element which goes by the name <code>ScriptReference</code> and not <code>ScriptReferenceName</code> . Name is a property of this element, which was included without a space which led to this specific error.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Sripts&gt;
    &lt;asp:ScriptReference Name="guess-something.js" /&gt;
&lt;/Scripts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this should be part of the <code>&lt;asp:ScriptManager</code> parent tag</p>
