<p>Not a ruby expert but that looks like a method, can you call () it?  I imagine you've gone through steps to setup authentication, etc?  the messages.list() function should be able to be called without any parameters generally (well, you may need to specify a userId, which you can just use "me" for to get the authenticated user).</p>
