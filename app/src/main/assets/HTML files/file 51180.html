<p>The large text is only left-aligned when the words are too long to fit.</p>

<p>The icons have padding-right but no padding-left, so they are never centered. You don't notice it as much on a wide screen, but it becomes obvious on a narrow screen. </p>

<p>(I also noticed that while you have prefixed properties, you have sometimes forgotten the real property, for example <code>transform</code> in <code>.Icon</code>)</p>
