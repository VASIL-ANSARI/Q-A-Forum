<p>There is a really pretty new technology that is taking over the social specter of the internet that is exactly what you need. It is called websockets. I apologize I cannot provide any links at the moment but you could search for it. In case you don't feel like learning how this new technology works or it seems too complicated you can always use LONG POLLING. But if you decide to go with long polling have in mind that certain servers have a limit to open connections! I hope this answer was helpful to you and I wish you good luck in your project!</p>
