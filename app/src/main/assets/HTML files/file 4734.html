<p>Whithout knowing more, I can't guess what side effects this might have, but you could try:</p>

<pre><code>#define __extension__
</code></pre>

<p>This will make the pre-processor replace all occurrences of the word with nothing.</p>

<p>But this is likely due to a missing include file that defines this for a reason. Perhaps you are including a header that is meant for internal use? Maybe there is another header that includes this one and also the missing definition that you could use instead.</p>
