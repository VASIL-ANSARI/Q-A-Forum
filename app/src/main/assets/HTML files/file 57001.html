<p>That is not a filesystem path. That is a <code>content:</code> <code>Uri</code> from a <code>ContentProvider</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What should i do so i can use the file?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not a file, any more than this Web page is a file on the Stack Overflow Web server.</p>

<p>You can use a <code>ContentResolver</code> and <code>openInputStream()</code> to get an <code>InputStream</code> on the content represented by that <code>Uri</code>. You can get a <code>ContentResolver</code> by calling <code>getContentResolver()</code> on a <code>Context</code>, such as an <code>Activity</code> or <code>Service</code>.</p>
