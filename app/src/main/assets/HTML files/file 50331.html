<p>Selecting the image and not the whole button might not be possible and I can't see as it would be necessary as if one clicks anywhere on the button isn't that what you want anyway, as some might not click perfectly on the arrow?  For the button size, do you want a smaller or larger button?  If larger, it seems just doubling the size &amp; padding pixels would do that easily, if smaller just halving.</p>
