<p>As you correctly point out, <code>group</code> is not a reserved keyword (the language designers try hard not to introduce new reserved keywords when they add new features to the language in order to not break existing programs).
It is, however,  a <em>contextual</em> keyword: it becomes a keyword within LINQ query expressions. Resharper is suggesting you rename the variable in question to avoid ambiguities that would result if this variable were used within query expressions.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7029">language specification</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>7.16.1 Ambiguities in query expressions</strong></p>
  
  <p>Query expressions contain a number of âcontextual keywordsâ, i.e., identifiers that have special
  meaning in a given context. Specifically these are from, where, join,
  on, equals, into, let, orderby, ascending, descending, select, <strong>group</strong>
  and by. In order to avoid ambiguities in query expressions caused by
  mixed use of these identifiers as keywords or simple names, these
  identifiers are considered keywords when occurring anywhere within a
  query expression. For this purpose, a query expression is any
  expression that starts with âfrom identifierâ followed by any token
  except â;â, â=â or â,â.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you tried to do the following, you would get a compiler error:</p>

<pre><code>var filteredParis = from pair in group.Pairs // group is now treated as a keyword
                    select pair;
</code></pre>
