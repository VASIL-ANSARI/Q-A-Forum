<p>Are you trying to use values declared in <code>strings.xml</code> in a file inside <code>/raw/</code>? Then no, that's not possible. If you want to internationalize your "raw" XMLs you can provide one for each of your supported languages in the appropriate folder (<code>/raw-fr/</code>, <code>/raw-en/</code>, etc). At least that's out of the box.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can establish a template format and parse the raw XMLs in Java and fetch the appropriate string resource from there instead.</p>
