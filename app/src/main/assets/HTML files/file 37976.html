<p>The line <code>var appendedText= $('#searchbox').val();</code> works perfectly well, as you can see in <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tn0fhn27/1/" rel="nofollow">this</a> fiddle (passing the event parameter isn't necessary, and certainly isn't the root of the problem).  However, I got rid of the form and span elements, and the chrome.tabs stuff, so I suspect your issue lies in one of those.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to help if that's not the actual problem, but as far as jQuery and <code>.val()</code> go, everything's fine.</p>
