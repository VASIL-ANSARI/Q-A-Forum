<p>Bam! Reading from uninitialized values will KILL you every time:</p>

<pre><code>int roll1[6];
...
sum = roll1[0]+ roll1[1]+ roll1[2]+ roll1[3]+ roll1[4]+ roll1[5];
...
</code></pre>

<p>What are the values of <code>roll1[0]+...</code> at this point? The compiler doesn't know and flies off into <code>Undefined Behavior</code> - a crash is an option. Until the values for each of the elements in <code>roll1[6]</code> have been set, trying to read from one without a value is bad (you see the result).</p>

<p>Two things. <strong>1.</strong> <strong>Always compile with warnings.</strong> (<code>-Wall -Wextra</code>) at minimum. <strong>2.</strong> <strong>Always initialize your variables</strong>, to <strong>zero</strong> if you have no other initial value. The following will prevent the undefined behavior.</p>

<pre><code>int roll1[6] = { 0 };
</code></pre>
