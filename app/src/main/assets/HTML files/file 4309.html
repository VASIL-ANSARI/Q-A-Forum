<p>If you are just listing files (no folder and subfolder structure), you don't need a <code>QTreeWidget</code>.</p>

<p>But as you are willing to show the file location and file size, I would use a <code>QTableWidget</code> (or <code>QTableView</code>).</p>

<p>However, I would suggest to have a look at <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qfilesystemmodel.html" rel="nofollow"><code>QFileSystemModel</code></a>. Depending on what you're trying to do you with your app, this class might come handy : You can use this model and display it in a view widget.</p>

<p>And <code>QFileSystemModel</code> comes with methods such as <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qfilesystemmodel.html#remove" rel="nofollow">remove()</a> and will also handle file renaming.</p>
