<p>Because you want to mix-and-match... I would make a custom control that inherits from ContextMenu that has a "SharedMenuItems" Dependancy Property and a MenuItems Dependancy Property. This way your control can decide how to merge these two sets together. If you would like an example of this, please let me know.</p>
