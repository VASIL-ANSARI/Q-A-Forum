<p>Current Standard working draft N4527 [12.1p4]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <em>default</em> constructor for a class <code>X</code> is a constructor of class <code>X</code>
  that either has no parameters or else each parameter that is not a
  function parameter pack has a default argument. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, the constructor of the second class is a perfectly valid default constructor.</p>

<hr>

<p>Just a note that the wording in the published versions of C++11 and 14 was slightly different, but doesn't make a difference for your question. It used to be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <em>default</em> constructor for a class <code>X</code> is a constructor of class <code>X</code>
  that can be called without an argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The change to the current wording was made as a result of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html#1630" rel="nofollow">DR 1630</a>, in order to clarify the semantics of default initialization. Previously, there were places in the standard that referred to "<em>the</em> default constructor", implying that there can be only one; the current wording is intended to support more complex scenarios, where you can potentially have several such constructors (for example using SFINAE), and the one used is chosen using normal overload resolution.</p>
