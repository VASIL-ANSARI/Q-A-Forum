<p>The statement <code>if continueMaking == "Yes" or "yes" or "YES":</code> is equivalent to <code>(continueMaking == "Yes") or "yes" or "YES":</code> which, regardless of the value of <code>continueMaking</code> returns the string <code>"YES"</code>, which is truthy and thus the <code>makeContact</code> call always executes. Case-insensitive string comparisons can be accomplished by <code>continueMaking.lower() == "yes"</code>.</p>
