<p>In your local environment, you're running the Ruby process from the Rails root directory. This is why you're able to locate the file using <code>'../hub/data/comment_file.csv'</code> (or probably just <code>'./data/comment_file.csv'</code></p>

<p>However, Heroku and many other hosts will run it from other locations.</p>

<p>You'll have to specify the full path of the file:</p>

<pre><code>File.join(Rails.root, 'data/comment_file.csv')
</code></pre>
