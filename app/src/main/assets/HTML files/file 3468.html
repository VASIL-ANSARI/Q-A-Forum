<p>What you describe is the way Passenger works. It spawns new instances of the application when traffic warrants them, and shuts them down after periods of inactivity to free resources.</p>

<p>You should read the Passenger documentation, particularly the <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide.html#_resource_control_and_optimization_options" rel="nofollow">Resource Control and Optimization section</a>. There are settings which can prevent the application from being shut down by Passenger, if that is what you want.</p>

<p>Using the PassengerPoolIdleTime setting, you could keep at least one process running, but you'll almost certainly want Passenger to start up other instances of the app as necessary. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rufus-ruby/browse_thread/thread/38c3f08098dac35/5c6d4f845bb9dffe?q=#5c6d4f845bb9dffe" rel="nofollow">This thread</a> on the Rufus Scheduler Google Group mentions using lock files to prevent more than one process from starting the scheduler, that may be useful to you.</p>
