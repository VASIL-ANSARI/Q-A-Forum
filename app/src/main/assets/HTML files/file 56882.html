<p>This will never work because your listView is effectively a scrollView, so you have a scrollView within a scrollView. Is the textView of fixed size or can it be a large amount of text? I would consider some redesign here as this is not a very good way to design a UI. </p>

<p>If the textView is big which means you only see a small bit of the list then you should be able to scroll by touching the textView only, but i would make the scrollView the Parent and remove the first LinearLayout, it is not needed</p>
