<p>The first thing I see is that you have a ToString method without the parenthesis.  It should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (DropDownList1.SelectedValue.ToString() == null)
</code></pre>

<p>As others have pointed out, the second issue is the comparison to null after converting the item to a string.  Converting a null to a string will cause an error (the string representation of a null doesn't exist).  Instead, as they indicated, you should remove the ToString() entirely and compare the SelectedValue to null like so:</p>

<pre><code>if (DropDownList1.SelectedValue == null)
</code></pre>
