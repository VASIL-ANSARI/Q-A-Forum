<p>Remember never try to save the date and time in string. It creates problems later. But there is a solution, you can use converting it into date:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Table WHERE 
CONVERT(DATE, FromDate) &gt;= CONVERT(DATE, '2016-10-01')
AND CONVERT(DATE, ToDate) &lt;= CONVERT(DATE, '2016-10-10')
</code></pre>
