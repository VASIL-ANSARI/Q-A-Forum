<p>It looks like your could use some work.  First based on your variable names, you will want to assign something to filename for example:</p>

<pre><code>filename = r"C:\MyFile.txt"
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have that, you will want to open the file and parse its contents:</p>

<pre><code> with open( filename, "r") as fp:
        data = fp.read()
        # Process Data In File where datelist is set
 # end with automatically closes file for you

 snapshotbirthtuple = tuple(datelist)
 return snapshotbirthtuple
</code></pre>

<p>The reason your original code returns no answer is because the line:</p>

<pre><code>for i in filename:
</code></pre>

<p>filename is an empty string, there is nothing to iterate over, so there are never any values assigned to i.  As such your loop is skipped entirely so datelist never gets assigned</p>
