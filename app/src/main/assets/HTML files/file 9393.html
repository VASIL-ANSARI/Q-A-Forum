<p>I'm not really sure, but I think you can't customize this alert, it's specific to Apple.
And about how to know if the purchase is completed, I suggest you to take a look at <a href="http://troybrant.net/blog/2010/01/in-app-purchases-a-full-walkthrough/" rel="nofollow">this website</a>, and specially at this method :</p>

<pre><code>- (void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions
{
    for (SKPaymentTransaction *transaction in transactions)
    {
        switch (transaction.transactionState)
        {
            case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased:
                [self completeTransaction:transaction];
                break;
            case SKPaymentTransactionStateFailed:
                [self failedTransaction:transaction];
                break;
            case SKPaymentTransactionStateRestored:
                [self restoreTransaction:transaction];
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You also have to call this before ( again, take a look on the website above ) :</p>

<pre><code>[[SKPaymentQueue defaultQueue] addTransactionObserver:self];
</code></pre>

<p>When the transaction.transactionState is SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased, this means that the transaction is completed.</p>

<p>Hope it helps</p>
