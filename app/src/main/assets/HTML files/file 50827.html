<p>This could be a lot of things, but the most likely reason is that your key is invalid. The most common reason that your key is invalid is that you are accidentally using the "key ID" of a service account and not an actual "API key" (they're easy to confuse).</p>

<p>To generate an API key, head to <a href="http://console.developers.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://console.developers.google.com</a>, open the toolbar, choose "API Manager", then choose the "Credentials" page. Ignore everything under the "Service account keys" section, even if it says "Key ID". Those are service account keys.</p>

<p>Instead, click "new credentials" and choose "API key". Choose "Server Key" or "Browser Key" in the popup (server key if you're gonna use it from your rails server, browser if it runs client side). Now, try using that new key.</p>
