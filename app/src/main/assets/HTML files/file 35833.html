<p>All you need to do is the following in the touchesBegan method:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];
    CGPoint positionInScene = [touch locationInNode:self];
    SKSpriteNode *touchedNode = (SKSpriteNode *)[self nodeAtPoint:touchLocation]; 
    // Now that we have our touchedNode instance set the texture.
    touchedNode.texture = [SKTexture textureWithImageNamed:@"rescued"];
}
</code></pre>
