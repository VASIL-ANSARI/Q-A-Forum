<p>The return from the then method is still a promise and so would not be fulfilled. This is a hard paradigm to get your head around at first. (ever played portals? :))</p>

<p>I think you want to do something like this</p>

<pre><code>getMenu(id).then(function(currentMenu) {
    this.data.menu  = currentMenu;
});
</code></pre>

<p>The key part of this is you do your assignment inside the function that is called when the promise is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Any code outside of that is not guaranteed to be running after the promise has come back (which is why you are getting that console output)</p>
