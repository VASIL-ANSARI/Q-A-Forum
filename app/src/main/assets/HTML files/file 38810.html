<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/18265285/1382768">This answer</a> helped. The safe $apply function there did the trick.
I added that function to my controller and added this snipped to my node.js function:</p>

<pre><code>var scope = angular.element($("#angularDOMElement")).scope();
scope.safeApply(function(){
    myLegacyVar = res;
})
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if thats the proper way to do it but its working.</p>
