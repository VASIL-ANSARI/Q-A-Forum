<p>According to the official documentation there isn't a good way of doing this.
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager.html</a></p>

<p>I would recommend either starting a service or some sort of background thread that queries for the status of just your downloads every couple of seconds.
(keep track of their ids in a long[], because setFilterById takes a long[])</p>

<pre><code>long[] ids = new long[MyDownloadQueue.length];
// Look at all these requests I'm building!
ids[i++] = dm.enqueue(request);

Cursor cursor = dm.query(new DownloadManager.Query().setFilterById(ids));
while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
  int columnIndex = cursor.getColumnIndex(DownloadManager.COLUMN_STATUS);
  int status = cursor.getInt(columnIndex);
  int columnReason = cursor.getColumnIndex(DownloadManager.COLUMN_REASON);
  int reason = cursor.getInt(columnReason);
  // your stuff here, recording the status and reason to some in memory map
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way your listview won't have to do any of the work and the UI will stay smooth. There isn't really a better way that I know of however, sorry I couldn't provide an answer that didn't involve querying.</p>
