<p>As far as I know, and according to <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/CalendarContract.Attendees.html" rel="nofollow">the official <code>Attendees</code> table contract</a>, you cannot add different <code>Attendees</code> to different <code>Instances</code> of the same recurring <code>Event</code>, because you can only associate an event_id to an <code>Attendee</code>, not an "instance_id"(which does not exist). </p>

<p>Once you assign one <code>Attendee</code> to a recurring <code>Event</code>, all the <code>Instances</code> of that <code>Event</code> will have your <code>Attendee</code> assigned. </p>

<p>In alternative, you may have to create multiple <code>Events</code> with the same hourly dates and with the same periodicity of your <code>Instances</code>, so you could add different <code>Attendees</code> to each of those different event ids. </p>
