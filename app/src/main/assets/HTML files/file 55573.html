  <p>I can add an 'option' and a unique value for that - to the object, but that doesn't help me get something into the markup.</p>

<p>That's right - Leaflet won't magically turn options into HTML <code>data</code> attributes.</p>

<p>First: read the <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet" rel="nofollow">leaflet code</a>! It's easy to understand if you spend a bit of time in it. For markers, the HTML is really built in <code>L.Icon</code>, not in <code>L.Marker</code>.</p>

<p>Once you've done that, you'll notice the code in <code>src/layer/marker/icon.js</code> does something like:</p>

<pre><code>_setIconStyles: function (img, name) {
    var options = this.options;

    if (options.something) {
        img.style.something = something(something);
    }
},
</code></pre>

<p>If you then read <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/PLUGIN-GUIDE.md" rel="nofollow">Leaflet's plugin guide</a>, you'll then realise you can make a plugin in the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>L.Icon.DataMarkup = L.Icon.extend({

    _setIconStyles: function(img, name) {
        L.Icon.prototype._setIconStyles.call(this, img, name);

        if (options.slug) {
            img.dataset.slug = options.slug;
        }
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>You should be able to work it out from there.</p>
