<p>The expressions <code>(?&lt;!\d)</code> and <code>(?!\d)</code> are a "negative look behind" and a "negative look ahead". They are negative, zero-width assertions, <em>not</em> capturing groups.</p>

<p>The expression <code>(?&lt;!\d)</code> asserts that the previous character is <em>not</em> a digit.<br>
The expression <code>(?!\d)</code> asserts that the next character is <em>not</em> a digit.</p>

<p>Although they <em>look</em> like groups, that is just that the syntax that uses brackets.</p>

<p>Incidentally, they could be expressed as positive look arounds <code>(?&lt;=^|\D)</code> and <code>(?=\D|$)</code></p>
