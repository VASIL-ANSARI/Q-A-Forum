<pre><code>&gt; How do I know the amount of clients running (the value of N)
&gt; if every client is a different instance of the program client.c? 
</code></pre>

<p>Peterson's solution requires that all participating processes, or threads, have access to a shared-memory resource.  That shared memory segment will contain level[] and waiting[] arrays, as well as the value of N.  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; also, how do I know the value of i (i would be the number of the process)
&gt; if each new instance of client.c is unaware of how many instances have
&gt; been run before?
</code></pre>

<p>In more primitive situations where there is a set number of participating processes, or threads, each is assigned it's 'i' value.  The only requirement is that they are unique, and that i >= 0, and i &lt; N.  (Perhaps your implementation could assign 'i' from a command-line parameter?)</p>

<p>In more advanced implementations, each process might acquire (and then increment) 'i' in the shared memory segment.  Of course, such an implementation would have to assure that each participant is started in a way that there is no contention for i.</p>
