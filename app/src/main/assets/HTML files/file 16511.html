<p>Use WTSGetActiveConsoleSessionId() as described in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/gg465093" rel="nofollow">MSDN article</a> I showed you in your earlier question. That article includes all the code you need.</p>

<p>I also urge you to include error checking for your API calls. Diagnosing errors without that help is harder than it needs to be.</p>
