<p>I don't think that there are built-in JVM options to do these kind of tweaks, however you can limit CPU usage by setting priority and/or CPU affinity of the JVM process. 
If you are on Linux take a look at <a href="http://cpulimit.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">CPULimit</a> that is an awesome tool to do these kind of resource limitations.</p>
