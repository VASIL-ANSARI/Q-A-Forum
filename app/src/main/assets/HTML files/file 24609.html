<p>I have updated the code a bit, and it might not be what you're looking for, but instead of using an array to number whichever you want, I've used the modulus sign (<code>%</code>) to get which number the element is and then I use an increasing integer (You can also use a for loop if you need more control).</p>

<p>Here's the code I have and you can use this however you want.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    var numBalls = $('#hidden img').length; //Find out how many images are in queue.
    i = 0; //Start a counter
    setInterval(function(){ //Every (3000) ms run this action
        i++; //Up the counter by 1
        $('img:nth-of-type(' + (i%numBalls + 1) + ')').animate({top: '+=700'}, 1000, 'easeOutBounce').delay(1000).animate({top: '-=700'}, 1000, 'easeOutBounce') //animate the image.  The correct image is selected by (i%numBalls+1)
    },3000);
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you have to use an array count, I can work around this, but here is the fiddle to show what I believe you're looking for.  Take a look at the comments here as well to explain what is happening.</p>

<p>Also, by using your code, I edited your fiddle to work:</p>

<p>I added a delay in between the two animations, you may not have seen this working if you tried this because your setTimeout delay was shorter than the entirety of the animation</p>
