<p>I think that the most comfortable way is to create a data structure in your PHP code, and you will decode this JSON to a list of items from this type.
Then, it will be very easy to iterate this list and get the data that you want.</p>

<p>The data structure that I'm talking about is something that will contain </p>

<pre><code>String : kind
String : family
List&lt;String&gt; : variants
List&lt;String&gt; : subsets
</code></pre>

<p>hope this helps...</p>
