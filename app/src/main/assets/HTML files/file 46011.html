<p>I would recommend stripping down your code to the base, maybe just get everything displayed and then migrate to pagination. I can spot your first issue is you are applying two filters on specie.</p>

<pre><code>dir-paginate="animal in animals | filter: {specie: 'dog'} | filter: {specie: 'cat'}"
</code></pre>

<p>is basically saying filter down to animals that are <strong>both</strong> a dog <strong>and</strong> a cat. The first filter will return an array of only dogs, then the second filter will run on that finding only cats, which is none because obviously you can't be a dog and a cat :)</p>

<pre><code>Original Array: [{name: 'bob', specie: 'cat'}, {name: 'jeff', specie: 'dog'}] | filter dogs | filter cats
After First Filter (only dogs): [{name: 'jeff', specie: 'dog'}] | filter cats 
After Second Filter (only animals that are both dogs and cats): []
</code></pre>

<p>Try defining your own angular filter to simplify your work as so:</p>

<pre><code>.filter('isCatOrDog', function() {
    return function(inputAnimals) {
       return inputAnimals.filter(function(animal) {
          return animal.value === 'cat' || animal.value === 'dog';
       });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>And you call the filter as so:</p>

<pre><code>dir-paginate="animal in animals | isCatOrDog"
</code></pre>
