<p>if you comment that line and it crashes, it means that your stack is corrupted. So, the crash may appear and/or disappear without any apparent reason at any "random" point (of course it's not really random, but so it may seem).</p>

<p>Can you generate core-dumps and/or run with valgrind and/or step-by-step debug it?</p>
