<p>It is not the same principle, javascript files are downloaded and interpreted by the client; which is why you want to keep their size and number low (since bandwidth is limited).</p>

<p>PHP files are <em>not</em> downloaded by the client; they are interpreted by the server where you upload them; their output will be send to the client. This is why the number of PHP files does not have a negative impact on your page in the same way as javascript does</p>
