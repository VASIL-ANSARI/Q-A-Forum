<p>Try adding the speech code to the <code>Form_Shown</code> event. This event is raised whenever the form is shown to the user (when they can actually see it). From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.shown.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Shown event is only raised the first time a form is displayed; subsequently minimizing, maximizing, restoring, hiding, showing, or invalidating and repainting will not raise this event.</p>
