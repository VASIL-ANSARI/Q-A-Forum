<p>I know this is an old question but I found the same piece of tutorial code while playing with <strong>Xuggler</strong> today. The reason you are getting multiple thumbnails is due to the following line:</p>

<pre><code>public static final double SECONDS_BETWEEN_FRAMES = 10;
</code></pre>

<p>This variable specifies the number of seconds between calls to <code>dumpImageToFile</code>. So a frame thumbnail will be written at 0.00 seconds, at 10.00 seconds, at 20.00 seconds, and so on:</p>

<pre><code>if (event.getTimeStamp() - mLastPtsWrite &gt;= MICRO_SECONDS_BETWEEN_FRAMES)
</code></pre>

<p>To get a frame thumbnail from the middle of the video you can calculate the duration of the video using more <strong>Xuggler</strong> capability which I found in a tutorial at <a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/02/introduction-xuggler-video-manipulation.html" rel="nofollow">JavaCodeGeeks</a>. Then change your code in the <code>ImageSnapListener</code> to only write a single frame once the <code>IVideoPictureEvent</code> event timestamp exceeds the calculated mid point.</p>

<p>I hope that helps anyone who stumbles across this question.</p>
