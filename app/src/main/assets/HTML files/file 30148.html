<p>Using the other URLs seems to work fine. The issue lies with <code>/resolve.json</code> where it uses a 302 Redirect to send you to the right API URL and it doesn't jive with Safari.</p>

<p><strong>According to the SoundCloud API Doc:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The resolve resource allows you to lookup and access API resources when you only know the SoundCloud.com URL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don't need this functionality I suggest using the URL directly. Here's a working example.</p>

<pre><code>$.getJSON("https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/17235000.json?client_id=CLIENT_ID", 
    function( data ) {
        console.log(data);
});
</code></pre>
