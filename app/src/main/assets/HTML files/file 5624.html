<p>Since you are using ZF, you could make all this computations in the table row's class. Here's how. Let's say your teams class is called Application_Model_DbTable_Teams.</p>

<pre><code>class Application_Model_DbTable_Teams extends Zend_Db_Table_Abstract
{
    protected $_name = 'teams'; // table name
    protected $_id = 'teamId'; // table primary key

    // rows returned by fetchAll() will be of this class
    protected $_rowClass = 'Application_Model_DbRow_Teams';

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to create the Application_Model_DbRow_Teams class where you will put the extra calculations</p>

<pre><code>class Application_Model_DbRow_Teams extends Zend_Db_Table_Row_Abstract
{
    public $percentGamesDone;

    public function init()
    {
        // This method gets called automatically by ZF when you instantiate a new
        // object from this class
        // This is where you will put your extra calculations, 
        // like percentage games done, etc
        $this-&gt;percentGamesDone = $this-&gt;getPercentGames();
    }

    public function getPercentGames() 
    {
        $calculation = 3; // replace this with real data
        return $calculation;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once you've done this, you can simply use any of the row's declared properties (like percentGameDone) directly from the view as they will be calculated right when you instanciate the rows.</p>
