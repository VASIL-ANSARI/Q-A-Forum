<p>Well I suspect the problem is this:</p>

<pre><code>Friend = System::Convert::ToInt32(FriendString);
</code></pre>

<p>My guess is that <code>FriendString</code> isn't a valid integer. If this is user input, you should probably use <code>Int32.TryParse</code> so that you can detect this without resorting to exceptions.</p>

<p>It's important to learn to read stack traces to see which method has failed and the last place in <em>your</em> code that's mentioned... and then diagnose the prolem further.</p>
