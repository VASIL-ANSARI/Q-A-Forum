<p>You can use the bounding boxes approach to narrow down the search. All you have to do extra is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the closest bounding box (lets say it is the big one in your example)</li>
<li>Let r be the distance between the point and the closest bounding box and b the size of the bounding box. Find all bounding boxes that are closer than (r+b) from the point.</li>
<li>Use brute force to find the closest triangle among the remaining bounding boxes.</li>
</ul>
