<p>I believe I have found the answer to my own question. Initially, I was using a custom collection to store the child controls inside the parent. I tried putting them inside the parent's "Controls" collection and it started working immediately.</p>

<p>I'd guess this had something to do with the children not hitting the control tree soon enough.</p>
