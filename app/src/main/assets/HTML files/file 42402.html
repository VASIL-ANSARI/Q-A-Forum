<p>It is not possible to have two applications in one window. Each application runs under a different window session and cannot share windows. It is possible to display both windows side by side but the window manager has no stable API (it may change in any new version and it already did change in the history), and either each application would need to request that itself or you need root access.</p>

<p>Also, you understand fragments incorrectly. A fragment is hosted inside an acitivity, not the other way around.</p>
