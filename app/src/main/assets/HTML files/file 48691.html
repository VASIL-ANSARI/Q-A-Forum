<p>I managed to get my hudl 2 to work with a good bit of messing about. some of these steps may not be necessary but in the end i got the hudl debugging</p>

<ul>
<li>Connect the Hudl via usb</li>
<li>On the Hudl change its connection mode from media device to camera</li>
<li>Download and install the following stuff  <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-usb-driver-for-android-devices" rel="nofollow">https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-usb-driver-for-android-devices</a></li>
<li>Open the device manager and look in Other Devices</li>
<li>Right Click the ADB device and update driver</li>
<li>Select Browse computer for driver</li>
<li>Click let me pick from a list of devices</li>
<li>Select the Samsung device driver</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove and reconnect the hudl  via usb. the hudl should then have a popup asking for you to accept connections via the pc. allow it and your hudl should then be available for debugging</p>

<p>I was debugging through Xamarin studio at the time</p>
