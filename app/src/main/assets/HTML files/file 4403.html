<p>Personally I use <a href="http://www.springframework.net/doc-1.1-P3/reference/html/transaction.html" rel="nofollow">NHibernate with Spring.NET</a> which has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming" rel="nofollow">AOP</a> support so I am basically defining in an external configuration file which are the methods which I would like to be executed under a SQL transaction. Those would normally be my service methods which in term might call multiple data access methods that I would like to run in a single transaction. </p>

<p>I consider that transaction management is a crosscutting concern and shouldn't be mixed with the data access code as it pollutes it. Spring.NET takes care of generating runtime proxies and injects the proper transaction handling code.</p>
