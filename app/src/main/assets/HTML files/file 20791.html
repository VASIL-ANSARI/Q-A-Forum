<p>You can't get the unencrypted password. </p>

<p>Devise uses Bcrypt, which a one way encryption algorithm. The only way to get create an exact duplicate is top copy the encrypted password directly, rather than using the unencrypted version.</p>

<p>However I'd strongly recommend against this, what are you trying to achieve? Is there a better way to handle this problem - OAuth?</p>
