<p>If you're willing to put a little work into it, you could use a replacement for the UINavigationController such as the FJTransitionController <a href="https://github.com/coreyfloyd/FJSTransitionController" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/coreyfloyd/FJSTransitionController</a>. It functions as a drop-in, customizable replacement for navigation or tab controllers as well as any other navigation behavior you could want. You will need to provide the UI on your own though, the existing UINavigationBar might be usable.</p>
