<p>When you experience <code>ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</code>, check your internet connection, check any cables and reboot any routers, modems, or other network devices you may be using. The error mainly occurs due to the problems in the internet connection and if there are problems in the devices you use to connect to the internet.

<p>Based from this <a href="http://www.grokkingandroid.com/xmpp-server-google-cloud-messaging/" rel="nofollow">thread</a>, many problems can crop up in corporate networks, since firewalls might block access to the rather unusual port or proxies might interfere with any outgoing traffic. The exception indicates a networking problem on your part â itâs simply getting a timeout. I guess neither Google nor your provider are the problem here. Check your setup and any firewalls (corporate or personal) between you and the outer internet.</p>
