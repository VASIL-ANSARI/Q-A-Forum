<p>You'll find the method - renamed to insert due to the obvious clash with assert - in interface <code>org.kie.api.runtime.rule.EntryPoint</code>:</p>

<pre><code>FactHandle insert(Object object)

Inserts a new fact into this entry point

Parameters:
    object - the fact to be inserted 
Returns:
    the fact handle created for the given fact
</code></pre>

<p>EntryPoint is extended into interface <code>KieSession</code>, which is the pivot object for fact storage and engine activation.</p>
