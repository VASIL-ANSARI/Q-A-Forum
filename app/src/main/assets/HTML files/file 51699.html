<p>So finally I solve the problem after searching for two days. Here is the correct code:  </p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(context, BluetoothToggle.class);
intent.setAction(AppWidgetManager.ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE);
intent.putExtra(AppWiââdgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_IDS, appWidgetIds);
intent.putExtra(toggleBluetoothAction, toggleBluetoothAction);
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the <code>onReceive()</code> method which is called every time I clicked on the widget.  </p>

<pre><code>public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent)
{
    Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();

    if (bundle != null &amp;&amp; bundle.getString(toggleBluetoothAction) != null)
    {
        // My Logic
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at the <code>intent</code> <code>setAction</code> and <code>putExtra</code>, which are useful in my case to solve the problem. I checked many website but most of them didn't include this piece of code to make widget clickable. All they did is to create an <code>Intent</code> and then immediately create a <code>PendingIndent</code>. I did the same but nothing helped me in any way.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
