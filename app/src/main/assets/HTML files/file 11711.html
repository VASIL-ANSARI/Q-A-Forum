<p>Since php is a dynamically typed language, data types at interfaces often are kind of puzzling. </p>

<p>Usually when data is retrieved from the database, the driver doesn't bother to convert each value to the type in php which resembles the data type in mysql most (or you could also say, php isn't intelligent enough to do so automatically); you'd have to do that conversion yourself. Fortunately, it is really easy to do so:</p>

<pre><code>$yourvar = (int)$yourvar;
</code></pre>
