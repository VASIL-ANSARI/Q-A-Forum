  <p>Aren't all the above constant time operations?</p>

<p>No, the time complexity of <code>memcpy</code> and <code>memmove</code> is linear in the size of the block being copied or moved, because each of the <code>k</code> bytes being moved needs to be touched exactly once. The size of the block being moved is <code>sizeof(T) * N</code>, making the timing linear as well.</p>

<p>Even addition of an element at the end of a vector has linear complexity because of copying data on reallocation (however, adding <code>N</code> elements to the end of a vector has <em>amortized</em> linear complexity, which translates to amortized constant per-item complexity).</p>
