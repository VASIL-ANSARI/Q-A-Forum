<p>It appears that this plugin requires the <code>div (suqBoxInner)</code> to be on the page. So short of modifying the plugin, I'm not sure you have many options as-is. Perhaps you may want to rethink how you are implementing the plugin? How is <code>suqBoxInner</code> being placed on the page? Is it after a specific event, or action?</p>

<p>One solution I can think of off the top of my head is to fire an event after <code>suqBoxInner</code> is placed on the page. The event would then initialize jqModal.</p>

<p>Just a thought. Good luck.</p>
