<p>You can use a reference to a FMResultSet elsewhere, however it must be used on the same thread where the original query was ran. </p>

<p>Also, you can only iterate over the result set once.  After you iterate, it will automatically close the sqlite statement and you will no longer be able to access the results.</p>

<p>If that doesn't give you any clues, post all the relevant code.</p>
