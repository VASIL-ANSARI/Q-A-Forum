<p>The latest version of the GridFS spec requires that the id for a stored GridFS file be of type ObjectId.</p>

<p>But since there may be existing files stored in GridFS where the id is <em>not</em> an ObjectId, there is an overload of DownloadToStream that takes a BsonValue id.</p>

<p>Since there is no BSON type for GUID specifically, any GridFS files you might have where the id was originally a GUID would actually have the id stored as either a BsonBinary value or a BsonString value, depending on how you chose to represent the GUID in MongoDB.</p>

<p>So to read an existing GridFS file that was stored using a GUID as the id you need to convert that GUID to the appropriate BsonValue and then pass that BsonValue to the DownloadToStream overload that takes a BsonValue id.</p>
