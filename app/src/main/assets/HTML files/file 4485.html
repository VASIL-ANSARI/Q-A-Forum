This will let you bind to two source properties and convert them into a single value for your Position.</p>

<p>EDIT: It sounds like what you really want to do here is animate a Point rather than seperate Left and Top values, so this probably doesn't apply to your case.  The real problem here is that you have a two-way problem; this property represents the same information as Top and Left, so if you change it, then Top and Left should change.  Likewise, since Top and Left are mutable, if those change, you really want your property to reflect that.</p>

<p>One option is to register a property changed handler for LeftProperty and TopProperty.  Now, when those change, update your PositionProperty.  You have to be careful here not to trigger repeated updates (I change Left, which changes Position, which changes Left, which...)</p>
