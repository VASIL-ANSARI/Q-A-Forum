<p>You would have to register your app for some background execution.
I am too having the same issue, but I guess mine could be solved as I will register for Location background support, and I have noticed in another SO question that NSTimer works when you have registered you app for some background execution. Here it is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5187741/nstimer-on-background-is-working">NSTimer on background IS working</a></p>

<p>For background execution please read apple documentation <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH5-SW4" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH5-SW4</a></p>
