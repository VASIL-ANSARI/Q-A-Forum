<p>I think there is a lot of confusing things here... Here below is the answer, but I would advise you to try debugging this snippet by yourself to learn what is wrong. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You're itering trough an array with <code>301</code> cells. An array index goes from <code>0</code> to <code>length-1</code>. As you're itering with <code>numArray[++posNum]</code> when posNum was initialized with 0, the first index will be <code>++0 = 1</code>. So you never reach the first cell of the array. This lead to an <code>out of range exception</code> because the last index will be <code>301</code> but in reality the last index is <code>300</code>... Simply reading the exception message would have lead you to the solution.</p></li>
<li><p>I would advise you to take a look at how works a <code>for loop</code> to understand how to browse the array cell by cell with an incremented index. Then you will correct your for loop like this :</p>

<p>for(int idx = 0; idx &lt; NumArray.length; idx++)</p></li>
<li><p>You were accessing the current cell with the wrong variable. This can append, but you would have detected it very fast in debug mode...</p>

<p>NumArray[idx]</p></li>
</ol>

<pre><code>NumArray[Range1]
</code></pre>

<ol start="4">
<li><p>This is not essential to make your program work, but in Java there are some conventions (as in every langages) and <code>variables</code> are written in <code>camelCase</code>.</p>

<p>Don't hesitate to debug your program, this is the best way to learn the langage, and enjoy Java</p>
