<blockquote>
  <p>Here in this code they are checking the equality of self with the other two parameters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Where? No. <code>a and b == c</code> doesn't relate <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> together in any way.</p>

<pre><code>self.parent and self.parent.leftChild == self
</code></pre>

<p>checks if</p>

<ol>
<li><code>self.parent</code> has a meaningful value (is not <code>None</code>) and, if so,</li>
<li><code>self.parent.leftChild</code> equals to the given <code>self</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, it does what its name says: it checks if "we" are identical to our parent's left child. This, of course, only works if we have a parent. If we haven't, we aren't its left child.</p>

<p>Note: What I just said about "is not <code>None</code>" is only half the truth. To be exact, it checks if there is a "truthy value", i. e. a value which evaluates true in the context of conditional expressions. As one normally uses <code>None</code> in the case of an absent node such as <code>parent</code>, what I wrote is clear enough.</p>
