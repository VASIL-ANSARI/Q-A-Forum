<p>Of course:</p>

<pre><code>class StupidThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        run();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But why would you do this? You cannot do this <em>globally</em> for every thread created in JVM, you are however free to use <code>StupidThread</code> wherever you want.</p>
