<p>You have two option :</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a WinForm </li>
<li>Ask the user name and password interactively directly in the console application</li>
</ul>

<p>As suggested by rene you can use a switch on the command line of the same application, or you can create a separate application to do it, in the case of a separate application maybe the winForm solution would be the best choice.</p>
