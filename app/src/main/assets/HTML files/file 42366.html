<p>There's an example of a BufferStream class <a href="http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2681-turning-buffers-into-readable-streams-in-node-js.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, that can be used for turning buffers into readable streams.</p>

<p>The article has an example of piping a buffer stream through a response object, however, seeing as <code>client.connect</code> returns a <code>net.Socket</code> which implements duplex Stream, you should equally be able to pipe the buffer stream into your <code>client</code> socket.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var buffer = new Buffer([0x4, 0xFF, 0x01, 0x20, 0x0]),
    stream = new BufferStream(buffer),
    client = net.connect({ host: 'someIp.pl', port: 7171 }, connected);

function connected() {
  stream.pipe(client);
  // do other things
}
</code></pre>

<p>Generally speaking, if you can stream something in Node, you probably should. It's a more elegant model and allows you to do some cool things. </p>

<p>There are a bunch of examples of streams in practice which are interesting to look at, here: <a href="http://nodestreams.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nodestreams.com/</a></p>
