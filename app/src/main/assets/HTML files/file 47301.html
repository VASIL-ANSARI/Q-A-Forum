<p>The <code>ajax()</code> function <strong>sends</strong> the request. You are hiding the drop down elements after you call that function.</p>

<p>The elements don't exist until the <strong>response</strong> is received and the <code>success</code> function is called.</p>

<p>Move the <code>hide()</code> call inside the <code>success</code> function.</p>
