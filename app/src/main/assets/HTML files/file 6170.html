<p>The short answer is yes, you have to package header files with your static library.  You have to package header files with any library in fact, dynamic or static.  The library itself contains the compiled code, but you still have to tell the compiler about the identifiers in the library so when it's compiling your code it knows that they exist.  </p>

<p>If you care, you can package your static library into a static framework with a little care.  You simply create the same directory structure that a dynamic framework has, with your .a file in place of the .dylib (or .so) file.  Frameworks contain a directory for headers, so you can distribute the binary and headers as a single package, and you can easily import headers from a framework without messing with the Additional Header Search Paths build setting.</p>
