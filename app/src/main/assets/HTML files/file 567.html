  <p>These directories contain the core
  cryptography framework and three
  providers (SunJCE, SunPKCS11,
  SunMSCAPI). <strong>SunJCE</strong> contains Java
  implementations of many popular
  algorithms, and the latter two
  libraries allow calls made through the
  standard Java cryptography APIs to be
  routed into their respective native
  libraries.</p>
