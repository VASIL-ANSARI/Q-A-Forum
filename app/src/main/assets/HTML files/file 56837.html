<p>Without knowing specifics about Theano, I remember that one way to turn an <code>if-else</code>  statement into a linear equation is to make your <code>if</code> check into a variable itself, setting it as <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. Then, you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>sign = (R_t &gt; 0) ## this is the part I don't know how exactly to do
(topEquation * sign) + (bottomEquation * (sign ^ 1))
</code></pre>

<p>This has the nice property that if <code>sign</code> is <code>1</code> (or <code>True</code>), the <code>bottomEquation</code> will drop out, being multiplied by <code>1 ^ 1</code> or just <code>0</code>. Similarly, <code>topEquation</code> drops out if <code>sign</code> is <code>0</code>/<code>False</code>. </p>

<p>One note, though maybe Theano can help with this - it will still <strong>evaluate</strong> both equations, so this could present an efficiency concern (for every single input, it's running both equations, and then ignoring one of them).</p>
