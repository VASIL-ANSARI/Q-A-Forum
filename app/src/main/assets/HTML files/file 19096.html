<p>An important point of <code>#import</code> is exactly that it prevents interferences among the templates by giving them their own namespaces. So that's why it doesn't work. If you want the templates to share that variable, use a global variable: <code>&lt;#global a = 0&gt;</code> instead of <code>#assign</code>. Or, you can set the variable in the imported namespace like <code>&lt;#assign a = 0 in my&gt;</code>.</p>
