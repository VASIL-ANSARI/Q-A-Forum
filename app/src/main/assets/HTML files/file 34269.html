<p>If the head should only be created once, then that's what the constructor is for!</p>

<pre><code>List() {
    // initialize head here
    head = new Node();
    head.next = head;
    head.previous = head;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I think you need to think a bit longer about what you want your list's nodes to look like. Do I understand correctly that you're trying to create a doubly linked sorted list? If so, it's probably of most use if its nodes contain data objects of type <code>Comparabe</code>, so that you can reuse the list for other purposes. (Even fancier would be to make its data type generic <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>.)</p>

<p>Finally, if you're trying to store frequencies of letters in the list, then the data type will need to have two fields, one for the letter's frequency and one for the letter it's counting. And you'll have to decide which of the two you wish to use for sorting: the character or the frequency. I'd expect the character.</p>

<p>Anyways, try to draw a little picture first of what you'd like to do, before you start coding away.</p>
