<p>As i said in my comment, THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDABLE but anyway....</p>

<p>You can use sockets reading byte by byte:

<p>or you can use ftp: 
<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.ftp.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/book.ftp.php</a></p>

<p>Anyway, the problem in your approuch is doing the process async or sync with the user navigation? I really suggest you passed it by sql or ftp and give the user a response based on another event (like a file watching, then email, etc) or using sql (binary, blob, etc)</p>
