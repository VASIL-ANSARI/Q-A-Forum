<p>If this is something where people will actively trying to defeat your security, this won't work. But if people want to view this multiple times, they'll find a way to do it regardless of what you do.
Grab the IP Address </p>

<pre><code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
</code></pre>

<p>Toss it into a file, database, whatever floats your boat</p>

<p>Start the page with </p>

<pre><code>$viewedonce = array(); // populate this however you've stored the data
if (in_array ($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], $viewedonce)) 
{
header("location: http://redirect.com");
   exit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like to combine cookies and IPs, go to town.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If all you are after is "AS SOON AS THIS PICTURE IS VIEWED ONCE, BY ANYONE, NO ONE ELSE CAN VIEW IT"</p>

<p>just serve the file, and then delete it</p>

<pre><code>unlink($theFile);
</code></pre>

<p>you can also rename the file and delete it...</p>

<pre><code>rename('theFile.jpg', 'derp/theFile.jpg');
</code></pre>

<p>or copy the file and delete it...</p>

<pre><code>copy('theFile.jpg', 'derp/thefile.jpg');
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to do.</p>
