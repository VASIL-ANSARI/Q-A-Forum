<p>The compiler is warning you not to use <code>scanf("%s")</code>, because it has <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3302594/3601420">serious security problems</a>. It's also warning you not to use <code>fopen</code>, but <code>fopen</code> is perfectly safe as long as you check <code>errno</code>. They're recommending you use <code>fopen_s</code> instead, which is available in C11 only. It seems the main difference is that <code>fopen_s</code> returns it's error code instead of setting <code>errno</code>. That's not really a compelling reason to use it.</p>
