<p>You can do your db work in background thread:</p>

<pre><code>public void myFunc()
{
    lbl_status.Text = "Loading ... Please Wait";
    BackgroundWorker bw = new BackgroundWorker();
    bw.DoWork += bw_DoWork;
    bw.RunWorkerCompleted += bw_RunWorkerCompleted;
    bw.RunWorkerAsync();
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: oops DB works should be in the DoWork event handler :)</p>

<pre><code>void bw_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    // Some Database Works
}

void bw_RunWorkerCompleted(object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    lbl_status.Text = "Done";
}
</code></pre>
