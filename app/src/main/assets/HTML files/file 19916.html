<p>I'm not quite sure about your needs but I would recommend to have store.abc.com as subdomain - this way you can link xyz.com and store.abc.com to the same folder and keep abc.com to the main wordpress folder. But again need to look deeper into the setup. we just transferred one of the store to amazon AWS.</p>
