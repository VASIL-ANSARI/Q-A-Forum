<p>I think you'll need to implement your own radiogroup logic for that. It will need to register itself as the OnCheckedChangeListener for each button it manages.</p>

<p>I wish the API wasn't designed with RadioGroup as a LinearLayout. It would have been much better to separate the radio group management from layout.</p>
