  <p>Can this be done with just an insert + case statement?</p>

<p><code>CASE</code> would make the <em>value</em> conditional - in your case you want to make the insert itself conditional.  A better method would just be to insert records that have a <code>other_functions</code> value:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO {table}
(ItemID, VendorId, Function)
(
SELECT ItemID, VendorId, other_functions
FROM {table}
WHERE other_functions IS NOT NULL
)
</code></pre>
