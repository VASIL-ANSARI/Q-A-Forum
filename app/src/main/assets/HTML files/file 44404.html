<p>Your regex string is a little off, but not bad. I'd really do</p>

<pre><code>Regex(@"^\d+\.wav$");
</code></pre>

<p>Which will match all file names that have one or more digits as their name and wav as their extension.</p>

<p>The real issue here is that all of your strings start with <code>C:\WaveFiles\</code> which is why your regex is failing.</p>

<p>You will want to add a line to get the filename from the full path:</p>

<pre><code>Path.GetFilename(path);
</code></pre>
