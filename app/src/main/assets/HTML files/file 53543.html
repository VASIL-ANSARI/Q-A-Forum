<p>This is a valid question, why downvotes?</p>

<p>First, as comment suggests, you might really want to implement your function in C++, as Qt provides C++ interface. General way to do it is to declare your function as slot and attach to 'click' signal of the button. Then you can emit the output as another signal and attach it to a 'text' slot in textarea widget. See <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html" rel="nofollow">http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html</a>.</p>

<p>Next, if you really want to call implementation in C, provide a header file with prototypes of those functions with prepended </p>

<pre><code>extern "C"
</code></pre>

<p>linkage specifications. Then you can include this header file from C++ and safely call C functions.</p>
