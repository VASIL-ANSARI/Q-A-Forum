<p>I don't know gems for this, but if I had to solve this problem, I would download some english words dictionary and read about text searching algorythms.</p>

<p>When you have more than one variant to divide letters (like in sepp2k's <em>expertsexchange</em>), than you can have two hints:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your dictionary is sorted by... for example, <em>popularity of a word</em>. So dividings with most popular words will be more valuable.</li>
<li>You can go to the main page of site with domain you are anazyling and just read the content, searching your words. I don't think that you'll find <em>sex</em> on a page for some experts. But... hm... experts can be so different ,.)</li>
</ol>
