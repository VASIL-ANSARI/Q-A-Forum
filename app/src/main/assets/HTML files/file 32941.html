<p>What really was happening since your row height was 44 and you had 8 objects in it so at height 44*8 (.i.e 352) or more than that , your tableview would not scroll. Your total height of the table view should be less than (<strong>numberoOfRows)*(rowHeight)</strong> if you want the tableview to scroll.And this is the reason that after you made it 264 it worked fine. <strong>The scrolling is related to the height of the tableView not the area of tableview that is visible</strong>. Hope this clarifies if you had any doubt.</p>
