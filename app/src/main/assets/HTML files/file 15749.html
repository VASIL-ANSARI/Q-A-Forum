<p>I think your <code>sleepForInterval</code> is blocking the NSURLConnection's activity -</p>

  <p>No run loop processing occurs while the thread is blocked.</p>

<hr>

<p>I think you might have to rethink how you're setting your <code>downloadComplete</code> variable. Consider using your  <code>connectionDidFinishLoading:connection</code> delegate method to determine when the download is complete instead of your loop + sleep?</p>

<pre><code>- (void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection
{        
    self.downloadComplete = YES;

    // release the connection, and the data object
    [connection release];
    [receivedData release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the <code>connection:connection didFailWithError:error</code> delegate method to ensure you're dealing with situations where the download does not complete.</p>
