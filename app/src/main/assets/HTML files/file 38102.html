<p>Normally, blocking occurs on a named pipe, when you use <code>write</code> or <code>read</code> system calls. So, if the pipe is opened for reading, the process will block until some other process opens it for writing and vice-versa. If this behavior is undesirable, the <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> flag can be used in an <code>open()</code> call to disable the default blocking action.</p>

<p>If you wish to know when a pipe is ready to read/write, you should look into <code>man 2 select</code> and <code>man 2 poll</code> commands, which notify such events.</p>

<p>If you use blocking calls, you can also use the <code>FIONREAD</code> in an <code>ioctl</code> call:</p>

<pre><code> rc = ioctl(pipefd, FIONREAD, &amp;nBytesAvailable);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>ioctl()</code> calls behaviors are implementation defined and you should check your system's man pages(<code>man 2 ioctl</code>) to get more accurate idea.</p>
