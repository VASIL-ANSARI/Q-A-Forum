<p>Unless you want to use a 3rd party solution like <a href="http://brandonwalkin.com/bwtoolkit/" rel="nofollow">BWToolkit</a>, you can simply use a standard <code>NSToolbar</code>, that sends selection notifications to one of your controller classes. You can then use an <code>NSTabView</code> to switch between the panels, and in your <code>IBAction</code> method (that receives selection notifications) you can determine which item is selected, and programmatically switch your <code>NSTabView</code> to the proper index.</p>
