<p>I would have done it so..
Just push state changes to your UI thread and display them there.
You can do that via <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html" rel="nofollow">BroadcastReceiver</a>, which is intended to let background services communicate with UI activities, or <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/LocalBroadcastManager.html" rel="nofollow">LocalBroadcastManager</a> which is simpler version of the previous. </p>

<p>Here on StackOverflow you will find dozens of questions describing how to implement it.</p>
