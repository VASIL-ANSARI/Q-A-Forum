<p>To add spacing between components in (most) layouts, you can use setSpacing(boolean) - e.g. <code>horizontalLayout_4.setSpacing(true);</code></p>

<p>If you want to change the <em>size</em> of the spacing, you must change this in CSS.</p>

<p>I don't understand what you are doing there with the size of the button &amp; label; as far as I'm aware, setting the width/height to negative values is not valid in Vaadin.</p>
