<p>Are you sure that you are using the appropriate <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html" rel="nofollow">RoundingMode</a>?  RoundingMode 1 is <code>ROUND_DOWN</code> and RoundingMode 5 is <code>ROUND_HALF_DOWN</code>.  Perhaps you are supposed to use <code>ROUND_HALF_EVEN</code> (which is common in some financial scenarios)?</p>

<p>Also, the code would be clearer if you used these enum constants instead of the <code>RoundingMode.valueOf</code> method.</p>
