<p>I was hoping to find a "safer" way to edit the generated code, which is the primary reason that I posted this question, but I still never found a method of changing the generated code within Netbeans.</p>

<p>I did end up solving my issue by using Notepad++ to edit my files, as described in this SO question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/450727/bypassing-lock-on-generated-code-in-netbeans-6-5">Bypassing Lock on Generated Code in NetBeans 6.5?</a></p>

<p>The errors I was having now appear to be resolved, but I cannot yet see any side-effects (because some other errors have still kept me from a successful build).</p>

<p>Summary: Use an External Text Editor, but be careful because you could break the GUI Builder.</p>
