<p>Since it is <code>jquery</code> event <code>angular</code> will not be aware of this event immediately. It will have to wait till the next digest cycle and that is causing the delay. You try using <code>$scope.$apply</code></p>

<pre><code>$scope.$apply(function() {
        if ($location.path() == '/') {
            $location.path('/ser/mynewpath');
            alert("fired"); // just to check the event was fired
        }
}
</code></pre>
