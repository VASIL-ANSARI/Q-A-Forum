<p>what you have are two different coordinate spaces that should be independent from each other.
The ball should move in the "world" coordinate space, independently from the "screen" coordinate space. Of course that the "world" must be displayed on the "screen", so you must convert the "world" coordinate space to "screen" coordinate space, which in you case is a simple translation that can be done by adding an offset.</p>

<p>On iPhone, you can simply put all the "world objects" inside a <code>UIView</code> and move that 'UIView' left and right, while the world objects move relatively to the "world" inside that view, and the conversion from "world coordinate space" (the view coordinate space) to the screen coordinate space will be done for you when the view is drawn on screen.</p>
