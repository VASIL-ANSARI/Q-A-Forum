<p>Your question borders on asking for recommended libraries and opinions. Nonetheless, let me summarize the options and the way I see them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't chop your text into divs, but <strong>use other SSRS toolbox items</strong> such as tablix cells and textboxes, and give <em>those</em> a background color.</li>
<li><strong>Create your own component</strong>. Certainly possible, but quite a pain to get it working IMHO.</li>
<li>Choose a <strong>third party component</strong>. Stack Overflow isn't very good at (nor meant for) recommendations, but a quick search would render at least <a href="http://www.aspose.com/reporting-services/pdf-component.aspx" rel="nofollow">one result</a>.</li>
<li>Switch to <strong>another reporting tool</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Drop the requirement</strong>. (Okay, you stated that's not possible for <em>you</em>, but others landing here may want to consider that option.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't skip the final two options too quickly ;-)</p>
