<p>The first thing you should do is to read this thread on SO  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14994391/thinking-in-angularjs-if-i-have-a-jquery-background?rq=1">&quot;Thinking in AngularJS&quot; if I have a jQuery background?</a>. This will give you some perspective.</p>

<p>When it comes to Angular, it the model that drives the view and most of the times direct DOM manipulation is not required.</p>

<p>For example if you are using DOM manipulation to show\hide element, add remove class or set style, then better to use <code>ng-show\ng-class\ng-style directive</code>.</p>

<p>But there are cases when DOM manipulation is required and that is the time you write directives and either use jqLite or jQuery to manipulate DOM. </p>

<p>My suggestion would be to avoid jQuery unless you have to incorporate a jquery plugin that is dependent on jQuery.</p>

<p>While developing always look if the inbuilt directives that can serve your purpose. If not can jqLite be used to achieve what is desired. Your final resort should be jQuery. </p>
