<p>There are two things I can think of as reasons why it is doing this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The file path isn't formatted incorrectly. Try checking backslashes, colons, etc.</li>
<li>The box isn't updating the value. Try literally clicking in the text field and hitting enter.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all I can think of without seeing your quartz composition and/or code.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Check the other continuous box, in the general properties.</p>
