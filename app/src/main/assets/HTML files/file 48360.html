<p>Checking for multiples of three in this example is a bit pointless, because it will return every item in your list, since each is a multiple of three. However you can check using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow">filter</a></p>

<pre><code>list_to_check = [3,6,9,15,24,27,30,33]
multiples = filter(lambda x: x%3==0, list_to_check)
</code></pre>

<p>The second part of your question doesn't make sense, though. </p>
