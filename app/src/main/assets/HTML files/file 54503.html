<p>Instead of ScrollView use a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/NestedScrollView.html" rel="nofollow">NestedScrollView</a>.</p>

<p>The collapsing Toolbar behavior that CoordinatorLayout provides requires that the scrolling element supports nested scrolling.  This is needed in order to propagate the scroll event all the way up to the AppBarLayout and Toolbar.</p>

<p>If you are only supporting api-21 and up, you could use a ScrollView or ListView and call <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setNestedScrollingEnabled(boolean)" rel="nofollow">setNestedScrollingEnabled(true)</a>, and it would work.</p>

<p>For supporting lower api levels, use the support library classes that inherently support nested scrolling, such as <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/NestedScrollView.html" rel="nofollow">NestedScrollView</a> and <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html" rel="nofollow">RecyclerView</a>.</p>
