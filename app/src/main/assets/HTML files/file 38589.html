<p>You should throw away anything that you have done so far. Then read a book about object oriented programming and than start again from scratch.</p>

<p>In simplicity, you should create a base class Rack and then inherit specific Rack types (i.e. derived classes) from it. The Catalogue nor any other class should not know the details of objects derived from Rack. It should ask the Rack-derived objects to do actions by calling their virtual methods rather than ask for/access their private details.</p>

<p>Moreover - forget about the existence of new and delete now. You do not need it yet. It makes your code worse.</p>
