<p>You should be able to achieve what you want by using the following MySQL query:</p>

<pre><code>select sum('amount') from 'some_table'
    where dayofmonth('sell_date') &gt;= 1
        and dayofmonth('sell_date') &lt; dayofmonth(currdate())
    group by month('sell_date');
</code></pre>

<p>I hope it works, did not have some database to test.</p>

<p>You could eventually also group by branch, by adding an additional <code>, 'branch'</code> before the query's semicolon.</p>
