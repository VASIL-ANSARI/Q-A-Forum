<p>It depends on the plugin for your modal window. Generally, you have 2 choices when loading content into a modal window:</p>

<ul>
<li>predefined content </li>
<li>content loaded dynamically via ajax or similar</li>
</ul>

<p>If you predefine the content, you could use PHP to generate the content if the javascript is in your PHP page. If you want to use ajax, this might be better because then you could hit a PHP page which would give you whatever dynamic content you like.</p>
