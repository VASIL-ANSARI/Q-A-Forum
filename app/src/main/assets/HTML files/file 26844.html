<p>0.7 cannot be represented exactly as a <code>float</code> value, so <code>a</code> stores some approximation of it. The gotcha here is that the literal 0.7 has type <code>double</code>, so a more precise approximation of 0.7 is used to represent it. That approximation may differ from the less precise one in either direction.</p>

<p>To fix, use a <code>double</code> variable, or a <code>float</code> literal <code>0.7f</code>.</p>
