<p>The easiest way is to use the <code>Contains</code> method</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;int&gt; theList = GetListFromDatabase();
if (theList.Contains(theNumber)) {
  // It's in the list
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your Q said this isn't working for you though.  Could you give some more information?  The above pattern should work just fine</p>
