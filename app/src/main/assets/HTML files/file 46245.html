<p>Whether you get exactly the same results will vary based on what conditions you are evaluating, your equipment, settings, and other factors. But yes, generally <code>if</code>/<code>elseif</code>/<code>else</code> with strict comparison (<code>===</code>) will outperform <code>switch</code>. The reason is that <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.switch.php" rel="nofollow"><code>switch</code> uses "loose" (i.e., type-insensitive) comparison (<code>==</code>)</a>, which is slower than type-sensitive comparison (<code>===</code>).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that these differences are extremely tiny and are going to be dwarfed by any inefficiencies in your algorithm. So, you should only tune for details like this after you are sure you have eliminated other major bottlenecks.</p>
