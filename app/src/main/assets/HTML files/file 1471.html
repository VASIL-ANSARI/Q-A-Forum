<p>You can make periodic calls with xmlhttprequest and you can accurately obtain some network diagnostics.  For instance,  you can determine how fast files are transferring by seeing how long it takes to download them.   You can also make periodic tests and count the failure to determine packet loss.   However a tool like fping is much much better at identifying packet loss.   The "Same Origin Policy" for javascipr puts a serious limitation on what you can do.  Having a client side application written in C++ or even Java (maybe an applet?) would be more accurate and could provide a wider verity of tests (like the tests that fping is capable of).</p>
