<p>I would do a search function on the href value.  If you have links to multiple pages, then you could take the code further to include <code>window.location.pathname</code>, but here's a good start on searching for the domain name:</p>

<pre><code>$("#accordion a").each(function() 
{
    if (this.href.search(window.location.hostname) != -1)
    {
        $(this).addClass("active-sidebar-link");
    }
});â
</code></pre>

<p>Or, as I said in my comment above, you may want to use a regex instead.</p>
