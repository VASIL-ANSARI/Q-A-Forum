<p>If you really want to do this with Java, and really want to write your own CSV parser as you currently did, you can</p>

<ol>
<li>Instead of printing out each 'CSV-file value', you will have to store them. You could for example use an <code>ArrayList</code> for each column in the CSV file, and populate those while reading the CSV file</li>
<li>Once the file is read, you can loop over those <code>ArrayList</code> instances again to construct one big <code>INSERT</code> statement for all data, or one <code>INSERT</code> statement for each row you encountered in the CSV file. If you would opt for the last option, it is not even necessary to use those <code>ArrayList</code> instances. In that case you could construct an indiviual <code>INSERT</code> statement while reading the CSV file, and submit it to the DB after each time a row has been read.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know the approach of constructing your query while reading the CSV file would be possible as well if you want to go for one big <code>INSERT</code> statement, but separating the <code>INSERT</code> from the reading of the CSV file has the big advantage you can replace your own CSV parser later on by a standard one without too much trouble. </p>
