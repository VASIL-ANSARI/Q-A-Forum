<p>You have a typo here:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementByID("variableToPass").value = variableToPass;
                      ^
</code></pre>

<p>change it to:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById("variableToPass").value = variableToPass;
</code></pre>

<p>The value doesn't get changed and stays with the default value, being <code>variableToPass</code>, which coincides with the PHP variable name.</p>

<p>Besides you don't need to change innerHTML - it is input, it has its value.</p>
