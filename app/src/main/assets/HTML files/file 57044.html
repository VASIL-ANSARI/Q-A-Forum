<p>So the easiest way to do this if you have a small number of columns is by a few <code>unions</code>.  By selecting 1 column at a time from <code>Table1</code> and <code>union all</code> for all 3 columns you effectively change the format of that table to the same as <code>table2</code> and then you can just do an <code>inner join</code> at that point.</p>

<pre><code>;WITH cteTransformTable1 AS (
    SELECT
        'A' as Col1
       ,[A] AS Col2
    FROM
       Table1

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'B' as Col1
       ,[B] AS Col2
    FROM
       Table1

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        'C' as Col1
       ,[C] AS Col2
    FROM
       Table1
)

SELECT *
FROM
    cteTransformTable1 t1
    INNER JOIN Table2 t2
    ON t1.Col1 = t2.Col2
    AND t1.Col2 = t2.Col2
</code></pre>
