<p>You need to fetch the values and process them in your application. You cannot pass a PHP function to MySQL.</p>

<p>If possible, use whatever SQL commands can perform an equivalent operation. MySQL supports a number of functions that could probably do what you want.</p>

<p>Generally what this means is you need to create a <code>profit</code> column, populate it, index it, then use it in your query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM products WHERE profit &gt; 10
</code></pre>

<p>As to how you go about populating this, it could be as easy as:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE products SET profit=(price - shipping - acquisition - fees)
</code></pre>

<p>It's not clear why you are adding these numbers up in the first place.</p>
