<p>While not answering your original question can I just remark that <code>MPI_Bcast</code> and <code>matrixmult</code> both take <code>tmp</code> as a first argument in the <code>else</code> block, perhaps using it as a destination to store variables. </p>

<p>Without seeing how those two functions are implemented you can't know for sure whether <code>tmp</code> is used unitialised. </p>

<p>Also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8029584/why-does-malloc-initialize-the-values-to-0-in-gcc%20though"><code>malloc</code>-allocated memory can sometimes be 0 initalised</a> though it's not behaviour I would rely on.</p>

<p>And finally, if you're going to use the code in the slides <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/605845/do-i-cast-the-result-of-malloc">don't cast the result of <code>malloc</code></a>.</p>
