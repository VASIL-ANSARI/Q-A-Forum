<p>There is no GPU in the emulator, thats why the CPU Usage is so hight.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>you can enable the GPU: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/23607021/2494799">http://stackoverflow.com/a/23607021/2494799</a> ..</p>

<p><code>Is there some CPU usage per app restriction on Android phones?</code> yes there is, it's the kernel in your phone who specify the amount of resources (ram cpu..) allocated to each app (process) depending on what currently running, heat... what you should do is to focus on your app code to improve performance based on your devices not the emulator</p>
