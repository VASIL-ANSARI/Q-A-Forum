<p>OK, what I THINK you're wanting is to look at the Application.OpenForms collection.</p>

<p>Form1 instantiates a new instance of Form2</p>

<pre><code>Dim f2 as New Form2
f2.Name = "foo"
f2.Show
</code></pre>

<p>Then in form1 you might be able to get what you're wanting with</p>

<pre><code>For Each child as Form in Application.OpenForms.OfType(Of Form2)()
    Debug.WriteLine(child.Name)
Next
</code></pre>
