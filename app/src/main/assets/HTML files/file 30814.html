<p>assuming a couple of things about your data and function this should work:</p>

<pre><code>select a.colx, b.colx from 
(select colx, row_number() over(order by colx) rown from dbo.SplitString('test,test1',',')) a
join a
(select colx, row_number() over(order by colx) rown from dbo.SplitString('45,78',',')) b
on a.rown=b.rown
</code></pre>
