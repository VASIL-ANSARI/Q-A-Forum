<p>You can store a single UTC datetime value and adjust it according to (1) user's timezone (See <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_convert-tz" rel="nofollow">CONVERT_TZ</a>) and (2) an indicator on the event indicating if it is all-day or not. If not all-day, convert the datetime to a date (without timezone conversion), otherwise apply the timezone conversion mentioned above. If you want to save on database fields, use a second datetime for the end, leaving it null for all-day events.</p>
