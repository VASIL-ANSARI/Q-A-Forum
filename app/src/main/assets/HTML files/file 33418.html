<p>I'm not fully understanding, but part of your problem may be this part:</p>

<pre><code>{% if word == interest %}
</code></pre>

<p>You're comparing a particular Post with <em>all</em> of your Interests (since <code>'interest' = Interests.objects.all()</code>). At the very least I would change that to:</p>

<pre><code>{% if word == item %}
</code></pre>

<p>As this iterates through your interest list (using 'item') and compares it to each 'word' in your post list. </p>
