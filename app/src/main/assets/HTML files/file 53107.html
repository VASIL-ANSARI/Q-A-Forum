<p>You get an error running the jar file. It displays for a split second and the it exists.</p>

<p>Try running it from the command line. That will give you more insight in to the  error that prevents you from running the jar file. </p>

<p>Go to cmd (press Windows key and type 'cmd', press Enter). Navigate to the directory where you have the jar file and execute</p>

  <p>java -jar yourJarName.jar</p>
