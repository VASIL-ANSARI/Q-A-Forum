<p>I don't really understand why you're asking for help, when the required action is contained in your code already:</p>

<pre><code>    // TODO: two things
    // 1: place a '\0' after the current word
    // 2: advance nextindex to the beginning
    // of the next word
</code></pre>

<p>So let's break it down.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You need to search through your string until you find a space.  You already have a loop that does the reverse.  You replace the character that follows your word with a <code>'\0'</code>.  Be careful not to run past the end of your string.</p></li>
<li><p>I think number 2 doesn't require explanation, except to say that you need to make sure that if you find yourself at the end of the input string (in number 1 above), you set <code>nextindex</code> to -1.</p></li>
</ol>
