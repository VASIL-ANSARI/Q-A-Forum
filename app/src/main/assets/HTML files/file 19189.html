<p>At first glance, I would say you need to assign the result of your %-operation somewhere:</p>

<pre><code>settings = settings % user_var
</code></pre>

<p>In stead of</p>

<pre><code>settings% (user_var)
</code></pre>

<p>(the <code>()</code> around the user_var make no difference, if you want it to be a tuple, use <code>(user_var, )</code>, but this is besides the point, both should work).</p>

<p>Somehow the whole thing doesn't feel very safe or secure, but you only asked for a fix of your code ;) </p>
