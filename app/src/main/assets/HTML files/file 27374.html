<p>Your project should already include a <code>DEBUG</code> preprocessor macro (defined as part of the project template). This is defined in the build settings and only set for the Debug build configuration. You can use this setting and define others if required. Then, when you build for Debug / Release the flags will automatically be enabled / disabled.</p>

<p>You use them like:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef DEBUG
    // TEST
#else
    // PRODUCTION
#endif
</code></pre>
