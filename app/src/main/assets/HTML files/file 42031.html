<p>Okay, so after looking for an answer it seems the problem isn't with my code, the problem is with android 5.</p>

<p>I tried many tutorials of JsonArray/JsonObject, downloaded their samples etc but nothing worked. Also, I've witnessed a growing number of developer who suffer from the same problem.</p>

<p>Thanks to Lena's advice I tried GSON again, and this time it worked. The last time I tired using GSON the problem was my poor implementation.</p>

<p>Thank you all.</p>
