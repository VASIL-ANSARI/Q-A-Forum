<p>This is a pointer which points to an array of <code>X</code> chars. </p>

<p>The C standard does not specify any particular size for a pointer.  On common systems however, pointers are all the same size; so probably 4 bytes on your system.</p>

<p><code>X</code> is part of the size of what is being pointed to, not the size of the pointer itself.</p>
