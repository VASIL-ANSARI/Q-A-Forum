<p>I'd agree that those are your two options. If you want to only forward some clicks to your usercontrols, then go with option 1, and hit test the controls under the canvas.</p>

<p>If you need your usercontrols to behave as though there is nothing covering them (textboxes, buttons etc), then i'd recommend using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.uielement.previewmousemove.aspx" rel="nofollow">PreviewMouseMove</a> event on the user control's parent, as this can pick up and optionally "handle" events before the controls get at the event, but it won't block the event if you don't set handled to true</p>
