<p>Do you use @using (Html.BeginForm()) in your .cshtml?</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is MVC. MVC is stateless, which means if you don't render it then you loose it :( </p>

<p>If you use model binding and scaffolding, then you can save some time and work but at the end it will be the same solution.</p>
