<p>By two ways you can achieve this, </p>

<p>(1) Get the max of ItemId and put it in one local variable.</p>

<pre><code>Declare @max_itemid int =(select max (itemid ) from services ) 
</code></pre>

<p>Already through cursor loop you have all the remaining column values in local variables. (From select query )</p>

<p>Now all you need to do is Insert. (Using union all )</p>

<pre><code>Insert into services (
&lt;column list &gt;)
Select @max_itemid+1 as item_id, @pkg, @service_id, get date()
UNION ALL 
Select @max_itemid+2 as item_id, @pkg, @service_id, get date()
UNION ALL 
Select @max_itemid+3 as item_id, @pkg, @service_id, get date()
</code></pre>

<p>All the codes mentioned above should reside inside while @@fetch status block </p>

<p>(2) Approach two is simple, you don't need to get the max and increment it every time, make item_id as identity column. (Not sure your business needs accordingly you decide )</p>
