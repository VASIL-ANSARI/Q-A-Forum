<p>I don't think what you're trying to do is possible since your assumption that "a graphics object really always refers to a bitmap" is false.</p>

<p>There's a good article <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/hu-HU/netfxcompact/thread/286703c6-c6af-46a6-b7e0-c4f17ee8ea65" rel="nofollow">here</a> that shows how to render a control to bitmap if you really want a bitmap and another one <a href="http://www.wyvernzora.com/2012/12/ripple-effect-in-winforms-c.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> that shows how to quickly update the screen at the WndProc level. If you're more familiar with C++ that might get you going the right direction.</p>
