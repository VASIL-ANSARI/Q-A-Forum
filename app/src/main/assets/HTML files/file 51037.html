<p>Bootstrap 3 doesn't suport IE7. You should be able to add it back, though, see this link: <a href="https://github.com/coliff/bootstrap-ie7" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/coliff/bootstrap-ie7</a>. But unless your customers are hellbent on IE7, forget about it. And if they are hellbent, convince them otherwise. And if you can't convince them, drop them. You'll be the one supporting that crap.</p>
