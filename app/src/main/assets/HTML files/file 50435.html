<p>I would actually organize it more "complex".</p>

<p>Every step in the dialog should have a pointer to the next, so you can
choose, wich part of the dialog is the next.
This makes everything easier, you can even go back in your tree.</p>

<p>So the Dialogpart class holds:<br>
*pointer to the next part<br>
*aviable choices<br>
*func to choose<br>
*func to draw buttons for choices  </p>

<p>Implementations like you did are okay for a small application, but horrible for
bigger games or actually longer dialoges.</p>
