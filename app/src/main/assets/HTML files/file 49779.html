<p>With graph colouring.</p>

<p>Make a node for each module, and whenever a student has modules i and j then there is an edge between nodes i and j. Colour the graph, the colours represent days. There is an edge between nodes whenever the modules cannot be on the same day, so the colouring gives a valid schedule. A minimum colouring gives the shortest schedule.</p>

<p>As a suggestion for actually solving the instance (ie, an algorithm for graph colouring), for this size I would take a simple fairly brute force approach, sort of like this:</p>

<pre><code>for k in 1 ..
    tryColour(k, 1)

tryColour(k, i):
    if i &gt; numnodes:
        found it
    for c in 1 .. k:
        if node i can have colour c:
            colours[i] = c
            tryColour(k, i+1)
</code></pre>

<p>I paid no attention to detail there, it's just for the idea: pick a node, give it a colour that is not immediately impossible, then recursively colour the rest. If the recursive colouring comes up empty, try again with the next colour. Do this whole thing with an increasing number of colours until you find a solution.</p>
