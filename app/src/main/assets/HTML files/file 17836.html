<p>This doesn't make any sense, and can't work. Your jQuery code is invoked (presumably) at some later time via a <code>$("selector").gridView()</code> and <em>that</em> is when your plugin executes. Until then, nothing inside your <code>gridView: function</code> has run, and the value of <code>o</code> hasn't been modified when your code reaches <code>console.log(o)</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to persist some data tied to an element, you should use <code>$.data</code> to get and set data attributes on the element your plugin is being bound to. The section on Data in the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Data" rel="nofollow">jQuery Plugin Authoring</a> page will be very useful.</p>
