<p>I see you are calling your window by the same name and yet they are still opening in a new window, it could be because your onclick function hasn't get specific scope to save the reference to the window.</p>

<p>If you were to change onclick to a function you can cache the window.</p>

<pre><code>//js
var myWindow;
function myClick(){
    myWindow = window.open("http://www.google.com", "infoWindow", "width=300, height=250");
    return false;
}

//html
&lt;a href="#" onclick="myClick()"&gt;info1&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
