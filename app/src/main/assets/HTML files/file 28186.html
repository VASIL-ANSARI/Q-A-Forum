<p>There's an error in your JS somewhere other than here - it's halting execution and therefore your event handler never gets bound. </p>

<p>Open up dev tools (F12) and refresh your page and you'll see a script error. This is what's causing the problem.</p>

<p>Also, remember that</p>

<pre><code>e.preventDefault();
e.stopPropagation();
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as </p>

<pre><code>return false;
</code></pre>

<p>It's also kind of strange to stopPropagation() and an event handler that's bound to the body element anyway, although I guess it will stop the event from bubbling up to the document...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT #2</strong></p>

<p>There's one of 3 things going on - 1) there's an error in your code somewhere else that halts execution and the handlers don't get bound, 2) there's an error in your code inside the event handler (there's not from what you posted) or 3) you unbind this event handler (or all event handlers on the body element) specifically in IE8 (unlikely).</p>

<p>Start adding some console.log's to figure out which one of the above is causing your problem.</p>

<p>To be perfectly clear, your event handler should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('body').on('click','.toggle',function(e) {
     e.preventDefault();
     $(this).toggleClass('active');
});
</code></pre>
