<p>I would create a module with your text and import it. That way you shouldn't care at all what it looks like in your editor because you're not really touching that file unless you're specifically trying to edit your huge block of text.</p>

<pre><code>export default `
  ....huge block of text....
`
</code></pre>

<p>Then where you actually use it:</p>

<pre><code>import hugeText from './text/hugeText'

....

render() {
  return &lt;p&gt;{hugeText}&lt;/p&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Editors like atom and sublime also have "soft wrap" mode so you don't have a ton of horizontal scrolling.</p>
