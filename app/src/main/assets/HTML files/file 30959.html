<p>You created an array, but when an array of objects is created, they are all initialized to <code>null</code> -- the default value for object reference variables.  You need to create some objects and assign them to slots in the array.</p>

<pre><code>carrots carrotArray[] = new carrots[3];

// Place this code
carrotArray[1] = new carrots();

carrotArray[1].setVar(10);
</code></pre>

<p>You could do something similar for position 0 and 2.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Java convention is to capitalize class names, e.g. <code>Carrots</code>.</p>
