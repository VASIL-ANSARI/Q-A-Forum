<p>You want to use a <code>UIPickerViewDataSource</code> and <code>UIPickerViewDelegate</code>, and implement the necessary functions, namely <code>numberOfRowsInComponent:</code> and <code>titleForRow:</code>, through these methods you can draw the data from your <code>NSMutableArray</code>. </p>

<p>The important thing to consider is for you to call <code>reloadAllComponents</code> on the pickerview when you need it to update.  You can also use <code>selectRow: inComponent: animated:NO</code> to keep the picker scrolled to the appropriate selection when you update the components in the list.</p>
