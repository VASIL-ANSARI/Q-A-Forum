<p>to set cursor to end of text</p>

<pre><code>myEditText.setSelection(text.length()); //as you are getting value for text
</code></pre>

<p>And I suggest you to put your code to finding "." under <strong>afterTextChanged()</strong> method. because the official docs says: </p>

<p>public abstract void onTextChanged (CharSequence s, int start, int    before, int count)</p>

<p>This method is called to notify you that, within s, the count characters beginning at start have just replaced old text that had length before. <strong>It is an error to attempt to make changes to s from this callback</strong>.</p>

<p>have a look at official notes:</p>

<p>suggesion in code:</p>

<p>use <strong>replaceAll</strong> to remove the dot</p>

<pre><code>str= str.replaceAll("\\.", "");
            }
</code></pre>
