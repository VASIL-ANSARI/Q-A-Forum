<p>As far as I know there is no ready solution for your problem. I haven't yet tried something like this, but I would use a LinearLayout as the list item. Then just create your own Deflater (e.g. CursorAdapter) that deflates the Layout and checks the length. If needed you should be able to add a new View (e.g. TextView) to the LinearLayout. </p>
