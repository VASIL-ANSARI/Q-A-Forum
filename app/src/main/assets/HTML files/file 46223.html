<p>For class library projects an assemblyname.dll.config is generated for them by default if an App.config is available.</p>

<p>If you don't want to put the required settings in the app.config/web.config of the entry point assembly you can access it as below.</p>

<pre><code>var config = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location);

    var value = config.AppSettings["key"];
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes that the assemblyname.dll.config file is located in the same directory with the assembly.</p>

<p>Note that if you are calling this outside the assembly in questions it will simply refer to whatever assembly is executing at that point.</p>
