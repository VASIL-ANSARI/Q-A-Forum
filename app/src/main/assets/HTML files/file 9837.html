<p>my World class extended GLSurfaceView and was using the MatrixTrackingGL as a wrapper.</p>

<p>the problem was that the Viewport also extended GLSurfaceView and was NOT using the MatrixTrackingGL... stupid.</p>

<p>now the world doesn't extend anything and the Viewport ( extending GLSurfaceView ) implements the Wrapper's change and everything's fine.</p>
