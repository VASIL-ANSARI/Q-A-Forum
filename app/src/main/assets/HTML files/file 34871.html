<p>You have a very poor data layout.  You should have a third table, <code>OrderItems</code> that has one row per order and item in the order.</p>

<p>You can do what you want using string manipulations.  Unfortunately, you cannot take advantage of indexes and other database optimizations.</p>

<pre><code>select i.item_code, count(*) as cnt
from orders o join
     items i
     on concat(' ', o.item_code, ' ') like concat('% ', i.item_code, ' %')
group by i.item_code
order by count(*) desc;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You can create the <code>OrderItems</code> table by running a query quite similar to the one above:</p>

<pre><code>select o.order_id, i.item_code
from orders o join
     items i
     on concat(' ', o.item_code, ' ') like concat('% ', i.item_code, ' %');
</code></pre>

<p>Then insert this into the new table or use <code>create table as</code>.</p>
