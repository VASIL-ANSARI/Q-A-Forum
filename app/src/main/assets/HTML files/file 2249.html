<p>Yes, they can easily be maintained this way if I understand your question correctly. Basically, your XML provides all the information about the images and their grouping, not the jQuery code directly.</p>

<p>You will be able to remotely fetch the XML using Adobe Air, and will also be able to reuse a lot of your jQuery and Flash that you have setup already to build the Air app. </p>

<p>The only caveat is you may need to use the XMLHTTPRequest interface directly for fetching the external XML vs. any of the jQuery AJAX functions. jQuery is meant to run in a browser with cross domain limitations, and I am not sure if it tries to enforce the limitations whether they exist or not. At least try jQuery first just be sure since using a familiar syntax would save time in development.</p>

<p>If you are on a tight deadline, I recommend you build a HTML/CSS/JavaScript Air app vs. a straight Flash/Flex app.</p>
