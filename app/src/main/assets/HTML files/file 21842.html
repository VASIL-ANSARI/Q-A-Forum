<p>Hard to see what the problem is without a stacktrace (post one). </p>

<p>But from what I can see it looks like the NPE could come from any of these two rows:</p>

<pre><code>displayData = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tvDisplayData);      
displayData.setText(provider.list.toString());
</code></pre>

<p>Either displayData (the TextView) is null, or the provider's list. Are you sure you are creating the list in the constructor of the provider?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The error is at row 24 in your DataObjectsProvider:</p>

<pre><code>"at com.d69.dancesongsdb.DataObjectsProvider.(DataObjectsProvider.java:24)"
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT2:</p>

<p>You never called open. Hence the database object is null. There's your crash. You can also check if your cursor you retrieve from that query is null before doing the move to operations on it.</p>
