<pre><code>node *root = (node *)&amp;array;
</code></pre>

<p>You're taking the address of "array" local variable. IOW, you take the address of value that's on the stack, not what you are expecting. You have to modify the function's signature like this:</p>

<pre><code>int mymain(int **myarray, int size);
</code></pre>

<p>and modify its definition accordingly. Then, you can write:</p>

<pre><code>node *root = (node *)array;
</code></pre>
