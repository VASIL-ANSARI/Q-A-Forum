<p>Is Application_End not being called or is it that a break point in Application_End is not being hit?</p>

<p>Application_End is called when the application pool is stopped.</p>

<p>When you are debugging you are attached to the application pool process.</p>

<p>What may be happening is that the debugger looses contact with the application pool before the Application_End is called, and you are therefore not hitting the break point.</p>
