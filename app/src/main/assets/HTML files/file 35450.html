<p>Activities in android are stored in a Stack called activity-stack, when you go to next Activity it's added to the stack, when you go back you pop last element from stack and nothing points at it any more, so <strong>not destroying</strong> is just waste of space!</p>

<p>Even if you override the back button to launch previous activity with <code>noHistory</code> or <code>clearTop</code> flag, current activity would be destroyed.</p>

<p>I suggest that you read more on <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/activity-lifecycle/index.html" rel="nofollow">activity lifecycle</a></p>
