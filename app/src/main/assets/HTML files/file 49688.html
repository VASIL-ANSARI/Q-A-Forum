<p>When the Maximum is 83,64 and you enter 90, you are out of range, so an exception is raised and the last valid value entered is kept : 9.</p>

<p>If you want to set the Maximum value when the value entered is greater than the Maximum, set the property ClipValueToMinMax to true. Entering 90 will result in 83,64.</p>
