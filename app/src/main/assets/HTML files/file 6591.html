<p>Its hard to tell what you are trying to do in the overall code with this snippet but it doesnt look right, no.</p>

<p>The problem I see is that in <code>f()</code> you create the <code>PictureBox pic</code>, set some of its properties but then dont do anything with it. At the end of <code>f()</code> the method returns and <code>pic</code> is destroyed.</p>

<p>If this code actually compiles then from your use of <code>pix[]</code> in the <code>picarray()</code> method I would say you have a class level variable somewhere that is your game board. In that case you dont need the line:</p>

<pre><code>PictureBox[,] pic = new PictureBox[8, 8];
</code></pre>

<p>in <code>f()</code> because its just creating a new empty board that exists only within <code>f()</code> rather than updating your real board.</p>
