<p>Mark the field in question with a <code>UNIQUE</code> constraint and use <code>INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE</code> or <code>INSERT IGNORE</code>.</p>

<p>The former will update the records if they already exists, the latter will just do nothing.</p>

<p>Searching the table first is not efficient, since it requires two roundtrips to the server: the first one to search, the second one to insert (or to update).</p>

<p>The syntaxes above do the same in one sentence.</p>
