<p>I think that it could be possible with OneDrive API and <a href="https://dev.onedrive.com/webhooks/webhooks.htm" rel="nofollow">webhooks</a><br>
Unfortunately I can't find any example for UWP (there is only <a href="https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-webhooks-aspnet" rel="nofollow">one for ASP.NET</a> available)</p>

<p>You can also try to do it with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.search.storagefolderqueryresult.contentschanged.aspx" rel="nofollow">ContentsChanged</a> event</p>

<pre><code> auto query = folder.CreateFileQuery();
 query.ContentsChanged += queryContentsChanged;
</code></pre>

<p>.......</p>

<pre><code>void queryContentsChanged(IStorageQueryResultBase sender, object args) 
{
    // check what was changed 
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can find some information here: <a href="http://lunarfrog.com/blog/filesystem-change-notifications" rel="nofollow">File system change notifications in WinRT</a></p>

<p>That should work with OneDrive also, because of smart files concept. As taken from this article: <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2013/12/06/working-with-files-across-the-local-pc-and-skydrive/" rel="nofollow">Working with files across the local PC and SkyDrive</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a developer, think of SkyDrive files as âjust filesâ â they use the same StorageFile interface as every other file on the system and can be manipulated in much the same way.</p>
  
  <p>A smart file is a file that appears on the system like a regular file but only contains metadata and thumbnails, not full file contents. The contents for the file are located on SkyDrive and can be downloaded as needed.</p>
