<p>The inner shadow appears to be a <code>-webkit-box-shadow</code> (for WebKit at least) that comes from <code>.ui-shadow-inset</code>. The outer "shadow" is almost certainly the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ui.html#dynamic-outlines" rel="nofollow"><code>outline</code> property</a>; the <code>outline</code> generally comes from the browser's default stylesheet. Setting both of those to <code>none</code>:</p>

<pre><code>-webkit-box-shadow: none;
outline: none;
</code></pre>

<p>Gets rid of both effects for me. You'll need to port the <code>-webkit-box-shadow</code> to the other browsers you care about but you can look at <code>.ui-shadow-inset</code> to see what you need to negate.</p>
