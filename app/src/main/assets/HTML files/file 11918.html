<p>I do know that, relative to the workarounds to this issue, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Array.html#newInstance%28java.lang.Class,%20int%29" rel="nofollow"><code>Array.newInstance()</code></a> is an expensive method to call. IIRC it uses a native method to instantiate the array, amidst the other reflection involved. I can't offer any statistics, but this seems like a good enough reason for such functionality not to be automatically substituted in by the compiler in order to allow generic array creation. Especially given the existence of <code>ArrayList</code>, etc. it just doesn't seem like a pressing issue.</p>
