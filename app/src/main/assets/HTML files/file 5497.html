<p>Its important to remember that OpenGL is a state machine, so you have to tell it "I'm going to talk about textures now" that's where the <code>glActiveTexture();</code> comes in.  </p>

<p>Also keep in mind that you will have to load in pixel by pixel the colors from your .jpg (compressed) to your texture array, so either you will need to find a library that will give you bitmap values of your .jpg file or you will need to pre-convert it into a .ppm or a .bmp which will make reading in the values easier.</p>
