<blockquote>
  <p>Could you suggest the best container/doubly-linked list for my scope?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you access elements by index, a linked list is not a good solution: you have to traverse the list from the beginning, so it is an O(N) operation. And for this reason, <code>std::list</code> and <code>std::forward_list</code> have no such access in their interface.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to seamlessly substitute std::vector with any other standard container?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not with an <code>std::list</code>, since it has no access by index. <code>std::deque</code> <em>could</em> be suitable, but only if you do not rely on the underlying data being in one continuous block (I assume you don't, since you are asking about linked lists)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there special issues I have to pay attention to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As always with performance, you should first be sure whether you have a problem or not. <em>If</em> you have a performance issue with <code>std::vector</code>, then try something else, and <strong>measure</strong> the difference in performance in a realistic running scenario. The performance characteristics of different containers can be quite counter intuitive, so measuring is specially important here.</p>
