<p>The image unit is the value of the image uniform variable. While the ES 3.1 spec does not allow <em>setting</em> values for these variables with <code>glProgramUniform1i()</code>, there's nothing I can see that prevents you from <em>getting</em> the value that was set in the GLSL code with the <code>binding=...</code> layout qualifier.</p>

<p>This is based on section 7.10 "Images" of the spec. On page 112, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The value of an image uniform is an integer specifying the image unit accessed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and in the same section on page 113:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The location of an image variable is queried with GetUniformLocation, just like any uniform variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, to get the image unit for variable "MyImage" in program <code>prog</code>:</p>

<pre><code>GLint loc = glGetUniformLocation(prog, "MyImage");
GLint imgUnit = -1;
glGetUniformiv(prog, loc, &amp;imgUnit);
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you the image unit that the image variable in the shader is bound to. If you wanted the image name, you can continue the querying:</p>

<pre><code>GLint imgName = -1;
glGetIntegeri_v(GL_IMAGE_BINDING_NAME, imgUnit, &amp;imgName);
</code></pre>
