<p>No, the <code>link</code> function <strong>does not</strong> <code>trigger</code> the change event. The change event is being triggered by this code:</p>

<pre><code>$datepicker = $(element).datepicker({
        format: "dd/mm/yyyy",
        startDate: 'today',
        language: 'pt-BR',
        autoclose: true,
        todayHighlight: true,
        forceParse: false
      });
   $datepicker.datepicker('setDate', date);
</code></pre>

<p>which actually changes the model <code>$scope.date</code>, that's why the <code>ng-change</code> is being called! </p>

<p>that will answer this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another point is: let's consider that the plugin changes the input.
  This is a programmatic change and the ng-change directive does not
  listen for these programmatic changes, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In another words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically you are changing the format of the input during the link
  event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can workaround by telling your <code>edit()</code> function when the real change happens or you can simply do a simple <code>watch</code> and don't use the <code>ngChange</code> directive.</p>

<pre><code>$scope.$watch('date', function(newValue, oldValue) {

    if(newValue!=oldValue&amp;&amp;newValue!='25/12/2018'){
      console.log(newValue);
      console.log(oldValue);
      $scope.changed = true;
    }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion, if you may. <strong>I won't be using any jQuery in the project</strong>.</p>

<p>You should be using <strong>Angular ui-datepicker</strong> <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/datepicker" rel="nofollow">https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/datepicker</a></p>

<p>About <strong>Angular</strong> with <strong>jQuery</strong> <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq" rel="nofollow">reference</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DOM Manipulation Stop trying to use jQuery to modify the DOM in
  controllers. Really. That includes adding elements, removing elements,
  retrieving their contents, showing and hiding them. Use built-in
  directives, or write your own where necessary, to do your DOM
  manipulation. See below about duplicating functionality.</p>
  
  <p>If you're struggling to break the habit, consider removing jQuery from
  your app. Really. Angular has the $http service and powerful
  directives that make it almost always unnecessary. Angular's bundled
  jQLite has a handful of the features most commonly used in writing
  Angular directives, especially binding to events.</p>
