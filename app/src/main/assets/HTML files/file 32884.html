<pre><code>self.input_queue.put(input())
</code></pre>

<p>This means: ask a user for input <em>right now</em>, than put whatever user input was ino a queue.</p>

<p>Looks like that should be something like</p>

<pre><code>self.input_queue.put(lambda: input())
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like you have omitted some plumbing from your code, so it can't be run as is.</p>
