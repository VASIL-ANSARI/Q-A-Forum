<p><code>func_pointer = func_test</code> and <code>func_pointer = *func_test</code> work because function names are automatically turned into function addresses when used in this context. 
<code>func_pointer(2)</code> works because function pointers automatically dereference themselves, much like references. As to why they do these things, I don't know. Maybe it was decided the syntax was complicated enough already.</p>
