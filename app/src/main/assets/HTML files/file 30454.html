<p>There is one thing your compiler should have told you:  This recursive invocation of search_list doesn't return anything.  Didn't you get a warning about this?  And using recursion here really is a bad idea, better replace it with some kind of loop.  One reason of course is excessive stack usage, another one is debugging sucks with that kind of recursion.</p>
