<li><p>It is indeed very sensible to use the same source control for both types of projects. </p></li>
<li><p>Yes, I'm sure it is. I'm using git both at work and for my hobby projects at home. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm pretty sure that both MS and Apple tools are also able to interact with an existing git repository. You may well have to manually build the project in the respective tools - but this is simply because "Create new project" is really not meant for when you already have a bunch of source-files in the first place. </p>

<p>For a larger project with many different parts, you will probably also want to have several project files that use the same source files, so you will need to somehow manage these things in a way that doesn't involve just clicking a few places. But once you have built your project definition files for the respective IDE, it should be perfectly fine to store all your source and project definitions in a git repo. </p>

<p>And yes, you want a single repo for all (or as much as you can of the) related source - otherwise you will need to keep track of, for example, which version of your project X goes with which version of test Y (because ultimately, you will update X to work differently, so test Y will need to be changed simultaneously - much easier to do that if you have one version control repo than if you have, say, your testcode in one repo and the production code for project X in another repo  - it is generally hard enough to do these things with a single repo!). </p>
