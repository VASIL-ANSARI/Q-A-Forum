<p>To explain some terms. Guice and Spring solving same problem domain, which is dependency injection. So, using Guice and SpringMVC at the same time is somehow not possible or at least contrary. </p>

<p>To difference between Guice and Spring, well said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Steep! Closer to bloody impossible. I think Guice is like taking a
  girl home for the night. Spring is certain marriage, and if not
  careful, painful divorce. â Spider Oct 7 '11 at 16:25</p>

<p>Guice is indeed very lightweight DI framework. But there is not support for routing and templating. You have to do it by yourself trough binding servlets and using tempaltes engine by your own. Or you can use <a href="http://sitebricks.org" rel="nofollow">Sitebricks</a>. You can put all routing into SitebrickModule configuration method like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyAppConfig extends SitebricksModule {
@Override
protected void configureSitebricks() {
    at("/movies").show(MoviesPage.class); // basic page
    at("/actors").serve(ActorsPage.class); // service
    embed(SoundtrackPage.class).as("Soundtrack"); // brick
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Sitebricks also support several tempalting system: MVEL, Freemarker,...</p>

<p>Also, you can easily build up your REST services for javascript usage:</p>

<pre><code>Reply&lt;Product&gt; view() {
  return Reply.with(new Product("Anti-ageing cure"))
              .as(Json.class);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Give it a try.</p>
