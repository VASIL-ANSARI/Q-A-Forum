<p>It is a good practice to see if your delegate responds to the selector you are trying to call.</p>

<p>I would recommend calling it with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>if([self.delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(searchPressed)])
{
    NSLog(@"My delegate is not nil");
    [self.delegate searchPressed];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will tell you if your delegate is set correctly. A big possibility is that your delegate is nil but if you call a selector on a nil object it won't crash but won't do anything.</p>
