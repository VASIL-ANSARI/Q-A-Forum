<p>I don't understand why this question got downvoted, I think it's perfectly clear what is being asked.</p>

<p>It's dependant on your DBMS, but in MySQL and SQL Server you can use GROUP_CONCAT() for this.</p>

<p>example:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT col1, GROUP_CONCAT(col2) FROM table1
GROUP BY col1;
</code></pre>

<p>In Oracle, we have LISTAGG() for this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    col1,
    LISTAGG(col2, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY col2)
FROM table1
GROUP BY col1
</code></pre>
