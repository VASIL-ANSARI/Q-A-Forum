<p>As far as I can see, the <code>User</code> relation in the Post model is causing the exception. So, when you call:</p>

<pre><code>{{ $blog_post-&gt;user-&gt;name }}
</code></pre>

<p>it can't  find the user associated with that post. I am guessing that the foreign key for <code>User</code> table is not the same as <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/eloquent-relationships#one-to-many-inverse" rel="nofollow" title="guessed">guessed</a> by Laravel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eloquent determines the default foreign key name by examining the name of the relationship method and suffixing the method name with _id. However, if the foreign key on the Comment model is not post_id, you may pass a custom key name as the second argument to the belongsTo method:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>public function post()
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo('App\Post', 'foreign_key');
}
</code></pre>

<p>So in your case, it would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public function user()
{
    return $this-&gt;belongsTo('App\User', 'post_user_id'); //Replace post_user_id with the id convention you are using.
}
</code></pre>

<p><s><strong>Update:</strong></s></p>

<p><s>Thanks for the dd on your $blog_posts. I can see that the user is being fetched but it's not being called correctly. It's a function so you need to treat it as a function. Modify your blade file to retrieve the user like this:</p>

<pre><code>{{ $blog_post-&gt;user()-&gt;name }}
</code></pre>

<p>This should get the valid user collection.</s></p>

<p><s><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>As I can see from the dump, the user relation from the second <code>Post</code> is null. Make sure it's not null when you are creating the post and to deal with it in the blade, wrap it in a null check:</p>

<pre><code>@foreach ($blog_posts as $blog_post)
&lt;div class="post item"&gt;
    {{ $blog_post-&gt;post_title }}
    {{ $blog_post-&gt;post_content }}
    @if($blog_post-&gt;user()!=null)
        {{ $blog_post-&gt;user()-&gt;name }}
    @endif
&lt;/div&gt;
@endforeach
</code></pre>

<p></s>
<strong>Update 3:</strong></p>

<p>It actually is supposed to be called as an attribute rather than a function since it returns 'BelongsTo' when called as a function. Try the following now:</p>

<pre><code>@foreach ($blog_posts as $blog_post)
&lt;div class="post item"&gt;
    {{ $blog_post-&gt;post_title }}
    {{ $blog_post-&gt;post_content }}
    @if($blog_post-&gt;user!=null)
        {{ $blog_post-&gt;user-&gt;name }}
    @endif
&lt;/div&gt;
@endforeach
</code></pre>

<p>I've reproduced the same issue here and this fixes it. Let me know if it works for you.</p>
