<p>I guess asking the question here gave me the necessary brain-power to solve this :D</p>

<p>In case anyone is interested, here is what happened:</p>

<p>In the Account Value Object (AccountVO), I had the following:</p>

<pre><code>public var user:UserVO = new UserVO()
</code></pre>

<p>In the User Value Object (UserVO), I had the following:</p>

<pre><code>public var account:AccountVO = new AccountVO();
</code></pre>

<p>So, it basically got stuck in an infinite loop of creating value objects, and never actually responded! Doh!</p>
