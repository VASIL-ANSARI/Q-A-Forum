<p>You are trying to do <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS" rel="nofollow">Cross Origin HTTP Request (CORS)</a>. Solution is to <a href="http://enable-cors.org/server.html" rel="nofollow">enable CORS</a> on your server side and as i can see u got 401 unauthorized so send Authorization header with requests (i dont know your authorization implementation).</p>
