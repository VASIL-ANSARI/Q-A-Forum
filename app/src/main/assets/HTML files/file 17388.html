<p>If you store your SQL file directy into your project root, you'll have the merge available.
Be just careful to make dumps in a way which creates different lines for each insert (I mean INSERT INTO ....  (values),  (values) ...)</p>

<p>If you have a lot of data, I think it's not such a good idea to store it into your Git repository. On my project, we store only the database <em>structures</em> into it, and we have another file which manage inserts (into Git to easily share it (ok I'm lying, I'm using Mercurial, but does it matters?)). When an insert is done on all envs, we simply delete the corresponding row in order not to have too big files there. The full data is saved (and backed-up) outside version control.</p>
