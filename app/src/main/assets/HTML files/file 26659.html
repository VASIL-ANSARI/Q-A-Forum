<p>Why are you storing application logic in your DOM in the first place? Why not store the function in your backing business logic in JavaScript? </p>

<p>This <em>will</em> prove to be a maintainability issue. Do <em>not</em> do this, instead store your functions in code and separate the logic of your presentation from what happens when it runs.</p>

<p>The <em>simplest</em> way is to classify your form and run a function accordingly, a better approach could be using something like an MV* pattern but let's not diverge. Here is the simplest solution I could think of without storing data attributes. This still does not do proper separation of concerns but it is a lot simpler than a data attibute.</p>

...

<p>JavaScript with jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>/now we select by class, and not just any form
$('.successForm').on('submit', function(e){
Â  Â  e.preventDefault();
Â    test();
});

function test(){
Â  Â  alert('run');
};
</code></pre>

<p><sup>THAT said, it <em>can</em> be done. <code>eval($(this).data("success"))</code> - please <em>don't</em> do this though, this bit is just here for completeness</sup></p>
