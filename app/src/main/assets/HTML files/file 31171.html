<p>The order of filter execution is described <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg416513%28VS.98%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.filterscope%28v=vs.98%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
That still stands for MVC 4.</p>

<p>Basically filter registered on Global level (<code>HandleErrorAttribute</code>) gets executed before your custom filter defined on Action level.</p>

<p>This might seem strange - but that's how it is.</p>
