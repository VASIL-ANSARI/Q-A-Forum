<p>I would say there is something else in you App leaking that memory.</p>

<p>Can you paste more of your code, including how you are instantiating *table?</p>

<p>Also you shouldn't rely on the <code>retainCount</code> values to determine whether an object is leaking or not. The system will also retain objects that it needs and release it when they are no longer required, and your retainCount will always be affected by that.</p>

<p>As a general rule, if you alloc, retain or copy an object, it is your responsibility to release it. Everything else is dealt with by the system and will be flushed with the auto release pool.</p>
