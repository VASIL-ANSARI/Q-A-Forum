<p>So many hours I've spent debugging some code like this. :)</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the proper solution to this is, but if you create a new instance of the object, or just clone() it, before sending it the code should work as expected.</p>

<p>It seems as if the VM recognizes the object it is receiving as one that it already has, and simply updates the pointer at the client without bothering to actually check if there are any changes.</p>

<p>try...</p>

<pre><code>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
{
    object.var++;
    //assuming your object supports clone()
    output.write(object.clone());
    output.flush();
    System.out.println(object.var);
}
</code></pre>
