<p>ZIndex is only used to order direct children in a panel, not the children's children. The control you are trying to bring to the top is on a different level in the <code>VisualTree</code> than the Flyouts, so unless you bring the whole <code>Border</code> on top, you can't bring only the <code>Control</code> you want on top.</p>
