<p>That worked for me! it is not realy stable but it works....
I created a GUI and fused the two main classes. I am able to send and receive with one application now.</p>

<p>Beware! ics (ice cream sandwich) has problems with recognizing simple NDEF actions. I used 2.3.3.</p>

<p>If you want to use NFC with Android 4.0.x you should use Android Beam (from google) it was a lot easier to implement. </p>
