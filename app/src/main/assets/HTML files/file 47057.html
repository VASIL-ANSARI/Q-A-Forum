<p>The way to run a coroutine generator is to use <code>yield from</code> (<code>await</code> in Python 3.5) from another coroutine. The <code>yield from</code> (<code>await</code>) is what allows one coroutine to drive another coroutine, which normally means that you have chains of linked coroutines that are ultimately driven by the event loop.</p>

<p>Another option is to use a Task-like wrapper like <code>asyncio.async</code> (<code>ensure_future()</code> in Python 3.5) to drive the coroutine.</p>

<p>Without one of the above, it's just an <em>inert</em> generator object (or coroutine, in Python 3.5) per your observations.</p>
