<p>You need the index of <code>line</code> within <code>thefile</code>. Once you have that, it's easy. And the way you get that is with <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow">enumerate</a>.</p>

<pre><code>def CleanFile(sourceFile):
    global thefile
    thefile=list(csv.reader(open(sourceFile, 'rb'), delimiter=',', quotechar='"'))
    for i, line in enumerate(thefile):
        if line[3]=='':
            del thefile[i]
</code></pre>

<p>However, it's worth asking whether you actually need to delete it. For example, could you just filter it out like this?</p>

<pre><code>def CleanFile(sourceFile):
    global thefile
    thefile=[line for line in 
             csv.reader(open(sourceFile, 'rb'), delimiter=',', quotechar='"')) 
             if line[3] != '']
</code></pre>

<p>Or, depending on what you're doing with the data, maybe it makes even more sense to just skip over lines where <code>line[3] == ''</code> at output or calculation time. Or, even better, don't make a list in the first place; just leave csv.reader as an iteratorâthen you can stick a filter in front of it via <code>itertools.ifilter</code>, or a generator expression. In fact, that's as simple as just changing two characters:</p>

<pre><code>def CleanFile(sourceFile):
    global thefile
    thefile=(line for line in 
             csv.reader(open(sourceFile, 'rb'), delimiter=',', quotechar='"')) 
             if line[3] != '')
</code></pre>

<p>Of course this makes no sense if you need, e.g., random access to <code>thefile</code>. But if you're going to iterate over it line by line, this is probably the best solution. (Except that <code>thefile</code> shouldn't be a global; it should be passed around from function to function as needed.)</p>
