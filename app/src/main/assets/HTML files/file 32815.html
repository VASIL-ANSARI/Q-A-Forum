<p>Your <code>cityLabel</code> property can be weak, but you must add it to the view hierarchy before you can assign the property or assign it to a standard (strong reference) variable.</p>

<p>What is going on is that you're creating a <code>UILabel</code>, then assigning it to a property which assumes no ownership of it (weak). After you've gone past the <code>self.cityLabel = [[UILabel alloc] ...</code> line, the <code>UILabel</code> has already been deallocated and the <code>cityLabel</code> property is nil.</p>

<p>This will correctly do what you intend:</p>

<pre><code>UILabel *theLabel = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 80.0f, 30.0f)];
self.cityLabel = theLabel;
[addressView addSubview:theLabel];
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <code>theLabel</code> will retain the <code>UILabel</code> during for scope of <code>createCityLabel:</code> and adding the <code>UILabel</code> as a subview to a view that is part of the View Controller's view will retain it for the life of the view controller (unless you remove the <code>UILabel</code> from the view or any of the <code>UILabel</code>'s parent views)).</p>
