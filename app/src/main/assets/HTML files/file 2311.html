<p>The Google APIs Add-On for Android is a proprietary product. As such, there is no real public documentation on what data is provided by the various layers (e.g., satellite), just that the layers exist. Moreover, there is no real configuration for what gets displayed on the various layers -- all you can do is toggle the layers on and off and control gross aspects like zoom levels.</p>
