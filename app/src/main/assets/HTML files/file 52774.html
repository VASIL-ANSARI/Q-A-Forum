<p>NULL is likely implemented in a different way on both platforms. The "problematic" implementation creates an ambiguity as there is more than one likely candidate for implicit conversion.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>JsonValue parameters = NULL</code> try <code>JsonValue parameters = JsonValue()</code> - that constructor will create a json value of type null.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even if <code>JsonValue parameters = NULL</code> "works" it will likely be wrong, as it will be equal to something like <code>JsonValue(int(0))</code> and not a "null" json value as in <code>JsonValue()</code> which has a default <code>QJsonValue::Type::Null</code> parameter. So you won't have a NULL json value, but a NUMBER json value with value of 0 - <strong>two completely different things</strong>.</p>
