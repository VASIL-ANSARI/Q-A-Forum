<p>What it looks like is going on with this is that you are double clicking on a regular HTML element. For example, if you have </p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="button" value="Test" id="Test" name="Test" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and double click on it in design view it will create a JavaScript function on the page for it and an onclick event in the element. If you want to create an event handler in the code behind, you need to have an Asp.Net control like </p>

<p><code>&lt;asp:Button runat="server" ID="Test" Text="Test" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>and then double click that to create a code event in the code behind. </p>

<p>Also, make sure that your page directive at the top has the correct filename for its <code>CodeFile</code> attribute to correctly map to an existing code behind file.</p>
