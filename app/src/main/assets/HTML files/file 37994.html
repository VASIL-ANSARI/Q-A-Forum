<p>Thanks to:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4855821/group-by-sum-on-multiple-columns-in-rails-3">group by + sum on multiple columns in rails 3</a></p>

<p>I can do with some SQL:</p>

<pre><code>issues = Issue.group(:tracker_id)
        .select([:tracker_id, "COUNT(subject)", "COUNT(status_id)"])
</code></pre>

<p>Don't know is this the best?</p>
