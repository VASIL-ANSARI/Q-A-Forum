<p>change the code from </p>

<p><code>format ('truetype');</code></p>

<p>to </p>

<p><code>format ('opentype');</code></p>

<p>and this should work for you.</p>

<p>That was listed in the article referenced from the other page near the bottom and it worked for me. This fiddle shows the working example: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Phlume/CMv8G/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/Phlume/CMv8G/1/</a></p>

<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>The article also mentioned that for otf or ttf fonts you can leave the <code>format</code> section off entirely -- it is optional as the format is open type.</p>
