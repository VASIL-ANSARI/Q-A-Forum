<p>Trying to provide the solution. Feel free to correct if there is something wrong in my answer.</p>

<p>If you have a Visual Studio, you can open win32 solution with it. And add in AppDelegate.cpp</p>

<pre><code>#include "network/XMLHTTPRequest.h"

bool AppDelegate::applicationDidFinishLaunching()
{   .......
sc-&gt;addRegisterCallback(MinXmlHttpRequest::_js_register);
.......
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then add the libNetwork subproject, and libNetwork.lib in linker input of your project.</p>

<p>You may also want to refer to the reference below. You may need to use translation feature if you don't understand Chinese :) </p>

<p>Hope it will help.</p>
