<p>Answers to this question will be somewhat opinion-based. From a separation-of-concerns standpoint, if you're already using decorators in your project it might make more sense to put the logic there than in the controller or the model.</p>

<pre><code># maker_decorator.rb
def cars
  if object.new_record? &amp;&amp; object.cars.none?
    3.times { object.cars.build }
  end

  object.cars
end
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to deal with decorators, putting the logic in the controller seems a reasonable approach (as long as it's not being duplicated across multiple actions).</p>

<pre><code># makers_controller.rb
def new
  @maker = Maker.new
  3.times { @maker.cars.build }
end
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't add model code to handle this functionality since that's a rather blatant mixing of model and view concerns, though any use of <code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code> will tend to push you down that route. "Form objects" avert this problem, though that might be a heavyweight solution in your case and there are few established libraries or conventions for this pattern at the moment (<a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/10/17/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/" rel="nofollow">see #3 in this blog post</a>).</p>
