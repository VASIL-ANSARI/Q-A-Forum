<p>You should look at <code>include details of your certificate and its issuer</code>. In my case I accidentally deleted header of a file. When I return it back, the script is connecting successfully.
Before:</p>

<pre><code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIFCBG+gAwIBAg...
</code></pre>

<p>After</p>

<pre><code>Bag Attributes
    friendlyName: ...
    localKeyID: ... 
subject=...
issuer=/C=US/... CN=Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIFCBG+gAwIBAg...
</code></pre>
