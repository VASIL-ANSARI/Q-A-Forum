<p>You should use the JDT API to get a CompilationUnit:</p>

<pre><code>ICompilationUnit cu = JavaCore.create(file);
</code></pre>

<p>and then use this CompilationUnit object to setSelection:</p>

<pre><code>ISelection selection = new StructuredSelection(cu);
</code></pre>

<p>And, by the way, why you want to develop this function yourself? Ctrl+Sihft+T, you can open an dialog to search class and open it in editor. And the package explorer has an "Link with editor" toolbar item that can auto select the class in the active editor.</p>
