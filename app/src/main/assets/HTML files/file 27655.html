<p>I think this is the wrong setup. At the moment, each client links to one telephone id. But you want to have each client having multiple telephone ids.</p>

<p>I would instead have:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE Telephone
(TelephoneID tinyint Primary key,
ClientId smallint foreign key references CLIENT(ClientId),
TelephoneNo int)

CREATE TABLE CLIENT
(ClientID smallint Primary key,
FName varchar(25),
LName varchar(25),
HomeAddress varchar(50))
</code></pre>

<p>From that, it's easy to see how multiple telephone entries can relate to one client.</p>

<p>To get the user details and phone numbers from this do:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CLIENT.ClientID, CLIENT.FName, CLIENT.LName,
  CLIENT.HomeAddress, Telephone.TELEPHONEID 
FROM CLIENT
JOIN TELEPHONE ON Telephone.ClientId = CLIENT.ClientId
</code></pre>

<p>To get the telephone ids as a list:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CLIENT.ClientID, CLIENT.FName, CLIENT.LName,
  CLIENT.HomeAddress, GROUP_CONCAT(Telephone.TELEPHONEID)
FROM CLIENT
JOIN TELEPHONE ON Telephone.ClientId = CLIENT.ClientId
GROUP BY Client.ClientId
</code></pre>
