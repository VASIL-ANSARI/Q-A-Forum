<p>import your Project (rootdir not build) as MakeFile Project into the Workspace (select GNU Toolschain or Linux GCC). Now open your project properties -> c++ build and select the build folder inside your project.</p>

<p>Now you can compile it and create a new run configuration for debugging.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I assume your rootfolder looks like this</p>

<p>cmake/</p>

<p>CmakeList.txt</p>

<p>src/</p>

<p>dep/</p>

<p>../</p>

<p>now you create a folder build
you switch to build and run cmake cmake ../ -flags  (no eclipse-project, use default gcc)</p>

<p>After you have done this u can import your rootfolder to eclipse cdt and select root/build as build folder.  Where is the problem? Eclipse CDT only wants to now where the makefile is at buildtime (thats why you manually need to select the buildfolder)</p>
