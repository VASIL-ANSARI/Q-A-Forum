<p>As long as gcc is allowed to use SSE/SSE2/etc instructions, the compiler will in general produce vector instructions when it realizes that it's "worthwhile". Like most things in compilers, this requires some luck/planning/care from the programmer to avoid the compiler thinking "maybe this isn't safe" or "this is too complicated, I can't figure out what's going on". But quite often, it's successful if you are using a reasonably modern version of gcc (4.x versions should all do this).</p>

<p>You can make the compiler use SSE or SSE2 instructions by adding <code>-msse</code> or <code>-msse2</code> (etc. for later SSE extensions). <code>-msse2</code> is default in x86-64.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any way that you can FORCE this, however. The compiler will either do this because it's happy that it's a good solution, or it wont. </p>

<p>Sorry, can't answer about Graphite. </p>
