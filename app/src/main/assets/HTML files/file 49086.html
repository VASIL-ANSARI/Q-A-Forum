<p>Since a new instance of <code>FooTest</code> is created for each test method (not sure if this is <em>always</em> true with JUnit, but I think it's at least true in the typical case), you're going to be getting a new <code>FileSystem</code> for each test as well unless you make that field <code>static</code>. So deleting the files you created after the test isn't necessary. What you might want to do, though, is <code>close()</code> the <code>FileSystem</code> after each test. That removes it from the map of open file systems immediately, allowing it to be garbage collected. (This isn't strictly necessary since the file system is stored in a weak reference there, but I think it's preferable anyway.)</p>
