<p>If you are going to be gathering a lot of data from the database into a series of labels like this, I suspect that your DBAs could question the repeated hammering on the database (i.e. opening a connection and performing the select statement for each label each time the page is rendered), especially if this is a high-traffic site.</p>

<p>In cases like this, we usually fetch all of the necessary data from the database in one fell swoop and dynamically generate the required HTML in code-behind. This might take a little more work up front, but it should be much faster and have a lot less impact on the database.</p>

<p>If you want to stick with the current design, we would need to see how the PK for the column is defined in the client side, but it could be as easy as just adding a parameter to your ppCustSurvey method.</p>
