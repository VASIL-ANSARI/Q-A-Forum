<p>The spec is expecting that the performance monitor doesn't return the total of the times, but average. Your current version of the code is returning neither the total, nor the average, but the <strong>count</strong> of the times the <code>yield</code> statement was called. </p>

<p>Your current version of the solution is failing with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>1) Performance Monitor returns the average time, not the total time, when running multiple times
   Failure/Error: average_time.should == 6.5
     expected: 6.5
          got: 4 (using ==)
   # ./06_performance_monitor/performance_monitor_spec.rb:64
</code></pre>

<p>So you are returning the <strong>count</strong> and not the <strong>average</strong> of <code>[8,6,5,7]</code>.</p>

<p>If the spec fails with the following error, it is returning the sum <code>( 26.0 = 8 + 6+ 5 + 7 )</code>:</p>

<pre><code>1) Performance Monitor returns the average time, not the total time, when running multiple times
   Failure/Error: average_time.should == 6.5
     expected: 6.5
          got: 26.0 (using ==)
   # ./06_performance_monitor/performance_monitor_spec.rb:64
</code></pre>

<p>Couple of pointers to help you move forward:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Look at your assumption that the count should default to 0 (as defined by <code>x=0</code> param being passed to <code>measure</code>. If the program calls <code>measure</code> without any parameters, wouldn't it make sense to say it has been called once rather than zero times? </p></li>
<li><p>Try to understand why your program is returning <code>4</code> by walking through the code for <code>measure</code> on each value of [8,6,5,7], and by modifying/adding new test cases in <code>performance_monitor_spec.rb</code> file. <strong>Hint:</strong> The code isn't doing any performance monitoring in this path ;-) </p></li>
</ol>
