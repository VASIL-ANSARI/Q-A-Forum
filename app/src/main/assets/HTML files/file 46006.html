<p>If you are passing a <code>List&lt;Something&gt;</code> around in your code, then it is "mutable" by default, and there is no way to signal this explicitly.</p>

<p>If this is a language background issue (Haskell?), then in C# you should looks things from a different perspective: if you wanted to pass around an immutable collection, you would need to use some different type (maybe an <code>IEnumerable&lt;Something&gt;</code>, even if it's not the same as a list); if you're passing around a List, instead, it can be modified by every method that receives it.</p>
