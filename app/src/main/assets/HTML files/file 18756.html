<p>I found my issue.  When I was attempting to evict my object, I was evicting the wrong object.  I was evicting the object I was merging (entity), instead of the object that NHibernate returned in the Merge (persisted).</p>

<p>Evicting the persisted object returned from the merge (as shown below) solved the problem.</p>

<pre><code>    public int? Save(DocumentNote entity, bool autoFlush)
    {
        var persisted = (DocumentNote)CurrentSession.Merge(entity);
        entity.DocDataNoteID = persisted.DocDataNoteID;
        if (autoFlush)
        {
            CurrentSession.Flush();
            CurrentSession.Evict(persisted);
        }

        return entity.DocDataNoteID;
    }
</code></pre>
