<p>I would really stay away from loading 3x images for lower-resolution devices. Those phones already have limited memory and loading such large images will use up a lot of memory. You should use tools to resize the images for you in all the different densities. Try using this <a href="https://github.com/redwarp/9-Patch-Resizer" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/redwarp/9-Patch-Resizer</a></p>

<p>If you really want to keep one version of the image, put it in the drawable folder (not drawable-xxhdpi). (not recommended because you'll end up with poor looking images on some devices)</p>
