<p>This will work:</p>

<pre><code>myCounter = Counter()
largedict = { myKey:
                    {counterKey: myCounter
                     anotherKey: Value2}
             }

largedict[myKey][counterKey]['somethingyouwanttocount']+=1
</code></pre>

<p><code>Counter</code> is just a dict with some extra functionality. However, as a dict, it cannot be a key in a dict, nor an entry in a set, which explains the unhashable exception.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you're keeping track of information about coherent entities, rather than using nested <code>dicts</code>, you could store the information (including the counter) in objects, and put the objects in a <code>dict</code> as necessary. </p>

<p>If <em>every</em> value is a counter, then just use defaultdict:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict, Counter
largedict = defaultdict(Counter)
largedict['apple']['purple']+=1
</code></pre>
