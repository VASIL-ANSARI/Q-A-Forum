  <p>I am using broadcast receiver with AlarmManager, but sometimes it takes lot of seconds to wake up, which causes issue in app functionality</p>

<p>I am not aware that any other sort of component will somehow start up faster than a <code>BroadcastReceiver</code>. Certainly I would expect an activity to start up more slowly than does a <code>BroadcastReceiver</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>WakeLock</code> is doing you no good, as there already is a <code>WakeLock</code> in place for the duration of your <code>onReceive()</code> call (assuming that this is a manifest-registered <code>BroadcastReceiver</code>).</p>

<p>The only way this <code>WakeLock</code> will be useful is if you release it from <code>onCreate()</code> of the activity, to try to keep the device awake long enough for the activity to start up.</p>

  <p>Can you tell what is the best approach?</p>

<p>That depends on what the "calculations" are. <code>onReceive()</code> is called on the main application thread. Like all methods called on the main application thread, you want <code>onReceive()</code> to return in a couple of milliseconds. If your "calculations" will definitely take only a couple of milliseconds, stick with the <code>BroadcastReceiver</code>. If the "calculations" will take longer than that, you will want to consider delegating that work to an <code>IntentService</code>, and have the <code>IntentService</code> start the activity if needed.</p>

<p>With respect to the "lot of seconds", bear in mind that your <code>AlarmManager</code> events may be inexact, depending on what method you use to set them up, what your <code>targetSdkVersion</code> is, and what version of Android you are running on.</p>
