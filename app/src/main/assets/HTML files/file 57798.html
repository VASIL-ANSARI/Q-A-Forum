<p>This looks like a case of premature optimization.  You should probably worry more about correctness and flexibility than performance.</p>

<p>30 million rows per year, especially in these skinny tables, is a small amount of data for any Oracle system.  Don't worry too much about indexes and partitioning yet, those can be added later if necessary.</p>

<p>Your solution is similar to the Entity Attribute Value (EAV) model.  It's worth knowing that term since much has been written about it.  There are 2 common problems with EAV models you want to avoid:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Avoid extremes.</strong>  Don't use EAV for <em>everything</em>, but don't completely avoid it either.  EAV is slow and inconvenient compared to a normal table structure.  It should not be used for every interesting columns, otherwise you have created a database within a database.  For example, if virtually every survey has fields like a username and a date created, store those as regular columns and not in a generic column.  It's OK to have a column that is only populated 99% of the time.  On the other hand, it's a bad idea to always avoid the EAV and try to hack something together with 1,000 column tables or object-relational types.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Always use the correct type.</strong>  Always, always, always store data as the correct type.  Store numbers as numbers, dates as dates, and strings as strings.  Your queries will be easier, faster, and safer, if you have at least three columns for the data: ANSWER_NUMBER, ANSWER_STRING, ANSWER_DATE.  I explain the type safety problem more in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31769013/409172">this answer</a>.  Those extra columns may look bad in the model diagram, but they are a life-saver when you're querying the data.</p></li>
</ol>
