<p>If you want good performance, use a persistent server technology, not CGI. CGI is notoriously slow in any language. You need to persist your code on a server to completely eliminate startup time.</p>

<p>I'd check out <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http://www.sinatrarb.com/&amp;ei=MNTrTuuKK6nq0gHM7-jVCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFFKzlCnMagiB-8gN7Iz9xgm7mRg&amp;sig2=td5d-JuSKiu_2SHaGp3RVg" rel="nofollow">Sinatra</a>, which is every bit as easy to develop for as CGI. Setup can be easy too. There are many server solutions you can use, such as passenger (which is loaded into apache, for example, as mod_passenger, much like mod_cgi). There's even a standalone server built into the Sinatra framework -- super easy.</p>
