<p>Check this for deails: <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#finishAffinity%28%29" rel="nofollow">API Description</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finish this activity as well as all activities immediately below it in
  the current task that have the same affinity. This is typically used
  when an application can be launched on to another task (such as from
  an ACTION_VIEW of a content type it understands) and the user has used
  the up navigation to switch out of the current task and in to its own
  task. In this case, if the user has navigated down into any other
  activities of the second application, all of those should be removed
  from the original task as part of the task switch.</p>
  
  <p>Note that this finish does not allow you to deliver results to the previous activity, and an exception will be thrown if you are trying
  to do so.</p>
