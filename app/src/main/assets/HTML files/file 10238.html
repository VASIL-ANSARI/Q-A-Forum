<p>Did you try aliasing the column? eg.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT to_char(ProblemDate, 'yyyymmdd') as ProblemDate, data1, data2 ...
</code></pre>

<p>As a side note, you might run into issues with your date comparisons in your <code>WHERE</code> clause. Granted I don't know anything about your application, client and/or server regional settings and maybe your example was just for illustration purposes, but I'm thinking it would be safer to use <code>TO_DATE</code> than string comparisons:</p>

<pre><code>cmd.CommandText =
    "SELECT to_char(ProblemDate, 'yyyymmdd') as ProblemDate, data1, data2,"
    +"data4, data5, data6"
    +" WHERE ( ProblemDate &gt;= TO_DATE('03-oct-2011', 'DD-MON-YYYY') ) "
    +"AND ( ProblemDate &lt;= TO_DATE('08-oct-2011', 'DD-MON-YYYY') ) AND " 
    +"( data1 in ( '3','5','6' ) )";
</code></pre>
