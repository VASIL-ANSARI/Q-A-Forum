<p>Without knowing more details, I'm not sure of the reason behind the behaviour you're describing. However, I'll try and give an idea of how to setup these kinds of transition. Since you're working in a storyboard, it's pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>In your storyboard, you'll start off with a view controller embedded in a navigation controller, and a second view controller that you want to transition to. Control-drag from your first VC's button to the second VC scene, and choose a "Show" action segue which will cause a navigation push transition - I think this is the way you have your storyboard configured.</p>

<p>You can change your back button title directly in the storyboard. Choose the first VC scene and select its navigation item object from the document outline on the left. In the attributes inspector on the right, just change the "Back Button" field to whatever you want the button to say when you push to the second VC. This will keep the back arrow icon users expect.</p>

<p>If you want to use a push transition but show a normal-looking button without the arrow, you can hide the back button in your second VC's <code>viewDidLoad()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>navigationItem.hidesBackButton = true
</code></pre>

<p>Then, back in your storyboard, drag out a bar button item to the left side of the navigation bar of your second VC, and give it a custom title etc.</p>

<p>However, what you really want for this setup is a modal transition, and doing this is as simple as changing your segue type to "Present Modally" in the storyboard. This will present the second VC <em>above</em> the navigation stack, so a navigation bar will not be shown by default. Rather than dragging a standalone navigation bar out from the objects panel (which will give you some headaches trying to get it to extend under the status bar), embed your second VC in its own navigation controller which will implicitly add a navigation bar. Then, you can drag out a bar button item to the left side of the bar and hook it up via an unwind segue, or use an <code>IBAction</code> method and call <code>presentingViewController?.dismissViewControllerAnimated(_:completion:)</code>.</p>
