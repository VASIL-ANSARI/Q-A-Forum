<p>The error message you are seeing is often due to a user permissions problem (you need to run SQL Server Surface Area Configuration tool with admin permissions: choose 'Run As Administrator' when launching the tool).</p>

<p>Have you enabled TCP/NamedPipes from SQL Server Configuration Manager?</p>
