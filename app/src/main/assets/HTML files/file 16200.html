<p>Well it is discouraged by apple , according to it's documentation:-</p>

<p>There is no API provided for gracefully terminating an iOS application.</p>

<p>In iOS,user presses the Home button to close applications. Should your application have conditions in which it cannot provide its intended function, the recommended approach is to display an alert for the user that indicates the nature of the problem and possible actions the user could take â turning on WiFi, enabling Location Services, etc. Allow the user to terminate the application at their own discretion.</p>

<p>Warning Do not call the exit function. Applications calling exit will appear to the user to have crashed, rather than performing a graceful termination and animating back to the Home screen.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa2008/qa1561.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> to it.Anyway nobody stops you from using 
<code>exit(0)</code> ,  but is discouraged.</p>

<p>Another way to do is is simply change your application's pList property <code>"Application does not run in background"</code> to true.</p>
