<p>If you need to deal with customising the download process by supporting authentication, then you <em>need</em> to stop using <code>dictionaryWithContentsOfURL:</code> and start using <code>NSConnection</code> because <code>NSConnection</code> <em>is</em> the API for customising URL downloads. Particularly, look at the delegate method <code>connection:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:</code> which is where you hook in to the authentication procedure.</p>

<p>You don't need to use an XML parser, because you have no need to parse the downloaded contents. Hand the data off to <code>NSPropertyListSerialization</code> once you've downloaded them and that can return an <code>NSDictionary</code> instance to you.</p>
