<p>I recommend always creating fragments when needed (as done in google developers samples) for one important reason which is to prevent potential <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>s. Keeping hard references to a Fragment/Activity  outside its lifecycle makes it illegible for garbage collection and pave way for the infamous OOMs.</p>

<p>For your scenario I would recommend you to try some sort of EventBus (pub / sub mechanism) to communicate from your activity to fragment.</p>
