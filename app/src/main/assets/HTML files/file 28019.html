<blockquote>
  <p>what exactly happens when we assign derived class object to base abstract class object  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no <em>object</em> assignment in you code, there's <em>variable</em> assignment.
After assignment, variable <code>bobject</code> refers to the same object, as <code>d2</code> does. Object type (and anything in the object state) remains unchanged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now I want to access the Dervied2 class method Method1 which accept string argument  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can't do this in your sample without casting <code>bobject</code> to <code>Derived2</code>:</p>

<p><code>((Derived2)bobject).Method1(str)</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to keep things generic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, you shouldn't try to access members, which are not the part of base class.</p>
