<p>It seems that this issue was caused by connect, a dependency of express. I had originally created my app using express running on node 0.8.8, and CF was using 0.8.2. Even though I it didn't seem to make a difference locally, when I deployed to Cloud Foundry I was getting this error.</p>

<p>I created an entirely new app, running Node 0.8.2 from the beginning. This seemed to fix the issue.</p>
