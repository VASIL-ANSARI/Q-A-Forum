<p>You can supply a command to the interpreter through the command line:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -c 'a = 3; b = 5; print a &gt; b'
False
</code></pre>

<p>Is that adequate for your needs?</p>

<p>If you're concerned about opening the interpreter repeatedly, you could generate and evaluate many expressions at once. I'm not sure what the upper limit is, but I was able to evaluate and print 200 concatenated copies of <code>a = 3; b = 5; print a &gt; b;</code> without any problem. </p>
