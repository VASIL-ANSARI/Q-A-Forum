<p>First of all, you need to create Core Data models and relationships. My suggestion is to divide them for 3 objects: Station, Name and Class. Relationships could be: Station->>Name, Station->Class, where "->>" To-Many and "->" To-One relationships respectively. Don't forget to create reverse relationships. After that create mapping rule and relationship in RestKit. Relationship is created with RKRelationshipMapping object.</p>
