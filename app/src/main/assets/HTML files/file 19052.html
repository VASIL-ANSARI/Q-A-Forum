<p>It seems like a lot of overhead to create a server/client app just for a web app to communicate with a local java program (and even more so to duplicate this process to do more than one thing at a time).  If you are looking for concurrent processing in the background of a web app, you can always just create a thread (or multiple threads) to do the work.  Or is there a reason why the simple java app can't be embedded in the web app?</p>
