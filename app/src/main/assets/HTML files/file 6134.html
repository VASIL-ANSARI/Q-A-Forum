<p>You can see which Network Interfaces are available using <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/NetworkInterface.html#getNetworkInterfaces%28%29" rel="nofollow"><code>java.net.NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces()</code></a>.  Note: The loopback interface is always present in this list.</p>

<p>However, it appears that the only way to force the system to use particular network interfaces is by referring to the IP address a particular network interface is on.  For example, the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#Socket%28java.net.InetAddress,%20int,%20java.net.InetAddress,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">4-arg <code>Socket</code> constructor</a>s take the local address as the third argument (I only linked to one, the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#Socket%28java.lang.String,%20int,%20java.net.InetAddress,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">other</a> takes the hostname as the first argument).</p>

<p><code>DatagramSocket</code> has a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/DatagramSocket.html#DatagramSocket%28int,%20java.net.InetAddress%29" rel="nofollow">2-arg constructor</a> that does something similar.</p>
