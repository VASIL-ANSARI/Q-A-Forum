<p><strong>Note:</strong>  I'm the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/moxy.php" rel="nofollow"><strong>EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy)</strong></a> lead and a member of the <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=222" rel="nofollow"><strong>JAXB (JSR-222)</strong></a> expert group.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Based on the results of an offline conversation the solution to the issue was to use the following EclipseLink bundle:</p>

<ul>
<li>org.eclipse.persistence.asm</li>
</ul>

<p>In combination with the EclipseLink bundles that were already being used:</p>

<ul>
<li>org.eclipse.persistence.core</li>
<li>org.eclipse.persistence.moxy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reason</strong></p>

<p>MOXy byte code generates some objects (leveraging ASM) when creating mappings for <code>Map</code> objects.  Without these generated classes MOXy's metadata generation was failing.</p>
