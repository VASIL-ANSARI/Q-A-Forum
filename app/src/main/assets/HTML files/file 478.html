<p>So I googled <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=greasemonkey%20dom%20ready">greasemonkey dom ready</a> and the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/beat-website-greasemonkey/">first result</a> seemed to say that the greasemonkey script is actually running at "DOM ready" so you just need to remove the onload call and run the script straight away.</p>

<p>I removed the  <em><code>window.addEventListener ("load", function() {</code></em> and <em><code>}, false);</code></em> wrapping and it worked perfectly. It's <strong>much</strong> more responsive this way, the page appears straight away with your script applied to it and all the unseen questions highlighted, no flicker at all. And there was much rejoicing.... yea.</p>
