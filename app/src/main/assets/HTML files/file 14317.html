<p>When using $("#id") jquery will still need to loop through the elements to find the correct one, so adding to the DOM will make it slower but this will only be slow when the DOM is massive.</p>

<p>It depends how much you are thinking of adding to the DOM. A couple hundred lines isn't going to matter too much on the newer browsers, might have some problems with IE8 and lower.</p>

<p>I suggest doing a test on the oldest browser you are going to support, if it works ok on that then it should be fine on the other ones.</p>
