<p>Think you could do something like that (I'm not like Michael B., I must admit I have no idea about US zip codes, so just taking that from your query).</p>

<pre><code>select a.zip,
case when z.zip is not null then 'SD'
     when a.zip between 9001 and 96162 then 'CA'
     else 'US'
     end as location
FROM apinfo a
left join zipcode z on z.zip = a.zip
</code></pre>
