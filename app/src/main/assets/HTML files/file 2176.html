<p>Run your VB6 application inside a profiler like <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/index.html" rel="nofollow" title="DotTrace">JetBrains DotTrace</a> or <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_performance_profiler/index.htm" rel="nofollow" title="ANTS Profiler">ANTS Profiler</a>. Although the application is VB6, at least DotTrace should be able to see the managed .NET library calls.</p>
