<p>Given that you are discussing the <code>tms_utime</code> and <code>tms_stime</code> members of <code>struct tms</code> (which contains 4 elements of type <code>clock_t</code>) used by <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/times.html" rel="nofollow"><code>times()</code></a>, the difference is as outlined in my first and last comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>tms_utime</code> element is the amount of time spent executing your code, or the code in the C library.  The <code>tms_stime</code> element is the amount of time spent in the kernel executing code on your behalf.  (The <code>tms_cutime</code> and <code>tms_cstime</code> are the sums of the <code>tms_utime</code> and <code>tms_stime</code> respectively for all the child processes that have exited â see the rationale commentary.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no breakdown of the time into 'time spent waiting for the cache' vs 'time spent not waiting for the cache'.  I think the cache time would be included in the <code>tms_stime</code> value because when the data isn't in the cache, you will need the system to fetch it for you.</p>
