<p>It's counting every answer as correct because the condition of your <code>if</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>if (ans = correct)
</code></pre>

<p>is an assignment, which technically evaluates to <code>true</code> (because it's non-zero).</p>

<p>Change to:</p>

<pre><code>if (ans == correct)
</code></pre>

<p>to evaluate for equality.</p>
