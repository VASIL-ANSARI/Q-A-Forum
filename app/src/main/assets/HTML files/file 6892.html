<p>There is no API nor class available from Android SDK where you can register a listener, and wait for network status changes.</p>

<p>Basically you will need to figure out a solution that fits your project requirements.</p>

<p>I found this solution (from another response) very useful <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1783117/network-listener-android">Network listener Android</a>, basically you create an register a BoradcastReceiver that will be waiting for connectivity changes (via intent-filter).</p>
