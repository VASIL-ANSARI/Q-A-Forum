<p>Today, I faced the same problem. After some debugging I found out that pyqtdeploy looks for the correct <code>bootstrap-&lt;version&gt;.py</code> script it wants to use, by looking at the version in the filename of the Python library (<code>python3.dll</code> in our case).</p>

<p>The solution is to use <code>&lt;windows-dir&gt;\system32\python34.dll</code> or <code>&lt;python-install-dir&gt;\python34.dll</code> as the Python library. The former will be present when you install Python for all users, the latter will be present when you install Python "just for me" (see this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/X98I6A2.png" rel="nofollow">screenshot</a>).</p>

<p><s>After renaming <code>python3.dll</code> to <code>python34.dll</code>, everything worked again.</s></p>
