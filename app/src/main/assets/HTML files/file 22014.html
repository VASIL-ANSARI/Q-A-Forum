<p>Is it what you are looking for ?</p>

<p>You can open the desired url in the same window  by using <code>Window.Open</code> and setting target as <code>_self</code></p>

<pre><code>com.google.gwt.user.client.Window.open(url, "_self",
           "param1=value," + 
           "param2=value");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope the above code will give you a hint .</p>

<p>And have a look on GWT <a href="http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/view/net/customware/gwt/presenter/gwt-presenter/1.1.1/gwt-presenter-1.1.1-javadoc.jar!/net/customware/gwt/presenter/client/place/PlaceManager.html" rel="nofollow">PlaceManager</a> also</p>
