<p>Adapted from <a href="http://www.cryer.co.uk/brian/sql/sql_delete_duplicates.htm">this article</a>. These two solutions are generic, and should work on any reasonable SQL implementation.</p>

<h1>Remove duplicates in-place:</h1>

<pre><code>DELETE T1
FROM foo T1, foo T2
WHERE (T1.city = T2.city AND foo1.zip=foo2.zip) -- Duplicate rows
   AND T1.id &gt; T2.id;                           -- Delete the one with higher id
</code></pre>

<p>Simple, and should work fine for small tables or tables with little duplicates.</p>

<h1>Copy distinct records to another table:</h1>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE foo_temp LIKE(foo);
INSERT INTO foo_temp (SELECT distinct city, zip) FORM foo;
TRUNCATE TABLE foo;
</code></pre>

<p>If you're lucky enough to have a sequence as your id, simply:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO foo SELECT * FROM foo_temp;
DROP TABLE foo_temp;
</code></pre>

<p>A bit more complicated, but extremely efficient for very large tables with lots of duplicates. For these, creating an index for (city, zip) would incredibly improve the query performance.</p>
