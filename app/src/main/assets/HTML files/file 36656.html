<p>If Chrome is your browser, then I believe there's functionality to get screenshots/snapshots of your favorite websites built into its extensions business (which is really just lots of javascript and stuffs).    Might want to look into creating an extension for Chrome that becomes your default/new-tab business (there are already a bunch out there in the Chrome Store).</p>
