<p>This should work fine, in fact you do not need to name the testscript testScript.c at all. Just keep it as testScript.sh and run:</p>

<pre><code>cpp testScript.sh
</code></pre>

<p>to run the c preprocessor on it.</p>

<p>This should be more portable than running gcc directly  as there are other c preprocessors available other than gcc.</p>
