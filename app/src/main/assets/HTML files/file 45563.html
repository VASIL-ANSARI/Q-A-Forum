<p>Finally solved this problem. The problem was not in the frontend but in the backend. People were posting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon#unicode" rel="nofollow">unicode emoticons</a> . The backend was built with an MySQL utf8_general_ci collation table/column. This collation does not support the unicode characters and will break the text before the unicode character. So the resulting insert will have all text missing after the unicode character.</p>
