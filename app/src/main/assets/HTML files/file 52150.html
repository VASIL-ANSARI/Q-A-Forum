<p>I have messed around with your code to get a basic movement around a point. </p>

<p>I changed the foci var to an object which is just two points :</p>

<pre><code> foci = {
    x: 300,
    y: 100
  };
</code></pre>

<p>Ive added to the data you have to give each node a start point : </p>

<pre><code>nodes.push({
  id: 0,
  x:20,
  y:30
});
nodes.push({
  id: 0,
  x:40,
  y:60
});
nodes.push({
  id: 0,
  x:80,
  y:10
});
</code></pre>

<p>I have added an angle to each node so you can use these independently later:</p>

<pre><code> .attr("cx", function(d) {
            d.angle = 0; //added
      return d.x;
    })
</code></pre>

<p>And changed the tick so each node moves around the focal point. As said before I added an angle as these points will move around different circles with different sized radius as they will be different distances from the foci point. If you use one angle then all the nodes will move ontop of each other which is pointless :</p>

<p>Formula for point on a circle : </p>

<pre><code>//c = centre point, r = radius, a = angle
x = cx + r * cos(a)
y = cy + r * sin(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Use this in tick :</p>

<pre><code>var radius = 100; //made up radius

  node
    .attr("cx", function(d) {
       if(d.angle&gt;(2*Math.PI)){ restart at full circle
         d.angle=0;
       }
    d.x = foci.x + radius *Math.cos(d.angle) //move x

      return d.x;
    })
    .attr("cy", function(d) {
    d.y = foci.y + radius *Math.sin(d.angle) //move y
      return d.y;
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Updated fiddle : <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/reko91/yg0rs4xc/7/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/reko91/yg0rs4xc/7/</a></p>

<p>This should be simple to implement to change from circle movement to elliptical :))</p>

<p>Looking at this again, this only moves around half way. This is due to the tick function only lasting a couple of seconds. If you click one of the nodes, it will continue around the circle. If you want this to happen continuously, you'll have to set up a timer function so it runs around the circle non stop, but that should be easily implemented.</p>

<p>Instead of tick function just make another function with the timer inside, call it on load and it will run continuously :)</p>
