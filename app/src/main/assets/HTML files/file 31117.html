<p>At the very least, put all your commands in a <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.8/" rel="nofollow">fabric</a> script, it will make things easier in the long run.</p>

<p>You have a asked a very broad question with lots of opportunity for subjective answers, for which I had to vote to close it.  There are lots of good parts to your question which is why I try to provide some answer.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is no preferred way.  Do you want to install git as a dependency on your production/staging/web machines? If you want to, deploying with git is perfectly acceptable, if not it is just as easy to use built in <code>rsync</code> utility and interact with it using fabric.  There are lots of scripts online showing how to set up fabric using either way.  There are probably a number of other ways too but rsync or git pull seems to be the most popular ways to deploy.</p></li>
<li><p>Fabric lets you define <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.8/api/core/decorators.html#fabric.decorators.roles" rel="nofollow">roles</a>, and makes it easy to deploy to multiple servers at one time.</p></li>
<li><p>Special cases require special functions.  You can define these in your fab file. You could create the logic to deploy to your general web servers in a function then have a seperate function to build and deploy your fragmented server.</p></li>
<li><p>Amazon provides a couple of autoscaling tools, I have never used any but I am sure that lots of people have, and lots of people have blogged about their experiences.</p></li>
