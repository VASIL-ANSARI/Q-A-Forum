<p>From what I can see, you are passing an empty list into the <code>TableListAdapter</code> in <code>TimeTableList</code> (activity).
As the list size is <code>0</code> during the creation of the Adapter, there are not going to be any cardViews created for the RecyclerView.</p>

<p>Either you should <strong>add some data points into the list before creating the instance</strong> of the <code>TableListAdapter</code> </p>

<p><strong>OR</strong> </p>

<p>Have a <strong>public void updateRecyclerAdapter(List itemList)</strong> in <code>TableListAdapter</code> that you can call post creating the instance of the adapter.
The method can possibly look something like below code</p>

<pre><code>public void updateAdapaterList(List&lt;TimeTable&gt; newTimeTableList) {   
    //Replace the current list with new list
    this.List = newTimeTableList;
    //notify the adapter that the data set has changed
    notifyDataSetChanged();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>ALSO</strong></p>

<p>make sure you override the <code>getItemCount()</code> method in the RecyclerAdapter as below.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public int getItemCount() {
    return List.size();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also I would highly recommend using proper <em>camelCasing</em> while coding. :)</p>
