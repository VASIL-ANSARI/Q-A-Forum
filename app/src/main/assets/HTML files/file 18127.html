<p>The problem is that <code>T</code> has to be replaced with a type since you are declaring a variable. <code>T</code> must be the type of the <code>value</code> in the dictionary or, in your specific case, the type of the event arguments. Since you specifically say you are wanting to store events, <code>T</code> should probably be the good old <code>EventArgs</code>. Your code should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;Events,EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;&gt; EventsDic = new Dictionary&lt;Events,EventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt;&gt;()
{
     { Events.Insert , this.ItemInserted}
};
</code></pre>
