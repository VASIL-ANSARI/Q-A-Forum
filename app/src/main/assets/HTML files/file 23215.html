<p>This is because the order of execution. The initial <code>throw</code> for all intents and purposes is the defacto <code>return</code> statement for the method (Read: exit point) but because it is inside a <code>try</code> block with a <code>finally</code> block the code inside the <code>finally</code> block is <em>guaranteed</em> to be run before the method returns (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/516049/in-java-is-the-finally-block-guaranteed-to-be-called-in-the-main-method/516060#516060">with a few exceptions</a>). So before the methods <code>return</code>/<code>throw</code> another, different exception is thrown which is a newer, sooner method return.</p>

<p>The way to handle this situation it to never get in it. You should be aware that this is how Java behaves and avoid programming yourself in this corner.</p>
