<p>Ok so I resolved this situation in an odd way, and I'm very much so open to someone explaining why this resolved it but this is what I used to have :</p>

<pre><code>CardSignup.find_by_email(email).emails &lt;&lt; orig_email
</code></pre>

<p>This is what caused the error. And this is what fixed it:</p>

<pre><code>CardSignup.find_by_email(email).emails &lt;&lt; Email.find(orig_email.id)
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason Delayed_Jobs can not do a query on a raw object? </p>
