<p>After a quick read over my gut reaction is that your ChangeImage() method is being called on each pass over the grid, causing a "random" cell to be "mole'd".</p>

<p>As for the click not working, I don't have VS to hand so can't be 100% on this but when you pass molePopup to grid_Mail.Children.Add it could be being passed as a value parameter meaning that your MouseUp handler is not actually there when the object is "copied" over to the grid.</p>
