<p>Not sure if this is something that you want, but if you want only those departments that do not have any projects use</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DEPARTMENT.D#,DEPARTMENT.DNAME,DEPARTMENT.MANAGER#
   FROM DEPARTMENT
      WHERE DEPARTMENT.D# not in (select PROJECT.D# from project);
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it Helps</p>
