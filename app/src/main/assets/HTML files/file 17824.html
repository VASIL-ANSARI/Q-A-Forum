<p>Shouldn't you be using something like this:</p>

<pre><code>runJava = String.Format(@"/K java ""{0}""", projectName);
</code></pre>

<p>Because it seems that it fails with the space in your username.
If you have accounts with the same name on both computers you also have two C:\Users\... directories.</p>
