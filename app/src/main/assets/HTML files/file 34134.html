<p>The regex engine returns the first and leftmost match it find as a result.</p>

<p>Basically it tries to match the pattern starting from the first character. If it doesn't find a corresponding match, the transmission jumps in and it tries again from the second character, and so on.</p>

<p>If you use <code>a+?b</code> on <code>bab</code> it will first try from the first <code>b</code>. That doesn't work, so we try from the second character.</p>

<p>But here it finds a match right from the first character. Starting from the second isn't even considered, we found a match so we return.</p>

<p>If you apply <code>a+?b</code> on <code>aab</code>, we try at the first <code>a</code> and find an overall match: end of story, no reason to try anything else.</p>

<p><strong>To sum up</strong>: the regex engine goes from the left to the right, so laziness can only affect the right side length.</p>
