<p>A composite ID is a primary jey with multiple parts for example. Lets say we have a table:</p>

<pre><code>|ID|StudentID|Name|Class|
-------------------------
|1 |10023    |Jon |FR   |
|1 |10024    |Bob |FR   |
|2 |10023    |Jon |SO   |
|3 |12234    |Joe |FR   |
</code></pre>

<p>In this case lets say you want to select Jon only, but for some reson JOn and Bob have an ID of 1 and that isn't uniquely identifying Jon alone. There for we have to create a composite key. So instead of a primary key being Just ID we need to use the composite primary key which would be the (ID,StudentID) Because if we just used the Student ID you see we would get two Jons but if we use the composite key of (ID,StudentID) we would get a unique identifier there is only one row with ID 1 and Student ID 10023 together. Hope this helps. So in the end you may have a two or more coluns with repeating values but those columns together may not have a uniqe value together. Hope this helps. Sorry if the table looks a little wonky.</p>
