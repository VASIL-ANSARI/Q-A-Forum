<p>there is no real solution other than setting php's max_execution_time higher in php.ini but:</p>

<p>mysql natively supports sha1, so maybe you can just do something like</p>

<pre><code>update register set password = sha1(concat(password, 'Q*iV%qKz$&amp;!C'))
</code></pre>

<p>this should be a lot quicker than your php solution. </p>

<p>still the performance of your query looks very low unless you are on an ancient box. maybe you have no index defined for the password field?</p>
