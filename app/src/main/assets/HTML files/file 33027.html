<p>There is a syntax error here:</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['cart'][$row_s'id_product']]
</code></pre>

<p>I think it's supposed to be:</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['cart'][$row_s['id_product']]
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You will easily catch these errors if you turn on error reporting. There is no reason to not have it turned on in development.</p>
