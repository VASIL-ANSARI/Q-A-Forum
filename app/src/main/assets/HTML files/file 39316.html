<p>We've been working in this and we didn't find any solution, so instead we are using a zip file renamed to .obb instead of a normal obb created with <code>jobb</code>. That solution works in every device we've tested so far, even in the Galaxy Tab with Android 4.1.2</p>

<p>Hopes this works on your app also.</p>
