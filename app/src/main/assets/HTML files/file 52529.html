<p>One solution would be to implement pixel detection with a secondary canvas to be used as a map. </p>

<ol>
<li>Draw your shape onto your scene canvas.</li>
<li>Draw the exact shape onto a second canvas, but set the color to rgb(0,0,0).</li>
<li>Store that color as a reference in some sort of map to reference your first 'shape'</li>
</ol>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>var pixelMap = {
  '000' : 'rectangle 1',
  '001' : 'rectangle 2'
};
</code></pre>

<p>Every time you draw a new shape to the canvas, increase the rgb by 1. Unless you have over 16.7 million shapes (256^3), this method should suffice. </p>
