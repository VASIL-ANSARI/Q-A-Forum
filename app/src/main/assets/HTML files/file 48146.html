<p>Order is important in your route config. The key to routing in MVC is to start with the most specific routes and work up. Also as you have specific routing rules for the Emails controller, you can give the name of the controller specifically in the URL parameter. So here you would do this:</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(
    name: "Emails",
    url: "{id}/Emails/{action}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Emails", action = "Index" },
    constraints: new { id = @"\d+" }
);

routes.MapRoute(
    name: "Default",
    url: "{controller}/{action}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Account", action = "Index" }
);
</code></pre>
