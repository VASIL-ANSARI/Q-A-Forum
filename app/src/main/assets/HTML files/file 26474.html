<p>I created this <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/metrics-store" rel="nofollow">nodejs application</a> with the <a href="http://opencover-metrics.herokuapp.com/charts/sample_chart.htm" rel="nofollow">google charts output</a> (but it may be overkill for your needs)</p>

<p>In the end just extract the number(s) from the summary entry at the top of the opencover (or reportgenerator) output and store that data somewhere useful then create your own graph. </p>

<p>As for your second issue the OpenCover documentation (a PDF/RTF that should have been installed alongside OpenCover, nuget and msi) details a switch that should do what you want.</p>
