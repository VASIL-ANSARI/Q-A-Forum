<p>I hope someone can confirm this for me as I cant seem to find any forum questions or documentation that support this, but it seems that the MessageQueue has an issue with my Event setup.</p>

<p><strong>I removed the event call and simply hardcoded the queue creation and send in its place within my main process and everything worked fine.</strong></p>

<p>My setup is like so:</p>

<p>A Service - Creates a Processor, a Synchronizer, and sets the events.</p>

<p>Processor starts a <strong>thread</strong> in which it processes string transactions, on a successful process the transaction needs to be sent via the Synchronizer, so the Processor triggers event.</p>

<p>Synchronizer has already created the queues and is simply waiting for events to be triggered to send messages.</p>

<p>If anyone could shed some light on if this could be a cross thread issue or just a quirk in my system it would be appreciated.</p>

<p>*<strong>*After a little more research and some trial and error, it seems I get the error due to a cross thread complication with the event. My guess is that it's a similar issue to UI objects being updated from a different thread than the one it was created on. The error is essentially an ownership issue. The messages still go though but the queue complains that its original owner isn't the one that initiated the call.</strong></p>
