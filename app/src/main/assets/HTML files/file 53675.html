<p>I wouldn't. I'd keep my list as a list of <code>Customer</code> and I would extend my <code>Customer</code> class to support access to a <code>Dictionary</code> of additional properties, accessible through an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/287928/how-do-i-overload-the-square-bracket-operator-in-c">explicit indexer</a>.</p>

<pre><code>private Dictionary&lt;string,Something&gt;;
public Something this[string i]
{
    get { return InnerDictionary[i]; }
    set { InnerDictionary[i] = value; }
}
</code></pre>
