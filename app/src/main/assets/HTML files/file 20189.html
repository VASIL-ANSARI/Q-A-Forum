<p>Your if statement conditions are completely wrong; no part of this does what you think it does: <code>if (Circle = 'Y' or 'y')</code>.</p>

<p>You're looking for <code>if (Circle == 'Y' || Circle == 'y')</code>. What you've written is wrong for a couple reasons; it's using the assignment operator (<code>=</code> instead of <code>==</code>), and the other half of the binary <code>or</code> is always true.</p>

<p>What you've written is essentially this:</p>

<pre><code>if ('Y') {
  if ('y') {

  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And 'Y', the character, casts to boolean <code>true</code>, just like the character 'N', so both <code>if</code> statement's conditions evaluate as true.</p>
