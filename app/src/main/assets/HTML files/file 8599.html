<p>On the OWASP Top 10 and Play (some info <a href="http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2.1/security">here</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A1: Injection</p>

<p>Uses JPA and escapes strings by default</p></li>
<li><p>A2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</p>

<p>Since version 1.0.1, Playâs template engine automatically escapes string</p></li>
<li><p>A3: Broken Authentication and Session Management</p>

<p>Play is stateless, no session involved. Cookies are protected with cryptography. Storing data safely on the database (passwords) via hashing depends on the user, not the framework</p></li>
<li><p>A4: Insecure Direct Object References</p>

<p>Again this depends on developer verifying access to allowed resources, not so much the framework</p></li>
<li><p>A5: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</p>

<p>POST requests allow for authenticity tokens to prevent this. Of course this depends on developer using GET/POST properly</p></li>
<li><p>A6: Security Misconfiguration</p>

<p>The default error reporting process seems safe on production (no stack trace leaks). The only concern would be the "catch all" entry in routes, but this should be commented out in production mode</p></li>
<li><p>A7: Insecure Cryptographic Storage</p>

<p>Developer is responsible to encrypt sensible information in the database</p></li>
<li><p>A8: Failure to Restrict URL Access</p>

<p>Developer must implement a security restriction (via @Before, like in the tutorial) to disallow access to forbidden pages.</p></li>
<li><p>A9: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection</p>

<p>Play supports SSL</p></li>
<li><p>A10: Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</p>

<p>Play redirect is via 302, not hardcoded strings, which should prevent this.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>TL;DR: In the parts that the framework can do all the work, Play does it. In the parts that developer needs to do all the work, well, developer needs to do all the work. Parts that need 50% of each, Play gives its 50%.</p>

<p>Let's put it this way: there is no reason why you should consider Play less safe than any other Java framework. In many cases you can consider it more safe. And with Play being an easy to developer, stateless and REST framework you get less chances to mess it.</p>
