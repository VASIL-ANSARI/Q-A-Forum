<p>There is native library for that <a href="http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/android/index.html#gifflen" rel="nofollow">http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/android/index.html#gifflen</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've written a small native lib for Android to do color quantization (from 2-256 colors) of a Bitmap and save the result as a frame in an animated GIF (you can add as many frames as you like).
  You may hack and slash the library code as you wish to fit your needs. The color quantizer used is Anthony Dekker's NeuQuant, with some modifications made by me.</p>

<p>For a java based library try <a href="http://www.jappit.com/blog/2008/12/04/j2me-animated-gif-encoder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jappit.com/blog/2008/12/04/j2me-animated-gif-encoder/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usage is quite straightforward, and it requires these steps:
      Instantiate your AnimatedGifEncoder object
      Start it, by passing an OutputStream as argument (e.g.: a ByteArrayOutputStream)
      Add your Image objects by using addFrame() method
      Finalize it by calling finish()</p>
