<p>You could use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.socket.poll(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Socket.Poll</code></a> which allows you to wait for a connection with a timeout. Call it with <code>SelectMode.SelectRead</code>, and if it returns <code>true</code> there is a connection pending that you can accept without blocking.</p>
