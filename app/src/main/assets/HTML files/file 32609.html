<p>The issue is most likely because the purpose of <code>onCreate()</code> is to create the Activity's state as it was when it left.  You can't under any circumstances assume that an <code>Activity</code> will maintain its state once the user leaves it.  Views are memory intensive, and the system is going to dump it as soon as it needs more memory for the current top Activity. If this happens then the system must recreate the <code>Activity</code> to its original state before the system dumped it.</p>

<p>You can save states via the <code>onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)</code> method.  The bundle that's passed in to <code>onCreate</code> is the same bundle you set in <code>onSaveInstanceState()</code>, so all parameters will be there.  Then you can rebuild just as it was.</p>
