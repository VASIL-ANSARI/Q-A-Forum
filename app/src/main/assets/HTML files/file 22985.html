<p>I don't have a solution to your specific problem of the cookies, but what we have done to print pdfs with permissions is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Expose a separate view with no log in authentication.</li>
<li>Create a single use token for the pdf to be generated.</li>
<li>In the view with out authentication, ensure that the key is correct, and has not been use yet. If the token is valid, then return the html to convert into a pdf.</li>
<li>If your view needs to know which user is requesting the pdf (to customise the page in some way) you can store the user id along with the token in the database.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are looking for a better way of dong this, but it works for us so far. </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
