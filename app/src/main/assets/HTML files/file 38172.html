<p>Wow, there's a lot going on in that <code>getView()</code>.  Off the bat, the following looks really wrong.</p>

<pre><code> // we're near the end of the list adapter, so load more items
 if (position &gt;= getCount() - 1){
     mSwipe.setRefreshing(true);
     loadmore();
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>getView()</code> method can be called 3-4 times per position number. It may or may not be called for all items when first displaying to the screen.  So determining when to load more items into the adapter here is really bad. Considering you said problems don't arise till you start scrolling...I'd say this might be your culprit.</p>

<p>What you should do instead is attach an <code>OnScollListener</code> to the <code>ListView</code> and check the <code>ListView.getLastVisiblePosition()</code> against your adapter count to determine when to load more.</p>

<p>Also, before applying this fix, I'd just remove that segment of code and see if that resolves your problem.</p>
