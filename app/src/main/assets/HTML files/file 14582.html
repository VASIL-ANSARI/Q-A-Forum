<p>Whats wrong with the code ? </p>

<p>You have @Persistent plastered all over the place (implied by Googles docs admittedly, but then best not to believe them), you don't need that ... all standard types are by default persistent (as per the JDO spec, and indeed extended by Google's own code to make their Key class etc as persistent by default). Makes the class look much more normal.</p>

<p>You're calling <em>makePersistent</em>, yet the object being persisted is in what "state" ? <em>JDOHelper.getObjectState(obj)</em> tells you. If it is already managed then there is no need to do that ... the whole point of that bytecode enhancement process, to detect changes. Obviously a nontransactional update will not happen immediately. You don't say if using a transaction around that.</p>

<p>Look in the Log for the retrieve, tells you way more than anyone here can.</p>

<p>Not using v2.0 of the GAE JDO plugin probably too; anything earlier than that is very old and not maintained.</p>
