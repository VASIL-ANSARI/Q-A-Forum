<p>This problem is not a Laravel issue. You said in a comment, that it is written that you sent the email to yourself. This is due to the fact that gmail does not allow to use random from addresses, to prevent spamming. </p>

<p>You have to register alternate addresses before you can use them as your "from address" , or gmail will change it back to default. </p>
