<p>I'm not aware of an issue around this being reported. I would work to reproduce this as a simple case and bring it to the mailing list <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/masstransit-discuss" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/masstransit-discuss</a> or submit an issue <a href="https://github.com/MassTransit/MassTransit/issues?state=open" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/MassTransit/MassTransit/issues?state=open</a> with the reproducible case. </p>
