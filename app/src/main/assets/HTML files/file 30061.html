<p>I don't think you really need a strategy, you just need a cache.</p>

<p>Pick what your maximum time interval for polls is. The code that fetches the data just remembers the result and the time it fetched it. Until the time interval expires it returns the cached data instead of querying again. Once the time is reached next request fetches the new data...</p>

<p>The cache time is a judgement call based on how fast the data might go out of date as opposed to how nice you want to be to the downstream systems. (And be aware that in many systems if you flood them with requests they will shut you out anyway).</p>
