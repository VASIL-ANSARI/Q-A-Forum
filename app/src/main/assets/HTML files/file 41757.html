<p>You'll need to add a specific firewall for anonymous access : </p>

<pre><code>firewalls:
  api:
    pattern: ^/api
  doc:
    pattern: ^/api/doc
    security: false
  public:
    pattern: ^/api/public
    security: false
</code></pre>

<p>Another option is to allow anonymous users to access these 2 firewalls, I don't know however if it will works with remote curl calls for e.g.</p>
