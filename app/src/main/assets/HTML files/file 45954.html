<p>In your case, I'd use @NotNull, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>it's a more specific annotation and IDEA is able to produce more specific warnings based on it</li>
<li>IDEA can generate runtime assertions ensuring it's really not null</li>
</ul>

<p>@Contract annotation is a more powerful but less specific tool. It allows you to express much more complex contracts with the downsides that the resulting editor warnings might be more obscure, and there will be no runtime checks added automatically.</p>
