<p>You might be able to.. but it wouldn't be very clear or succinct Angular code.  You want to avoid DOM manipulation like this as much as you can with Angular.  If you need to have a hidden field with a gift id, you could have just one in your view and ng-bind it to a variable in your scope.  </p>

<p>ex <code>&lt;input type="hidden" ng-bind="saved_gift" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>Then your <code>remeber_gift</code> function could just update that <code>saved_gift</code> to the selected <code>gift.id</code>.</p>
