<p>Meteor already gzips and minifies (in production mode) your app.</p>

<p>Just not to cause the confusion your main app file the <em>root file</em> available at xxx.meteor.com is not impacted by this (the one containing the HTML similar to index.html).</p>

<p>Also this index.html <em>LIKE</em> file is the bare one containing the references to your js &amp; css files. The actual js file containing your app's HTML is indeed gzipped too.</p>

<p>The rest of your static assets (css, js, images, etc) are all gzipd.</p>

<p>In production mode your css &amp; js are also minified.</p>

<p>Your site at gzipminify.meteor.com has no static assets nor CSS.</p>

<p>On the other hand</p>

<p>Is the web page compressed : YES  for <a href="http://test.meteor.com/5166d4fcc07e1605cbe979ef217942271d8badac.js" rel="nofollow">http://test.meteor.com/5166d4fcc07e1605cbe979ef217942271d8badac.js</a></p>

<p>Is the web page compressed: NO for (<a href="http://test.meteor.com" rel="nofollow">http://test.meteor.com</a>)</p>

<p>For a custom server side rendered route with iron router you can gzip files by including middleware with <code>Router.onBeforeAction</code> instead of <code>app.use</code> with the compression middleware of your choice (nodejs).</p>
