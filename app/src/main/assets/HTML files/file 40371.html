<p>I think you need more conditions on the join, including the department and the date.  My best guess is this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT   T1.empid as empid, T1.department as department,
         COUNT(absencedate) AS NumDaysAbsent ,
         startdate, enddate,
FROM     Table1 T1 JOIN
         Table2 T2
         ON t1.empid = t2.empid AND t1.department = t2.department and
            t2.absencedate between t1.startdate and t1.enddate
GROUP BY T1.empid, T1.department, startdate, enddate;
</code></pre>
