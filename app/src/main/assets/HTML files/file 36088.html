<p>A datatype cannot restrict the acceptable characters. However, a <code>CONSTRAINT</code> can be used to do the same. For example, in SQL Server, you can add a constraint on a particular column to check if data being inserted meets a criteria.</p>

<pre><code>create table tbl(textcol varchar(10))

alter table tbl add constraint cs_chk_chars check (textcol not like '%[^A-Za-z0-9]%')
</code></pre>

<p>The above constraint will cause an insert to fail if it contains non-alphanumeric characters.</p>

<p>Ideally, however, you would do this validation at the application level to ensure only valid data is sent to the DB in the first place.</p>
