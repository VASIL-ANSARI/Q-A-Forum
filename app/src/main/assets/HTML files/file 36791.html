<p>You just need <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" rel="nofollow">the JDK</a>. Installing it (it has an installer) should set it up sufficiently.</p>

<p>When you want to compile something, use the <code>javac</code> tool:</p>

<pre>
> javac MyClass.java
</pre>

<p>When you want to run something, most likely you'll want the <code>java</code> tool (although of course if you're doing servlets or such, you'd use something else):</p>

<pre>
> java MyClass
</pre>

<p>Or of course, go ahead and use a separate text editor if you like but continue to use the IDE to compile, not least because presumably any IDE you were using had an integrated debugger, and a debugger is an essential tool.</p>
