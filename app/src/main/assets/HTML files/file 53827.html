<p>Let's start saying you don't need to call pow() at all, but in your case you misplaced the braces. It should be</p>

<pre><code>pow(height, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that height is a numeric variable.
It's not clear if you want to include somehow the units of measures of phisical quantities (inches or pound) into your variables. That's a more challenging task, but meanwhile you can use this:</p>

<pre><code>float weight = 0, height = 0;
cout &lt;&lt; "Enter weight(lbs): ";
cin &gt;&gt; weight;
cout &lt;&lt; "Enter height(inches):";
cin &gt;&gt; height;

float BMI = weight * 703.0 / (height * height);
cout &lt;&lt; "BMI = " &lt;&lt; BMI &lt;&lt; '\n';
</code></pre>
