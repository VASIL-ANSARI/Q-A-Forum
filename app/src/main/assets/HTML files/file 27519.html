<p>i fixed the issue. I changed the code :</p>

<pre><code>     content = content + html;
     $ul.html( content );
</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>  $ul.append( html);
</code></pre>

<p>i made a custom filter and recognized that the .then was always called AFTER the filter began.
Thats really weird because this method listviewbeforefilter should do everything before the filtering begins. I guess its because the ajax takes so long and will be skipped but later coming back to the .then method when the response received. I thought maybe async:false would help, but nope.</p>

<p>So basically it filters my local data and hides the list which are not needed and than i append the received data to the list. </p>
