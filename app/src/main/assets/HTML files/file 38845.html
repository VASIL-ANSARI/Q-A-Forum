<p>The <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/the-select-element.html#the-select-element" rel="nofollow">HTML5 spec on <code>select</code></a> defines an option with a value of the empty string as a placeholder label option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a select element has a required attribute specified, does not have a multiple attribute specified, and has a display size of 1; and <strong>if the value of the first option element in the select element's list of options (if any) is the empty string</strong>, and that option element's parent node is the select element (and not an optgroup element), then that option is the select element's placeholder label option.</p>
</blockquote>
