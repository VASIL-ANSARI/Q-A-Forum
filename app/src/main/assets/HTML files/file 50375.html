<p>A module is a container for differing pieces of your application, and should be independent of each other.</p>

<p>Read up on it here:  <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module" rel="nofollow">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module</a></p>

<p>Regardless of being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" rel="nofollow">SPA architecture</a>, modules place like source together.  Think of them as a means for encapsulating (and even modularizing) your code into meaningful, self-contained and stand-alone logic.  They should not be dependent on other pieces of your code in different modules, but should be easy to interact with them.</p>
