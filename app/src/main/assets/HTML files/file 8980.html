<p>All you need to do is call render :json with an object, like so:</p>

<pre><code>render :json =&gt; my_object
</code></pre>

<p>For most objects, this will just work. If it's an ActiveRecord object, make sure to look at as_json to see how that works. For your case illustrated above, your hash will be transformed to json and returned.</p>

<p>However, you do have an error: you cant access the success key via response.success -- you should instead do response[:success]</p>
