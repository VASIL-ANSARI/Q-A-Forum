<p>There is one error in your code. You are not using the correct attribute to load the text into the label.Use This.</p>

<p>This worked for me. I tested this on my Xcode.</p>

<pre><code>-(void) editingChanged:(id)sender {
  //label1.text = field.text;
   libelleTemp=field.text;
    NSLog(@"text is %@",libelleTemp);
   // libelleTemp is set to @"" whatever the user has typed in when I'm in insert mode
}
</code></pre>
