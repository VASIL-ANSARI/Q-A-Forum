<p>You have a database record where the country is NULL. The length of that doesn't make sense. What should it do when there's no country set?</p>

<p>Maybe you want to filter the records? <code>SELECT country, city FROM df WHERE country IS NOT NULL</code>? Or maybe <code>lambda l: l.country is not None and len(l.country) &lt; 4</code>, or depending on your logic, <code>lambda l: l.country is None or len(l.country) &lt; 4</code>.</p>
