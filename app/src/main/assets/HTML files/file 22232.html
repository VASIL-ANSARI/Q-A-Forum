<p>Maps URL format  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/iPhoneURLScheme_Reference/Articles/MapLinks.html" rel="nofollow">of Apple documents</a>. It looks like you can replace <code>maps.google.com</code> with <code>maps.apple.com.</code></p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong>Â In iOS 5.1 and earlier, the Map Kit framework uses the Google Mobile Maps (GMM) service to provide map data.</p>

<p>It turns out that the same is true in MobileSafari on <code>iOS 6;</code> tapping a link to <code>http://maps.apple.com?q=...</code> opens the Maps app with that search, the same way <code>http://maps.google.com?q=...</code> did on previous versions. I got curious and tried it and it worked, and then noticed that it's explicitly confirmed in the page linked above.</p>
