<p>I'll try to answer here instead of continuing the comment-spam ;)<br>
you got your webspace with FTP access. let's just call it <strong>webspace</strong>;<br>
then you got your server at your workplace. let's just call it <strong>workplace</strong>;<br>
after all you need one server (also can be <strong>webspace</strong> for example) where you are able to run <code>PHP</code>. let's call it <strong>php-server</strong>;  </p>

<p><strong>step 1</strong><br>
at the <strong>workplace</strong> setup a FTP server, for example <code>FileZilla</code>. you setup your FTP server so that you can connect to it. so make an account and set it up so you can access the folder(s) where you want to save your images. also make sure you got access from outside your workplace - firewall settings etc.</p>

<p><strong>step 2</strong><br>
if you can run your PHP scripts on your <strong>webspace</strong> this would be the easiest way. you can directly access the image files, establish a connection to your FTP server at <strong>workplace</strong> and upload the files.<br>
if the PHP server is somewhere else, you have to establish a connection from the <strong>php-server</strong> to your <strong>webspace</strong>; download your files to your <strong>php-server</strong>; upload your files to the FTP server at your <strong>workplace</strong>.</p>

<p>will be a bit of work as you can see, but should be possible to do.</p>
