<p>The <code>index.php</code> script serves <strong>every</strong> request. I'm guessing what you actually want is the index page view script, which you can usually find at <code>application/views/scripts/index/index.phtml</code>. This is rendered within the default layout, which is probably at <code>application/layouts/default.phtml</code>.</p>
