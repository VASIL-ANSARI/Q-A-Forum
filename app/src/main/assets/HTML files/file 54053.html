<p>There is a repeatInterval you can set on the local notification that takes an NSCalendarUnit as its type. You can read more about the different available calendar units here <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSCalendar_Class/#//apple_ref/c/tdef/NSCalendarUnit" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSCalendar_Class/#//apple_ref/c/tdef/NSCalendarUnit</a></p>

<p>You would likely be looking for NSCalendarUnitWeekOfYear</p>

<p>So you could just add the following to your code for your notification</p>

<pre><code>notification.repeatInterval = NSCalendarUnit.WeekOfYear
</code></pre>
