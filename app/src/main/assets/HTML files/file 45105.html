<p>It is not possible to share the same memory for multiple socket operations (or if you do you receive undefined results).</p>

<p>You can circumvent this problem by reading only 1 byte at first. When that read completes it is likely that more data will be coming. So for the next read you use a more efficient size such as 4KB (or you interrogate the <code>DataAvailable</code> property - this is about the only valid use case of that property).</p>
