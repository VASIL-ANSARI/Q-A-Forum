<p>I am not sure that I understand correct your requirements. You wrote mostly about the problem of warping of long texts having no spaces like email. The problem could be solved by usage of character wrapping. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6915486/315935">the answer</a> for more details. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/7256972/315935">Another answer</a> has additional information about implementation of character level wrapping in different web browsers. The most web browsers do word level wrapping if the text contains spaces and do character wrapping only if no spaces exist in the text. Is it not what you need?</p>
