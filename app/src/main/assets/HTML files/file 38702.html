<p>The problem was I haven't got specified the path to box2D library.</p>

<p>So, I succeed to compile and execute my little hello world program following this steps :</p>

<p>1 ) Copy and paste the library into my project folder (I put it into a lib directory).
2 ) add path of the lib directory to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3 ) compiling with g++ and specify to use the box2D library :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>g++ main.cpp -o test -l Box2D</p>
</blockquote>
