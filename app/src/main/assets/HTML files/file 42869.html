<p>For reading and writing files, you just use the normal <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> functions; you'll need to have a file descriptor first, so you'll need to use <code>fopen</code>. </p>

<p>all in all, every C tutorial I've ever seen covers opening and writing long before it touches <code>fork</code>, so I wonder what you've been following. I'd really just recommend finding an intro to C that you like and read the first few pages; if you already understand what <code>fork</code> does, this will be a piece of cake for you.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: also, you might misunderstand what </p>

<pre><code>program arguments &lt;from_file &gt;to_file 
</code></pre>

<p>does when using that on a shell: </p>

<p>The <strong>shell</strong> reads that line, and calls <code>program</code>, passing it <code>arguments</code> as... arguments. It detects the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> on that line and "bends" the standard input and output file descriptors (yes, standard input and output behave just like that), to be actually <code>fopen</code>ed files.</p>

<p><code>program</code> never sees <code>&lt;from_file</code> nor <code>&gt;to_file</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> in your comment you say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i can not use fopen and those functions. only .fork,dup.dup2,exec,open,write,read</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, <code>fopen</code> is but a wrapper for <code>open</code> and returns the file descriptor <code>open</code> returns.</p>

<p>Also, your program uses plenty libc functions; if you'd only be allowed to <code>write</code>, you shouldn't use <code>printf</code>, which is a very handy formatting wrapper for <code>puts</code>, which is a wrapper for <code>write</code>. Similar things apply to <strong>all</strong> functions you call, ie. <code>waitpid</code>, <code>execvp</code>, <code>perror</code>. You should document your requirements clearly <em>for yourself</em>, first.</p>
