<p>the scenario you describe is easily achievable when the web API are protected via Azure AD as well. In that case, you can refer <a href="https://github.com/AzureADSamples/WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/AzureADSamples/WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AzureADSamples/WebApp-WebAPI-MultiTenant-OpenIdConnect-DotNet" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/AzureADSamples/WebApp-WebAPI-MultiTenant-OpenIdConnect-DotNet</a> as examples of asp.net apps where we maintain a server side token cache keyed on the asp.net app user, which allows you to gain access to all the associated web API with a single login. However if you need to access API protected by other providers you will have to refer to their features, practices and SDKs.</p>
