<p>Your class inherits from System.Web.UI.Page, which sets its Session member to HttpContext.Current.Session on first access. Since you have a singleton, it will always refer to the first session in which the User property was accessed.</p>

<p>You probably should do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public sealed class SessionManager
{
    private const string USER = "User";

    private static readonly SessionManager _instance = new SessionManager();

    private SessionManager()
    {
    }

    public static SessionManager Instance
    {
        get { return _instance; }
    }

    public User User
    {
        get { return HttpContext.Current.Session[USER] as User; }
        set { HttpContext.Current.Session[USER] = value; }
    }
}
</code></pre>
