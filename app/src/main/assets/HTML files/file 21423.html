<p>Yes. No. If you implement it, yes. Depends on what your application needs.</p>

<p>Basically if all you need is simple data passing pipes are fine, if you need to be constantly calling functions on objects in your remote process then you'll probably be better of using some form of existing RPC instead of reinventing the wheel. Whether that should be XMLRPC or something else is another matter.</p>

<p>Note that RPC will have to use some underlying IPC mechanism, which could well be pipes. but might also be sockets, message queues, shared memory, whatever.</p>
