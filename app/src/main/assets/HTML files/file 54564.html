<p>4th to last line:</p>

<pre><code> with open(fi, "r") as current:
</code></pre>

<p>needed to be changed to:</p>

<pre><code>current = open(fi, "r")
</code></pre>

<p>That's it. That fixed my problem. load() closes <strong>current</strong>, and apparently I cannot close <strong>current</strong> inside the <strong>with open() as ...</strong> code segment for <strong>current</strong>.</p>
