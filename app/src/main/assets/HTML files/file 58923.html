<p>I'll point out the logical problem with this part of your existing code:</p>

<pre><code>    if (pace &lt; pace_f)
    {
        name_f = name;    
        pace_f = pace;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Your other <code>if</code> statements have the same problem, but it's easier to explain the problem here, and then you can apply the same fix to all the others.</p>

<p>Here you've decided that your next pace level is better than the current first place finish. Now, it is true that <code>pace</code>, the current record, is now the first place pace, and you need to update <code>name_f</code> and <code>pace_f</code>, the first place records accordingly.</p>

<p>But the detail that you missed is that your current first place pace is now your second best pace, and your current second place pace is now your third best pace.</p>

<p>You just found a record with a pace that's better than your top three paces, so this must mean that your existing best is now the second best, and your existing second best is now your third best.</p>

<p>So, before you can update your first best's pace and name, you need to move your existing second place name and pace to the third place name and pace; your existing first place name and pace to the second place name and pace; and only after that's done, you can update your first place name and pace.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can simply the comparisons by rearranging their relative order with each other.</p>

<p>If you can compare the first place pace first, then the <code>else</code> part can then be used to test the remaining possibilities. Once you've excluded the possibility that you have the best first pace, it's simpler to test the remain possibilities.</p>

<p>Your overall logic should be:</p>

<pre><code>if (pace &lt; pace_f)
{
     // Move the second place name+pace to third place
     // Move the first place name+pace to the second place
     // Set the new first place pace.
}
else if (pace &lt; pace_s)
{
     // Move the second place name+pace to third place
     // Set the new second place pace.
}
else if (pace &lt; pace_t)
{
     // Set the new third place pace.
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it.</p>
