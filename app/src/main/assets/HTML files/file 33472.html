<p>The hooks for cucumber are described <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Hooks" rel="nofollow">in this wiki page</a> which show the before and after hooks you can have.</p>

<p>Taken from that page is this example: </p>

<p>The following example will cause scenarios tagged with @fast to fail if the execution takes longer than 0.5 seconds:</p>

<pre><code>Around('@fast') do |scenario, block|
  Timeout.timeout(0.5) do
    block.call
  end
end
</code></pre>
