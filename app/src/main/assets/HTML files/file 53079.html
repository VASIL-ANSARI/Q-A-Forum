<p>My current workaround is to do a one-way binding and initializing the textview to the initial property.</p>

<pre><code>    textview.text = testVar.value
    textview.rx_text.subscribeNext({ self.testVar.value = $0 }) // and dispose it
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't allow me to react to any model changes, but in my case, I'm pretty sure the model will not change without the user input.</p>
