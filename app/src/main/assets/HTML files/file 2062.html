<pre><code>xmlParseEntityRef: no name 
</code></pre>

<p>Means you've got bogus unescaped ampersands in the XML file. (Well, âXMLâ... technically if it ain't well-formed, it ain't XML.)</p>

<p>You'll need to check the file for lone <code>&amp;</code>s (or fix the code that generated it) to escape them to <code>&amp;amp;</code>. According to the error, the first one's on line 43102 of the file (yikes!).</p>
