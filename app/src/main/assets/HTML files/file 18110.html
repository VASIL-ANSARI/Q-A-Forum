<p>The types of things you have described are actually system specific rather then C specific. If you look around you might be able to find some wrappers for them, but they are not part of the C++ standard (nor the C standard).</p>

<p>As an example, there's no reason to use file descriptors in standard C. That's what the file struct, fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, etc are for. If you're using file descriptors it's because you're being taught about the operating system rather than about C.</p>
