<p>Make sure these calls need an <code>Activity</code> and not a <code>Context</code>. I believe the cases you mention only require a <code>Context</code>, which is readily available outside of an Activity. For example, an Android <code>Service</code> derives from Context, as does the <code>Application</code> object itself.</p>
