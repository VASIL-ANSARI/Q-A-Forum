<p>I'm wondering whether you have your key correct?</p>

<p><code>UITextField</code> does not have a <code>selectionRange</code> property publicly defined AFAICT.  However, <code>&lt;UITextInput&gt;</code> - to which <code>UITextField</code> conforms - has a <code>selectedTextRange</code> property.  Is this perhaps what you intended?  (It's possible there's an undocumented private property actually called <code>selectionRange</code> that you've accidentally encountered, and which doesn't behave as expected in cases such as you encountered.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, did you really mean <code>UITextView</code> - which has a <code>selectedRange</code> - but still no <code>selectionRange</code>?</p>

<p>On a separate note, I don't think subclassing <code>UITextField</code> is the right approach here. Autocompletion can be completely (no pun intended) implemented using the <code>&lt;UITextFieldDelegate&gt;</code> methods and it is a maxim of Cocoa programming that when you can accomplish a goal through class composition rather than subclassing, you should opt for composition every time.</p>
