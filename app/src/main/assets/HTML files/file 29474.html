<p>Well tables cannot break so they always force the upper element to scroll, except you do overflow: hidden but then important data are not displayed at all.</p>

<p>Wether shortcut / wrap / fix your table col width and content size so the context cannot get too large or if you are aiming for the data to appear in the next row you have to use left floating  with some margin.</p>
