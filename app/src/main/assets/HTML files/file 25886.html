<p>When the images fail to appear, the problem is not that they aren't loaded by the browser, but that the Freetile plugin is giving the image containers a zero height and width, therefore hiding them.</p>

<p>I think what's happening is your Freetile code is executed before the browser has finished loading the images. I assume Freetile measures the content of the div (which will be zero until the image loaded) and then determines that there is no content and applies the zero height and width.</p>

<p>This explains the inconsistent results because sometimes the browser manages to get the images loaded before Freetile runs, sometimes not.</p>

<p>My theory could be tested by commenting out the Freetile code and add it to a <code>setTimeout()</code> call with a long timer such as 5 seconds because you know the images will be fully loaded by then.</p>

<p>Suggested possible fixes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add the Freetile execution to <code>$(window).load()</code> instead of <code>$(document).ready()</code>. The difference is <code>$(window).load()</code> only fires when everything is fully loaded (including all images).</p></li>
<li><p>Add some code that will listen to the images <code>onload</code> events and wait until all of them have fired (indicating all images loaded) and then do the Freetile execution. Your use of <code>$(document).ready()</code> is not enough because that only means the DOM is loaded and ready, doesn't necessarily mean all images are downloaded and rendered.</p></li>
</ol>
