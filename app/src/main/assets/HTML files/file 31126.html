<p>You can use Timer and TimerTask to execute AsyncTask on specified time intervals, but remember that TimerTask executes on worker thread and you should execute AsyncTask only on UI thread so you will have to use handler or runOnUithread method to properly execute AsyncTask.</p>

<p>If you choose to use Timer, then invalidate in in onPause and restart in onStart, you dont want updates when app is in background. If you want you need to add more logic, like store temporary list to be used once your Activity is recreated.</p>

<p>Also, I see you are clearing list inside your doInBackground which is currently used by your ListView, this is wrong, you should return new list contents from doInBackground and update ListView in onPostExecute, otherwise you are introducing data race.</p>
