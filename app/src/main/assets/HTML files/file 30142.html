<p>Use an <code>AsyncTask</code>:</p>

<p><code>onPreExecute</code> is for pre-processing.</p>

<p><code>DoInBackground</code> is where you would parse the XML.</p>

<p><code>OnPostExecute</code> is for doing things <strong>for the UI</strong>. This would be putting the output of the parsing into the UI.</p>

<p><strong>Do not run it on the UI thread!</strong> Instead, use an <code>AsyncTask</code> as I described above.</p>
