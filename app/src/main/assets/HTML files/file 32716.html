<p>When an operation involving <code>floats</code> fails, <code>NaN</code> is the resulting value. <code>NaN</code> has an interesting property: operating with <code>NaN</code> always results in <code>NaN</code>.</p>

<p>This means that as soon as one of your variables holds <code>NaN</code>, the value will propagate with all future operations.</p>

<p><code>console.log</code> your floats, and detect the moment in which one becomes <code>NaN</code>. My bet is in <code>(V[Z + C] + V[Z + C])</code>.</p>
