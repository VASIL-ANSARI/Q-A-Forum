<p>Well, merging the <code>Where</code> and the <code>Any</code> clauses would be a good first improvement:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var assay in compiledAssays)
{
    if (compiledAssays.Any(a =&gt; a != assay &amp;&amp; a.Overlaps(assay)))
    {
        throw new ApplicationException("Something went wrong.");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also try the more succinct:</p>

<pre><code>if (compiledAssays.Any(a =&gt; compiledAssays.Any(b =&gt; a != b &amp;&amp; a.Overlaps(b))))
{
    throw new ApplicationException("Something went wrong."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, if your primary concern is to minimize the amount of loops that are performed, I wouldn't use Linq.  I would do this instead (assumes <code>compiledAssays</code> is an array, adjust as necessary):</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; compiledAssays.Length; i++)
{
    for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; compiledAssays.Length; j++)
    {
        if (compiledAssays[i].Overlaps(compiledAssays[j]))
        {
            throw new ApplicationException("Something went wrong.");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> A very pertinent comment by Raymond Chen.</p>

<p>My last option assumes that the <code>Overlaps</code> function is symmetric.</p>

<p>In other words, that <code>a.Overlaps(b)</code> will always return the same value as <code>b.Overlaps(a)</code>.  If this is not the case, then my last option is incorrect.</p>
