<p>Use <code>ExecuteScalar</code>, it's much more straight forward:</p>

<pre><code>MySqlConnection con = new MySqlConnection("host=db4free.net;user=*;password=*;database=*;");
MySqlCommand xcmd = new MySqlCommand("SELECT x FROM members WHERE id='" + Login.idd + "';", con);

con.Open();
var x = (int)xcmd.ExecuteScalar();
con.Close();
if (x == 2)
{
    button6.BackgroundImage = Properties.Resources.logo;
}
</code></pre>

<p>further, please take note to the answer provided by <strong>dash</strong>. I generally add that to my answers, and was in the process, but saw his addition.</p>

<p>And a note about setting a <code>BackgroundImage</code> -you need to work with the <code>Layout</code> and <code>Size</code>. The following code is from MSDN:</p>

<pre><code>// Specify the layout style of the background image. Tile is the default.
button1.BackgroundImageLayout = ImageLayout.Center;

// Make the button the same size as the image.
button1.Size = button1.BackgroundImage.Size;
</code></pre>

<p>those settings above may not be right based on your image.</p>
