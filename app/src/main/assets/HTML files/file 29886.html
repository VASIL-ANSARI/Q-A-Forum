<p>This is a very common requirement. In fact, it's so common that Microsoft even have a page on MSDN specifically for this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb613586(v=vs.100).aspx" rel="nofollow">How to: Find ControlTemplate-Generated Elements</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, if you have a reference to <em>the <code>ComboBox</code> that the <code>ControlTemplate</code> is applied to</em> (let's call it <code>ComboBox</code>), then you should be able to do this:</p>

<pre><code>DataGrid dataGrid = 
    ComboBox.Template.FindName("PART_PopupDataGrid", ComboBox) as DataGrid;
</code></pre>
