<p>You need to change ft.add to ft.replace. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>add() adds a fragment to the activity state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>replace()</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Replace an existing fragment that was added to a container. This is
  essentially the same as calling remove(Fragment) for all currently
  added fragments that were added with the same containerViewId and then
  add(int, Fragment, String) with the same arguments given here.</p>
