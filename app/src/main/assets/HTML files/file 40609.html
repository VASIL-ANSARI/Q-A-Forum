<p>Ali, I assume here that you need to update the contents of the MainPage.xaml while some background (async) task has finished.</p>

<p>The best way to do that is have a DataModel (MVVM) in your application. More info <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/gg521153%28v=vs.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>
and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj721615%28v=vs.105%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>By doing this when the async task finishes a function will be called to update the DataStructure that holds your data. Since that Model implements the INotifyPropertyChanged class the control on your UI (even though they are on another page) will be updated automatically.</p>
