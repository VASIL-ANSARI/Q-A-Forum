<p>Probably no, and I don't recommend doing it. The way how a service is published is better to consider as an implementation-specific detail. If you want to search for the services provided by your library, then it is better to add a custom key-value property to your services (don't know how to do that with iPOJO) and use that key in your LDAP filter.</p>

<p>edit: the provided services' only externally visible characteristics are the classname and the key-value service properties, so if you can't find any reasonable information there about iPOJO, then you don't have too much chance </p>
