<p>Hosting .jar files on Google Sites results in a caching effect with googlegroups.com. I can't say right now <em>why</em> this is, but you can see evidence of it in the Java console if you set the tracing level to 5. </p>

<p>For some applets I have, this poses no problem. However, I encountered security exceptions with <code>getSoundClip</code> that I couldn't figure out in my applet. It always worked when I hosted it on a site set up by my ISP. I noticed the odd googlegroups.com URLs coming from some kind of cache, appearing in the console. Default console settings don't show caching, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>Uploading the .jar file to code.google.com (and setting codebase, etc.) doesn't have any caching (that I can see) and my <code>getSoundClip</code> calls work with no security exceptions.</p>

<p>In the following extract from the console of an applet that <em>works</em> for me on Google Sites, you can see an example of a URL on <strong>sites.google.com</strong> and its corresponding cache in <strong>bab6424e-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com</strong>. Note: I replaced the true path in the URLs with <code>X/Y</code> and the jarfile with <code>Z.jar</code></p>
