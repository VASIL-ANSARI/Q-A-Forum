<p>Based on my experience, you don't need to add the keyword <code>BigBobsBowling</code> in your App Store Keywords. If someone searches that term your app will be found.</p>

<p>For info, one of my app is titled <code>Market Impulses</code> but if I search the term <code>MarketImpulses</code> I found it (I didn't define that term as a keyword).</p>

<p>You can focus your remaining keywords characters to your ASO :-)</p>
