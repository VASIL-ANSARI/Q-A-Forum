<p>Assuming that you can calculate "Depth" of each node, you can add the following code to OnPreRender and will show your items hierarchical:</p>

<pre><code>protected void overrided OnPreRender()
{
    lstItems.Items.Do(a=&gt;
    {
        var item = // get item from a.Value
        for(var i = 0; i&lt; item.Depth; i++)
        {
            a.Text = "&lt;span class='spacer'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" + a.Text;
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>and add the following rule to your stylesheets:</p>

<pre><code>span.spacer { width:20px; }
</code></pre>

<p>Although if you want to have collapse/expand feature you will need to add some javascript actions which I won't include here (too keep it simple)</p>

<p>P.S. It is important that items added to lstItems is ordered correctly based on hierarchical structure. Solution I recommend is to use the following method as the sort key of your datasource:</p>

<pre><code>public string GetFullPath()
{
    if(Parent == null) return Key;
    return Parent.GetFullPath() + "&gt;" + Key;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where Key is a unique field (in the context of a single parent). - It can be name, order, etc.</p>
