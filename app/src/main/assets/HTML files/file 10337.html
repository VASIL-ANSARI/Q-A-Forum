<p>The <code>nx.random_layout</code> function returns a dictionary mapping nodes to positions. As <code>pos</code> is a Python object, you don't want to just store the printed string version of it to a file, as you did in <code>f.write("%s" % pos)</code>. This gives you a file containing your dictionary, but reading it back in isn't as easy.  </p>

<p>Instead, serialize <code>pos</code> using one of the standard library modules designed for that task, for example, <code>json</code> or <code>pickle</code>. Their interfaces are basically the same, so I'll just show how to do it with <code>pickle</code>. Storing is:</p>

<pre><code>with open("graphLayout.txt", 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(pos, f)
</code></pre>

<p>Reloading is:</p>

<pre><code>with open("graphLayout.txt", 'rb') as f:
    pos = pickle.load(f)
</code></pre>
