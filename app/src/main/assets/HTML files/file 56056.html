<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT vet_id, Visit_date, SUM(Cost) AS [Total Cost]

<p>Access requires you to include the <code>AS</code> keyword when you alias a field expression.</p>

<p>I enclosed the alias in square brackets.  If you use quotes instead ... <code>AS "Total Cost"</code> ... Access will include those quotes in the column header.  </p>
