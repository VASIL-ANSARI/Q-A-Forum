<p>What browsers do you need to support?</p>

<p>Have you tried just dragging and dropping an image into a TinyMCE text area? It will encode the image in base64 and use that encoding as the value for the src attribute of the image tag. Since the customer is "not going to use that image ever again" that might be a temporary solution, especially if the images are very small like logos and the like.</p>

<p>Alternatively, many people have success with <a href="https://github.com/valums/file-uploader" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/valums/file-uploader</a> for drag and drop upload functionality, but I'm not sure how you would integrate it with TinyMCE.</p>
