<p><code>Google Apps Script</code>  is a web based script which is very akin to Java <strong>Script</strong>. With GAS, you can of course create Google Docs, which Google handles as blobs.</p>

<p>You can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Open a document by ID.
var doc = DocumentApp.openById('DOCUMENT_ID_GOES_HERE');

// Create and open a document.
doc = DocumentApp.create('Document Name');
</code></pre>

<p>You can also programatically edit documents. Please refer to : <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document/" rel="nofollow">Document Service</a></p>

<p>We can help you better, if you are more precise. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I apologize for being mistaken. May be <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/rest/quickstart/java" rel="nofollow">Java Quickstart</a> could be of some help, but it is no way an "idiot's" guide. Sorry once again. :(</p>
