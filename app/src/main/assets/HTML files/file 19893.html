  <p>This happens when you link an .obj or .lib that contains code created by an earlier version of the compiler. Which of course would be common if you downloaded a binary for opencv_ffmpeg instead of the source. You can turn the linker option off but then you'll still have a CRT version incompatibility that can byte. Rebuild the library from source. âÂ Hans Passant May 15 at 13:01
