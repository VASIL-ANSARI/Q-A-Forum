<p>If the input element is inside a form, and that form is not actually being submitted to the server, remove the form.</p>

<p>The reason your code doesn't work is becaue the <code>onkeydown</code> event should be in lowercase, and you aren't actually returning something in it (try <code>return keyPressed(holder);</code> - or just move the <code>keyPressed</code> function's code into <code>setupSearchField</code>, since it seems kind of pointless to me to have it as a separate function).</p>
