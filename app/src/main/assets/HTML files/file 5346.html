<p>I don't know what have you implemented in this custom preference, but maybe the super class doesn't know how create a proper view to your preference?</p>

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>protected View onCreateView (ViewGroup
  parent)</p>
  
  <p>Since: 
  API Level 1 Creates the View to
  be shown for this Preference in the
  PreferenceActivity. The default
  behavior is to inflate the main layout
  of this Preference (see
  setLayoutResource(int). If changing
  this behavior, please specify a
  ViewGroup with ID widget_frame. Make
  sure to call through to the
  superclass's implementation.</p>

<p>I guess you have set that id on the horizontal layout.</p>

<p>Now that I'm talking about it, why don't you include this horizontal layout in the layout that you are inflating?</p>
