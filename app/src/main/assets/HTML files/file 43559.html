<p>You should do two things : </p>

<ul>
<li>configure the security over your http request (in applicationContext)</li>
<li>configure your application container to be aware of your security configuration using the web.xml</li>
</ul>

<p>So slides are two steps, not two alternatives.</p>

<p>EDIT : 
The first step will allow you to configure which url will be secured and which will not be secured (and more option)</p>

<p>The second is the step which allow your configuration to be apply to your app</p>

<p>I hope it may help you</p>
