<p>Interesting behaviour. My guess is that this is Firefox's "memorize form field values" mechanism going awry - how and why, I don't know, though.</p>

<p>The problem could of course also be caused by something outside the code you have shown us. Are you 100% sure there are no tricky JQuery routines, other plugins or anything?</p>

<p>The issue certainly merits more research, but in the meantime, try whether <code>.reset()</code>ting the form helps. It should bring all the form values back to their predefined state (=unchecked).</p>
