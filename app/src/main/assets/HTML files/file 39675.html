<p>There is no accurate way to detect the state of printer as some printers don't have the capability of reporting their state to the operating system.</p>

<p>Never the less you can get the current state of the printer by :</p>

<pre><code>PrinterState QPrinter::printerState() const
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns <code>Idle</code>, <code>Active</code>, <code>Aborted</code> and <code>Error</code>. You can check if the printer state is <code>Active</code> or <code>Idle</code>. But there is no guarantee that your printer reports it's state correctly.</p>
