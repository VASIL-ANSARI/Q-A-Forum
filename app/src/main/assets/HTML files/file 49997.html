<p>In this case you could also use the string <code>in</code> operator in a list comprehension</p>

<pre><code>m = [i for i in sites if r'/site-packages' in i]
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly you could use <code>endswith</code></p>

<pre><code>m = [i for i in sites if i.endswith(r'/site-packages')]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>
To get the smallest element (by length) once the list comprehension has executed you can do</p>

<pre><code>min(m, key=len)
</code></pre>
