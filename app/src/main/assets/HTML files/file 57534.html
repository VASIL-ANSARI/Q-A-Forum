<p>The first one is <em>just</em> an assertion, a positive look-ahead saying "there must be zero or more characters followed by a digit." If you match it against a string containing at least one digit, it will tell you whether the assertion is true, but the matched text will just be an empty string.</p>

<p>The second one searches for a match, with an assertion (a positive-lookahead) after the match saying "there must be a digit." The matched text will be the characters before the last digit in the string (including any previous digits, because <code>.*</code> is greedy, so it'll consume digits up until the last one, because the last one is required by the assertion).</p>

<p>Note the difference in the match object results:</p>

<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>var str = "foo42";
test("rex1", /(?=.*\d)/, str);
test("rex2", /.*(?=\d)/, str);

function test(label, rex, str) {
  console.log(label, "test result:", rex.test(str));
  console.log(label, "match object:", rex.exec(str));
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>Output (for those who can't run snippets):</p>

<pre>
rex1 test result: true
rex1 match object: [
  ""
]
rex2 test result: true
rex2 match object: [
  "foo4"
]
</pre>

<p>Notice how the match result in the second case was <code>foo4</code> (from the string <code>foo42</code>), but blank in the first case.</p>
