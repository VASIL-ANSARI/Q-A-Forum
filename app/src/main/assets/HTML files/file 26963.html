<p>do you see it with command:</p>

<pre><code>dpkg -L libevent-dev|grep libevent.a
</code></pre>

<p>In normally, libevent-dev will install libevent to standard system library location, so you just need to add <code>event</code> to Project Properties -> C/C++ General -> Path And Symbols -> Library Paths</p>
