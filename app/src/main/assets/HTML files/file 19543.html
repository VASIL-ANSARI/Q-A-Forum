<p>This is, IMHO, <strike>a bug</strike>.</p>

<p>(As has been kindly pointed out, "bug" might be to strong a word as the API does not state what would happen if you passed null to the <code>selectedFile</code> method.  Instead, it's probably more reasonable to suggest that it is a missing feature)</p>

<p>Try something like this...</p>

<pre><code>JFileChooser fc = new JFileChooser();
fc.showOpenDialog(null);
File selected = fc.getSelectedFile();
System.out.println("You selected " + selected);

File currentDirectory = fc.getCurrentDirectory();
// Hack alert
fc.setSelectedFile(new File(""));
fc.setCurrentDirectory(currentDirectory);

fc.showOpenDialog(null);
selected = fc.getSelectedFile();

System.out.println("You selected " + selected);
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the change of the selected file seems to be UI dependent and relies on the <code>SELECTED_FILE_CHANGED_PROPERTY</code> property change event.  What seems to happen is that it's ignoring a <code>null</code> reference when it comes to changing (in particular) the selected file text field.</p>

<p>I tested this using Metal and Windows look and feel</p>
