<pre><code> LODGroup lodGroup = obj.GetComponent&lt;LODGroup&gt;();
 if (lodGroup != null)
 {
     Transform lodTransform = lodGroup.transform;
     foreach (Transform child in lodTransform)
     {
         var renderer = child.GetComponent&lt;Renderer&gt; ();
         if (renderer != null &amp;&amp; renderer.isVisible)
         { 
             Debug.Log("This LODlevel is used: " + child.name); 
         }
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>You can find out which LOD level is currently active by looking into the names of children GameObjects Renderers which are currently visible (visible on the screen).</p>
