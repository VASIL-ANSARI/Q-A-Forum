<p>It looks as if the attribute <code>name</code> is used in more than one table that you're trying to access. You'll want to add <code>table_name.</code> before <code>name</code> so it would look like <code>WHERE (table_name.name LIKE...)</code>. Just replace <code>table_name</code> with whichever table and field you're comparing the name to :-)</p>
