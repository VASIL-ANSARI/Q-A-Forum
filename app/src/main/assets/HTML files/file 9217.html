<p>The best/only way I know to do this is to declare RED, BLUE, GREEN, etc. as functions and return a constant value, like so:</p>

<pre><code>window.MyModule = {
    RED: function() { return "#FF0000"; },
    BLUE: function() { return "#0000FF"; },
    GREEN: function() { return "#00FF00"; }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Someone can still overwrite the function to do something different, but it's semantically more difficult to do - a function seems more so like it shouldn't be overwritten.</p>
