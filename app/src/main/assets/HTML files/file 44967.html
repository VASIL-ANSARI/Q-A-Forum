<p>You are setting Selected and unselected image for button's Normal state in both cases i.e UIControlStateNormal.
When you are using <strong>selected</strong> method you do not require to setImage again. Just set Image for Normal and selected state for button properly in cellForRowAtIndexpath or in xib. You are done.</p>

<p>First remove the setting image in clickBtnSubscribe:() method.</p>

<p>Now in your storyboard  set images for Normal and selected state.
Also remove set Image in cell for row at indexpath as you have already done in view.</p>
