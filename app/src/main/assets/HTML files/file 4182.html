<p>My understanding is that (both for modal and non-modal editors) it is <em>completely</em> up to the whim of the control being shown. If the <code>UITypeEditor</code> involved chooses a big form, it will be big...</p>

<p>The only way to change that would be to define your own <code>UITypeEditor</code> and associate it with the types involved (<em>sometimes</em> possible with <code>TypeDescriptor.AddAttributes(...)</code>, that creates the <em>same</em> form as the runtime wanted to show, but resizes it before showing.</p>
