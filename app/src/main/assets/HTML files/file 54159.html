<p>If the table have an auto incremental column 'id', We can order by id and identify the next row value and subtract it</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.*, t1.Data2-(SELECT t2.Data2 FROM  `table_name`  t2 WHERE t2.id &gt; t1.id LIMIT 1 ) AS difference
FROM `table_name`  t1
ORDER BY t1.id
</code></pre>

<p>to subtract from next row value</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.*, t1.Data2-(SELECT t2.Data2 FROM  `table_name`  t2 WHERE t2.id &lt; t1.id ORDER BY id DESC  LIMIT 1 ) AS difference
FROM `table_name`  t1
ORDER BY t1.id
</code></pre>
