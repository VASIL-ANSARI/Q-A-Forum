<p>Yes, this is correct; the main cause of this is that you are using <code>xsl:output</code> with html method. With this, the processor is allowed to output non well formed documents. The <code>area</code> tag is an HTML tag without end tag as many others like <code>br</code> and so on. You can resolve your problem just be changing output method to XML.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:output method="xml"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You may experience the same behavior with any XSLT 1.0 compliant processor (like Saxon 6.5).</p>
