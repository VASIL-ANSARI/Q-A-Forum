<p>You could put each image on a separate <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html" rel="nofollow">Layer</a> and tell your "eraser brush" to ignore the layer behind the one you want to erase using a <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LayerMask.html" rel="nofollow">LayerMask</a>. When the user clicks on the image, it erases part of the image on the first layer, but leaves the image behind it alone.</p>

<p>Credit to <em>Statement</em> from <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/8715/how-do-i-use-layermasks.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LayerMask, or any "Mask" in Computer Science, is an integer which uses
  its 32 bits to represent different flags. While it is an integer, the
  value doesn't mean anything useful numerically. What matters is which
  flags are turned on or off.</p>
  
  <p>In the case of LayerMask, each flag (each bit) represents one layer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The layers are selectable at the top of the inspector for each <code>GameObject</code>, you can add and name layers there, and also choose to view different combinations of them (see pic).</p>
