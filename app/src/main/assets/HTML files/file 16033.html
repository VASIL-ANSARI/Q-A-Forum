<p>Well that's clearly going to be a problem. There are more possible input strings than possible output values. In particular, every possible output value (a 12-digit string) is a possible input value. Therefore if all of those get unique output values, there can't possibly be any output values left for any <em>other</em> input values.</p>

<p>Of course you could always <em>record</em> each email address you encounter (so the first one ends up with 000000000000, the second gets 000000000001 etc) but that's a storage matter rather than hashing as such. You can't get to the output from <em>just</em> the input, without the backing store.</p>
