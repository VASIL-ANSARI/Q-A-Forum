<p>First running Arrangement1 gives me:
control1
control2
control3</p>

<p>Running arrangement2 gives me:
control1
movingcontrol
control2
control3</p>

<p>Your code, pure as it is posted, works for me.</p>

<p>However, recently i encountered a similar problem.  I was holding the controls in a list, then itterating through this to add them to the flowlayout.  Removing a single item from the list, then adding a new control would not insert the new control at the end, it would replace the vacant spot left by the deleted item.</p>

<p>So in summary, i suspect it's something you haven't posted, possibly where you store the controls themselves?  do you store them in an array or a List?</p>
