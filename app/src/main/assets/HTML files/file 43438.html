<p>I believe you can use this</p>

<p>You can set how old is the search by changing "INTERVAL XX MONTH".</p>

<p>Downside is: If you end up with a month without sales, that month will not be present in the query result.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
MONTH(`date`) AS period,
SUM(ammount) AS clicks
FROM `sales`
WHERE `date` &gt;= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 10 MONTH
GROUP BY period
</code></pre>
