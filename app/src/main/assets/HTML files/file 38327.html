<p>Edit the selected fields to suits your needs. Also if you want to display only one joke and its data you have to set the id of the joke you want as you did on the WHERE for instance.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT jokes.*, category.*, comments.* FROM jokes LEFT JOIN category ON jokes.category_id = category.category_id LEFT JOIN comments ON jokes.jokes_id = comments.joke_id
</code></pre>
