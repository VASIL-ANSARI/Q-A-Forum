<p>You can examine the originating address, and if it contains an @ (for instance) send an email to the recipient with the reply message.</p>

<p>By this i mean you can launch the email client of the phone with the predefined message. Is that your intention?</p>

<p>If it serves your purpose you can try this:</p>

<pre><code>Intent sendIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, "email text");
sendIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "Subject");
sendIntent.setType("message/rfc822");
startActivity(Intent.createChooser(sendIntent, "Title:"));
</code></pre>
