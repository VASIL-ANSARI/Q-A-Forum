<p>There's no serial ioctl for that in linux.  That ioctl is specific of the windows serial driver.  XON/XOFF protocol has no counters defined, so I cannot imagine what is this being used for. (perhaps Windows is counting the number of XOFF characters received, but just a speculation)</p>

<p>See <strong>termios(3)</strong> manual page of linux to see the ioctls defined for rs232 terminal control.</p>
