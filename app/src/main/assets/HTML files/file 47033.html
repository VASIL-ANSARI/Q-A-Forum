<p>How about slicing your 10-12 rows and then transposing that you have a 64 rows x 12 columns dataframe. This should be readable provided you don't have very large index names.</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Set max number of rows, 64 would be enough here but I'm trying to be safe
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(1000,64))
nstart = 100
# Slice 12 lines starting at nstart, and transpose that...
df.iloc[nstart:(nstart+13)].T
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sparing you the output here, but try running the above code.</p>
