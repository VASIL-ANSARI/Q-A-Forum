<p>Depending on your needs either approach is fine.</p>

<p>When deciding consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>if client have special hadnling for different types - in this case code would be easier to handle.</li>
<li>if there are localization concerns and if your service already provides localized responses (i.e. you return numbers/dates as localized strings, or you require culture to be passed in request and other strings are localized accordingly). If your server does not provide any locaization support - returing strings could be confsing.</li>
<li>if set of types is complete - if not retyring type as string (non-localized) may be better as it forces client to start handling "unknown" types earlier.</li>
</ul>
