<p>The query is used to select which A entities must be returned by the query. But the A entities will never be partial entities containing only a subset of their Bs. They will always be complete instances of A, reflecting the state of what A is in the database, and which B this A is related to.</p>

<p>BTW, even if this was possible (it's not, and explicitely forbidden by the JPA spec), your query would at least have to load the Bs as well, using a fetch join. Otherwise only the state of A is returned by the query, and the linked Bs are loaded lazily.</p>
