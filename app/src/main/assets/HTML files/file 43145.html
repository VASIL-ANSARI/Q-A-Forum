<p>In terms of <code>factory</code> you must return an object. Since you're not returning anything, it means that other services/controllers can't use this service.</p>

<p>If you're just checking for Authentication, it must be inside your Auth service which must be an IIFE function. Which will check and redirect the user.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>In either Auth/Ref service, create a IIFE</p>

<pre><code>(function() {
var authData = Ref.getAuth();

   if (authData) {console.log('already logged in with ' + authData.uid)} else {

      return Auth.$authAnonymously({rememberMe: true}).then(redirect, showError);

      function redirect() {
      $location.path('/account');
    }

      function showError(err) {
      Login.err = err;
    }
  }
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Else insert the code inside <code>init()</code> method and call that in your service. SO this will run only once.</p>

<p>You must use service when you want to expose a singleton interface for other parts of your application to make use of.</p>
