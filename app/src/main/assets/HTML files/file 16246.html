<p>Something like this?</p>

<pre><code>var x = [
    [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4,5,6]
    ],
    [
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]   
];

alert(x[0][1][2]);
</code></pre>

<p>This is one reason why JavaScript's variable syntax isn't always what it's cracked up to be. Compare to Java:</p>

<pre><code>String[][][] x = new String[5][5][5];
</code></pre>
