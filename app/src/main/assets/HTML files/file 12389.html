<p>None of your objects is set as the delegate so the delegate is nil - messages sent to nil are silenced. Nothing happens.  </p>

<p>If it is not a problem, put the NSLog in:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) mainMenuViewLibrary:(MainMenuView*)controller withString:(NSString*)string;
</code></pre>

<p>in your WorkspaceView and check whether the method is called.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
