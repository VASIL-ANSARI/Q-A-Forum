<p>One thing that can have a huge impact is how you allocate memory to MySQL for you given usage pattern.</p>

<p>The relative size of your query cache, innodb buffer, etc should be tuned for your specific needs.</p>

<p>Here are a few links that helped me resolve the same type of issue.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.mysqltuner.com/" rel="nofollow">MySQLTuner</a> is a great (free) tuning diagnosis tool written perl.</p>

<p>Make sure you have enabled the slow query log and review it periodically.  As your data volume grows, things that used to be fast will be slow.  After you re-tune your memory parameters, fast queries can also become slow and vice versa as you shift resources from one type of query to another.</p>

<p>Even though your queries look good to you, make sure and run the Explain command to verify that the indexes are being used.</p>

<p>Additionally I purchased MySQL Enterprise from Sun and find their included performance monitor and query analyzer very useful.</p>
