<p>Look at the documentation for <code>UIUserNotificationSettings</code>. Its signature has changed in Swift 3 as has the values for the types.</p>

<p>You need:</p>

<pre><code>let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [.alert, .badge , .sound], categories: nil)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course if you are only supporting iOS 10 and later, then you shouldn't use <code>UIUserNotificationSettings</code> at all since it is now deprecated. Use <code>UNNotificationSettings</code> instead. But if you are still supporting iOS 9 or earlier, then using <code>UIUserNotificationSettings</code> is fine as long as you change to the updated syntax.</p>
