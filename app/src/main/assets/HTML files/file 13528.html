<p>All your SQL needs are correct parentheses:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE (column1 = "$value" OR column2 = "$value" OR column3 = "$value") AND
      (column1 = "$value2" OR column2 = "$value2" OR column3 = "$value2")
</code></pre>

<p>"AND"s get evaluated before "OR"s.</p>

<p>By the way, having to search through multiple columns indicates a possible shortcoming in your data model.  You might want a table structure that places each word in a separate row.</p>
