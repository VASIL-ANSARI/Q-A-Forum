<p>I think your problem is with IIS, in regards with what permission it has to folders(eg. project folders).So check your application which application pool its in. So you can give the appropriate rights to the account in that pool. By default in IIS7, the account is NETWORK SERVICE.</p>

<p>Then you would essentially go to the relevant folders and allow read/write access or whichever needed to the account. </p>
