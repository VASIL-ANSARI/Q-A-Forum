<p>I figured it out - in addition to the code I pasted above, I also had an API key attached to the URL (which I didn't want to share for obvious reasons). </p>

<p>But Google doesn't seem to allow you to associate a localhost environment with an API key, and was therefore rejecting the request. </p>

<p>Ditching the API key until it goes to a production server is the only solution I can think of.</p>
