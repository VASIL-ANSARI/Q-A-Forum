<p>Is there a specific reason you want to use Eclipse? For a beginner, probably the easiest way to get started with C on Windows is to use the free <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition</a>. It's a full IDE with built in compiler and debugger, and can do everything you might need to do for learning C.</p>

<p>Although you have Eclipse and Cygwin right now, neither of those components actually include a <em>compiler</em> unless you specifically download that too. With that environment, you have to manually put the pieces together before you can compile and run your code.</p>
