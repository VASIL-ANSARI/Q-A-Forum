<p>I made some changes to the Settings class (that comes with the Android source) and trying to create a shadow of the one the methods that the Settings class creates which is in the same Settings app. However turns out that Robolectric does not allow creating of Shadows of Android classes within the same package as the Class under test. So ultimately I had to resort to creating a shadow that is outside of the Settings package.</p>
