<p>It looks like <code>boost/strong_typedef.hpp</code> directory is a historical artifact.</p>

<p>The lack of explicit initialization of the <code>t</code> member was a bug fixed in <code>boost/serialization/strong_typedef.hpp</code> a couple years ago in svn revision 71183. See <a href="https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5182">the bug ticket</a>.</p>

<p>In Boost's Subversion trunk, <a href="http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/trunk/boost/strong_typedef.hpp"><code>boost/strong_typedef.hpp</code></a> is a largely empty file that says:</p>

<pre><code>#error "This header is deprecated. Please use: boost/serialization/strong_typedef.hpp"
</code></pre>

<p>That change, r48575, was made back in 2008 - I don't know why it has never been merged into a release. Maybe because it would break users without a lot of upside or maybe it's an oversight. That same change (r48575) was what created <code>boost/serialization/strong_typedef.hpp</code> in trunk.  </p>

<p>If they don't want to break existing users, then maybe the deprecated file should just include the file in <code>boost/serialization</code> so there's a single, canonical implementation. In any case, it would appear that if you can avoid using <code>boost/strong_typedef.hpp</code> in favor of using the one in <code>serialization</code>, that's what I'd suggest.</p>

<p>As a side note, keep in mind that a year ago the author of Boost Serialization (and <code>strong_typedef.hpp</code>), Bob Ramey, <a href="https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/6501">posted a comment in another bug ticket</a> about <code>strong_typedef.hpp</code> that you might find interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't think the serialization library uses this any more. Of course it's still in there. I have no idea if anyone uses it.</p>
