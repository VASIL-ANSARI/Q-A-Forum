<blockquote>
  <p>Although MySQL will automatically initiate a transaction on your
  behalf when you issue DML statements, you should issue an explicit
  START TRANSACTION statement in your program to mark the beginning of
  your transaction.</p>
  
  <p>It's possible that your stored program might be run within a server in
  which autocommit is set to TRUE, and by issuing an explicit START
  TRANSACTION statement you ensure that autocommit does not remain
  enabled during your transaction. START TRANSACTION also aids
  readability by clearly delineating the scope of your transactional
  code.</p>
