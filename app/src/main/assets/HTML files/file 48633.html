<p>As far I know, at this moment it is possible to do it only by reload page. It will reload the code (HTML, js, CSS), but the history of WebView will not be cleared. By that I mean that if your app start on "<a href="http://start" rel="nofollow">http://start</a>", and you are currently on url "<a href="http://a/b">http://a/b</a>" and do reload, you will be now on "<a href="http://start" rel="nofollow">http://start</a>", but click on back will not terminate app, you will be redirected on "<a href="http://a/b">http://a/b</a>". If that is not problem, then relaod is your solution. Regards.</p>
