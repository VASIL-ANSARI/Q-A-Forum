<blockquote>
  <p><code>response.xpath('\\div').execute()</code></p>

<p>This line is just wrong. First of all you use front-slashes instead of back-slashes here. Also <code>execute()</code> is not a method of <code>Selector</code> or <code>SelectorList</code> objects (those are the values that are returned by response.xpath() method).</p>

<p>Try: <code>response.xpath("//div").extract()</code></p>

<p>Other than your code being broken it's a good practice to turn off javascript and run <code>view(response)</code> to see exactly what your spider is seeing. In some cases your spider might not even see <code>"//div[@id='name']"</code> because it's loaded in with javascript.</p>
