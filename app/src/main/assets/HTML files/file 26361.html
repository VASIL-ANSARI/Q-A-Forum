<p>EDIT: I misread the question and talked about the wrong rectangle. This is what i meant:</p>

<p>Basically, you just need to scale the purple rectangle. Find ut where it is defined, then put it onto a canvas and do the following:</p>

<pre><code>float screenWidth = /*get the width of your screen here*/;
float xScale = rect.width / screenWidth;

float screenHeight = /*get the height of your screen here*/;
float yScale = rect.height / screenWidth;

canvas.setScaleX(xScale);
canvas.setScaleY(yScale);
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the coordinates will be translated properly.</p>

<p>SECOND EDIT (in response to your comment): You can also do this with views, if you like.
Have fun.</p>
