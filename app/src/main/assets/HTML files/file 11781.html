<p>For 1.7 it seems there are some major changes.
You will probably be able to match your exam when it's out. It can be moving fast according to the oracle strategy and their website is not really intuitive  neither always up to date so it may sometimes be hard to find what you need.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the exams aren't usually released just after the JDK. It can takes some time for the guys to make that exam. And if you want to prepare it seriously, you will have to wait for a book, which is probably not written yet...</p>

<p>Remember too that Java 1.8 will follow Java 1.7 very soon, so perhaps in would be a good idea to pass as soon as possible a Java 1.6 SCJP and then perhaps it 2 years upgrade to Java 1.8? 
During this time you'll have all the time you want to prepare other certifications, and remember that Java 1.6 wasn't updated for a long time so a lot of projects will probably stay in that version.</p>
