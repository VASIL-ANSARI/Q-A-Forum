<p>A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>The element has been deleted entirely. </li>
<li>The element is no longer attached to the DOM.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes there is a possibility that element which you are looking for is visible but you see StaleElementException just because of above 2 reasons (mainly). </p>

<p>How to deal with it see <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/exceptions/stale_element_reference.jsp" rel="nofollow">this</a></p>
