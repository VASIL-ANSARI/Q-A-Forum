<p>You can mix libs compiled for x86 and for arm only if they don't depend on each other (ie. if they don't call each other directly without going through Java). </p>

<p>So gradle will not mix libs targeting different architectures, it's really your responsibility to do that and the most simple way is indeed to copy your <code>libLibraryA.so</code> to an x86 folder.</p>

<p>But doing this is a <em>workaround</em> that will work only on retail Intel-based devices. I don't recommend that: the right thing to do would still be getting a version of <code>libLibraryA.so</code> compiled for x86 and putting it inside the x86 folder.</p>

<p>update: as said in my comment below, loading an arm lib from the app's x86 folder isn't supported anymore with Android 5.0.</p>
