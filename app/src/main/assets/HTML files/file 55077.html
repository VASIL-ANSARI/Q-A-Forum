<p>Can you provide the javascript that is actually creating the DOM elements?  I imagine you are inserting the the values from the JSON and then inserting that into the DOM, something like:</p>

<pre><code>options.each(function(){
   var option = "&lt;option " + this + "&gt;" + this + "&lt;/option&gt;";
   // append the option into select
})
</code></pre>

<p>Update:
@ClosDesign has the correct answer.</p>
