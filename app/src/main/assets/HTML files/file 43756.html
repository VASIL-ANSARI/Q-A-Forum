<p>In the second case, the elements of the outer list are themselves lists, that is, mutable objects. In Python mutable objects are assigned (and thus copied) by reference, so all the 41 elements of the outer list are identical and reference the same inner list.</p>

<p>The elements of the inner list are floats, and these (as other immutable objects) are copied by value and behave as expected.</p>
