<p>You have to define your own user choice field for lab admin.</p>

<pre><code>from django import forms
from django.contrib import admin


class UserChoiceField(forms.ModelChoiceField):
    def label_from_instance(self, obj):
        return obj.last_name

# Now you have to hook this field up to lab admin.

class LabAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request=None, **kwargs):
        if db_field.name == 'responsible':
            kwargs['form_class'] = UserChoiceField
        return super(LabAdmin, self).formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<p>Something like that. I didn't tested it so there may be some typos. Hope this helps!</p>
