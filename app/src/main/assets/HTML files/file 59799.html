<p>So as I understand you just want to accept numbers or?</p>

<pre><code>const regex = /([0-9])/g;
regex.test("123"); //true
regex.test("123a"); //false
</code></pre>

<p>What you can also do is except every "letter":</p>

<pre><code>const regex = /([^A-Za-z])/g;
</code></pre>

<p>But be careful using this! It also recognizes whitespaces and other symbols.</p>

<p>Or are you talking about unicode chars? That could be a little bit tricky with javascript.</p>
