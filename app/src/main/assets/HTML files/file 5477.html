<p>Each controller action is executed in a separate request, so you are losing the values in between.</p>

<p>You probably need to use <code>session</code>, or better yet <code>flash</code> to store the title across requests.</p>

<pre><code>def edit
  flash[:title] = @title = "Edit account"
  ...
end

def update
  ...
  if (flash[:title] == "Location")
    redirect_to wsp_location_path
  else
    redirect_to edit_wsp_path
  end
end
</code></pre>
