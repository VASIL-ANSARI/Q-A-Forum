<p>I would propose</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You could use a hash table which gives O(1) expected time</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding the maximum, you could store it in attribute and be aware at each insertion if the maximum changes. With the deletion is some more complicated because if the maximum is deleted, then you must perform a linear search, but this only would happen if the maximum is deleted. Any other element could be deleted in O(1) expected time</p></li>
</ol>
