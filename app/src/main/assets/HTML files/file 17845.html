<blockquote>
  <p>A Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) represents one of the oldest and best-known pseudorandom number generator algorithms.[1] The theory behind them is easy to understand, and they are easily implemented and fast.</p>
  
  <p>The generator is defined by the recurrence relation:</p>
  
  <p>X_{n+1} = ( a * X_n + c ) mod m </p>
