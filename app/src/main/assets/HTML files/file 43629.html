<p>To restrict / filter the query output after aggregation has been performed, use a <code>HAVING</code> clause.</p>

<p>The <code>WHERE</code> clause is used to restrict / filter the query output BEFORE aggregation is performed (so if you had some rows you did not want to include in the COUNT, you can use the WHERE clause to filter them out).</p>

<p>Also you should not be using <code>DISTINCT</code> here, it will REMOVE all the duplicates before calculating the COUNT.</p>
