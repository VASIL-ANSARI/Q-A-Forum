<p>Your current program is little more than a large static main method with a few small supporting static methods. Since this code is very linear, as most console programs are, and since it has no OOP-compliant classes, there is no way to directly convert or re-use any of this code to use in an event-driven GUI. I suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extract out the logic or brains behind your program into true OOP classes with instance fields, constructors and non-static methods.</li>
<li>Only after doing this should you consider creating a GUI to display the logic.</li>
<li>Read a decent book on OOP and Java such as "Thinking in Java" as this will help you think and code in an OOP way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-GUI Classes to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stock classes with String name, double (or BigDecimal) value, String abbreviated name</li>
<li>Player that holds a String for name, a <code>HashMap&lt;Stock, Integer&gt;</code> for Stocks held and number of shares.</li>
<li>Market where a player can buy and sell Stocks.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>The bottom line is that there is no one single simple way to "convert" this code to a GUI, and instead you should focus on learning Java fundamentals, and experiment with your code while learning (for that's how you learn).</p>
