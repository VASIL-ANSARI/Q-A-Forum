<p>I don't think you can do this automatically, but there is a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/NSAttributedString_UIKit_Additions/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSAttributedString/size" rel="nofollow"><code>size</code></a> method of NSAttributedString which you can use to check if your string is too big, and adjust yourself if required. </p>
