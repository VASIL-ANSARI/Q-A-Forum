<p>I suppose that would depend on how complicated your query is. If it's a simple query that returns instantly and is only being run by a single service every 10 seconds, I doubt it'll be an issue, but I know nothing of your environment so don't hold me to that.</p>

<p>If you're looking for another solution altogether, you could look at a messaging architecture instead of polling.</p>

<p>Basically in this scenario, whatever system you have that's adding the work to the database in the first place can fire off a message to your service to let it know that there's work to do. Then your service doesn't need to poll anything, it just sits and waits for a notification that it needs to check the database. 
Alternatively, you could include the work to do in the message itself and let the service process it and store what needs to be stored in the database itself.</p>

<p>If you're interested in messaging, take a look into NServiceBus. It's basically a wrapper around MSMQ and will open your mind to a whole new world of ideas concerning inter-connected systems.</p>

<p>The options are endless really.</p>
