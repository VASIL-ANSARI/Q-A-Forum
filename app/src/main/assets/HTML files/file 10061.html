<p>this is just a guess since I'm not up on OF on Linux, but I think OF needs access to the low-level ALSA device in order to get the RT functionality. As such, it can't share the device with PulseAudio (or whatever they're using these days) which allows the audio device to be shared between apps. You could try looking at JACK to multiplex between PulseAudio and your ALSA program.</p>
