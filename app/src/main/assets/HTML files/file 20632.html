<p>As you can see in <a href="https://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow">Firebug's</a> JavaScript console, you have two errors.</p>

<pre><code>ReferenceError: Cufon is not defined
Error: Permission denied to access property 'toString'
</code></pre>

<p>You also have similar errors on Chrome's developer tool, but Firefox stops working and doesn't load the rest of the resources after encountering an error.</p>

<p>The solution for you is to fix the errors listed in the js console in the Firefox/Firebug developer tool. Then your site will work correctly in each browser.</p>
