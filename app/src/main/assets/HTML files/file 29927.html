<p>I think you need something like this</p>

<pre><code>WHERE (@Site = '1' AND Site IN ('C150','C151'))
OR    (@Site='2' AND Site IN ('C161','C162'))
</code></pre>

<p>Not clear in your question, but I think you have a <code>@Site</code> var and a <code>Site</code> column.</p>

<p>Cause I don't see how <code>@Site</code> could be equal to <code>1</code> and in <code>C150</code>,.</p>
