<p>Only for your number 2, you can check out <a href="http://www.genexus.com/xev2beta" rel="nofollow">GeneXus X Evolution 2</a>. The main purpose of <a href="http://www.genexus.com/evolution" rel="nofollow">GeneXus</a> is to design business applications in a custom IDE, and generate what's needed for each platform you want to target.</p>

<p>The current stable release is the Evolution 1, and targets lots of platforms.</p>

<p>The Evolution 2 is still in development (a beta build is already released, take a look at #XEv2Beta on twitter). When released, It'll add support for the most common smartdevices platforms (Apple, Android, BlackBerry), but later they plan to add support for other platforms too.</p>
