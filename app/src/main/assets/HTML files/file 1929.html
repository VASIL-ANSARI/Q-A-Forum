<p>To my knowledge, no, <code>ejb3=true</code> in <a href="https://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/tools/reference/en/html_single/#d0e1193" rel="nofollow"><code>hbm2java</code></a> means using EJB3/Hibernate Annotations. Quoting the <a href="https://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=994243" rel="nofollow">generating annotated pojos</a> thread in Hibernate's forums:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ejb3 means use JPA and Hibernate annotations; we try and generate everything we can with JPA but some things require hibernate annotations.</p>

<p>Maybe have a look at the Jira issue but in the current state, you can't.</p>
