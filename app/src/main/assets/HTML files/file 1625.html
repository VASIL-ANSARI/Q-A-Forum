<p>I don't really have an answer for your question, but I just wanted to say that I don't think you should ever leave off the units unless you're specifying a value of 0. It's easier to read and there's no guesswork (for both the browser and someone else who may be reading your CSS).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Pulled this from a forum. They are the CSS properties that accept integer values for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html" rel="nofollow">CSS 2.1 specifications</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>z-index</li>
<li>font-weight</li>
<li>line-height</li>
<li>counter-reset</li>
<li>counter-increment</li>
<li>volume</li>
<li>stress</li>
<li>pitch-range</li>
<li>richness</li>
</ul>
