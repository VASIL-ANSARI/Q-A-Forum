<p>It would actually be much easier to reverse the haystack than the needle.  And since <code>Matcher</code> takes a <code>CharSequence</code> instead of a <code>String</code>, you can do so with trivial overhead by simply wrapping the <code>String</code> (see the answers to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3109914/reverse-a-string-in-java-in-o1">Reverse a string in Java, in O(1)?</a>).</p>

<p>With this knowledge, you can create an alternate version of <code>Matcher</code> that can appear to be reversing the pattern, but is really just reversing the input.</p>
