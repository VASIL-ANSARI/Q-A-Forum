<p>First: you cannot derive from an unknown, or even a partially known
class.  In order to define <code>King</code>, you must first include <code>Figure.h</code>
(supposing <code>King</code> is defined in a different file).</p>

<p>More generally, as to how to organize the code, there is no one
definitive answer.  Personally, in the one particular case (where the 
number of derived classes is well defined and strictly bound), I'd
probably cut corners and define all of them in <code>Figure.h</code>, but there are
very good arguments for using a separate header for each&mdash;if
nothing else, you don't have to include the headers for the individual
figures except in files where they are created.  Another solution would
be to use factory functions for the figures, and define the derived
classes in the source file which implements the factory functions.</p>
