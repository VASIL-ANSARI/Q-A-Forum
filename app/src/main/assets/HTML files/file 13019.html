<p>One quick correction that should help is your <code>[super dealloc]</code> should <strong>always</strong> be the last statement in your <code>dealloc</code>. </p>

<p>Also, since you are doing CoreData operations on a background thread (via <code>NSOperationQueue</code>), make sure you are creating your <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> for your background thread object <strong>while in the background thread</strong>. Do not create it on one thread and assign it to an object that will run in a different thread, or you will have all sorts of issues.</p>

<p>When you get your <code>NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification</code> notification, you need to do the merge on the same thread that the context you are merging <strong>into</strong> belongs on. More than likely this will be your main context in (it sounds like) your app delegate, which means it is on the main thread.</p>
