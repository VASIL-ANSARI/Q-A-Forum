<p>I'm not familiar with the technical details of HTAs, but if they run the JavaScript using Microsoft's JScript, and if they do so without the usual browser-based security, you could use the various objects available to Windows Scripting Host, including (most notably) the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa242706%28v=vs.60%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>FileSystemObject</code></a> in order to enumerate the files and directories.</p>

<p>The rest is just straight-forward DOM manipulation, and if you're allowed to use jQuery in the HTA (you have the <code>jquery</code> tag on your question), there are plenty of treeview plug-ins for it, such as <a href="http://www.jstree.com/" rel="nofollow">jsTree</a>.</p>
