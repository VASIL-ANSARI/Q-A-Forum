<p>wxPython 2.8.12 contains an older version of pubsub.</p>

<p>In your code it is not clear which version you error on, in other words which import worked?  I guess it is the one from wx.lib which with 2.8.12 would be the old version of pubsub.</p>

<p>I would suggest to use either a newer version of wxPython, e.g. 3.0.2 or use the stand alone pypubsub, but if you want to stick with 2.8 then the doc shows you what needs to be done.
