<p>It's called the <a href="https://learntech.imsu.ox.ac.uk/blog/?p=494" rel="nofollow">star hack</a>. It's a way of resetting a CSS attribute for only IE7 or below, because these browsers have a bug that let them ignore the star and apply the attribute named after the star. Other browsers will see <code>*[attribute name]</code> and consider it malformed or unknown, and ignore it.</p>

<p>In your case, it will only apply <code>margin-left: -487px;</code> on IE7 or below; other browsers/versions of IE will ignore that.</p>

<p>This is generally considered poor form or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell" rel="nofollow">code smell</a>. </p>
