<p>The problem is solved now: </p>

<p>As AlexD mentioned, the problem was double destruction of an object. I had these statements in my code: </p>

<pre><code>namespace_top_of_FDD::FDD_Ptr_Object-&gt;~FDD();
    delete namespace_top_of_FDD::FDD_Ptr_Object;
    namespace_top_of_FDD::FDD_Ptr_Object=NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem was that, explicit call to destructor with <code>namespace_top_of_FDD::FDD_Ptr_Object-&gt;~FDD();</code> and de-allocation with <code>delete namespace_top_of_FDD::FDD_Ptr_Object;</code> were conflicting with each other. The explicit call to object destructor <strong>is a bad idea</strong> in many cases. The solution was to remove the explicit call to object destructor, so now I just need to de-allocate: </p>

<pre><code>delete namespace_top_of_FDD::FDD_Ptr_Object;
    namespace_top_of_FDD::FDD_Ptr_Object=NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the code works perfect. </p>
