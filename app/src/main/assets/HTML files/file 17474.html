<p><code>Interface</code> contains no code.</p>

<p>Split your interface in many specific interfaces declaring and initializing their own constants.</p>

<p>This will follow the <code>Interface Segregation Principle</code> where a class doesn't have to be bored by some useless constants or methods.</p>

<p>Of course, Java let classes implement several interfaces at once. So if you have specific interfaces to mix up for one concrete class, this would be pretty easy.</p>
