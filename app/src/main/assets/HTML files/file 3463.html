<p>Once you do a <code>GroupBy()</code>, you're no longer dealing with your entities -- they have been... well, grouped, so the <code>var</code> in <code>var grouped = ...</code> is now of type <code>IEnumerable&lt;IGrouping&lt;...</code>. As such, the methods available on the items in the <code>grouped</code> collection are the methods of the <code>IGrouping&lt;&gt;</code> interface.</p>

<p>You may want to <code>OrderBy()</code> instead of <code>GroupBy()</code>, depending on your need, or you'll need to iterate on two levels: iterate over each group in <code>grouped</code>, and over each member within each of those.</p>

<p>Once you are inside of a particular <code>IGrouping&lt;&gt;</code>, you should have access to the properties for which you are looking.</p>
