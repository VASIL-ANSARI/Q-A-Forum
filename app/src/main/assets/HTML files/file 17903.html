<p>You can't really put a callback function on an integer, however, you could expose your integer as a property and call a function from the property setter. Look at this example:</p>

<pre><code>private int _myInteger = 0;

private int MyInteger {
    get
    {
         return _myInteger;
    } 
    set 
    {
        _myInteger = value;
        if (_myInteger &lt;= MAX_INPUT)
            MyCallBackFunction();
    }
}

private void Right_Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    MyInteger = MyInteger + 1;
    // Do your other stuff here
}

private void MyCallBackFunction()
{
    // This function executes when your integer is &lt;= MAX_VALUE
    // Do Whatever here
    display_result();
}
</code></pre>

<p>What this is doing is exposing your integer through a private property. As long as you set the property through the setter (e.g. use the <code>MyInteger = MyInteger + 1;</code> syntax), you can have your setter check the condition and execute your call back function.</p>
