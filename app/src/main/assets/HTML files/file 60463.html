<p>There is no limiting factor with iOS to develop VOIP based app.</p>

<p>Well, about notifying user ( iOS User ) about incoming VOIP call in background / kill state, you need to handle with push kit ( Silent push notification ).</p>

<p>About users are online / offline, it would be better to get flag from sockets, not from API call each time.</p>

<p>Let me know if i could help you any more in VOIP based app.</p>
