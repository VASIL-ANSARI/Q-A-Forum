<p>Interesting question. You should try a broadcast receiver with appropriate filters or a background service. There may be a better approach, just my initial thought.</p>

<p>BroadcastReceiver

(if the action of sending takes too long, you may prefer to couple this with a wakeful broadcast receiver AND delegating the work to an Intent Service: <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/run-background-service/create-service.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/training/run-background-service/create-service.html</a>) </p>
