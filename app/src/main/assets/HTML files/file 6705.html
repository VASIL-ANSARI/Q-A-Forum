<p>Red indicates the file is missing (or XCode is looking in the wrong place for it). Have a look in your project folder to see if the file is around somewhere. If not, you'll need to restore from a backup or recreate it.</p>

<p>If you can find it, copy it into your project folder (if necessary) then select the file, choose Get Info from the File Menu, click the Choose button next to "Path:" and locate it, and you should be set.</p>
