<p>This may not be what you're looking for, but if I needed to do this quick&amp;dirty, I would:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a separate WPF application (so I could use the built-in document handling)</li>
<li>Give the service the ability to interact with the desktop (note that you don't actually have to show anything on the desktop, or be logged in for this to work)</li>
<li>Have the service run the application, and give it the data to print.</li>
</ol>

<p>You could probably also jigger this to print from a web browser that you run from the service (though I'd recommend building your own shell IE, rather than using a full browser).</p>

<p>For a more detailed (also free) solution, your best bet is probably to manually format the document yourself (using GDI+ to do the layout for you). This is tedious, error prone, time consuming, and wastes a lot of paper during development, but also gives you the most control over what's going to the printer.</p>
