<p>I think you have two issues here. Your problem with not finding the equivalent to content() stems from the fact that Smarty handles inheritance of templates differently. The <code>{ $title }</code> not working as expected comes from the whitespace after and before the accolades. Change it to <code>{$title}</code>. </p>
