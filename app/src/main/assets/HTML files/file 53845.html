<p>As there are 3 separate broadcast senders so i think the only way to stop this behaviour is make a shared object that the first sender (or receiver) will create with some sort of timestamp and the other will check and if the object is present - stop sending anything to server.
That can be achieved with:
world readable/writable preference (i think it marked as deprecated since api 17..)
or 
some sort of file on sdcard</p>
