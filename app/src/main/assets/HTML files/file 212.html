<p>Since I don't know how your factory method looks like, all I can advise right now is to </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Check to see the object is the correct concrete implementation you were looking for:</p>

<pre><code>IMyInterface fromFactory = factory.create(...);  
Assert.assertTrue(fromFactory instanceof MyInterfaceImpl1);
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You can check if the factory setup the concrete instances with valid instance variables.</p></li>
</ol>
