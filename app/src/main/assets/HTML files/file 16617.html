<p>Because what you are doing is constructing a <code>&lt;script src=...&gt;</code> element, with the <code>src</code> attribute dynamically generated, it's not possible to use POST. All HTTP requests use GET. What you <em>may</em> be able to do instead is encode your querystring to make it shorter. The server-side processing can decode it to send the right script file. </p>

<p>For example, you don't need <code>&amp;usario=</code> when you could call that <code>&amp;u=</code> because your server-side process shouldn't need it to be called <code>usario</code>. You've saved five bytes just by doing that.</p>

<p>You could encode the values to make them shorter, and decode them server-side. I've no idea what the data actually is; this may not be practical.</p>
