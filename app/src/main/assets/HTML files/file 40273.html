<p>I'd certainly expect a bad access if you were not using ARC, in which case a dangling pointer is extremely likely. </p>

<p>Regardless, I would make sure that <code>didEndElement</code> sets <code>element</code> variable to <code>nil</code> at the end of the method (or else you may end up with unintended extra characters in <code>title</code> and <code>link</code> values). This also minimizes the incidental and unnecessary references to the <code>elementName</code> you received in <code>didStartElement</code> beyond the point that you actually needed it.</p>

<p>Personally, if I were going to use the <code>elementName</code> passed to me in <code>didStartElement</code> beyond the scope of that method, I'd be inclined to either <code>copy</code> the value passed to me or use some other state variable to keep track of whether I was parsing <code>title</code> or <code>link</code> or whatever. </p>
