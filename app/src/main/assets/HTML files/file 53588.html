<p>I know this is an old question, but I hope people having the same problem will be helped quicker this way. </p>

<p>We had this problem, debug=true showed us what was wrong. The encoding wasn't correct for bcrypt. This should fix it.</p>

<pre><code>passwd = bcrypt.hashpw(str(request.form['passwd']), bcrypt.gensalt())
</code></pre>
