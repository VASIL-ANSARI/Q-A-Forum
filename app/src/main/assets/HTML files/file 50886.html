<p><code>ma</code> and <code>std</code> are <code>pandas.Series</code> objects in your example. The reason is, that <code>np.mean</code> applied to a <code>pandas.DataFrame</code> returns a <code>pandas.Series</code>.
However, mlab.normpdf(x,ma,std) expects float values or numpy arrays as inputs.
You could simply convert <code>ma</code> and <code>std</code> to floats by <code>ma = float(ma)</code>.
I would not suggest to use <code>int(ma)</code> as you pointed out in your comment, because that would cut away the decimals.</p>
