<p><code>requests</code> stores the request headers in a <code>dict</code>, which means every header can only appear once. So without making changes to the <code>requests</code> library itself it won't be possible to send multiple headers with the same name.</p>

<p>However, if the server is <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2" rel="nofollow">HTTP1.1 compliant</a>, it <em>must</em> be able to accept the same as one header with a comma separated list of the single values.</p>
