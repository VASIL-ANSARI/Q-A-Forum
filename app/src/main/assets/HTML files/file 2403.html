<p>The only good way that I know of doing this is to write a .NET C++ wrapper class using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa712574%28VS.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><strong>Managed C++ Extensions</strong></a>, and within the .NET C++ object call your native C++ code.  There are functions in the managed extensions to convert a System.String to a char* or any other type of unmanaged string.</p>

<p>Basically you create a .NET class using C++ and expose it from an assembly, and internally to that assembly you can call your native C++ code.  The other way is to add a pure C function to your C++ code using P/Invoke and then call your C code from C# and have your C function call your C++ code.  This will work, but I tend to try to use managed code as much as possible.</p>
