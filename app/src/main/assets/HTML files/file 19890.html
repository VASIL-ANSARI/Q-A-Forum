<p>I've reduced the amount of stutter on my animations by following these rules listed in order of importance when reducing stutter:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't initiate animations in <code>onCreate</code>, <code>onStart</code> or <code>onResume</code>.</li>
<li>Initiate animations on user events such as <code>onClick</code> and disable touch events until animation is complete.</li>
<li>Don't initiate more than 2 animations simultaneously</li>
</ol>
