<p>The problem with using GUIDs as a PK in InnoDB isn't just the fact that GUID distribution is random.  It's that records in InnoDB are stored in primary key order.  That means in the table design you're talking about, InnoDB is going to be constantly moving data about in an effort to sort your GUIDs.  You should use a translation table that maps the GUIDs to int or bigint and use that as the PK.</p>
