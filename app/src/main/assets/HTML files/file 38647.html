<p>You can't do that in a JavaScript object literal. Create the object and then add the property as a separate statement:</p>

<pre><code>var write = {Titulo: title };
write[i] = {Stock: stock, Price: price, date: date};
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that <code>.map()</code> will pass your callback function the array index as the second parameter, so you don't have to maintain your own counter.</p>
