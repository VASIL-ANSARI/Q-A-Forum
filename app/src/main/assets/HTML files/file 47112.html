<p>To achieve this you would need to pass the class of the Domain object you are looking for. Something like the following would work:</p>

<pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; T convert(Object source, Class&lt;T&gt; targetType)
        throws InstantiationException,
        IllegalAccessException,
        InvocationTargetException {
    if (source == null)
        return null;
    T target = targetType.newInstance();
    BeanUtils.copyProperties(source, target);
    return target;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With that being said, as it appears, you are already using Spring. You could try registering a special converter with Spring's<code>ConversionService</code> (Auto wire conversion service) and you can use the <code>convert</code> method to achieve the same result).</p>

<p>Please note that you should add some checks to make sure that each the entity and the domain objects are compatible otherwise you'd end up with a big mess and your code would be error prone.</p>
