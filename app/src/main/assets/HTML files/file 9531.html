<p>You could try output buffering:</p>

<pre><code>// before any output is generated
ob_start();

// all your code

// end of the script
echo ob_get_clean();
</code></pre>

<p>This will capture all output generated to a buffer, and dump it when the script has completed. However, this means that no content will be sent until your queries have completed. Perhaps another consideration you should make is optimizing your database queries as best as possible, to reduce the bottleneck impact of database hits.</p>
