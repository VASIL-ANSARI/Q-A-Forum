<p>So far as I know, there's nothing specific to ASP.NET, and you are right (at least in 2008) about it not using referenced stylesheets.</p>

<p>These may be of use to you, however:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.positioniseverything.net/</a> - Position is Everything, an excellent CSS resource.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/topics/code/css/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alistapart.com/topics/code/css/</a> - A List Apart's CSS section, advice on specific techniques.</p>

<p>Essentially, what you want is 4 main divs for your sight: header, footer, menu, content.  Position each div as you like, and then adjust the positioning of their children, which most browsers will treat as 'position relative to my parent' (unless it's absolute, IIRC).</p>
