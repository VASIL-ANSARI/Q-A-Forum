<p>Maybe take a look at this post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39831093/linq-to-sql-submit-changes-or-refreshsystem-data-linq-refreshmode-overwrite">Linq to sql submit changes () or .Refresh(System.Data.Linq.RefreshMode.OverwriteCurrentValues, &quot;entity to update&quot;)</a></p>

<p>Basically whats being said there is : Refresh is pretty much never needed because normally you are making all writes through entities. This means that the entities are always up to date.</p>

<p>Hopefully this anwers your question.</p>
