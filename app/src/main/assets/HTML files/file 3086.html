<p>I would just add the certificate to the cacerts file of the JDK running your app. If you do this then you won't have to do anything else. The code you have above wouldn't be required. You add the certificate to the keystore by running a command similar to below:</p>

<pre><code>C:/&lt;jdk-version/bin/keytool -import -alias myalias -file mycert.crt -keystore C:/&lt;jdk-version&gt;/jre/lib/security/cacerts
</code></pre>
