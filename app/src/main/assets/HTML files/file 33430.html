<p>I can think of three possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can either return a value that the method should never return under normal circumstances, such as <code>-1</code> in your case.</li>
<li>You can change the return type to <code>Integer</code> and return a <code>null</code>. Automatic boxing and unboxing can simplify the work needed to make this change.</li>
<li>You can throw an exception.</li>
</ol>
