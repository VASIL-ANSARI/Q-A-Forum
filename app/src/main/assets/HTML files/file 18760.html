<p>You can't initialise an <code>int bla[2][3]</code> with an <code>int*</code> (what <code>foo</code> becomes in that context).</p>

<p>You can achieve that effect by declaring a pointer to arrays of <code>int</code>,</p>

<pre><code>int (*bla)[3] = (int (*)[3])&amp;foo[0];
</code></pre>

<p>but be sure that the dimensions actually match, or havoc will ensue.</p>
