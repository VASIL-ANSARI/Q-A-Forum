<p><code>replicate-wild-do-table</code> allows you to restrict replication statements to databases and tables using <code>%</code> and <code>_</code> wildcard characters, that is perform pattern matching.</p>

<p>Where <code>replicate-do-table</code> uses concrete databases and tables names.</p>

<p>Here's a manual reference: <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-options-slave.html" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Seems like you are having trouble with <code>USE</code> statement or fully qualified table names (those with database name specified) in your setup. First of all, there are 2 types of binary logging:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statement-based</li>
<li>Row-based</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, statement-based replication logs every statement that could modify data and row-based logs modified rows.</p>

<p>Here's a manual reference: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-formats.html" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>

<p>Here's a comparison from the manual: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-sbr-rbr.html" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>

<p>Those two types imply different behaviour for replication options. The key one here is that for statement-based replication MySQL replicates statements that are performed on default (selected via <code>USE</code>) database only.</p>

<p>So the question is: do you need cross-database updates? If so, you can't use <code>replicate-do-db</code>, because it restricts replication on database level. In terms of cross-database updates, there is no difference between <code>replicate-wild-do-table</code> and <code>replicate-do-table</code>.</p>
