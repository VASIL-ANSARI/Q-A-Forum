<p>The problem is with the scope of variables <code>ID</code> and <code>Scores</code>. Both variables are defined in two places -</p>

<ul>
<li>As a global variable at the top of the file, and</li>
<li>As a named parameter to your function.</li>
</ul>

<p>The named parameter is closer in scope to the place of use, hence it wins.</p>

<p>It looks like the use in the second place (i.e. as function parameter) is not intentional, because the declarations lack types<sup>*</sup>. Removing them will make your code compile.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup> in which case C considers them <code>int</code>s, and issues a warning which should have explained the error to you: since the compiler thinks that the inner-scope <code>ID</code> and <code>Score</code> are <code>int</code>s, you cannot use index operator <code>[]</code> with them.</p>
