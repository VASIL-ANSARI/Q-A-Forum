<p>In the <code>for</code> loop replace <code>c[i]</code> by <code>c[c.length-1-i]</code>. This works for me. I just found out that the index specified for the Array <code>c</code> gave wrong results because it kinda went from the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Iâm sure this could be optimized in other ways as well.</p>
