<p>Here's how I would achieve this.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="col-md-3"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-3"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col-md-3"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col-md-3"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="col-md-12&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This simple layout will allow you to set-up all the columns correctly. Then you just put your content inside, bootstrap will automatically set these to responsive. I don't know why you have position relative when you can just change the padding/margin etc. to style it how you like.</p>

<p>My code above is simply just the layout to achieve your layout, fill them respectively and you should see results.</p>

<p>Circular Images = border-radius: 30px (and above depending size of the image, so fiddle with this. No need for a percentage.)</p>

<p>Headings, Place them in the columns using a h1 tag, style them with a class and centre them.</p>

<p>If you're looking to place text over the images, you could just padding: -20px; or even margin -20px on the text to move it around, but you can mostly achieve this with text-align: center/left/right; Then obviously z-index the image and the text, making sure the text is like z-index: 10 and the image is z-index:5; to place the text over the image.</p>
