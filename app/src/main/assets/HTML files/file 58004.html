<p><code>first() &amp;&amp; second() | third()</code> is evaluated as <code>first() &amp;&amp; (second() | third())</code> due to <em>operator precedence</em>. And evaluation takes place from left to right, so <code>first()</code> is evaluated first, followed by <code>(second() | third())</code>. In evaluating this latter term, <em>both</em> arguments are evaluated (again starting from the left), since <code>first()</code> is <code>true</code>, and there is <em>no</em> short-circuiting for the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<p><strong>Did you mean to use a single <code>|</code>?</strong></p>

<p>The less idiosyncratic <code>first() &amp;&amp; second() || third()</code> is evaluated as <code>(first() &amp;&amp; second()) || third()</code>. <code>first()</code> and <code>second()</code> are both evaluated in this instance (and in that order) since <code>first()</code> returns <code>true</code>. Since <code>second()</code> also returns <code>true</code>, <code>third()</code> would <em>not</em> be evaluated.</p>
