<p>If you are willing to mix in TPL DataFlow Blocks you can do what you want.  Though I must say it's a bit non-Rxish.</p>

<pre><code>var source = Observable.Interval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
var queue = new BroadcastBlock&lt;long&gt;(null);
var subscription = queue.AsObservable().DistinctUntilChanged().Subscribe(l =&gt;
{
    Thread.Sleep(2500);
    Console.WriteLine(l);
});

source.SubscribeOn(ThreadPoolScheduler.Instance).Subscribe(queue.AsObserver());
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh160447(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">BroadcastBlock</a> is the queue that will only hold the last value. The TPL DataFlow Blocks do have nice support with Rx.  So we can subscribe to the event and put that into the BroadcastBlock and then subscribe off the BroadcastBlock. </p>
