<p>No, you can't. You are trying to implement multiple inheritance. A User cannot be both a Clerk and a Consumer in a language that does not support multiple inheritance. If this is a valid scenario, then you should map using composition rather than inheritance, so that your User class has both Clerk and Consumer child objects, either or both of which could be null.</p>
