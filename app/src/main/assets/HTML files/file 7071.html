<p>You need to understand what a property actually is.  Suppose you declare a property like this:</p>

<pre><code>@property(nonatomic,retain)IBOutlet UIButton *someLabel;
</code></pre>

<p>When you synthesize it (<code>@synthesize someLabel;</code>), you're actually making a method, though it's hidden, that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>-(void)setSomeLabel:(UILabel *)aSomeLabel {
    if (someLabel != aSomeLabel)
    {
        [someLabel release];
        someLabel = aSomeLabel;
        [someLabel retain];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So yes, there is a parameter, but it's hidden.  </p>
