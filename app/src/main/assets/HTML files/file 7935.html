<p>If you can't detect when the flooding occurs, chances are nobody else can. Since you do the capturing, you are of course free to limit your capturing, but that requires that you know when the looping has occured.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can use rate-limiting, if the "regular" rate is lower than the one observed when the spamming occurs?</p>
