<p>Hi Pratibha. </p>

<p>It is not possible in Android, but you can do one thing: define the class which is extending the <code>BaseAdapter</code> as sub class inside the class which is extending <code>Activity</code> so that you can directly access those data inside the sub class without passing through an intent</p>
