<pre><code>{
 data : [
         {
          "title":"section1",
          "items":[{"name":"item1","url":"url1"},{"name":"item2","url":"url2"}]
         },
         {
          "title":"section2",
          "items":[{"name":"item3","url":"url3"},{"name":"item4","url":"url4"}]
         }
        ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>so basically you have array of objects which contains title and items as its property. Again items is another array of objects which contains name and url as its property.</p>
