<p>You were almost there! </p>

<p>The problem is that (as you alluded to) the expression you've supplied to <code>select()</code> matches two elements. I checked this by executing a JQuery in the Chrome dev console.</p>

<p><code>select()</code> returns an <code>Elements</code> so you could just access <code>rate.get(1)</code> but that doesn't really read very well. So instead, you can add a little bit more refinement to your query so that it gets the rating you're after:</p>

<pre><code>Element rate=doc.select("html body table:nth-child(2) tbody tr td:nth-child(2) table tbody tr td table tbody tr td:nth-child(2) table tbody tr:nth-child(2) td[align=center]").first();
</code></pre>

<p>Which works because the other <code>td</code> isn't centred.</p>
