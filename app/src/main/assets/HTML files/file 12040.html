<p>I downloaded the project, but I don't see any problem. When I import the jar in a different project I still see the correct rollback for.</p>

<p>I issued <code>mvn clean install</code> on command line to generate the jar. I had a look at your committed jar. Yours looks similar to mine, no problem even with it. I even decompiled it and I can see the <code>rollbackFor={Exception.class}</code> in <code>AzerAuthorityDaoImpl</code>.</p>
