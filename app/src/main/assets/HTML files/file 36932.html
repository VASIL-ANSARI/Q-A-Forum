<p>You should give an example with <code>data</code> specified, to make it clear what behavior you're expecting.<br>From what you wrote, I'm supposing you're trying to use <code>filter</code> to select from the children of a div. It won't work, because <code>filter</code> selects from the objects in the current selection, it doesn't care
what is inside those objects. So, if you have <code>div#foo</code> in your selection, it won't care about <code>div#bar</code> inside it.</p>

<p>So, this works:</p>

<pre><code>$("#foo").filter("#foo").html()
</code></pre>

<p>But it won't work</p>

<pre><code>$("#foo").filter("#bar").html()
</code></pre>

<p>because <code>div#bar</code> is not in the selection from which you're trying to filter. It could work this way:</p>

<pre><code>$("#foo").children().filter("#bar").html()
</code></pre>

In case I misunderstood your question, I apologise, and will gladly update my answer.</p>
