<p>You're setting up your "getClass()" function incorrectly. The way your code is written, it's being passed as an argument to jQuery, and it is <em>not</em> being declared as a global function. So just declare it:</p>

<pre><code>function getClass(str) {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once you do that, I <em>think</em> you'll want to change the code that adds content so that it's adding a complete single DOM element. Surround your <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or something.</p>

<p>Also, "i" needs to be a global variable, or else it'll start over at 0 on each call to the function. Move its declaration to outside of "getClass".</p>
