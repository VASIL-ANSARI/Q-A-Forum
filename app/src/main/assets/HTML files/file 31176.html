<ol>
<li>Store your PDFs outside of your webserver document root. Make them completely inaccessible to direct browser access.</li>
<li>Write a PHP script to handle download requests. This PHP page can check the session user ID to ensure the user is requesting a file that they are allowed to access.</li>
<li>Use <code>header()</code> calls and <code>readfile()</code> to then send the appropriate PDF file to the user.</li>
</ol>
