<blockquote>
  <p>A variable can be declared final. A final variable may only be assigned to once. <strong>It is a compile-time error if a final variable is assigned to unless it is definitely unassigned immediately prior to the assignment</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-16.html" rel="nofollow">What is definitive assignment</a></p>

<p>Now, in case of a local variable, it's scope is valid inside the block it's declared. And flow will be linear (from top to bottom). So the compiler can identify easily where the variable will be initialized at first.</p>

<p>But in case of a <code>field</code>, it's impossible to find which method will assign the variable first unless it's assignment in a <code>Constructor</code>.</p>

<p>So, you have to assign <code>final fields</code> <strong>during declaration or in a Constructor</strong>.</p>
