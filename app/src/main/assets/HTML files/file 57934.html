<p>The proposed solution is correct because you do not have an unlimited number of coins of each denomination:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]t is often helpful to bring cash.</p>
  
  <p>The following n lines each contain one integer, the value in cents of each bill or coin that you have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is why the loop in the proposed solution decreases:</p>

<pre><code>for (int v = 30001 - C - 1; v &gt;= 0; v--)
</code></pre>

<p>This avoids using the same coin twice because when it looks at <code>dp[v]</code> to construct <code>dp[v+C]</code>, <code>dp[v]</code> has been constructed without using the current coin C.</p>

<p>Additionally, to allow using any coin any number of times, reversing this loop would be enough:</p>

<pre><code>for (int v = 0; v &lt;= 30001 - C - 1; v++)
</code></pre>
