<p>I would read each row from the original file and write
the desired format to a new csv.</p>

<p>To get the 2nd column of links separated out, the conditional should be
something like:</p>

<pre><code>for row in csv_rows:
    if len(row[1].split()) &gt; 1:
        for link in row[1].split():
            new_csvfile.write(','.join(row[0], row[1].split()[link])
    else:
        new_csvfile.write(row)
</code></pre>
