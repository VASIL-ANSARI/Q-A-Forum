<p>Ok, i found an answer <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.6/selects_using_stores/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, dijit.form.Select possesses an important limitation: <strong>it is
  implemented in such a way that it does not handle non-string item
  identities well.</strong> Particularly, setting the current value of the widget
  programmatically via select.set("value", id) will not work with
  non-string (e.g. numeric) identities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution is to cast ids in store to strings and use </p>

<pre><code>productSelect.set('value', ['4', '3']);     
</code></pre>
