<p>At first guess, it's probably the First() call that's throwing the exception. You could make it FirstOrDefault, or try to pass an Id to your method (Make them select a value from a dropdown or auto complete, then get the Id of what they selected). That way you can be sure when this code hits you can update the entry.
If you pass an Id to the method you can even use "Single" or "SingleOrDefault"</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Say you enter "MyCompany" as CompName, and this doesn't exist in the Database table. If you call First() it'll throw an exception. If you call FirstOrDefault() it'll return "c" as null.</p>

<p>If you call "c.CompanyName" or anything else with a dot, it'll return an exception.</p>

<p>You need to check if c is null before calling any dot methods.</p>
