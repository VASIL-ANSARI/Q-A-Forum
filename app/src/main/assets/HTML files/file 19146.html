<p>If you have a list of keys, some of which might be in the table, then try something like:</p>

<pre><code>insert into my_tableC(key, created, modified)
    select key, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    from &lt;list of keys query&gt; k
    where k.key not in (select key from my_table)
</code></pre>

<p>If you have the list, but not in a table, you can create it as:</p>

<pre><code>with toinsert as (
    select &lt;keyval1&gt; as key union all
    select &lt;keyval2&gt; union all
    select &lt;keyval3&gt; . . .
    select &lt;keyvaln&gt;
)
insert into my_tableC(key, created, modified)
    select key, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    from toinsert k
    where k.key not in (select key from my_table)    
</code></pre>
