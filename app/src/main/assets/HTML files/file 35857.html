<p>I figured this out, thanks to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21097711/chrome-multiple-requests/21368565#21368565">related question</a></p>

<p>Chrome has a setting called "Predict network actions to improve page performance." Since I have done this action (arrive on page A, click to page B) so often while testing my app, Chrome just assumes I'm going to do that and prefetches it. I'll just have to write my code in such a way that we don't do extra writes to the database if this happens.</p>
