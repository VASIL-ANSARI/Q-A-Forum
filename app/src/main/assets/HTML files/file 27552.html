<p>I don't know if this counts as "better/ simpler", but you can write it as a regular SQL query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT MIN(sequence)
  FROM ( SELECT t1.sequence
           FROM table_name t1
           JOIN table_name t2
             ON t2.category = t1.category
            AND t2.sequence &lt;= t1.sequence
          WHERE t1.category = ...
          GROUP
             BY t1.sequence
         HAVING SUM(t2.value) &lt;= 0
       )
;
</code></pre>
