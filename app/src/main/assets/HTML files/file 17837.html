<p>It may be because you're adding the same items to the drop down list in every case, rather than binding the dropdownlist to the source data.  This way, they all share a common set of items, and if you set Selected = true to one item, it'll be true for every dropdownlist that contains that item.</p>

<p>Potentially an interesting technique, but probably not what you want.  </p>
