<p>I think you may be overthinking the problem.  You don't need to abort the <code>read()</code> call after 2 seconds, you just need your backing logic to understand that after 2 seconds it should not expect to receive any "feature" commands.  Then your implementation can write the next command, and your <code>read()</code> will return the byte(s) from the response to that command.</p>

<p>That's how I'd approach it anyways, by having generic code that reads in bytes and passes them further up the chain where context-specific processing can be done.  Then you don't need to interrupt the read, the upstream code just needs to understand that the data it eventually gets back may be a "feature" command, or it may not be.</p>
