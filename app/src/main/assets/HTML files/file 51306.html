<p>Many ways, the one I'd suggest is:</p>

<pre><code>row_reshaped = np.array(row).reshape(3,3)
row_reshaped_as_base_array = row_reshaped.tolist()
row_reshaped_as_json = json.dumps(row_reshaped_as_base_array
with open("goodBoards.txt", "a") as f:
   f.write(row_reshaped_as_json)
</code></pre>

<p>I don't do method chaining and find list comprehensions a bit too terse for me.</p>
