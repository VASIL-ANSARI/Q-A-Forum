<p>most PHP frameworks have (or implement the ability from extensions) the functionality you need. e.g. Cakephp has the so-called helper classes, some of which are used to generate html content. </p>

<p>example (cakePHP):</p>

<pre><code>echo $this-&gt;Form-&gt;input($params);
</code></pre>

<p>this generates input controls based on parameters passed to it.</p>
