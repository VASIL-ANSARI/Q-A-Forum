<p>You used </p>

<pre><code>while(oneRay[pick][0] == "" || oneRay[pick][0] == null)
</code></pre>

<p>and then you didn't use brackets, which means that your code actually works like</p>

<pre><code>while(oneRay[pick][0] == "" || oneRay[pick][0] == null) {
    hold = oneRay.length;
}
random = new Random(); 
System.out.println(oneRay.length + "\n" + hold);
</code></pre>

<p>In particular, if the <code>while</code> condition doesn't hold, then <code>hold = oneRay.length</code> won't even be executed.</p>

<p>(You should also be using <code>.equals("")</code> or <code>.isEmpty</code> rather than <code>== ""</code>, and you should be doing the null check first instead of second.)</p>
