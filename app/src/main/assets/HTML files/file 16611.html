<p>It looks like you've confused BGT (branch if greater-than) with BLGT (branch and link if greater-than). In the middle of your main loop you have this:</p>

<pre><code>  BLT LoopStart ;Branches to label_bar if r7 &lt; 0 (in which case r6 &lt; r4)
  BGT heaterOff
  BGT errorLedOn
  BGT FanOn
  BGT LoopStart
</code></pre>

<p>If the condition is "greater-than", your code will branch to <strong>heaterOff</strong> and then when that function returns, it will exit the code entirely. The functions <strong>errorLedOn</strong> and <strong>FanOn</strong> can never execute.</p>
