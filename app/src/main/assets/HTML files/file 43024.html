<p>First of all, you might try putting your opening <code>&lt;?php</code> <strong>before</strong> rather than <strong>after</strong> the first line of code... :-)</p>

<p>Then you simply modify your code to get the values from your HTML form - I will assume that your search term is named <code>q</code> kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>Search: &lt;input type="text" name="q" /&gt; &lt;input type="submit" name="search" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then your PHP script doing the searching will change the query to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$select = $db-&gt;query("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE FName LIKE '%$_REQUEST[q]%' OR LName LIKE '%$_REQUEST[q]%' ORDER BY id DESC");
</code></pre>

<p>If you are entered "Sam" that will end up with a query that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$select = $db-&gt;query("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE FName LIKE '%Sam%' OR LName LIKE '%Sam%' ORDER BY id DESC");
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that I am showing you the simplest version by simply constructing the query. In fact you should NEVER do this with user-supplied data. Instead, you should prepare and then bind and then execute your statement.  This is not just filler at the end of the answer - it's really important.  But while you are testing you may want to see how it works just be forming a string as above.</p>

<p>To answer your "BONUS POINTS" - you can update the current page by simply including your search form on the same page as the PHP script which displays the results. Then you only process your PHP code if the submit button has been pressed.  Your whole script (in a very simple form) might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Search: &lt;input type="text" name="q" /&gt; &lt;input type="submit" name="search" /&gt;
&lt;?php
if (isset($_REQUEST['search'])) {
    # do your query
    # loop through the results, printing them off in appropriate HTML
}
</code></pre>

<p>To answer your "BONUS BONUS" points, you would probably set up a pull-down ("select" in HTML) where the values of the options were the actual field names and the display was a human-readable form of that.  If your select had the name "field_name" then you would modify your query like this:</p>

<pre><code>$select = $db-&gt;query("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE $_REQUEST[field_name] LIKE '%$_REQUEST[q]%' ORDER BY id DESC");
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that you cannot prepare/bind to a column name, so you will just have to be very careful to validate that field very exactly (probably checking that it exists in a list of acceptable values).</p>
