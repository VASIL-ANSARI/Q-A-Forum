<p>Sylius controllers are services so should be called in the <code>sylius.controller.product:createAction</code> format rather than <code>Sylius:Product:create</code>.</p>

<p>The resource bundle names the services based on your resource name (<code>app.backend.product</code>) but the naming is generated like...</p>

<pre><code>list($prefix, $resourceName) = explode('.', $name);
</code></pre>

<p>...meaning that your prefix would be <code>app</code> and the resource name would become <code>backend</code> (<code>products</code> not even being included in the naming). As the resource controllers actions output are all controlled by the routing information there isn't really the need to have a specific <code>backend</code> controller. If any actions were needed to be just for backend routes you could always create <code>createBackendAction</code> although, as I mentioned, it's probably not necessary.</p>
