<p>This process is called <strong>cloning an object</strong> and the complexity of it depends on what kind of information you would like to clone.</p>

<p>If you simply want to clone an object's fields, you would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>old_object = A.find(old_object_id)
new_object = B.new

new_object.field_one = old_object.field_one
new_object.field_two = old_object.field_two
new_object.save!
</code></pre>

<p>If, however, you want to also clone the old object's <em>associations</em>, you will need to do that by hand.</p>

<p>Say for the sake of argument that <code>A</code> had a <code>has_many</code> association of <code>B</code> objects called <code>bees</code>, and <code>B</code> <code>has_many</code> <code>C</code> objects called <code>sees</code>, this could get a little complex:</p>

<pre><code>old_object.bees.each do |bee|
   new_bee = bee.clone
   new_bee.sees.each do |see|
      new_see = see.clone
      new_see.save!
   end
   new_object.bees.push(new_bee)
end
new_object.save!
</code></pre>
