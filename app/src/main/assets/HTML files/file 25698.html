<p>Your build system is probably generating an APK that's missing components. I would advise you to rebuild your development environment from scratch (new workspace, new IDE installation, new everything). It's often easier to rebuild from scratch than to pinpoint the exact setup issue that went wrong.</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete your workspace</li>
<li>Delete the bin/, gen/, project.properties etc on all projects. In summary, delete everything that was generated by an IDE or a build system.</li>
<li>Start with a fresh workspace</li>
<li>Import the Google Play services library project into the fresh workspace</li>
<li>Import BaseGameUtils into the workspace</li>
<li>Add the Google Play Services library as a reference on BaseGameUtils</li>
<li>Import your project into the workspace</li>
<li>Make sure your project is referencing BaseGameUtils</li>
</ol>

<p>Try to generate the APK agian.</p>
