<p>Like the error says, you need an actual User, not an ID. You could just pass <code>request.user</code> directly. You'll probably get the same error for topic; again, you should just pass the object itself. </p>

<pre><code>LastVisitedTopic.objects.create(user=request.user, topic=t, lastvisited=lv)
</code></pre>
