<p>I'd change a couple of things in the code you pasted.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make that class a regular java class, no injection and pass in the BeanManager. Something could be messing up that way. It's not likely, but possibly.</li>
<li>Create a new CreationalContext by using <code>BeanManager.createCreationContext(null)</code> which will give you essentially a dependent scope which you can release when you're done by calling <code>CreationalContext.release()</code>. </li>
</ol>

<p>You may be able to get everything to work correctly the way you want by calling the release method on the CreationalContext you already have in the <code>DestructibleBeanInstance</code>, assuming there's no other <code>Beans</code> in that CreationalContext that would mess up your application. Try that first and see if it messes things up.</p>
