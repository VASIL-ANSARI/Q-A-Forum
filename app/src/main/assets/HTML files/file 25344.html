<p>Hard to say without more information, but here are a few random guesses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ViewStateEncryptionMode can't be set to true?? I guess you mean 'Always', <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.viewstateencryptionmode.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN reference</a></p></li>
<li><p>If ViewStateEncryptionMode is Always, yes your viewstate is encrypted. This should hide the information it contains from prying eyes.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't need to hide the viewstate content, but want to prevent tampering (i.e. modification) you can set enableViewStateMac='true'. This adds a cryptographic hash to check if the content was tampered with. See MSDN documentation for more details. Both this and ViewStateEncryptionMode can be active at the same time if you want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Most probably you are seeing a false positive from OWASP ZAP. Does your encoded viewstate contain strings such as SQL, JDBC or ODBC? See this <a href="https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/issues/detail?id=273" rel="nofollow">bug</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The message reminds me vaguely of the padding oracle exploit. Is your server patched with <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/MS10-070" rel="nofollow">MS10-070</a>? Note that this is old stuff, the exploit was found and patched in 2010.</p></li>
</ul>
