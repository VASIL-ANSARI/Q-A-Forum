<p>Short answer: no.</p>

<p>What you have asked the db to do is: go order the entire thing table in a random order... then grab me five of them. If your thing table has a lot of rows... that's a very expensive operation.</p>

<p>A better option (if the ids are auto-increment and thus likely concurrent) is to generate a set of random ids within the id-range for your thing table and go fetch these individual things by those ids.</p>
