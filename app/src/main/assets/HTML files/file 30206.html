<p>i am sorry for my english</p>

<p>there are many<br>
1.Application_BeginRequest(and AuthenticateRequest) in global or some HttpModule<br>
2.filters<br>
3.mvc framework,controller factory,action invoker and so on<br>
4.when the first time run,it cost many to compile il to native  </p>

<p>i think you can use a Stopwatch to check how much time the code in you action spend<br>
so that you can find out where is the point take to much time</p>

<p>120ms is not the time spend before run action ,i think it is time the action done</p>

<p>by the way 120ms is not too bad</p>

<p><strong>update</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Index()
{
    var profiler = MiniProfiler.Current;
    using (profiler.Step("action"))
    {
        return View();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/rbF7V.png" alt="enter image description here"><br>
this pic is above code run result
so you can see<br>
action is a child only cost 1.9<br>
and http://...... cost 302,it include controller,action</p>

<p>so you should check most time cost inside you action code or outside you action code<br>
in the pic,it cost 300+ because it is 1st run,2nd run is just cost 4<br>
1st run must be slow</p>
