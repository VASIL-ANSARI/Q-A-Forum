<p>This seems like a direct application of SPOT (<strong>S</strong>ingle <strong>P</strong>oint <strong>O</strong>f <strong>T</strong>ruth), a.k.a. DRY (<strong>D</strong>on't <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself), two names for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="nofollow">single important idea</a>.  You've created a function for accessing <code>val</code> that performs some tasks that should always go along with accessing it.  Unless there is some private, implementation-specific reason to access the member field directly, you should probably use the getter method you define.  That way, if you change the synchronization mechanism that protects <code>val</code>, you only need to update one piece of code.</p>

<p>I can't think of any reason why "dereferencing a mutex to lock it" would be a <em>bad</em> thing, repeating yourself <em>is</em> a bad thing.</p>
