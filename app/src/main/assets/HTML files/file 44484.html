<p>If the user denies your request for notifications then <code>didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:</code> is <em>not</em> called, because registration didn't fail - it wasn't even attempted.</p>

<p>If the user changes the permissions in the settings app then you will receive a call to <code>didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:</code> either the next time your app is launched or when your app returns to the foreground if it is in the background.</p>

<p>The successful registration of remote notifications doesn't mean that you can actually notify the user - for that you need to check the value passed to <code>didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:</code>, however if all you are interested in is the ability to receive background push notifications then <code>didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:</code> may be sufficient</p>
