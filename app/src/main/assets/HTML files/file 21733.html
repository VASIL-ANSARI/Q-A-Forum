<p>I can't speak with any authority (can't prove a negative, etc.), but this doesn't seem like a setting that Apple would give 3rd party apps the ability to modify. Sure, Settings.app modifies it, but that doesn't mean there's public API to do it. Since there's no <code>jailbreak</code> tag on this post, I'm gonna go ahead and assume that the asker is asking about public API. I'm gonna go with "you can't."</p>
