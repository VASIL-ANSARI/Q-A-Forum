<p>you need to create a getter to read in-literal sibling values.</p>

<p>you forget the <code>get</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>var ob={
        quatntity: 3,
        get toalAmount () {
            return 599*this.quatntity;
        }
};

alert(JSON.stringify(ob)); 
</code></pre>

<p>the nice part about them is that the value of <code>toalAmount</code> will self-update as the other values change, yet it's still serialize-able.</p>

<p>a lot of folks forget about getters, or think it's an ES6 thing (kinda looks like it), but they have been around since IE8/ES5...</p>

<p>you also might want to simply make it a traditional method, the kind you need "()" to use, especially if you don't need JSON to include the value.</p>
