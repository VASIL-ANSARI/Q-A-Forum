<p>It looks like there is no way to efficiently pass this information into the function... so I will be handling each input with a function to save it's individual value to a MongoDB.</p>

<pre><code>$scope.updateContent = function() {
    setting.update({id:$scope.settings._id}, {
        name: $scope.settings.name
    });
};
</code></pre>
