<p>I don't know too much about this, but I believe that, to get the depth buffer in a 2D Texture, you would need to render it to a frame buffer object. From there, you could pass the texture of that buffer to the shader program. 
That wont get you to having full AO in your program, but it's a place to start.
Sorry I couldn't help so much.</p>
