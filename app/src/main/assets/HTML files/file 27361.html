<p>Hard to say what's going on. A way to find out is to place a <code>debugger</code> in your perform method and run a sidekiq worker in foreground. That gives you a chance to step through the methods.</p>

<p>You will end up in the <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq/client.rb#L39" rel="nofollow">Sidekiq::Clients push method</a>. That's where it gets interesting.</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec sidekiq
</code></pre>

<p>For 1.9 you can use the <a href="https://github.com/cldwalker/debugger" rel="nofollow">debugger gem</a>.</p>
