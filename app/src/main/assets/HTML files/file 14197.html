<p>Simple answer: <strong>You should be using ARC</strong>.</p>

<p>If for whatever reason you can't, your view controller is deallocated once it's popped off the stack, and you should alloc/init a new one every time you want to push it on to the stack. Or if you don't want to do that - say, if the view in VC2 is very heavy - get rid of your <code>[vcObject release]</code> and keep a reference to <code>vcObject</code> in VC1, and keep pushing the same one on to the stack. Make sure you don't mix these two, though; if you create a new object every time you must release it after pushing it on to the stack, and if you are keeping a reference to push the same VC2 on the stack each time, you must not release it until VC1's <code>dealloc</code>. Keep in mind that you <em>must</em> release it in VC1's <code>dealloc</code> method, or else the memory will be leaked.</p>

<p>But, really. <strong>You should be using ARC.</strong></p>
