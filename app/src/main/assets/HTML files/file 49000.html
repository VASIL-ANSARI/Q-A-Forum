<p>Well, writing down the question helped me to figure somethingâ¦ The idea would be to crush the user input into an $wordsArray and do the fulltext search for each of them.</p>

<p>So, the idea would be toÂ : </p>

<pre><code>//Parse the words from the query field  
    for (there is still a $word to check in the $wordsArray)Â {  
       // do a fulltext search on "works" fields against $word OR "authors" fields against $word
       // save the results in a multi-dimensional $resultArray
    }

// Keep only the results that exists in every row of the $resultArray
// Display
</code></pre>

<p>I think that is quite heavy, thoughâ¦ But the only alternative I can imagine is a database pregenerated table for those search purpose with an index on it. It all depends on the scale.</p>

<p>ExceptÂ if someone else has a better solutionÂ ! </p>
