<p>If you are trying to use such stored procedures for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" rel="nofollow">CRUD</a> purposes you can, in the edmx file (the one that holds the entities of the DB), right click the class you would like to perform the action on and select <code>Stored Procedure Mapping</code>. In there you'll find a list of the actions you can perform on such object. </p>

<p>P.S.: you also have to import the stored procedures from the DB when creating the models.</p>
