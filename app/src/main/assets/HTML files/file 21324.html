<p>I would consider in this cas using <code>Multi Table Inheritance</code>. I personally use the <code>citier</code> gem to implement this : <a href="http://inspiredpixel.net/citier/" rel="nofollow">http://inspiredpixel.net/citier/</a></p>

<p>Concretely, you would have a <code>User</code> table with the 4 common fields, and 2 inherited tables, each one with its own fields, which seems to be what you look for.</p>
