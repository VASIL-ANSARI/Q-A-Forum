<p>Your problem is that you're returning your filtered result from your action handler. The action handler doesn't use a return value (for the most part). Instead, you need to place your filtered items somewhere where your template can access them. Since your filter selector is in a different component, this is what I would do (if you have questions about any part of this, just ask):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In your component, re-send the filter action so it bubbles to the controller:</p>

<pre><code>actions: {
    filter(categoryName) {
        this.sendAction('filterByCategory', categoryName);
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Make sure your controller can receive the action by subscribing to it in the template:</p>

<pre><code>{{filterable-offers categories=categories filterByCategory='filterByCategory'}}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add a handler for the <code>filterByCategory</code> action in your controller:</p>

<pre><code>actions: {
    filterByCategory(categoryName) {
        // We'll use this in the next step
        this.set('filterCategory', categoryName);
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Set up a computed property that will automatically filter your items based on the filter category. We have our <code>filterCategory</code> property on the controller, so let's use that:</p>

<pre><code>filteredOffers: Ember.computed('model.offers.@each.company_industry', 'filterCategory', {
    get() {
        const offers = this.get('model.offers');
        const filterCategory = this.get('filterCategory');

        // If there's no category to filter by, return all of the offers
        if (filterCategory) {
            return offers.filterBy('company_industry', filterCategory);
        } else {
            return offers;
        }
    }
})
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Finally, instead of using <code>model.offers</code> in your template, use <code>filteredOffers</code></p>

<pre><code>    {{#each filteredOffers as |offer|}} ... {{/each}}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That answer might be a tad more in-depth than you want, but hopefully it helps. The major sticking point you were having is that you needed some way to tell your controller to use a filtered set of offers instead of the original set. This is just one of many ways to accomplish that.</p>
