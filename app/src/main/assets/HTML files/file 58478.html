<p>I don't think there's a press-one-button solution here. But you can try using <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlistItems/list#top_of_page" rel="nofollow">PlaylistItems.list</a>. It returns the videos contained in the playlist (50 maxresult per set). So if you want to detect if there's any changes, parse the current list and compare it to the original items contained in the list.</p>
