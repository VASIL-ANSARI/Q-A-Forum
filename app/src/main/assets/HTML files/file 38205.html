<p>Without knowing what program you're using, it's hard to be sure. However, assuming your program is similar to the problematic iOS one in the several-year-old thread you mention, then what you need to do is tell SXSSF to write strings to the Shared Strings table rather than inline. Be aware that this will result in higher memory use.</p>

<p>You can do that using <a href="https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/xssf/streaming/SXSSFWorkbook.html#SXSSFWorkbook%28org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook,%20int,%20boolean,%20boolean%29" rel="nofollow">this constructor to SXSSFWorkbook</a> by passing a value of true for the boolean <a href="https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/xssf/streaming/SXSSFWorkbook.html#SXSSFWorkbook%28org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook,%20int,%20boolean,%20boolean%29" rel="nofollow"><code>useSharedStringsTable</code></a></p>

<p>Assuming you're creating a new file, and your constructor code was</p>

<pre><code>Workbook wb = new SXSSFWorkbook(20);
</code></pre>

<p>You'd now do:</p>

<pre><code>Workbook wb = new SXSSFWorkbook(null, 20, false, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/xssf/streaming/SXSSFWorkbook.html" rel="nofollow">JavaDocs</a> for more on the various constructor options and their impacts</p>
