<p>logger is part of rails</p>

<p>irb is just a ruby command line interpreter</p>

<p>use 'rails console' to get a command line interface with the rails infrastructure running.</p>

<p>use puts as a substitute for logger while using irb </p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>You'll never get anywhere trying to run that code in irb,  instead,  copy your file to yourapp/lib, then  do a</p>

<p>rails console</p>

<p>Now RAILS is booted up,  but with a command line interface,  then try</p>

<p>include LinkedIn::Api::QueryMethods</p>

<p>test</p>

<p>now you can also use logger.debug</p>
