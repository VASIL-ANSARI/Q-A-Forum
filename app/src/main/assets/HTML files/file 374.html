<p>Couple of options here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Attach to <code>AppDomain.AssemblyResolve</code> and do another <code>LoadFile</code> based on the requested assembly.</li>
<li>Spin up another <code>AppDomain</code> with the directory as its base and load the assemblies in that <code>AppDomain</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd highly recommend pursuing option 2, since that will likely be cleaner and allow you to unload all those assemblies after. Also, consider loading assemblies in the reflection-only context if you only need to reflect over them (see <code>Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoad</code>).</p>
