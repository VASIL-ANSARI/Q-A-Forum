<p>When posting a question, it is a good idea to give the table format, the database you are using, and sample data.  In this case, I speculate that you are using SQL Server, because you are using the DAY() and MONTH() functions.</p>

<p>These functions take dates as arugments, not strings.  You should not depend on implicit conversion in SQL.  Let me repeat that.  You should always explicitly convert between data types, to prevent errors like the ones you see.</p>

<p>The problem that you have is that your date format is not in the default format for the system.  For instance, you may have a date like 10/03/2012.  Is this Oct 3rd, as Americans would believe?  Or is this March 10th, as Europeans would?  Then consider 10/20/2012.  It is out of range for Europeans.</p>

<p>So, you have two options:</p>

<p>(1) Do an explicit conversion, using the CONVERT() function.</p>

<p>(2) Extract the month and day using string functions.  In the above case, this might be substring(, 1, 2) for one and substring(, 4, 2) for the other.</p>
