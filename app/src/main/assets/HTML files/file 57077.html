<p>See, "this" keyword refers to current object due to which method is under excecution. As, you cannot call static method using instance of class. That is why, "this" can't be used in the above example in a static method as it is trying to print current instance which is not at all created. So, I think thats why there is an compile time error that you are getting.</p>
