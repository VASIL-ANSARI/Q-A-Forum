<p>Your syntax almost fine, but you have a <code>;</code> after your <code>IF</code> condition which is causing the error. <code>;</code> is used to separate statements and consequent of your If is part of the the same statement as the condition.</p>

<p>This should work:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER Prog_Made_Limits
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF Prog_Made ON Program_Table
 FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (NEW.Prog_Type &lt;&gt; 'FILM')
BEGIN
  IF (:new.Prog_Made &lt; date '1864-12-31' or 
      :new.Prog_Made &gt; sysdate )
  THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR( -20001, 'Program Made date must be later than Dec 31st 1864, and earlier than today, if FILM is inserted');
  END IF;
END Prog_Made_Limits;
</code></pre>

<p>I say <em>should</em>, because I don't have Oracle on my laptop, so can only test on SQL Fiddle, but by removing all semicolons I was able to get this to compile, however I think SQL-Fiddle treats semicolons as batch breaks rather than statement breaks, so I am not sure it is necessary to remove them all.</p>
