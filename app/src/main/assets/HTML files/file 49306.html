<p>Seaborn functions like <code>countplot</code> assume that you have <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf" rel="nofollow">tidy data</a>. Briefly: each variable should be a column, and each observation should be a row. You will want to find a way to format your dataframe so that it is in this basic structure, and then you will be able to use seaborn to plot it.</p>
