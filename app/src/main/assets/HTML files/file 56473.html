<p>You can use one or more structs to group "settings", and then expose a method to set them:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct settings{
  int setting1;
  int setting2;
}MySettings;

class Myclass{
 private :
   int setting1;
   int setting2;

 public Myclass(MySettigs *settings)
{
  if(null != settings){
     setting1=settings-&gt;setting1;
     setting2=settings-&gt;setting2;
  }
}

public void ChangeSettings (MySettings *setting){
  if(null != settings)
  {
     setting1=settings-&gt;setting1;
     setting2=settings-&gt;setting2;
  }
}

public void TakeSettings (MySettigs *settings){
  [copy local variables into the passed struct]
}
</code></pre>

<p>I strongly advise to be careful when changing settings while the object is "operational".You can fall in an undefined state where settings are being changed while another thread is using them.</p>
