<p>If you have a date already and you want to check the time passed since then to current time you can do something like this: </p>

<pre><code>long curTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
long curTimesec = curTime / 1000;  //you can continue to do this if you want to get minutes, hours, days, etc
long diff = curTimesec - lastSeenDatesec; 
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps and I didn't misunderstood your question.</p>
