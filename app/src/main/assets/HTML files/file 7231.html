<p>The <code>setDataSource()</code> method on the media player will accept file or URIs for a media source. Look at this list to see what media formats the media player accepts: <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html</a></p>

<p>I am fairly certain that the media player will not play playlist files like M3U. You would have to create your own M3U player, which could be accomplished via the <code>MediaPlayer</code> method: <code>setOnCompletionListener(MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener listener)</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Register a callback to be invoked when the end of a media source has been reached during playback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When playback is done, you could start playing the next media resource in your playlist.</p>
