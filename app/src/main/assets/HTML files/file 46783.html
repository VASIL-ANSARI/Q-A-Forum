<p>If you have a look at the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html#nextInt()" rel="nofollow">JavaDocs for Scanner#nextInt</a> you will see it's capable of throwing a InputMismatchException, among others</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the goal is that I'm trying to throw an IOException rather than InputMismatch. Is there anything i can do to my code which will help me throw it? </p>

<p>You will need to trap any possible exceptions and throw a new <code>IOException</code> with the old <code>Exception</code> as the cause.</p>

<pre><code>public static int getInt() throws IOException
{
    int a = 0;
    System.out.println("Enter an interger: ");
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    try {
        a = input.nextInt();
    } catch (InputMismatchException ime) {
        throw new IOException("Could not get int from input", ime);
    }
    return a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is, IMHO, not the most brilliant idea, as you may wish to treat the <code>InputMismatchException</code> differently from the <code>IOException</code> which might be caused when you create a <code>Scanner</code></p>
