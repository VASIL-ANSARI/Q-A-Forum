<p>If i understand the question correctly you need a replacement for <code>foo(A());</code> or similar cases where <code>A()</code> is called so that you don't have default initialization of members.</p>

<p>In that case one here is what i came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First i tried to add <code>A() = default</code> (but this might not work with older c++ standards) and i had <a href="http://ideone.com/iVKoIA" rel="nofollow">interesting results</a>. The exact sample you provided works in reverse printing first 0 and then some random number.</p></li>
<li><p>Second i did not use <code>A() = default;</code> and just used a templated function</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt; T make() { T tmp; return tmp; }
</code></pre>

<p>At the cost of a copy (or move) you can use it like <code>foo(make&lt;A&gt;())</code> and get the result you wanted.</p></li>
</ul>
