<p>Your table name does not meet Rails' naming conventions. To name a join table you should join the other table's name in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>In this case Â´syndicate_members_syndicatesÂ´, since your tables are named <code>syndicate_members</code> and <code>syndicates</code>.</p>

<p>You can fix that by:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can revert your migration, change it from <code>create_table :members_syndicates</code> to <code>create_table :syndicates_members_syndicates</code> and run it again. That would fix the table name. </li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>You can add <code>:join_table =&gt; 'members_syndicates'</code> to both <code>has_and_belongs_to_many</code> declarations in the <code>Syndicate</code> and the <code>SyndicateMember</code> model. That tells Rails not to use the autogenerated name as a table name but <code>members_syndicates</code>. In this case you do not need to change the table name.</li>
</ul>
