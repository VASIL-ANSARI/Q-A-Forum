<p>You should look into multi threading. What you basically want is a thread which keeps running and maintaining the rt.</p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>  String commandLine;
  while ((commandLine = System.in.readline()) != 'q') {
        Process pc = rt.exec(commandLine);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>You problem is that your program terminates after one call.</p>
