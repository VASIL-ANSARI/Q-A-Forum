<p>Enter "$(Build.SourcesDirectory)\SolutionFolderName\packages" in "Advanced Execution Options\Path to Custom Test Adapters" to set the test adapter to xUnit. Refer to this link for details: <a href="https://nocture.dk/2015/06/19/xunit-or-nunit-with-visual-studio-online-build/" rel="nofollow">xUnit or NUnit with Visual Studio Online Build</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
I just create a sample app to test this and get the same issue with you. However, if I copy the xunit assembly files into "dnx451" folder together with test.dll, the test will be completed successfully.

<p>And since you are working on a Asp.Net Core project and has imported DNX runner, you can also add a "Command Line" task to use dnx test command to run the testing directly.
