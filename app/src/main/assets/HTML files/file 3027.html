<p>I'm assuming you're using ASP.Net, and you would like to write the content of a particular cached item?</p>

<p>To accomplish this, insert the item into the cache with a callback function specified for when the item is removed.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>Cache.Insert("MyText", someTextVariable, null, DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(10), 
             TimeSpan.Zero, CacheItemPriority.High, 
             new CacheItemRemovedCallback(ItemRemoved))


public void ItemRemoved(string key, object value, CacheItemRemovedReason reason)
{
Â  Â  // write value to file
}
</code></pre>

<p>If this isn't what you're talking about, you're going to have to give more details in your question, because it's pretty vague.</p>
