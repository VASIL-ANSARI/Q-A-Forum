<p>Windsor is great, but why use that for caching when you have several built in ways to cache data. Windsor has its foundation in other areas not necessarily caching. From the cache object to session to cookies. There are many ways to cache. More importantly in large applications you end up needing distributed caching. MS is working on a product for that and there are a couple good vendors out there that have products on the market. </p>
