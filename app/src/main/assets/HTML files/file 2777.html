<p>I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but if you want to set the value of the select field with JavaScript, you need to obtain the value <em>in JavaScript</em> at some point. I can think of two ways of doing this:</p>

<p>1) When you get the options via AJAX, have the server indicate which one is selected. This can be done by returning HTML <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> tags with <code>selected="selected"</code> set for one of them. To do this, your AJAX request is going to have to provide information about the object this select field is for (so the server can look up the object's current <code>serving_size_id</code> value).</p>

<p>2) When you render the field in your original partial, also render some JavaScript which sets the current value of the field, for example, underneath what you have above:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= javascript_tag "var ssid = '#{builder.object.serving_size_id}';" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, after the options are retrived via AJAX, the <code>ssid</code> variable is checked and the correct option is selected.</p>
