<p>Enum names are in global scope, they need to be unique. Remember that you don't need to qualify the enum symbols with the enum name, you do just:</p>

<pre><code>Month xmas = December;
</code></pre>

<p>not:</p>

<pre><code>Month xmas = Month.December;  /* This is not C. */
</code></pre>

<p>For this reason, you often see people prefixing the symbol names with the enum's name:</p>

<pre><code>enum Month { Month_January, Month_February, /* and so on */ };
</code></pre>
