<p>You could do this "straight forward" like:</p>

<pre><code>var dateString; // user input date
if(dateString.split(" ").length == 3){
    // you have "yyyy mm dd" format
} else if(dateString.split("-").length == 3){
    // you have yyyy-mm-dd format
} else if(dateString.split(".").length == 3){
    // you have "yyyy.mm.dd" or "mm.dd.yyyy" format
} else {
    // suppose you have "yyyymmdd" or "mmddyyyy" format
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the cases where you can have two different formats you have to check the day, year and month values if they are a valid year. If so, you can build the date, otherwise try the other way.</p>

<p>For the yyyymmdd and mmddyyyy combinations you can use the <code>substr()</code> function on the string to extract the day, year and month.</p>

<p>However, you always have to take into account that the user input can be something incorrect like "12 March 2012" or "abcdefg", but I would simply wrap the whole functionality into a try-catch block.</p>
