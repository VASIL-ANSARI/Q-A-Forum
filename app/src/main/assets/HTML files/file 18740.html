<p><code>NSURLConnection</code> is the definitely way to go. All it does is a very robust and tested way to connect to your web site asynchronously and retrieve the content. And it is not messy. You make the connection and then catch the results in the callback once it is finished.</p>

<p>The issues you cite in your concerns are all not related at all to the way you connect to your web site. It is up to you to structure the data in a meaningful way, say, in a JSON format or otherwise. Once you have retrieve your <code>NSData</code> object it is up to you to display the data efficiently in suitable UIKit objects, such as tableview cells, labels, or text views, etc.</p>
