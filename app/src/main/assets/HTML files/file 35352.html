<p>A backslash in a <em>PHP string literal</em> can have a special meaning. For example <code>"\n"</code> is a newline, not the string "\n". To write the string "\n", you need to escape the backslash as <code>"\\n"</code>. However, if the character following the backslash doesn't have any special meaning, the backslash is taken as is. E.g. <code>"\foo"</code> is the string "\foo". In single-quoted strings there's only a single case in which you <em>need</em> to escape the backslash, which is directly before the end of the string: <code>'foo\\'</code> â "foo\".</p>

<p>So, writing <code>\\/</code> in a PHP string literal or <code>\/</code> has the same meaning, because <code>/</code> does not have any special significance to PHP. Either way is correct. This is not about regex syntax but about PHP syntax.</p>
