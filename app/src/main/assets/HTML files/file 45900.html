<p>It's because of <em>undefined behavior</em> as the variable <code>d</code> goes out of scope and is destructed when you to <code>pthread_exit</code> in the <code>main</code> function. The pointer in your thread function is no longer valid once the original variable goes out of scope.</p>

<p>For an intermediate solution, allocate <code>d</code> dynamically instead. For a long-term solution consider using <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread" rel="nofollow"><code>std::thread</code></a> instead.</p>
