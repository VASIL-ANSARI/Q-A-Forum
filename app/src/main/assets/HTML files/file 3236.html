<p>I think you should just change your code to only use the ID. 
A competent editor will be able to tell you where you have used store id in your project, and your tests will help if you introduce a regression error. </p>

<p>Otherwise, you could use a database trigger. Or setup a callback on the model to set store_id from the newly created id value (look at the <strong>after_create</strong> callback). Again, both of these approaches are hacks to cover up a bug in your system with an easy fix.</p>
