<p>theres an error with your server-sided code, the server sends "text/plain" when the browser expects "text/javascript"</p>

<p>.. how to fix this depends on what server you use (lighthttpd / apache / nginx / etc) , but.. if you have some scripting language like PHP (which nearly all webservers has these days) , you can use that to customize the MIME.. like</p>

<p>jsstuff.js.php</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php header("content-type: text/javascript");?&gt;
//javascript goes here!
</code></pre>
