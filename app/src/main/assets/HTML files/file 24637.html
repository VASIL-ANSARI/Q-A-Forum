<p>Eventhough in theory, your code should work, Chrome thinks otherwise, as noted in in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5445431/jquery-disable-submit-button-on-form-submission">similar SO question</a> and in <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/M7y2gZDvXAk" rel="nofollow">this chrome groups discussion</a> (may be a bug, may be the intended design).</p>

<p>First, when you want to allow / block a click you should use <code>onclick="return someFunction()"</code> and not <code>onclick="someFunction()"</code> - then the action will follow through only if that function returns true.</p>

<p>Now to make this work, you would have to submit the form from your function:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).parents('form').submit()
</code></pre>
