<p><s>It is likely that</s> TextEdit <strong>has</strong> formatted your text, since by saving it as a Web Document it thinks that you have typed up the web page how you want it displayed, with all formatting, instead of raw HTML code. Try to save the document as raw text, then change the extension manually from whatever it is (probably <code>.txt</code>) to <code>.html</code>. For a more permanent solution, it is advisable to use a non-formatting text editor when coding.</p>
