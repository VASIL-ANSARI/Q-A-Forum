<p>I follow the convention of the server technology for my Backbone models.</p>

<p>For example, in my Rails applications, I set attributes using underscore names like <code>some_value</code>, and in my .NET applications I set attributes using capitalized names like <code>SomeValue</code>.</p>

<p>This makes it easier to integrate everything on the back-end. It's a minor inconvenience to remember to do this in the client side code, but once I'm deep in to a project, it becomes habit for that project. </p>

<p>The ease of the back-end integration is well worth the minor effort to use the convention that the server wants, in my opinion.</p>
