<p>Try to check three things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you are using a local host name check that, the same bindning is set on your site and that the same host name row exists in your hosts file (usually in C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) like this example:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1    localsite.dev
</code></pre></li>
<li>Check that the sites root is pointing to the correct directory on your local machine.</li>
<li>If you have access to a local development tool, like Visual studio, try to compile and see if build errors exists.</li>
</ol>
