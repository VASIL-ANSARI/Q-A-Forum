  <p>A status bar notification requires all of the following:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>An icon for the status bar</strong></li>
  <li>A title and message, unless you define a custom notification layout</li>
  <li>A PendingIntent, to be fired when the notification is selected</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>from <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications.html#CreateANotification">Status Bar Notifications - Creating Notifications</a></em></p>

<p>You don't specify an icon, which means your notification is not valid. </p>

<p><em>(But yes, it's bad on the framework side that there is no proper error message/exception for this case)</em></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just tested this through and I can confirm the "invisible" notification from the comment on Android 2.2. It works on 2.3.3., seems like you stumbled <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=11040">over a bug</a> that has been fixed in the meantime.</p>

<p>The problematic line is the following for me:</p>

<pre><code>contentView.setViewVisibility(R.id.pgStatus, View.GONE);
</code></pre>

<p>If I comment that out, everything works. It also works when I add <code>android:visibility="gone"</code> to the ProgressBar in the XML layout, which has basically the same effect. But as soon as I call <code>setViewVisibility()</code> on the bar, everything breaks apart. </p>

<p>So I'd recommend the workaround from the bugtracker comments, wrap the ProgressBar into a LinearLayout and change the visibility of that instead. </p>
