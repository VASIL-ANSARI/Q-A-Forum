<p>I think they don't play it when minimize. They will call it every time the new notification comes, but when window is active, they disable the sound.</p>

<pre><code>var isactive = false;

function playSound(){
    if (isactive) return;
    playWav...;
}

onNotificaitonComes = playSound;

$(window).focus(function(){
    isactive = true;
}).blur(function(){
    isactive = false;
});
</code></pre>
