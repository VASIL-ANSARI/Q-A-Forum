<p>Exactly as the error message says: the source controller (GameViewController) needs to be managed by UINavigationController if you want to use push segue from GameViewController. </p>

<p>You need to embed UINavigationController into GameViewController, not the second view controller. If you want to hide the navigation bar in the GameViewController, you can do so: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/845583/iphone-hide-navigation-bar-only-on-first-page">iPhone hide Navigation Bar only on first page</a></p>

<p>After that, you will need to modify your prepareForSegue method, especially the part where you got the <code>segue.destinationViewController</code>. It will give you directly the PickTypeViewController instance.</p>

<pre><code>PickTypeViewController *pickTypeViewController = (PickTypeViewController *)segue.destinationViewController;
</code></pre>
