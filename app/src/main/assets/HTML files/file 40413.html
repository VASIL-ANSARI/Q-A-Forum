<p>The value you are seeing for "value 2" is not a nested dictionary.  You are getting a ParseResults object containing a single entry, an empty string. Since ParseResults have characteristics of both lists and dicts, its repr string shows both, first the list of parsed strings or objects, followed by a dict-like listing of any named results and their values.  Print out <code>type(result["value 2"])</code> to see this, or <code>result["value 2"].dump()</code>.</p>

<p>You may have some success by "ungrouping" the SkipTo results, using:</p>

<pre><code>pp.ungroup(pp.SkipTo(common_cfg)('value 2'))
</code></pre>

<p>for the first term in your parser.</p>
