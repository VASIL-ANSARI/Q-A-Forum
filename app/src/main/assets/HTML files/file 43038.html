<pre><code>jd.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
     public void windowGainedFocus(WindowEvent windowEvent){
           System.out.println("TEST");
     }        
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>Should be:</p>

<pre><code>jd.addWindowFocusListener(new WindowAdapter() {
     public void windowGainedFocus(WindowEvent windowEvent){
           System.out.println("TEST");
     }        
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>I <em>knew</em> there was a good reason I hated the adapter classes..  I would recommend using the listener rather than the adapter.</p>
