<p>If you compose to a vertical rhythm this shouldn't really pose much of a problem.</p>

<p>This is totally overkill, but you could use <a href="http://www.lalit.org/lab/javascript-css-font-detect" rel="nofollow">http://www.lalit.org/lab/javascript-css-font-detect</a> and create a conditional.  </p>

<p>I really suggest using something like the first method (vertical rhythm) to make then entire issue irrelevant if at all possible. You'll sleep much better at night.</p>
