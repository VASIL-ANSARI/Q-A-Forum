<p>Not exactly sure what you mean by <code>Stream</code> but here's another solution. Split rendering up into multiple passes. Fore instance, if you have a 512x512 texture and a corresponding quad to texture but can only afford to upload a 256x256 due to memory restrictions do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>split up the texture into 4 chunks</li>
<li>create a single, fitting texture object</li>
<li>for each chunk
<ul>
<li>upload the current chunk into the tex objects data store</li>
<li>draw 1/4 of the quad, e.g. top-left and texture accordingly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the above example assume a 512x512 texture and screen-size. In any case, I think you get the idea.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is the usual memory/performance trade-off.You circumvent memory restrictions by using more bandwidth for transfers and do more rendering.</p>

<p>Note: I'm a desktop GL guy and I'm not quite sure how memory is split up betweem the GPU and the rest, or if there even is some dedicated VRAM. I assume you've got a limited amount available for GL resources which is even smaller than the overall system memory.</p>
