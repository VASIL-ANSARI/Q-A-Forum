<p>If you open the .MSG file in a text editor, i believe you will find that the information you are after is stored as plain text inside the file. (It is on all the messages i have checked at least)</p>

<p>It would be pretty easy to write some code to parse the file looking for lines beginning with "From:" or "To:" etc. and then extracting the information you need.</p>

<p>If you need the body of the email as well, that may be a bit more complicated.</p>
