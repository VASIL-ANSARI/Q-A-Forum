<p>You can't "forward", in the strict sense.  Just call sendRedirect() on the HttpServletResponse object in your Action class's execute() method.  and, then 'return null'.</p>

<p>alternately, either call setModule on the ActionForward object (that you are going to return) or set the path to an absolute URI</p>
