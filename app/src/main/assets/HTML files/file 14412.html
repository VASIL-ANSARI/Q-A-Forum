<p>I'm going to answer this question since I had a world of problems with my code. Hopefully this answer will be a bit of a checklist if someone else has similar problems in the future.</p>

<ol>
<li>My final method was static so I needed to use staticExpects instead of expects  </li>
<li>My static calls were using self:: but I needed to use static:: ( PHP >= 5.3 )</li>
<li>static:: can't be used on a private function, unlike self::</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, I can now see why static functions are evil.</p>
