<p>Judging from the way you wrote your question, <strong>the answer is no</strong>. Full stop. No property in the <code>System.Windows.Forms.Label</code> class is related to escape sequences.</p>

<p>But I didn't fully understand your question. Do you need to display escape sequences in label? For example, <em>separate items by \n</em>. You can double-escape the value you put into the <code>Text</code> property of your label, in that case, or, smoother, preceed the string quotes with <code>@</code>. For example</p>

<pre><code>myLabel.Text=@"Separate items with \n";
</code></pre>

<p>I hope I have been of help.</p>
