<p>You can not just change those things in the fly, unless you write a PHP extension.</p>

<p>It is also never a good thing to use a document database like MongoDB as it were a relational database like MySQL. They have totally different features and performance characteristics. For example, MongoDB does not have joins, but instead uses embedded or nested documents; MongoDB does not do transactions either, so you will need to do things in another atomic way; MongoDB also does not do "WHERE A=B", so you need to redo your query thoughts.</p>

<p>In short, transparently converting SQL DQL to MongoDB queries is not possible.</p>
