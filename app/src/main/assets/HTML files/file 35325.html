<p>what you want is a less-expressive <em>pattern-matching</em> known as <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob" rel="nofollow"><strong>Glob</strong></a>. one solution is to implement your own <code>globbing</code> using String class method (such as <code>startsWith</code>, <code>endsWith</code> ,...). but I think using <code>regex</code> is the best and general solution.</p>
