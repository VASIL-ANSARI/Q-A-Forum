<p>You're looking to use joins since you want to pull info from multiple tables.</p>

<p>If <code>$starring</code> is an array of names, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>if (!empty($starring)) {
    $query .= " INNER JOIN actors on actors.dvdId = dvds.dvdId WHERE";
    foreach( $starring as $name )
         $query .= " starring LIKE '%$name%' OR";
    substr( $query, 0, -3 );  //Remove last OR
}
</code></pre>

<p>The logic here isn't perfect (will match all DVDs with any of the supplied actors), but I know this will get you going in the right direction.</p>
