<p>Actually what try is doing here is.... </p>

<p>Its making your code safe to run... if any exception occurs it is caught by catch...
All the unsafe codes and anything we do are not sure of... we place that into try block...</p>

<p>If any exception occurs in processing the code in try block then catch block gets executed... There might be some (you can call dangerous) calculation happening in the line:  </p>

<pre><code>letraNif = calcularLetraNif(this.numeroDni);
</code></pre>

<p>hence it is placed in try block and a catch is accompanied to catch any dangerous outcome of that calculation.</p>

<p>For more info go to oracle docs exception handling.</p>
