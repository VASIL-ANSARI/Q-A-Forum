<p>The <code>window</code> object is the global sink in the browser. Every variable that you define globally (e.g. jQuery's <code>$</code>) is a property in <code>window</code>. <code>ueLogError</code> is not some kind of standardized JavaScript function. It is most likely some function for an advertisement script.</p>

<p>Not all resources that a page requests as part of the page load are actually successfully loaded. Some requests fail due to SSL problems. Some requests fail, because the user agent string is not supported. Some requests fail because of unknown reasons.</p>

<p>You can register to the <code>onConsoleMessage</code>, <code>onError</code>, <code>onResourceError</code>, <code>onResourceTimeout</code> events (<a href="https://gist.github.com/artjomb/4cf43d16ce50d8674fdf" rel="nofollow">Example</a>) to see whether there are errors. Usually you will find that some JavaScript file wasn't loaded which would have contained <code>ueLogError</code> which another script depends on.</p>
