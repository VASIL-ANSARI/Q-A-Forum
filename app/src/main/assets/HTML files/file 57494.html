<p>You're using a thread pool thread just to wait for a "signal".</p>

  <p>what is a better alternative?</p>

<p>You can use an async-compatible <code>AutoResetEvent</code>, such as the one in <a href="https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx" rel="nofollow">my AsyncEx library</a> or the one on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/02/11/10266923.aspx" rel="nofollow">Stephen Toub's blog</a>.</p>

<p>Also, most of the time auto reset events are the wrong thing to use. manual reset events are much more common. I'd recommend re-evaluating this choice of synchronization primitive.</p>
