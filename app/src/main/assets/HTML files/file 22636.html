<p>I've been using <a href="https://kaazing.com/products/websocket-gateway/editions/" rel="nofollow">Kaazing</a> (HTML5 edition) to proxy traffic received via a web-socket to a Java process listening on a traditional TCP server socket.</p>

<p>It's working well, latency is low and was consistently handling over 1000 messages/second (though we found our Java code was the limiting factor in that respect).</p>

<p><a href="https://kaazing.com/products/websocket-gateway/editions/" rel="nofollow">Kaazing</a> also provides client APIs for Java, JavaScript and Flex, which allowed us to write an acceptance test suite using the familiar APIs (Concordion in my case).</p>

<p>I don't know how well it'd run on a Raspberry Pi, but given it's free to download there's a simple way to find out.</p>
