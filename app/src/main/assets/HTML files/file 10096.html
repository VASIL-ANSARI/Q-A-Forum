<p>Akka <strong>is</strong> suitable for systems with transient network coverage. Supervisor hierarchies can be used to handle the non-delivery errors as Viktor has pointed out in the comments to the question. For more details see the conversation in the comments to the question.</p>

<p>To verify this I have done some testing with two computers and physically switched the network connection to one of them on and off. There were no problems with hanging sockets and messages that were queued during the outage were delivered when the connection was (physically) reestablished, just as expected.</p>
