<p>It sounds like you're confusing LINQ to Entities/SQL with plain-old LINQ. Remember that when you're using the EF, any LINQ queries you write have to be translated into SQL. Thus, whatever object transformations you need to do on the data returned from the SQL database need to be directly supported by the EF. This includes ToList(), ToArray(), etc, but not your own custom extensions.</p>

<p>I think the best you can do here is first query the database (you could use ToList() so the query executes), then use that resulting list in the constructor of the ObservableCollection (or call your ToObservableCollection() extension method.</p>
