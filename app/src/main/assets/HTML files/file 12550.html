<p>Autocad doesn't provide debug info for it's binaries (<code>pdb</code> files).</p>

<p>If the crash is in your module, it should be fairly easy to debug, just make sure you have the corresponding <code>pdb</code>'s and <code>dll</code>'s. By <code>dll</code>'s I'm also talking about <code>arx</code> and <code>dbx</code> files.</p>

<p>If the crash is in an AutoCAD module... well, from experience, I'm 99.9% sure that the source is your code, and not AutoCAD's.</p>
