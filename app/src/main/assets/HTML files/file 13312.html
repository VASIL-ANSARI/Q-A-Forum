<p>Probably the first thing you checked but are the login, password and signature the ones for the sandboxed user and not your own login to the sandbox. You need to log in to the sandboxed users account and the get the signature from in there.</p>

<p>So when you log into sandbox.paypal.com and then go to Test Accounts, select the one you want the details for and press Enter Sandbox Test Site. In the new window enter the details for the fake user (email should be prefilled). Once logged in go to Profile -> API Access and request or view the API signature.</p>

<p>Sorry if you've already tried this but I couldn't post a comment to ask ;)</p>
