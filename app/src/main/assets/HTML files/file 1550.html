<p>Although not really an article, I think the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_41_0/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm" rel="nofollow">Boost smart_ptr library documentation</a>  has some good information on C++ memory management. It is of course biased to the Boost library but I think you will get some good ideas out of it.</p>
