<p>Your AJAX call should be to a URL, not a file-system location. Put in what you would type to load that page in a browser address bar. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
        type: "GET",
        url: "http://example.com/controllers/User.php?newUser",
        data: { name: "John" }
    }).done(function( msg ) {
        alert( "Data Saved: " + msg );
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Everything needs to be provided in the URL that is called since the PHP does not have access to your Javascript and the Javascript does not have access to your PHP. </p>

<p>The PHP page then needs to return everything the Javascript needs, typically as JSON or XML. So in your <code>User.php</code> script you would update your database or do whatever you needed to have done. It would have to figure everything out from the <code>$_GET</code> array values. This could be the name of a function or just values. If results are to be returned to your Javascript they would be <code>echo</code>'ed from the script.</p>

<p>Maybe your <code>User.php</code> script could be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$name = $_GET['newUser'];
// Some code to open a database, check if the name is valid, etc., here..
echo "user name '$name'";
?&gt;
</code></pre>
