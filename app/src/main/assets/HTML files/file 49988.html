  <p>I mean will StringBuilder always manage enough memory for string that comes from info to buffer variable?</p>

<p>You should always specify the initial capacity of the StringBuilder by using the constructor that takes the capacity:</p>

<pre><code>int size = 256;
StringBuilder buffer = new StringBuilder(256);
fr = info(5, buffer, ref size);
</code></pre>
