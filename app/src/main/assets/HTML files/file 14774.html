<p>You'd have to have some way of faking out the task creation.</p>

<p>If you moved the <code>Task.Factory.StartNew</code> call to some dependency (<code>ILongRunningOperationStarter</code>) then you could create an alternative implementation which used <code>TaskCompletionSource</code> to create tasks which complete exactly where you want them to.</p>

<p>It can get a bit hairy, but it <em>can</em> be done. I <a href="https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2011/11/25/eduasync-part-17-unit-testing/" rel="nofollow">blogged about this</a> a while ago - unit testing a method which <em>received</em> tasks to start with, which of course made things easier. It's in the context of async/await in C# 5, but the same principles apply.</p>

<p>If you don't want to fake out the whole of the task creation, you could replace the task factory, and control the timing that way - but I suspect that would be even hairier, to be honest.</p>
