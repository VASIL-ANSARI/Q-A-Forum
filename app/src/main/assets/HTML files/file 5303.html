<p>Based on a quick look at the Hibernate @embeddable attribute, it is basically a component that can be re-used in multiple places. NHibernate does not support this out-of-the-box, but you can accomplish this using <a href="https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Fluent-mapping#components" rel="nofollow">Fluent NHibernate's ComponentMap</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Component(x =&gt; x.Address, m =&gt;
{
  m.Map(x =&gt; x.Number);
  m.Map(x =&gt; x.Street);
  m.Map(x =&gt; x.PostCode);
});
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't appear that ComponentMap's have quite as much flexibility for overriding column definitions, though you can prefix columns to allow duplicate components in the same entity. (e.g. ComponentMap with HomeAddress and WorkAddress on a Person.)</p>
