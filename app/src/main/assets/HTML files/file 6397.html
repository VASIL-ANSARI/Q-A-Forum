<p>You got it. A <code>UITableView</code> really isn't designed to show more than two levels of a hierarchy, as sections and rows. If you want to show more than two levels, a "drill-down" approach used in most (all?) iOS apps, where tapping a row presents another <code>UITableView</code> on the navigation stack. (As you say.)</p>

<p>There are lots of Apple sample code projects that use this design pattern.</p>

<p>Edit: just checked and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/DrillDownSave/Introduction/Intro.html">DrillDownSave</a> is a good example, as is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/SimpleDrillDown/Introduction/Intro.html">SimpleDrillDown</a>.</p>
