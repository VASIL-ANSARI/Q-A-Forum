<p>jQuery selectors always return collections of elements, even if there is only one. Methods that logically work with only one element will work only with the first element of the collection, even if invoked on a collection with more than one element. You can check the number of elements in your collection with the good old-fashioned .length property or the modern oo-fanatic .size() method. Both will return the same result.</p>

<p>You can iterate through a collection using good old for structure and access the current element with collection.eq(i). Alternately and preferably, you can execute a function on each element of the collection with collection.each(func). Function func will have the current element available as this.</p>

<p>And, seriously, you don't need to specify every element in the DOM tree in a selector. Of course jQuery will search in html and body because there's no other way in a proper html file. Best practice is to include minimal number of selectors needed to uniquely identify your element or elements you want to select. Never specify html and body. Never have two ids in your selector. Don't specify tbody unless the element you need can also occur in thead or tfoot and you don't need those occurrences. Things like that.</p>
