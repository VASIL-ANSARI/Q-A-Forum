<p>You can't access the bitmap data of a UIImage directly.</p>

<p>You need to get the CGImage representation of the UIImage. Then get the CGImage's data provider, from that a CFData representation of the bitmap. Make sure to release the CFData when done.</p>

<pre><code>CGImageRef cgImage = [image CGImage];
CGDataProviderRef provider = CGImageGetDataProvider(cgImage);
CFDataRef bitmapData = CGDataProviderCopyData(provider);
</code></pre>

<p>You will probably want to look at the bitmap info of the CGImage to get pixel order, image dimensions, etc.</p>
