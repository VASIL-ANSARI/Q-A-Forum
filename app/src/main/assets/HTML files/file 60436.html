<p>I made this work by adding the following:</p>

<pre><code>STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")]
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/howto/static-files/#configuring-static-files" rel="nofollow">docs</a> (after point 4):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your project will probably also have static assets that arenât tied to
  a particular app. In addition to using a static/ directory inside your
  apps, you can define a list of directories (STATICFILES_DIRS) in your
  settings file where Django will also look for static files.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please note that the <code>STATIC_ROOT</code> directory, where Django will output all collected static files found in each <code>&lt;app&gt;/static</code> and <code>STATICFILES_DIRS</code> directories, must be different.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
