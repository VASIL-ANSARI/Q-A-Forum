<p>A class with abstract methods has to be abstract. However, an abstract class doesn't have to have abstract methods.</p>

<p>Generally, <strong>a class should be abstract whenever it doesn't make sense conceptually for instances of that class to exist</strong>. Having incomplete implementation is one example of this (and it happens to be enforced by the compiler), but it's not the only example.</p>
