<p>The issue is resolved by putting a placeholder in this line</p>

<pre><code>...
[cell.imageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:postpictureUrl] placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"default"]];
....
</code></pre>

<p>The placeholder needs to have dimension ratio similar to the thumbnail to avoid distortion.</p>
