<p>Measure the necessary time and see yourself. As you say it is <strong>absolutely file system dependent</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>        long t1 = System.currentTimeMillis();
        ...Your File.exists call
        long t2 = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("time: " + (t2 - t1) + " ms");
</code></pre>

<p>You will see that it will always give you different results, since it depends also on the way your OS caches data, on its load etc.</p>
