<p>Since you only scale the original bitmap you might want to use the folllowing method</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(Bitmap src, int dstWidth, int dstHeight, boolean filter)
</code></pre>

<p>Complete code:</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap newBmp = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(ball, canvas.getWidth(), canvas.getHeight(), true);
canvas.drawBitmap(newBmp, 0, 0, p);
</code></pre>

<p>Consider moving the "newBmp" line to another method such as <code>onSizeChanged(...)</code>. <code>onDraw(...)</code> will get called pretty much all the time and it would be slow and wasteful to recreate the same bitmap all the time.</p>
