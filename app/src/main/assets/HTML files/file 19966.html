<p><a href="http://ws-i.org/profiles/BasicProfile-2.0-2010-11-09.html" rel="nofollow">WS-I Basic Profile</a> says the following about the xml:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Profile uses Web Services Description Language (WSDL) to enable the description of services as sets of endpoints operating on messages. This section of the Profile incorporates the following specifications by reference (...): <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-1-20041028/" rel="nofollow">XML Schema Part 1: Structures</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it references the XML Schema as something it is based on. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-1-20041028/#Complex_Type_Definition_details" rel="nofollow">In there, you'll find</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract complex types can be used as {base type definition}s, or even as the {type definition}s of element declarations, provided in every case a concrete derived type definition is used for Â·validationÂ·, either via xsi:type (Â§2.6.1) or the operation of a substitution group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-1-20041028/#declare-type" rel="nofollow">it defines</a> the construction <code>&lt;extension base="QName"&gt;</code> about which the document has a lot to say.</p>

<p>But all this is on a conceptual level, not necessarily directly relating it to object inheritance. While it's probably not too difficult to make such a mapping (and your link exactly show that), it is also not strictly defined. I guess that's what they talk about when raising the concerns.</p>

<p>So technically and syntactically, the construction is part of the standard, but the implementation might handle it in unforeseen ways. On the other hand, a tool adhering the standard, should be able to both accept and output valid WS-I XML, and perform validation as also specified in the <a href="http://ws-i.org/profiles/BasicProfile-2.0-2010-11-09.html" rel="nofollow">XML standard</a>.</p>

<p>To conclude, I'd say that any tool not able to handle your construction somehow, is not a valid WS-I implementation.</p>
