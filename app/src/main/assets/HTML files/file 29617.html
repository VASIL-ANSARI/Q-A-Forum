<p>Your web host needs to support Java and some Servlet container. If they don't already have those two things installed, you'll need to install them yourself. Once that is done, in Eclipse, you will need to export your project in the form of a <code>.war</code> file and place it in the appropriate folder of your Servlet Container. For example, with Tomcat, you would place it in its <code>/webapps</code> directory. You then start your Servlet Container. Your web application will be up and running.</p>
