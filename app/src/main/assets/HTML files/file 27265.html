<p>Change this:</p>

<pre><code>printf("%d and %d", &amp;hi, &amp;hello);
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>printf("%d and %d", hi, hello);
</code></pre>

<p>You want to print the <em>values</em> of the variables, not their addresses.</p>

<p>And if you did want to print their addresses, you'd need to use <code>%p</code> and convert the addresses to <code>void*</code>:</p>

<pre><code>printf("address of hi is %p\n", (void*)&amp;hi);
</code></pre>

<p>(You may have been confused by the fact that <code>scanf</code> requires addresses for the values it reads.)</p>

<p>You say that you get the correct behavior if you "define the variables hi and hello seperately as integers". I don't know what you mean; if you use <code>&amp;hi</code> and <code>&amp;hello</code> in your <code>printf</code> call, you're always going to get weird values.</p>
