<p>For a 30mil rows <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh213609.aspx" rel="nofollow">heap</a>, there's not many options. Without any index you can do basically nothing to speed it up. </p>

<p>Only solution is to <a href="http://www.patrickkeisler.com/2013/03/dealing-with-fragmented-heap.html" rel="nofollow">check a fragmentation</a> of a heap. You should add a clustered index to alleviate the table fragmentation, then drop it immediately. But if you cannot affect that table in any way, it could be faster to move all the data into a new table :-)</p>
