<p>You never read anything from <code>in</code>, therefore it has no chance of ever hitting <code>eof</code>.</p>

<p>Also, using <code>eof</code> in loop conditions is likely to lead to incorrect results, as explained in the following SO question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5605125/why-is-iostreameof-inside-a-loop-condition-considered-wrong">Why is iostream::eof inside a loop condition considered wrong?</a></p>

<p>(Generally, it's unclear what you're trying to do. <code>.jpg</code> is a 'binary' format, there is no sensible notion of 'converting a <code>.jpg</code> file to binary'.)</p>
