<p>I'm not sure of what you are trying to achieve, but you could use a horizontal LinearLayout as a row in the vertical LinearLayout you already have. Do you need the whole column to be clickable as a single entity? If you only need clickable elements aligned in columns like a PreferenceActivity, I would use a GridLayout instead.</p>
