<p>There are several types of "popups".</p>

<ol>
<li>Javascript dialogs - These are NOT HTML dialogs but are instead Javascript created dialogs. These consist of <code>alert()</code>, <code>confirm()</code>, and <code>prompt()</code> and can be handled with <a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/Alert.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Alert</code></a>.</li>
<li>HTML dialogs - These take on various forms depending on how they are formatted. If you right-click on the dialog and see the typical context menu for your browser, then it's an HTML dialog. They are part of the DOM of the current page so you can use Selenium to access this just as you would any other page (e.g., no window handles needed).</li>
<li>Browser window - These are actually another browser window that pops up and may look like a dialog, depending on how it's formatted. It's different than an HTML dialog because it can be moved outside of the current browser page frame. You will need to use window handles to access these windows as you would another tab in the browser. Once you get ahold of the window handle, you can access the HTML of the page like any other page.</li>
<li>Browser dialog - these take on various forms but are akin to System dialogs. They are not made up of HTML so they cannot be accessed by Selenium. Other than using a library to access them, you can interact with them in a limited fashion by sending keys such as <code>&lt;SPACE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ENTER&gt;</code>, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>What you have pictured is a (4) browser dialog. They it takes on different forms depending on the browser you do the action on. Your best course of action is probably send keys. Sometimes, depending on the browser, you can specify settings to autodownload a file to a specific location so that the dialog doesn't come up. I've never used this so I can't direct you there.</p>
