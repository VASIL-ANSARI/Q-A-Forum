<p>I think that your problem is the fact that you activity extends <code>MapActivity</code> which was correct for Google Map API V1, but shouldn't be used for Google Maps API V2. what should be used is a simple <code>Activity</code> or a <code>FragmentActivity</code> depending on which platform you are targeting.</p>

<p>In you case just try to change  this line:</p>

<pre><code>public class MapsActivity extends MapActivity {
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MapsActivity extends Activity {
</code></pre>

<p>if you still having problems you can go over this blog post I wrote to integrate Google Maps API V2 in your application and see if this helps you:</p>
