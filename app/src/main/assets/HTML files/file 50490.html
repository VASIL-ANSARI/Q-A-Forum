<p>Try to change "frame.add(panel);" to the position after you add the exit Button in your panel method. iI dont know if this work but you add the panel before you adding the Buttons. Seems little strange to me but maybe its correct.</p>

<p>*edit 
i think it should also be possible to add buttons after you add the panel to the frame but im not sure</p>
