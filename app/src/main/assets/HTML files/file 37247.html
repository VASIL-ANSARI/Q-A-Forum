<p>I do not think you can make it any simpler than what you have. One solution would be not to use 0 through 8 as your posted values but some code, for example:</p>

<pre><code>d1, d2, d7, d14, m1, m3, m6, y1
</code></pre>

<p>And then parse this code to determine what value to subtract from the current date. So for example:</p>

<pre><code>d1 --&gt; DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1)
m3 --&gt; DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-3)
</code></pre>

<p>It makes your solution more flexible but not simpler.</p>
