<p>I managed to work past this problem. It seems that some modules have problems when their initialization routines are called more than once, and <code>numpy</code>is one of those. The solution is to call <code>Py_Finalize()</code> only once at the very end of the program. <code>Py_Initialize()</code> can be called as many times as you want, as if Python is already initialized, <code>Py_Initialize()</code> is a non-op ...</p>

<p>And also, discovered that this solution turns the application faster since python doesn't need to restart every time there's a call to some of its function.</p>
