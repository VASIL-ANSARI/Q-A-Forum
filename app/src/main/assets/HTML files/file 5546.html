<p>It is a pointer to a <code>char</code>.</p>

<p>When declaring a pointer, the asterisk goes after the type and before the identifier, with whitespace being insignificant. These all declare <code>char</code> pointers:</p>

<pre><code>char *pointer1;
char* pointer2;
char * pointer3;
char*pointer4;    // This is illegible, but legal!
</code></pre>

<p>To make things even more confusing, when declaring multiple variables at once, the asterisk only applies to a single identifier (on its right). E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>char* foo, bar;    // foo is a pointer to a char, but bar is just a char
</code></pre>

<p>It is primarily for this reason that the asterisk is conventionally placed immediately adjacent to the identifier and not the type, as it avoids this confusing declaration.</p>
