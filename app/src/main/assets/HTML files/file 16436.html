<p>Derp, I read the whole question wrong. My bad.</p>

<p>What you could do, is that you have a conversion algorithm I suppose.
Each letter in the alphabet could have a value from the alphabet.</p>

<p>Then all you need to do, is match the letter you find, with a letter from you a string array, get it's index, and add 1 to it. Then you got the value. If that's how you wanna play.</p>
