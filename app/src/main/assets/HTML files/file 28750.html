<p>The way that would be most clean and follows standard pathing would be:</p>

<pre><code>/pricing/offer/234
/pricing/promo/345
/pricing/customer/543234
</code></pre>

<p>With the layout being: <code>/pricing/${offer|promo|customer|/${PathParamForId}</code></p>

<p>Which you could then do as three separate methods one each for offer/promo/customer.</p>

<p>Then you just have to make sure your API is well documented so users know the expected behaviors for the paths. (Difference between offer vs promo lookup and etc.)</p>
