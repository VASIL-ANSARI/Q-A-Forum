<p>You cannot mix <code>CMake</code> and <code>qmake</code> projects just like that. </p>

<p>I think your realistic options are (ignoring any possible license issues):</p>

<p>1) Change your project to use <code>CMake</code> instead of <code>qmake</code>. Then it would be simple to include <code>ntcore</code> as a sub-build and link to it</p>

<p>2) Pre-compile <code>ntcore</code> using <code>CMake</code> and use the library and headers only in your <code>qmake</code> project</p>
