<p>AppInvite does not provide the sender name/picture in the invitation. Since the invitation is sent either by email or sms directly from the senders phone, you will get the sender information from the tool you use to read the email or sms.</p>

<p>There isn't any way for the sender to determine if an invite is received since there isn't any api or web page to get this data.</p>

<p>There isn't any way to put a "fake", i.e. different, email into an invitation, it's sent using the gmail account used when creating the invitation and can't be overridden by the user to some other account. </p>
