<p>If I assume that the values are unique in each column, then the key idea is doing a join on the <em>second</em> column in the table followed by aggregation.</p>

<p>A <code>having</code> clause can count the number of matches and be sure that it matches the expected number in the first table:</p>

<pre><code>select t1.c1, t2.c1
from t1 join
     t2
     on t1.c2 = t2.c2
group by t1.c1, t2.c1
having count(*) = (select count(*) from t1 tt1 where tt1.c1 = t1.c1);
</code></pre>
