<p>I use a similar template engine, and i encountered (some time) similar problems... are you sure that the values that you are replacing are strings? If not cast them as strings.</p>

<pre><code>if ( isset ( $this-&gt;parameter ) )
{
    foreach ($this-&gt;parameter as $key =&gt; $value) {
        str_replace('{' . $key . '}', (string)$value,  $this-&gt;content);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
