<p>Unless I'm missing something, you should just be able to go into the codebehind for your SecondMasterPage file, and check the namespace of it.  Perhaps the namespace is incorrect or something different than you want.</p>

<p>In your base class, use a <code>using my.masterpage.namespace;</code> statement to get it to work.</p>
