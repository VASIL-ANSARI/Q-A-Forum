<p>Most probably you have a problem with your relative/absolute path , and how you link your CSS.</p>

<p>Please read more about <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/beginningtutorials/a/aa040502a.htm" rel="nofollow">relative/absolute patching here</a>  <a href="http://jeffreybarke.net/2013/06/paths-and-urls-relative-and-absolute/" rel="nofollow">or here</a></p>

<p>Easiest way to test is to put your entire path in your link </p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://yourwebsite/path-to-css/css/style.css"&gt;
</code></pre>
