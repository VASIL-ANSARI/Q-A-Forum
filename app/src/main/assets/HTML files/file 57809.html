<p>if you'd like to make sth I was looking for you've got three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>you need to write your own module ;) ,</li>
<li>you need to wait for "Domain Access" module for D8: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/domain" rel="nofollow">https://www.drupal.org/project/domain</a> ,</li>
<li>you can also use D7 and module from URL which I provide above.</li>
</ul>

<p>I chose 3rd option.</p>
