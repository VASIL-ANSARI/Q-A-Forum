<p>loop through the lines and apply regex to extract the data you are looking for, adding it into an initially empty list for each column you desire. </p>

<p>Once you have the column in list form you can apply max(list) min(list) avg(list) functions to the data to get whatever calculations you are interested in.</p>

<p>note: You may need to revise where you added the data to the list and convert the numbers from str to int form so that the max, min, avg functions can operate on them.</p>
