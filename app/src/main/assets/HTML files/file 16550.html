<p>The linked <a href="http://automapper.codeplex.com/workitem/3197">issue</a> more or less answers your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mapper.CreateMap is not threadsafe, nor will it ever be. However,
  Mapper.Map is thread-safe. The Mapper static class is just a thin
  wrapper on top of the MappingEngine and Configuration objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So only use <code>Mapper.CreateMap</code> if you do your configuration in <strong>one central place</strong> in a threadsafe manner.</p>

<p>Your comment was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm asking this because I'd like to configure automatter in-place,
  i.e. right before usage. I planned to configure it in non-concurrent
  context, i.e. ~ lock (mapperConfigLock) { Mapper.CreateMap()....; },
  and I fear this is not enough now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are doing in-place configuration just don't use the static <code>Mapper</code> class. As the comment on the github issue suggest use the mapping engine directly:</p>

<pre><code>var config = 
    new ConfigurationStore(new TypeMapFactory(), MapperRegistry.AllMappers());
config.CreateMap&lt;Source, Destination&gt;();
var engine = new MappingEngine(config);

var source = new Source();
var dest = engine.Map(source);
</code></pre>

<p>It's a little bit of more code but you can create your own helpers around it.
But everything is local in a given method so no shared state no need to worry about thread safety.</p>
