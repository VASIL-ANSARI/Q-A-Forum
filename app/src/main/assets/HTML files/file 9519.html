<p>I've done some work tracking high altitude balloons using GPS data. Unless you need your data to be reported in some type of numerical form, I would recommend using the Google Maps API. You can create a map and then add markers for each of the points in your GPS data set. This provides a nice graphical representation, but it won't work as nicely if you are dealing with smaller scales.</p>
