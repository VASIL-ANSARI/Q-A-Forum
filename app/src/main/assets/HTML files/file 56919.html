<p>You'll need to remove the <code>TOTAL</code> column from the group by, and therefore the select list. Because <code>TOTAL</code> is in your select list and group by it can't properly aggregate how you're expecting.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID, SUM(TOTAL)
FROM tablename
GROUP BY ID
</code></pre>

<p>To get your exact output:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT tablename.ID,
       TOTAL,
       TOTALSUM
FROM   (SELECT   ID,
                 SUM(TOTAL) AS TOTALSUM
        FROM     tablename
        GROUP BY ID) AS t
       INNER JOIN
       tablename
       ON tablename.ID = t.ID;
</code></pre>
