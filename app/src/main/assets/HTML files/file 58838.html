<p>The SDK manager can be used from the command line: <a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/updatingsdkfromcommand-line" rel="nofollow">http://tools.android.com/recent/updatingsdkfromcommand-line</a></p>

<p>One thing to note though is that that's actually a rather old version of the SDK manager and it's fed from a different set of data, i.e. the packages available in the standalone SDK manager will not necessarily match those in the Studio SDK manager.</p>
