<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIWindow_Class/UIWindowClassReference/UIWindowClassReference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIWindow/windowLevel">Each <code>UIWindow</code> has a <code>windowLevel</code>.</a>  A window is displayed in front of each window with a lower level, and behind each window with a higher level.</p>

<p>But what about two windows with the same level?  The window whose level was set more recently is in front, by default.  (âWhen a window enters a new level, itâs ordered in front of all its peers in that level.â)  The <code>makeKeyWindow</code> message makes a window key, but that window might be partially or completely hidden behind another window on the same level.  The <code>makeKeyAndVisible</code> message makes a window key, <strong>and</strong> moves it to be in front of any other windows on its level.</p>
