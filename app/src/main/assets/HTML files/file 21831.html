<p>Once you have attached with gdb to the busy looping process then call <code>rb_backtrace</code> from gdb:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; call rb_backtrace()
</code></pre>

<p>The output from <code>rb_backtrace</code> will be similar to a crash report, and the output will go to your log files similar to a standard Ruby error backtrace. </p>

<p>From there you should hopefully already be a step closer to the solution since you will see where in your Ruby code the process is stuck.</p>
