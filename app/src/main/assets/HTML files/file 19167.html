<p>Unfortunately, the YQL table <code>yahoo.finance.historicaldata</code> contains the same fields as the CSV files, specifically the opening price, closing price, high, low, volume, etc. To download this data using YQL, this is an example of the proper query:</p>

<pre><code>select * from yahoo.finance.historicaldata where symbol = "IBM" and startDate = "2012-01-01" and endDate = "2012-01-11"
</code></pre>
