<p>Try looking at the decompiled class file for <code>GcmListenerService</code> using your IDE.  When I do that with Android Studio for version 8.3.0, the code that appears to be throwing the exception is attempting to get the ACTION from the intent that invoked the service.  Because you are invoking the service with an explicit intent, the ACTION is null.</p>

<p>I'm wondering why you are invoking your subclass of <code>GcmListenerService</code> explicitly?  The normal GCM processing for message receipt is for the message to be delivered to <code>GcmReceiver</code>, which then passes it to the app's instance of <code>GcmListenerService</code> for processing.  You should not be invoking your listener service explicitly, <code>GcmReceiver</code> does that.  Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/google-services/tree/master/android/gcm/app/src/main/java/gcm/play/android/samples/com/gcmquickstart">sample project</a>.</p>
