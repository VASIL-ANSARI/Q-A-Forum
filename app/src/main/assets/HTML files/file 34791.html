<p>Where the source code of the Python standard library is located will depend on your operating system and on how you installed Python.  However, the following locations are common:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows - <code>C:\Python27\Lib</code></li>
<li>Linux - <code>/usr/lib/python2.7/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some builtins such as the <code>math</code> module are missing -- that's because those builtins are written in C and are baked directly into the interpreter for purposes of speed.</p>

<p>You should also consider taking a look at the source code for some popular 3rd party libraries. They'll vary in quality, but might be worth examining.
