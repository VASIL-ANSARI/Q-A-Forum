<p>Chances are that if you need to optimize to improve the performance of your application, that the code <em>inside</em> of the foreach loop is what needs to be optimized, not the string.Split method.</p>

<p><em>[EDIT:]</em></p>

<p>There are a number of good answers elsewhere on StackOverflow related to optimized string parsing:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4114604/241754">Fastest Way to Parse Large Strings (multi threaded)</a> </li>

</ul>

<p>String.Split() likely does more than you can do on your own to actually split the string up in a well-optimized manner. That assumes that you are interesting in returning true or false for each split section of your input, of course. Otherwise, you can just focus on searching your string.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned, if you need to search through a huge string (many hundreds of megabytes) and, especially, do so repeatedly and continuously, then look at what .NET 4 gives you with the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/csharpfaq/archive/2010/06/01/parallel-programming-in-net-framework-4-getting-started.aspx" rel="nofollow">Task Parallel Library</a>.</p>

<p>For searching through strings, you can look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228630.aspx" rel="nofollow">this example</a> on MSDN for how to use  IndexOf, LastIndexOf, StartsWith, and EndsWith methods. Those should perform better than the Contains method.</p>

<p>Of course, the best solution is dependent upon the facts of your particular situation. You'll want to use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.stopwatch.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch class</a> to see how long your implementations (both current and new) take to see what works best.</p>
