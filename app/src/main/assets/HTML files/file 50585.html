<p>You're looking for an HTTP server library that is not ASP.NET?</p>

<p>Awkwardly bypassing the question "What's wrong with ASP.NET?"....</p>

<p><a href="http://nancyfx.org/" rel="nofollow">Nancy</a> is an awesome lightweight open source library. You can find some <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy.Demo.Samples/tree/master/src/Nancy.Demo.Samples" rel="nofollow">samples on github</a>, although the samples are a bit on the heavy side. If you're looking for an extremely basic setup you can get away with a couple dozen lines of code. A good example is the console-based <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Self-Hosting-Nancy" rel="nofollow">self-hosted</a> sample.</p>

<pre><code>// add such a module class to your assembly, Nancy should find it automagically
public class ResourceModule : NancyModule
{
    public ResourceModule() : base("/products")
    {
        // would capture routes to /products/list sent as a GET request
        Get["/list"] = parameters =&gt; {
            return "The list of products";
        };
    }
}

// then start the host
using (var host = new NancyHost(new Uri("http://localhost:1234")))
{
   host.Start();
   // do whatever other work needed here because once the host is disposed of the server is gone 
   Console.ReadLine();
}
</code></pre>
