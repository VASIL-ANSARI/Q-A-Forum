<p>Ok this was easier than I thought.</p>

<p>You simply create a new action in "action wizard" then just select "Save to" your directory on the filesystem. You do not even need any javascript to do this.</p>

<p>The only problem I have is how do I put the action in the toolbar? It can only be found under "Action Wizard" tab.</p>
