<p>From a raw table, the actual query itself will take the same amount of time.  However, returning the results will vary.  And, for such a simple query, this might dominate the time.</p>

<p>If the table contains very large columns, then records would span multiple pages ("overflow" pages), then there might be a performance difference.  I do not think all the overflow pages are read into memory at once.  So, explicitly referencing only a subset of columns that does <em>not</em> include the large columns might be faster.  How this is handled in MySQL might also depend on the file system being used.</p>

<p>However, if the "table" is really a view, then it could have a big impact.  Also, some databases support computed/calculated columns.  If these were present, then that could have an effect on performance.</p>

<p>Also, some databases are "column" oriented, where the columns are actually stored separately.  In such a database, there could be a a big difference in performance between these versions of the query.</p>
