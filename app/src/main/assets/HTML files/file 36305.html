<p>I just scanned your website with wpscan for the sake of it, and here's your problem:</p>

<pre><code>[+] Interesting header: CF-RAY: 15644be6d86308d8-LHR
[+] Interesting header: SERVER: cloudflare-nginx
[+] Interesting header: X-CF-POWERED-BY: WP 1.3.14
[+] Interesting header: X-POWERED-BY: PHP/5.5.14
</code></pre>

<p>You're using Cloudflare :) , just login into your Control Panel and enable Development mode.</p>

<p><strong>I'll leave the old answer below, just in case someone finds this question and wants to know how to do a bit of troubleshooting:</strong></p>

<p>If you go at the top of your stylesheet you'll see the following comments:</p>

<pre><code>/*
Theme Name: Twenty Ten
Theme URI: http://wordpress.org/
Author: the WordPress team
[...]
Version: 1.4
[...]
*/
</code></pre>

<p>Just change your number version and Wordpress now will serve the stylesheet with the new version number, forcing your browser to re-download it, otherwise while you're under development you can register your CSS in that way (which is really handy):</p>

<pre><code>wp_enqueue_style( 'main-style', get_stylesheet_uri(), array(), time() );
</code></pre>

<p>This enforces to append a timestamp on the CSS as query variable, so your browser believes that's a new file and the new fresh CSS gets downloaded every time you refresh the page.</p>

<p>Generally the <code>CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + R</code> works without any problem, if you still see your old CSS even with those changes one of these is probably what is causing problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your website is using Cloudflare and you forgot to enable dev mode</li>
<li>Your wordpress is running a caching plugin</li>
<li>You're uploading your file in the wrong place</li>
</ul>

<p>Cheers</p>
