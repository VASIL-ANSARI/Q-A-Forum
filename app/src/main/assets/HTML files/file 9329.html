<p>2 tips from <a href="http://www.wpftutorial.net/10PerformanceTips.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, the first one might help for virtualizing the <code>ListBox</code>:</p>

<p>Virtualize lists and views by using a <code>VirtualizingStackPanel</code> as <code>ItemsPanel</code> for lists. This only creates the visible elements at load time. All other elements are lazy created when they get visible. Be aware that grouping or <code>CanContentScroll="True"</code> prevents virtualization!</p>

<p>Enable Container Recycling. Virtualization brings a lot of performance improvements, but the containers will be disposed and re created, this is the default. But you can gain more performance by recycle containers by setting <code>VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode="Recycling"</code></p>

<p>I did virtualization of my huge list of objects by the technique described <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WpfDataVirtualization.aspx" rel="nofollow">here on codeproject</a>, it works nicely</p>
