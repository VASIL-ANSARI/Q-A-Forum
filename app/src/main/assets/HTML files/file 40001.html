<p>I would probably try to put a try catch statement around the doGet to see if there is an exception that you are not properly catching and printing.</p>

<p>also this kind of looks dubious:</p>

<pre><code>Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
</code></pre>

<p>Trying to figure out why you need the system input on a servlet call.
Are you trying to type commands on a console on the server side?</p>
