<p>A Content URI is simply a unique string uri associated with a particular query - they do not need to be related to your underlying table structure.</p>

<p>The <code>"content://" + AUTHORITY + "/"</code> part of the URI attempts to ensure that the strings are unique (i.e., they don't conflict with other applications) by using an AUTHORITY that is unique to your application.</p>

<p>They have two main purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allowing your <code>query</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>delete</code> calls to easily distinguish between different queries (of course, you could use the <code>selection</code>, <code>projection</code>, or other parameters to do this, but often times the URI is much easier to quickly parse using a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/UriMatcher.html" rel="nofollow">UriMatcher</a>)</li>
<li>Allow you to call <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/Cursor.html#setNotificationUri%28android.content.ContentResolver,%20android.net.Uri%29" rel="nofollow">Cursor.setNotificationUri</a> on a returned <code>Cursor</code> which will automatically re-query the data when <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver.html#notifyChange%28android.net.Uri,%20android.database.ContentObserver%29" rel="nofollow">ContentResolver.notifyChange(uri, null)</a> is called (i.e., in your insert/update/delete calls). This is particularly useful when using the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/loaders.html" rel="nofollow">Loader Framework</a> and a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/CursorLoader.html" rel="nofollow">CursorLoader</a> to automatically receive callbacks when the underlying data changes.</li>
</ul>
