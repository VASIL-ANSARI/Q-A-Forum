<p>The Visual Studio IDE and the Visual C++ compiler are two separate entities. Specifically, they are two separate executables (<code>devenv.exe</code> for the IDE and <code>cl.exe</code> for the compiler) that run as separate processes. The IDE simply spawns the <code>cl.exe</code> process to perform the actual compilation.</p>

<p>The IDE has a list of keywords somewhere that simply tells the text editor which words to highlight. It isn't super sophisticated; it doesn't have to be. The compiler has the final say, not the syntax highlighter (or Intellisense for that matter).</p>

<p>As long as the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k8d11d4s.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>/clr</code> switch</a> is not being passed to the <code>cl.exe</code> process, the compiler will compile the code as native C++ (which is the default setting). The IDE simply feeds in the file paths of your source code and the compiler switches as command-line arguments to the <code>cl.exe</code> process. The syntax highlighting has no bearing on how the compiler interprets the code.</p>
