<p>I've faced problems with using wildcards in classpath when using JNI based programs. Try the <em>direct-jar-in-classpath</em> approach, such as the one generated in this sample code of mine at <a href="https://github.com/QwertyManiac/cdh4-libhdfs-example/blob/master/exec.sh#L3" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/QwertyManiac/cdh4-libhdfs-example/blob/master/exec.sh#L3</a>, and I believe it should instead work. The whole contained example at <a href="https://github.com/QwertyManiac/cdh4-libhdfs-example" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/QwertyManiac/cdh4-libhdfs-example</a> does work presently.</p>
