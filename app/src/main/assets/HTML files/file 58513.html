<p>I'm happy to hear you're building cool things with data-driven styling in GL JS. </p>

<p>There is no built-in solution to pull the min / max values from within a particular field in a layer. This is an unfortunate technical limitation. If you were to have a 1TB vector tile set that spans the whole world, we would need to download all 1TB of data to find the min / max values. </p>

<p>Some options you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're sourcing data from a GeoJSON file, you can parse it yourself to find the min / max values</li>
<li>If you only care about data visible within the current viewport you can use <code>querySourceFeatures</code> to get all values and parse it yourself to find the min / max values</li>
<li>If you're willing to do some sleuthing and use an undocumented Mapbox-specific API, we have an API that'll give you data about min / max values within an uploaded tile set. </li>
</ul>
