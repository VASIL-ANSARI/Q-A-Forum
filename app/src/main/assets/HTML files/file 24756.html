<p>the simplest solution i see that i think would solve your specific problem would be to have class BasePlayer not inherit from class BaseEntity.  </p>

<p>class Player will end up with the BaseEntity class characteristics because it inherits from class Entity which inherits from class BaseEntity, and class CPlayer will end up with BaseEntity class characteristics because it inherits from class CEntity which inherits from class BaseEntity.</p>
