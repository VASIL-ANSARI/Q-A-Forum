<p>A TCP connection is bound to following parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source address</li>
<li>Source port</li>
<li>Remote address</li>
<li>Remote port</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it's not intended to offer the possibilty to create one to many connections via one socket since this would be against the TCP definition.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol" rel="nofollow">Wiki-Article for TCP</a></p>

<p>So the solution would be to create multiple sockets, each holding one connection to a different server.</p>
