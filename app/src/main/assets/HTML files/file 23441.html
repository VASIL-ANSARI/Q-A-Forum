<p><code>oWB.Worksheets</code> is where you find the sheets.</p>

<p>Can take them by index <code>Worksheets[1]</code> (or 2, or 3...)</p>

<p>Can take them by name <code>Worksheets["SheetName"]</code></p>

<p>They come as object, so cast them to <code>(Worksheet)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Worksheet oSheet = (Worksheet)oWB.Worksheets["TheSheetYouWant"];
</code></pre>

<p>To change name: <code>oSheet.Name = "NewName";</code></p>
