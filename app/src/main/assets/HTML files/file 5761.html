<p>JQuery will not treat the call as returning json, because you have told it the call is returning <code>html</code>. You need to change your <code>dataType</code> to <code>json</code>.</p>

<p>However it isn't clear where you expect <code>openModel</code> to be called from. The code as it is will use the Microsoft AJAX code and insert the returned data into the page, which is why you are seeing your json appear on the page.</p>
