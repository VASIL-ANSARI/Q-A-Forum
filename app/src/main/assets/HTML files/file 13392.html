<p>We had the same issue (on devices running iOS 4.x only btw..)
The cause of it has been the use of mutable objects in the cache. We put a NSMutableDictionary in the cache and and manipulated it afterwards. Then when the cache was released (to be deallocated) something seems to have happened that later crashed the app on suspend.</p>

<p>Hope this also solves your issue!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>We found a solution thanks to <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/message/421845#421845" rel="nofollow">this dev forum entry</a>. It appears that <code>NSCache</code> prior to iOS 4.3 was not unregistering itself from the notification center.</p>

<p>We worked around this issue by creating a simple subclass of <code>NSCache</code> and implement the <code>-dealloc</code> method like so (ARC version):</p>

<pre><code>- (void)dealloc;
{
    // NSCache had an issue on iOS prior to 4.3 where it didn't unregister from notifications and caused crashes
    // see https://devforums.apple.com/message/421845#421845
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now use this class instead of <code>NSCache</code> and you should be okay. Fingers crossed. :)</p>
