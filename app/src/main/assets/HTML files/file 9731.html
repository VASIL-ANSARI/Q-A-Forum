<p>If I understand you right, you set in OnClosing the <code>Cancel</code>-property to <code>true</code> and therefore the window does not close. Now you look for a possibilty to close the window from your button click event although you have this OnClosing-event. Right?<br>
A possibility is to define a member variable which you set in the buttons event. In the OnClosing you only set e.Cancel to true, if this member variable is not set.</p>

<pre><code>class YourClass{
    bool m_closeAnyway;
    void OnClosing(....){
         if(!m_closeAnyway){
             e.Cancel=true;
         }
    }
    void ButtonClickEventHandler(...){
        m_closeAnyway=true;
        Close();
        DoTheRest();
    }
</code></pre>
