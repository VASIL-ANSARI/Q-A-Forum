<p>Taken from Java API on JLists: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Painting of cells in a JList is handled by a delegate called a cell renderer, installed on the list as the cellRenderer property. The renderer provides a java.awt.Component that is used like a "rubber stamp" to paint the cells. Each time a cell needs to be painted, the list's ListUI asks the cell renderer for the component, moves it into place, and has it paint the contents of the cell by way of its paint method. A default cell renderer, which uses a JLabel component to render, is installed by the lists's ListUI.</p>
