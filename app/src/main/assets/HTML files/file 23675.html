<p>If you're implementing the Comparator interface then you need to use this method (given that your class is generic with the Chromosome tpye): </p>

<pre><code>int compare(Chromosome o1, Chromosome o2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, it seems the more appropriate interface to implement in your case is Comparable. <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html</a> </p>

<pre><code>int compareTo(Chromosome o)
</code></pre>

<p>Comparable is typically implemented to give instances of your class a natural ordering. Comparator is typically a separate class to what you're trying to compare, and can be used to give you several different types of orderings.  </p>

<p>Regardless of what you're implementing, the class also needs to be typed: </p>

<pre><code>class Chromosome implements Comparable&lt;Chromosome&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise the arguments should be Object, not Chromosome. </p>
