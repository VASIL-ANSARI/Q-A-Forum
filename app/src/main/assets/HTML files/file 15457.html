<p>What did you think <code>new OuterClass()</code> does if not explicitly create an instance of it? :)</p>

<p>You did not explicitly <em>store a reference to it</em>, but that is a different thing.  Invoking the constructor makes an instance, regardless of what you do with the result.  The inner class has a built in <code>$this</code> reference back to the outer class, so there will always be a reference to it kept around as long as you keep the inner class.</p>

<p>Whether using an inner class is <em>ever</em> a good idea is a historically contentious topic, but there's nothing specifically wrong with that particular usage.</p>
