<p>I'm not an expert on meteor but I think I know what went wrong here.
You will notice that function toggleSearchBottom is called only once. When the page loads it will trigger once, the class will be assigned and that's it. </p>

<p>Meteor has no way of knowing that you want to trigger this function each time esInput field's value has changed. 
This might be slightly confusing because Meteor is so smart when working with sessions and collections, but those automatic bindings do not work for arbitrary DOM.</p>

<p>You will have to take a bit different approach, I created a <a href="http://meteorpad.com/pad/JYwqGzp9ueYhoKDha/Copy%20of%20Leaderboard" rel="nofollow">MeteorPad</a> with an example. But this is the core of solution:</p>

<pre><code>Template.body.events({
    "keyup .esInput": function(event) {
      if($(event.target).val().length &gt; 0) {
        $("#state").addClass("hide");
      } else
      {
        $("#state").removeClass("hide");
      }
    }
});
</code></pre>
