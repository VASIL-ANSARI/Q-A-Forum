<p>It seems you have SQL Server installed already....Perhaps VS skips installing SQL Express if you have full blown SQL Server installed.  (Usually SQL Express is normal SQL with some limitations...Unless I misunderstand you somehow).  Can you see your databases in Management Studio?  Can you connect to your server?  If so, check the Properties of the SQL Server...it may indeed be SQL Server (Express)</p>

<p>Otherwise have you checked the install material for the SQL Express installation? Perhaps you can run that manually.</p>
