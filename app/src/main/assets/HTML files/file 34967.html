  <p>Main objective is to convert a dd/MM/yyyy to yyyy-MM-dd "date" format to fit in SQL</p>

<p>Don't! You should avoid string conversions as far as you possibly can. Keep your data in its natural representation for as much of the time as you can.</p>

<p>You may well need to parse the date from <code>dd/MM/yyyy</code> to <code>DateTime</code> to start with (although if you can avoid even this, do so - we don't know where your data comes from), but then you should <em>leave</em> it as a <code>DateTime</code>. Use parameterized SQL instead, passing the value of the parameter to the database as a <code>DateTime</code>. Of course, you should <em>also</em> make sure that the fields in your database are using the appropriate type to start with (not <code>varchar</code>). Ensuring that your schema matches your data is crucial to running a sane system.</p>

<p>The parsing part should be relatively simple. For example:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime date = DateTime.ParseExact(text, "dd/MM/yyyy",
                                    CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
</code></pre>

<p>You <em>may</em> want to use a user's culture instead (depending on where the data has come from) and you <em>may</em> want to use <code>DateTime.TryParseExact</code> instead (if this is user-entered data rather than something from machine-to-machine communication).</p>
