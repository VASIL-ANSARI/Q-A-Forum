<p>The database stores date/time values as a string internally. When you retrieve it through Django, then Django casts this into a <code>datetime.datetime</code> object for your convenience. If you retrieve the value directly from the database yourself, you will get the raw string and will therefore need to do any casting yourself.</p>
