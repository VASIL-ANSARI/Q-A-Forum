<p>I found the mistake that I was doing was, <code>redir</code> command was redirecting wrong. Since I have to redir from emulator(5070 Port) to server(5080 Port). </p>

<p>I change to this</p>

<pre><code>redir add udp:5070:5080
</code></pre>

<p>instead of </p>

<p><code>redir add udp:5080:5070</code></p>

<p>Since I have to recieve response from server therefore server has to redirect my packets to my emulator.
