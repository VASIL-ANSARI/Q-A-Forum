<p>I just ran into this problem myself. This happens because fields of type enum are being passed back to the browser serialized as their enum names, but @Html.EnumDropDownListFor generates its option values as integers. The browser can't match up the two so the dropdown stays at its default selection.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways to get around this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the view model's enum field to serialize properly as an int.</li>
<li>Write a dropdown generator that uses enum names as option values.</li>
<li><p>Use javascript to manually select the option (includes razor syntax here)</p>

<pre><code>$("#YourDropdownID option").each(function () {
    if ($(this).html() == '@(Html.DisplayFor(o => o.YourEnumFieldName))') {
        $(this).attr("selected", "selected");
        return;
    }
});</code></pre></li>
</ol>
