<p>in main document:</p>

<pre><code>function showevent(){
$('#book').slideToggle('slow', function() {
    // Animation complete.
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>inside iframe:</p>

<pre><code>window.parent.showevent();
</code></pre>

<p>running this inside iframe will cause the function to run. And you have to catch the click event inside the iframe - you can't otherwise.</p>

<p>edit:
 1. My bad: i put document.parent here instead of window.parent - fixed now
 2. Your bad: when you use jquery to assign click events to things, you have to be sure these things already exist. all jquery code should be wrapped in <code>$(document).ready(function(){/*your code here*/});</code> That's why it had no chance of working for you.</p>
