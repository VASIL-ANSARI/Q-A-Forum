<p>You don't need that loop.</p>

<p>Consider your business class creating your <code>FileSystemWatcher</code> and signing for it's events, and all other stuff your need.</p>

<p>On <code>ServiceBase.OnStart</code> override, you'll create an instance from your business class and to place it into a class level variable (a field, for instance).</p>

<p>On <code>ServiceBase.OnStop</code> override, you'll clean anything you need.</p>

<p>And that's it. You don't need to deal with background threads or anything else.</p>
