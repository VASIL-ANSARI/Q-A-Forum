<p>Postbacks are triggered using __doPostBack('uniqueidofcontrol', 'commandname'); so when the list changes value (I believe in onchange event), it posts to the server.  You would need to not set autopostback.  What you would need to do is tap into the  click event (if there is one) and then call __doPostBack(..) method upon that event.</p>

<p>HTH.</p>
