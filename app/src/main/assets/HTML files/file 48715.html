<p>From code it seems you are iterating through sheets (<code>for (int j = 0; j &lt; sheetNames.Length; j++)</code>) so it is possible that for first sheet you have rangeNames[j] value ("$A$1:$A$10") and on other sheets you don't.</p>

<p>From what I remember Excel by default creates 3 sheets, so that's probably the problem.</p>
