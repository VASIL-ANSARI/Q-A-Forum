<p>Because addition <em>doesn't</em> take precedence over subtraction. Both have the same precedence, and are associated left to right., so <code>5 - 1 + 4</code> is equivalent to <code>(5 - 1) + 4</code>.</p>

<p>(The order of evaluation is unspecified, which matters only if the operands have side effects.)</p>
