<p>Actually the real question is "why does <code>std::list</code> have a <code>sort</code> member when there's a perfectly good <code>std::sort</code> algorithm?". (Note: <code>std::sort</code> is how you sort <code>vector</code> and most other containers)</p>

<p>When you look at the question that way it becomes clear that <code>list</code> is the exception to the rule, implementing its own member sort function because for list specifically it can be implemented more efficiently.</p>

<p>This is exactly analogous to <code>std::find</code> and <code>std::map::find</code> where <code>map</code> provides its own find function that works much more efficiently.</p>
