<p>I never used this plugin, but as I looked inside the last release from 2007! I have to say that this plugin can not store data persistent. It's somehow nothing else than a kind of stack with limited number of items to store data related to the current document.</p>

<p>You need to work with cookies or <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/" rel="nofollow">webstorage</a> to keep data available after a refresh.</p>
