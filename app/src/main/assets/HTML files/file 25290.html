<p>So it turns out the solution was related to order of operations.  I was unable to work with the dom node because it had not been added to the dom yet.  It was just a javascript object.  Once I created the <code>Dialog</code> and set the dom node as the <code>content</code> for the <code>Dialog</code>, the dom node was added into the dom and I could access <code>#printLayers</code> using <code>dom.byId("printLayers")</code>.</p>
