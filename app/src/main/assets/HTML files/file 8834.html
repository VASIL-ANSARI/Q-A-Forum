<p>Very simple: you are removing the current item from <code>dirs</code> while iterating over it. That means you skip two forward on the next loop. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6260089/strange-result-when-removing-item-from-a-list/6260097#6260097">here</a>.</p>

<p>If what I said wasn't clear, say you iterate over this list of numbers:</p>

<pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...]
 ^
</code></pre>

<p>That's the state of the list initially; then <code>1</code> is removed and the loop goes to the second item in the list:</p>

<pre><code>[2, 3, 4, 5, 6...]
    ^
</code></pre>

<p>Since you've removed <code>1</code> <em>and</em> moved forward by one in the list, now you're at <code>3</code>, not <code>2</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[2, 4, 5, 6...]
</code></pre>

<p>Then you remove <code>3</code>... and so on.</p>
