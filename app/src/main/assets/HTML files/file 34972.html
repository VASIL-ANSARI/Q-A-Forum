<p>The disk quota is the maximum amount of data you're allowed to store in a given disk or location. You should first verify if you're making proper use of your disk space (i.e., do you have thousands of temporary files you no longer need but failed to remove?). If you actually decide you simply need more space, you should contact your hosting provider and upgrade your plan.</p>
