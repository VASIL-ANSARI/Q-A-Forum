<p>First of all, this is really bad pratice, it's hard to follow the code for someone new and is a potential bug source. Instead of returning urself every time, change your design.</p>

<p>Change your function to this:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub AddRecord(SomeVariable)
    lstRecords.Add(New Record()) &lt;--- should't you be doing something with SomeVariable?!
    If lstRecords.Count = 200 Then
        Me.ProcessTheRecords()
    end if
End Function


Private Sub ProcessTheRecords()
   'Do stuff in here
   Me.lstRecords.clear()
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Now AddRecord does exactly what it says it does - it adds a new record and modifies the recordSet. ProcessTheRecords does the processing, as its supposed to do, and if u need to clear the list container - oh well, just clear it.</p>

<p>I strongly recommed to read this wiki article about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29" rel="nofollow">Cohesion</a>.</p>

<p>Just as a proposiontion, the AddRecord could be a function of return type <code>Boolean</code>, which indicates the success of the operation (maybe an error or exception can be raised by the processing function?).</p>

<p>It's much cleaner now, isn't it?</p>
