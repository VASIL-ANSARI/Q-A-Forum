<p>I believe this has to do with the fact that aspx pages are (re?)compiled on first load by IIS rather than being compiled in Visual Studio.  This allows them to be updated on the fly without recompiling, however since they're compiled by IIS it brings the complications you're seeing.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of a way to have IIS use the C#4 compiler but compile to .NET 3.5 so it seems like your only options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Update to .NET 4</li>
<li>Don't use optional parameters</li>
<li>Don't call code that uses optional parameters in your .aspx files.  I'm guessing if you move the calls to the codebehind file it should work fine, but I haven't tried it.</li>
</ol>
