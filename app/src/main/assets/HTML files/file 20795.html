<p>The quotes are breaking your string! In this cases I usually take the part of string that is between this quotes and put it in a variable. For example $setcustomvar="'_setCustomVar\'" and then you add it in your echo code like this:</p>

<pre><code>'&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;_gaq.push([\'.$setcustomvar.'
</code></pre>

<p>etc..</p>

<p>and like the others are saying you can't put an echo inside a string.</p>
