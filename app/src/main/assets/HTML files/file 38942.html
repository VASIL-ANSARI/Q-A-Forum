<p>I got it fixed and glad to share the answer back.</p>

<p>ISSUE CAUSE:</p>

<p>The issue was that I was following some procedure which was not supported to php 5.2. The link of that document is as below:</p>

<p><a href="http://phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/installation.html" rel="nofollow">http://phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/installation.html</a></p>

<p>I used pear to uninstall PHPUnit which did not uninstall it properly and the binary was left in the system.</p>

<p>SOLUTION:</p>

<p>For php 5.2 we require to install phpunit 3.6 from:
<a href="http://phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/installation.html" rel="nofollow">http://phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/installation.html</a></p>

<p>Even then When phpunit command was executed, it shown the below mentioned result.</p>

<p>[root@localhost]# phpunit
-bash: /usr/local/bin/phpunit: No such file or directory</p>

<p>We need to Remove the binary left at /usr/local/bin/phpunit because pear installed the binary at:
/usr/bin/phpunit</p>

<p>The solution was to run phpunit through: /usr/bin/phpunit or copy the binary to /usr/local/bin/phpunit</p>

<p>cp /usr/bin/phpunit /usr/local/bin/</p>
