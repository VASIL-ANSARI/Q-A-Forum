<p>You should avoid synchronous methods on a server.  They are available as a convenience for single user utility scripts.</p>

<p>The first one runs only once since it is a synchronous method.  The * get route is not setup until after it returns.</p>

<p>The second will run when any http request comes to the server.  And yes, it will block the whole server for the duration of that synchronous call (I/O cost to open and read the contents of the file).  Don't do that.</p>
