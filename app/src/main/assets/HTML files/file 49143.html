<p>That depends on whether you serialized it using a serialization format for which a .NET implementation of a deserializer exists.</p>

<p>If there exists a deserializer, then you can.</p>

<p>If there doesn't exist a deserializer, then you can't.</p>

<p>Of course, if there doesn't exist a deserializer <em>yet</em>, you can still write one yourself, or hire someone to do it. Depending on the serialization format, it may be easier or harder to do that. JSON is fairly language-neutral, and thus trivial, Ruby Marshal, Python Pickle, Java Serialization, are fairly closely tied to the language, and thus much harder.</p>
