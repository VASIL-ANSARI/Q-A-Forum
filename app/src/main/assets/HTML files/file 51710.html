<p>I solved this problem. It appears to me that the UI is difficult to understand when getting in to Java. I can't recall exactly how I fixed this, but for those who may come to this thread facing similar issues, dig deep in to how your UI works, and check out this video to better understand how layouts work in UI in Android:</p>

<p>After watching this video, IIRC, I figured out that one of my layouts was overlapping another and that the textviews were never being created. I ultimately broke the entire code apart. I stopped using File reader and writer and began using Shared Preferences, which work phenomenally better at simple tasks like I'm trying to accomplish. Again, consider your UI, watch the video to better understand how to get started with UI, and look at how complicated your UI is. More than likely, you are trying to do too much too fast, which was my case. :)</p>
