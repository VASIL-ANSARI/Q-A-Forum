<p>In case you are using an older version of Aspose.Words, I would suggest you please upgrade to the latest version (v15.6.0) from <a href="http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.words-for-java/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If the problem still remains, please report the issue in <a href="http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/aspose.words-product-family/75/showforum.aspx" rel="nofollow">Aspose.Words forum</a> with the input html.</p>

<p>I work with Aspose as Developer evangelist.</p>
