<p>You are passing the same <code>StringTokenizer</code> object to both methods.  But you are using up all the tokens in whichever method is called first, because each method consumes all tokens in a <code>while</code> loop.  So the method that is called second has no more tokens and doesn't print any tokens.</p>
