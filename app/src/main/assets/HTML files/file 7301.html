<p>I can see two immediate possibilities.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Eclipse search functionality is not up to scratch, either because it's buggy (unlikely) or the actual definition of that item is held somewhere outside its scope (say, for example, you're including a header that isn't in the project).</p></li>
<li><p>The actual definition is not <em>in</em> a source file at all but possibly in an object file or library, in which case you probably <em>shouldn't</em> be worried about the definition - it's "hidden" for reasons of encapsulation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Granted, these are guesses, but it's the best I can do with the information given, and I'd at least like to <em>think</em> that they're educated guesses :-)</p>
