<p>Try adding <code>-i-static -static-libcxa</code> to the final linkage.</p>

<p>This should force static linking for intel libraries only.</p>

<p>(You can also try <code>-static</code> as littleadv suggested in the comment, but this will produce a huge static executable with no shared libraries at all)</p>

<p>One more note: A simple workaround would be to copy the executable with the required shared libraries (those that do not exist at the host) to the same directory. Then set <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.</code> before running your dynamically linked executable. This will force searching for libraries in the current directory as well as system directories.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just noticed you said "windows machine". The above is relevant to UNIX machines so probably not useful to you. I'll leave it here in case someone needs the information.</p>
