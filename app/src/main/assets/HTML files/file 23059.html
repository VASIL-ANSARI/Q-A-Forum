<p>This is because of FastDev. Developing for Android in combination with the Android emulator Titanium also starts a FastDev Server.</p>

<h3>What is FastDev?</h3>

<p>Well, in short FastDev allows replaces resources for the app on-the-fly. If you change a *.js-File and click on run the file which is used for the emulator is simply replaced by your changed file. This is possible because on emulator titanium is interpreted just in time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fastdev server enables Titanium developers writing Android apps to
  rapidly test and see the changes they make in code. Instead of
  re-deploying the app after changes are made, the app requests whatever
  it needs under Resources from the Fastdev server. In other words, when
  Fastdev is running and your app requests app.js (or just about
  anything under Resources), the latest version of app.js on your dev
  machine gets served up to the app â there is no need for the full
  build-and-release process.</p>
  
  <p>Currently Fastdev is only supported for the Android Emulator, but it
  will also be supported for devices in an upcoming release.</p>

<p>And FastDev - unfortunately - is not available for Devices till today.</p>
