<p>I figured it out after petelids told me to look at the XML from the excel spreadsheet. My original program kept crashing from what I though was ternary conditional always being true, even when the particular excel cells were not using SharedStrings. However, the xml shows that while the cells with the t="s", the ones that do not have SharedStrings do not, meaning that the non-sharedString cells did not have a corresponding DataType. Because of this, the code was failing because of <code>DataType</code> attribute of the <code>(((Cell)r.ChildElements[0])</code>, which was actually null, so trying to get the <code>Value</code> of it resulted in a null pointer exception. To fix this, I ended up simply checking to see if the <code>DataType</code> was null. When it was, then I just got the inner xml contents. When it was not, then I used the xml contents as the SharedStringsTable index to find the actual string. Case closed!</p>
