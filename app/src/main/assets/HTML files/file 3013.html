<p>It doesn't seem unreasonable to me, but I don't think it's really necessary. There are select1st and select2nd, from the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/select1st.html" rel="nofollow">SGI STL Guide</a>:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
  map&lt;int, double&gt; M;
  M[1] = 0.3;
  M[47] = 0.8;
  M[33] = 0.1;

  transform(M.begin(), M.end(), ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(cout, " "),
            select1st&lt;map&lt;int, double&gt;::value_type&gt;());
  // The output is  1 33 47.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, and of course, there are compose1 and compose2 when you want to do more than just feed them to some insert or output iterator directly.</p>
