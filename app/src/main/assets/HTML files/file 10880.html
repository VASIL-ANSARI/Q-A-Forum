<p>You would be better off editing your original question than raising a new one but the answer is that you are confusing your quotes and not concatenating the variable into the string, Should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>SQL = "UPDATE Test SET Com = '''" &amp; strFile &amp; "''' WHERE Com IS NULL OR Com = ''"
</code></pre>

<p>Surrounding your strFile with quotes is causing it to be treated as as string literal rather than getting the value of the string variable itself.</p>
