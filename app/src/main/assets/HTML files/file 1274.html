<p>What do you mean by no add on libraries? win32 is an external library, as is libX11, etc. Dev-C++ makes me think that you want pure win32. In that case, you want the common controls. I found this after a quick google: <a href="http://hyper.sunjapan.com.cn/~hz/win32/commctl2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hyper.sunjapan.com.cn/~hz/win32/commctl2.htm</a> . Hopefully it helps!</p>
