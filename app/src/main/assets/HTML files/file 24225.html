<p>Your file reading code is a bit odd (it has some minor redudance) but I don't think it's the problem. Typically (following the msdn example) the while loop is written as such;</p>

<pre><code>  string line;
  while ((line = sr.ReadLine()) != null) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally as suggested in the comments you can just used <code>string[] lines = File.ReadAllLines(fileName);</code> and then loop over the lines with your split logic in the middle. I suggest removing <code>EndOfStream</code> from your code and using one of the other two approaches. I don't know that it will fix your problem, but that stands out as something that is not exactly normal.</p>

<p>Also, your output is bad because you're not appending to the text box, you're setting it's value. This means you're only going to see the length of the final line in the file. If you want to see the length of each line it needs to be <code>OutputConsole.Text += lineWords.Length + " ";</code> In case you weren't aware there is an implicit cast done there so there is no need for your explicit cast which just makes the code less readable.</p>
