<p>Maybe a <code>string</code> in ruby is mutable? Then having an <code>Array</code> isn't really an obvious choice - the length could change, for instance. But you will still want to enumerate the characters...</p>

<p>Also, you don't really want to be passing around the <em>actual</em> storage for the characters of a string, right? I mean, I don't remember much ruby (it's been a while), but if I were designing the interface, I'd only hand out "copies" for the <code>.chars</code> method/attribute/whatever. Now... Do you want to allocate a new array each time? Or just return a little object that knows how to enumerate the characters in the string? Thus, keeping the implementation hidden.</p>

<p>So, no. Most people don't think of a string as an array of chars. Most people think of a string as a string. With a behavior defined by the library/language/runtime. With an implementation you only need to know when you want to get nasty and all private with stuff below the abstraction belt.</p>
