<p>A simplified code sample that demonstrates this leak would be helpful. Just from your description, is it possible that the call you're using to add imgData to the dictionary is retaining it? If you're not then immediately releasing imgData in your own code, you'll have a retain count of 2. When your local imgData pointer goes out of scope, you will have leaked the memory. This is just a stab in the dark without a code sample, though.</p>
