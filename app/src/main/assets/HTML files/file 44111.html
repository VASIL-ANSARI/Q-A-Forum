<p>The more appropriate way to do that is not by checking the server but rather the cluster (which may contain multiple servers) and you can access it directly from the <code>MongoClient</code> instance:</p>

<pre><code>public bool IsClusterConnceted
{
    get
    {
        return _client.Cluster.Description.State == ClusterState.Connected;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like to check a specific server that's also possible:</p>

<pre><code>public bool IsServerConnceted
{
    get
    {
        return _client.Cluster.Description.Servers.Single().State == ServerState.Connected;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that the value is updated by the last operation so it may not be current. The only way to actually make sure there's a valid connection is to execute some kind of operation.</p>
