<p>A string is just textual information. You could open in Notepad, display it in your console, send it in an email, etc. It doesn't carry any intrinsic meaning or function.</p>

<p>An XML document is an object which is constructed <em>from</em> a string. It gives you functions just like working with the DOM. You can search for nodes, add nodes, remove nodes, etc.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> A string is just text, an XML document is an object.</p>
