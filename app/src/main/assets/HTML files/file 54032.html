<p>Since you didn't assign any aliases to the empty columns, they're all named with the same empty string. But an associative array can't have duplicate keys, so you only get one empty column when you use <code>mysqli_fetch_assoc</code>. Instead, use <code>mysqli_fetch_row</code>, which returns a numeric-indexed array.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could assign aliases to the empty columns.</p>

<pre><code>$query = "SELECT client_last_name,'' AS empty1, '' AS empty2, '' AS empty3, '' AS empty4, client_first_name FROM billing_line_item"; 
</code></pre>
