<p>As @Robert point out in the comment, the warning suggests compatibility issue. I finally solved the problem by installing the 64-bit Enthought Canopy python distribution, the other steps are the same as described in the question.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that mingw can be installed by Enthough Canopy package manager as well, so you don't have to download independent mingw if you are using the distribution.</p>
