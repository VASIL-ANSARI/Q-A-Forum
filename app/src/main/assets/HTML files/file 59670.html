<p>Globalize (1.1.x) deduces the minus sign symbol from CLDR when parsing. In Swedish (sv), the minus sign is <code>â</code> (0x2212) not - (0x2D) as you have used in your example above. That's why it doesn't work for you. A quick test to assert parsing for negative numbers is:</p>

<pre><code>var sv = Globalize("sv");
sv.parseNumber(sv.formatNumber(-100)) === -100; // &gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>Having said that, it seems like "Loose Matching" is a feature that might be of your interest. It would normalize the different types of dashes, no-break space to space, comma used as abbreviation, etc before parsing. It's not supported by Globalize. We track such feature here:</p>
