<p>I figured it out. It was a newbie mistake. The Bottle documentation says that if you want to use Bottle with mod_wsgi, toward the end of the file, you should use this:</p>

<pre><code>application = default_app()
</code></pre>

<p>After getting a better understanding of how this all works, I realized I was sending the wrong application object to mod_wsgi. Instead, I should have used this:</p>

<pre><code>application = app #app was defined earlier in the example application
</code></pre>
