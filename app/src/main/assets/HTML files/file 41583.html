<p>If it's a wave file you just need to open it up, parse the header and within it you'll find the length of the audio data. There are a lot of questions on SO dealing with the format.</p>

<p>Basically you need the Subchunk2Size which is in bytes divided by NumChannels divided by the number byte per sample (BitsPerSample/8). That will give you the length in samples. If you need the time in seconds divide that by the sample rate.</p>
