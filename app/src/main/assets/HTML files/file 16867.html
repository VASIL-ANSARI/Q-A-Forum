<p>The reason the animation does not occur is because the div is already in it's final destination, so when it attempts to animate to that destination, it simply does not move.</p>

<p>If instead of just hiding the div, you animated it back to its original position, or even just made it jump back to its original position after it is hidden, the bounce in  animation would occur again the way you would like it to.</p>

<p>Also, you will want to show the div before you animate it, not after.</p>

<p><strong>Some other notes:</strong></p>

<p>It is typically considered best practice not to use inline code in your HTML file. Instead you would want to use an external file which references ids or classes to apply event handlers. This not only makes you HTML and javascript easier to read and traverse, but allows for easier changes after the fact.</p>

<p><em>HTML file</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="externaljsfile.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div id="popup"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;input id="showButton" type="button" value="show and animate popup" /&gt;
&lt;input id="hideButton" type="button" value="hide" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>JS file</em></p>

<pre><code>$( document ).ready( function() { // runs code once the DOM has loaded
   var $popup = $( '#popup' );

   $( '#showButton' ).click( function() {
      $popup.show();
      $popup.animate( {
         top: ( ( $( window ).height() / 2 ) - ( $popup.outerHeight() / 2 ) ) - 70
      }, 1000, 'easeOutBounce' );
   } );

   $( '#hideButton' ).click( function() {
      // move back to original position here.
      $popup.hide();
   } );
} );
</code></pre>
