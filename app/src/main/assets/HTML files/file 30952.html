<p>If the page you are on is an https page, and the page .get is trying to access is http, then that will not work due to same origin. However, you could just write out the ajax instead of short handing it with .get :) </p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type: "GET", 
    url: "https://someurl"
});
</code></pre>

<p>Though I suppose to be fair, that is still a short of true javascript</p>
