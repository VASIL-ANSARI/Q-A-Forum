<p>You first need to get the event Id with an ajax post:</p>

<pre><code>function uploadClick(){
   var eventId = getEvent();
   uploadFile(eventId)
}

function getEvent(){
   // make an ajax and return your id
}
</code></pre>

<p>One you got it, then create an URL with a query string indicating the eventId. this URL is where you want to post your file:</p>

<pre><code>function uploadFile(eventId){
    // attatch the id to the URL with query string
    url = url + '&amp;eventId=' + eventId;

    // submit here your file
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can post in the same ajax call the file itself and the event id. In you server side action you need to get this query string and then pick the posted file.</p>
