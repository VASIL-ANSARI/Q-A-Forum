<p>I don't think you want it to "crash", but you need to indicate an error of some sort.  Because  the method isn't returning <code>void</code>, returning nothing is a compiler error.</p>

<p>Instead, throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.</p>

<pre><code>else throw new IllegalArgumentException("Illegal operator: " + operator);
</code></pre>

<p>Just make sure you actually return a valid value at the end:</p>

<pre><code>return number;
</code></pre>
