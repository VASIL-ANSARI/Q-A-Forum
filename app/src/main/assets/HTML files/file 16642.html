<p>Working on this issue right now.  The solution I'm thinking of trying is suggested here:
<a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/74229/" rel="nofollow">http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/74229/</a></p>

<p>The idea is to set the simple product visible in search instead of not individually visible.  Then in the product template check if the simple product is part of a group.  If so JavaScript redirect to the grouped product page.</p>

<p>Still thinking about a cleaner solution but thought this might be of some help.</p>
