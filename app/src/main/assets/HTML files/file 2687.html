<p>In your first action, Detail,</p>

<pre><code>TempData["some-key-here"] = b;
</code></pre>

<p>In the action you want to receive the object, SomeAction</p>

<pre><code>SomeObjectY b = (SomeObjectY)TempData["some-key-here"];
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: you don't need the parameters in the RedirectToAction this way.</p>
