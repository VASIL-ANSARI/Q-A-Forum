<p>Your code is executing on the Event Dispatch Thread, so you can't use a Thread.sleep() since that will block the EDT and prevent it from repainting the GUI.</p>

<p>You need to use a separate Thread for you database processing. Read the section from the Swing tutorial on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html" rel="nofollow">Concurrency</a> for more information as well as a solution that uses a <code>SwingWorker</code> to manager this Thread for you.</p>
