<p>What Jeremy is talking about is a little different than your case. Quoting from the article</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many developers forget that functions are values in JavaScript. When you declare a function in your code, the JavaScript engine creates a corresponding function objectâa value that can be assigned to a variable or passed to another function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your case, you are assigning the value of handler to the click on another element, so on click of the element, the hander function will get called directly in context of the original create_event. Assume the following code:</p>

<pre><code>function create_event(el, randomValue){
   el.click(handler);

   function handler(){
        alert(randomValue);
   }
}

create_event(document.getElementById('sample'), 5000);
create_event(document.getElementById('sample1'), 'abc');
</code></pre>

<p>On click of sample, alert will be 5000 while on click of sample1 the alert will be abc. Note how the context under which your handler function was defined is always associated with that instance of the handler.</p>

<p>It works like this because as Jeremy pointed out, the hander function is defined every time you call <code>create_event</code>, but since you are calling create event only a limited number of times, the performance effect will be minimal.</p>
