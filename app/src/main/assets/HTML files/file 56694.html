<p>There's a built-in template for it, although I admit it needs a little work.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a regular iOS app of your chosen template.</li>
<li>Go to the File menu and choose New > Target</li>
<li>Select iOS > Application extensions from the left-hand pane.</li>
<li>Now choose Intents extension.</li>
</ol>

<p>That will create two new groups: YourExtension and YourExtensionUI. If you open the YoureExtension group you'll see IntentHandler.swift, which contains some sample code for handling workouts. If you're just getting started, I would recommend ditching that code entirely because it's longer than it needs to be. </p>

<p>Here's a much simpler example to get you started:</p>

<pre><code>class IntentHandler: INExtension, INSendMessageIntentHandling {
    override func handler(for intent: INIntent) -&gt; AnyObject {
        // This is the default implementation.  If you want different objects to handle different intents,
        // you can override this and return the handler you want for that particular intent.
        return self
    }

    func handle(sendMessage intent: INSendMessageIntent, completion: (INSendMessageIntentResponse) -&gt; Void) {
        print("Send message: " + (intent.content ?? "No message"))

        let response = INSendMessageIntentResponse(code: .success, userActivity: nil)
        completion(response)
    }
}
</code></pre>
