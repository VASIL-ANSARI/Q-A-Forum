<p>There is problem in your code. I have corrected as follows: You find I have added <strong>this</strong> while calling async task.
Your async task accept context as argument and you was not passing that. </p>

<pre><code>public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
     setContentView(R.layout.trackslist);

     backTask = new BackTask();
     backTask.execute(this);
}
</code></pre>
