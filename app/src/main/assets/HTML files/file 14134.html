<p>Any app with the necessary permission can read a phone's contacts and send them over Bluetooth (or Wi-Fi).</p>

<p>I think the main problem would be that people don't think to install your app until they need it.  Then, you can't install your app onto their broken phone unless the phone has a network connection, and if they have a network connection then there isn't really any need to use Bluetooth in the first place.</p>
