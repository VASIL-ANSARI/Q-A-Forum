<p>You are approaching the logic wrong by trying to calculate both sides separately. </p>

<p>As a hint, there are 2 spots on each row that are far away from each other at the top, and close to each other at the bottom.  Each row, they both move toward each other.  So what you want to do is figure out where they are at the top (say, 1 and 10), then each row, add one to the first and subtract one from the last, so they move closer to the middle.  at the bottom, they will meet each other.</p>

<p>As another hint, it is possible to complete this task using one loop.</p>
