<p>It sounds like you are confusing where the datagrid is looking for the 'Active' property.  Since the datagrid is bound to an Observable Collection, the objects inside the observable collection need to have the 'Active' property on them, not the view model used for the view.  If, however, you actually want to bind all the rows of a datagrid to a single property on the view model, you'll need to look up the ancestor tree to find the control's data context and then bind to the 'Active' property:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;CheckBox IsChecked="{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type UserControl}}, Path=DataContext.Active, Mode=TwoWay}" HorizontalAlignment="Center"&gt;&lt;/CheckBox&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But, I imagine, you are looking to bind to the 'Active' property of the object in the observable collection.  Check your output window when you are running your application and you should see a binding error if that property doesn't exist on the object.</p>
