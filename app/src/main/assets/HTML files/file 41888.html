<p><em>Solution</em></p>

<p>I think you refer to a maximize button, and perhaps the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/stage/Stage.html#setMaximized-boolean-" rel="nofollow"><code>stage.setMaximized()</code></a> method.  </p>

<p><em>Maximized != Full Screen</em></p>

<p>Setting the stage fullscreen via<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/stage/Stage.html#setFullScreen-boolean-" rel="nofollow"><code>stage.setFullScreen()</code></a> is generally a different thing than maximizing a stage.  A full screen stage operates in full screen exclusive mode (i.e. no windowing at all, the stage takes over the entire display).</p>

<p>What you seem to be doing is creating an undecorated window (i.e. a window with no default OS window frame and no in-built controls for resizing, title and minimize/maximize/close), but you still want some of the functionality that you would get if the window were decorated (by adding your own custom decoration controls to provide it).  For more information on how to tackle that problem, see the related question:</p>
