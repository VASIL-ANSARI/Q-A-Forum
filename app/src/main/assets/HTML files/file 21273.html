<p>I would strongly suggest that as you know the format in advance, you use <code>TryParseExact</code> instead of <code>TryParse</code>:</p>

<pre><code>bool success = DateTime.TryParseExact(quarterStarter, "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss",
                                      CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
                                      DateTimeStyles.None,
                                      out quarterStart);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you <em>should</em> check the return value of <code>TryParseExact</code> to check that it's parsed correctly - if you're fine with an exception, just use <code>ParseExact</code> instead.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that your existing code would work just fine - after all, you're already providing the invariant culture - but specifying the format makes it clearer what you really expect, and also means you'll detect if a value in an unexpected format is provided.</p>
