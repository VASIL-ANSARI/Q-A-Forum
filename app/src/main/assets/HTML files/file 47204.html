<p><code>$data</code> contains the objects of the last array, for example: <code>{id:7, name:'tal'}</code></p>

<p>In HTML you're binding to <code>$data.OrgName</code>, but OrgName is not a member of the bound object, so it indeed is undefined, like the exception mentions. Did you mean to bind to "name"?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span data-bind="text:name"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also <code>treeLists</code> is not an observableArray yet. Have a look at the following <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/kv7s202z/" rel="nofollow">fiddle</a>.</p>
