<p>Your method name is literally "<strong>GetMyClassName</strong>" or is it "<em>GetClassName</em>"?  </p>

<p>GetClassName is in the SDK (winuser.h) and is redefined based on the UNICODE defines. If you are using "GetClassName" the intellisense is probably getting confused; in fact the compiler is generating the A/W suffix for the actual compiled method as well but that would all work because everyone (Linker/Compiler) agrees on the redefined name (even if its not visible).</p>
