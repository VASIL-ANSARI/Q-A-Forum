<p>Here is a direct answer: there is no practical difference. The only scenario I can see where <code>use ($app)</code> wouldn't work is if you define some entries in separate files.</p>

<p>What follows is just if you are curious ;)</p>

<p>The advantage of passing the container again in the parameters is that it allows Silex to pass <em>another</em> container instance instead. Silex doesn't do that, so it doesn't affect you. But some other containers do.</p>

<p>The main reason for a container to do that would be if you have a complex setup with multiple containers that are chained one after another: <code>ParentContainer</code> -> <code>SubContainer</code>. When you define an entry in the <code>SubContainer</code>, you want to be able to fetch dependencies from the parent container (which will automatically look in the subcontainer too). So the subcontainer will pass the parentcontainer in the closure parameter.</p>

<p>That's an advanced (and rare) use case, but it's interesting to know ;)</p>
