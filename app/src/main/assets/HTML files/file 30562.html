<p>You can search for which stored procedures use a given table with something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT OBJECT_NAME(id) FROM SYSCOMMENTS WHERE text LIKE '%table_name%'
</code></pre>

<p>You'll then have to manually examine and analyse the code within those SPs to see what it actually does with that table. I expect you'll need to manually eyeball any SQL Agent tasks and SSIS packages you may have as well. This kind of work tends to be hard graft - there aren't many shortcuts to simply grinding over all the code by hand.</p>
