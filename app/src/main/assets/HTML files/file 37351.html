<p>After some more research I found, that it's a known bug of cx_Freeze:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/anthony_tuininga/cx_freeze/issue/90/cxfreeze-in-windows-is-not-executable" rel="nofollow">https://bitbucket.org/anthony_tuininga/cx_freeze/issue/90/cxfreeze-in-windows-is-not-executable</a></p>

<hr>

<p><em>In the link there is also a work around, which i quote here:</em></p>

<p>I create a <code>cxfreeze.cmd</code> in <code>venv\Scripts\</code> with the following contents:</p>

<pre><code>:: cxfreeze.cmd
:: make sure cxfreeze from the official installation is in the same folder
:: python is in my path
python "%~dp0\cxfreeze" %*
</code></pre>

<p>And cmd.exe recognizes <code>cxfreeze.cmd</code>, so that I can run <code>cxfreeze --version</code> now. Maybe the developers could consider adding my file into the official installation process.</p>
