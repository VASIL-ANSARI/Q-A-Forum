<p>@Putz1103 is right - you need to import the header to be able to use a subclass. If you generate a class from the popup shown in your question, isn't there an import statement at the top? </p>

<p>Test classes have the header and implementation in the same file simply because it is tidier (no need to have two files for every class, since you don't normally inherit). There's nothing stopping you manually creating a header file and importing it.</p>

<p>Add your parent class using the iOS / Source / Cocoa Touch Class template, and choose XCTestCase as the superclass. This will generate you a separate header and implementation file. You will then be able to import that header everywhere else. </p>
