<p>It's very hard to understand what you're asking, but my guess is you're looking for something like this?:</p>

<pre><code>echo $this-&gt;Html-&gt;link(
    $this-&gt;Html-&gt;image('image.png'),
    array('action' =&gt; 'add'),
    array('escape' =&gt; false)
);
</code></pre>

<p>It's hard for me to imagine any circumstance where you'd actually be using the cake.generic.css in any final product, so - just don't use it, and write whatever CSSyou want.</p>
