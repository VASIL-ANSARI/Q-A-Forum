<p>No. It's not possible.</p>

<p>At the heart of every broadcasts is an <code>Intent</code>. If such feat is possible then we should see the required information somewhere within them.</p>

<p>But if you take a look at <code>Intent</code>'s soucre, these are the only fields defined:</p>

<pre><code>    private String mAction;
    private Uri mData;
    private String mType;
    private String mPackage;
    private ComponentName mComponent;
    private int mFlags;
    private HashSet&lt;String&gt; mCategories;
    private Bundle mExtras;
</code></pre>

<p>You see, among those fields there's not really one that could tell us anything about the sender.</p>
