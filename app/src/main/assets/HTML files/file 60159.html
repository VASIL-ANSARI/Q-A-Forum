<p>In global mode, all the P5.js functions <strong>and variables</strong> are added to the global namespace. In instance mode, all the P5.js functions <strong>and variables</strong> are added to the variable passed into the sketch function (in your case, your <code>p</code> variable).</p>

<p>To use the <code>CENTER</code> variable, you have to get at it through the <code>p</code> variable.</p>

<p>In other words, you need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>p.textAlign(p.CENTER);
</code></pre>

<p>You'll also have to do this with other variables, like <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code>.</p>
