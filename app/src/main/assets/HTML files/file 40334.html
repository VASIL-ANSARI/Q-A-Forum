<p><strong><em>Such problems are due to current Provisioning Profile does not contain APNS information, as the Provisioning Profile is created BEFORE creating the APNS certificate.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Therefore, to solve the problem, create a new Provisioning Profile &amp; select the Provisioning Profile in Xcode. Then you are DONE.</em></p>

<p>Also, when you add push, I believe you have updated the certificates in keychain too.</p>
