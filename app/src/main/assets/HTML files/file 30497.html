<p>I've found exact explanation on how to deal with this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html</a></p>

<p>Definition of safe methods:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9.1.1 Safe Methods</p>
  
  <p>Implementors should be aware that the software represents the user in
  their interactions over the Internet, and should be careful to allow
  the user to be aware of any actions they might take which may have an
  unexpected significance to themselves or others.</p>
  
  <p>In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and
  HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action
  other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe".
  This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT
  and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the
  fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.</p>
  
  <p>Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not
  generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in
  fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important
  distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so
  therefore cannot be held accountable for them.</p>

<p>Important part is emphasized below, which gives resolution to my problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not
  generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request; in
  fact, some dynamic resources consider that a feature. The important

<p>So since user did not request the logging to be performed, it is considered to be side-effect and therefore I can continue setting GET as HTTP method for file download.</p>
