<p>ok ok it's very good question about performance.</p>

<p>Short answer: they will run in the same speed. Why </p>

<p>the compiler when it complies your code it will translate it to mechine language which is bunch of low level processor commands in RAM </p>

<p>In the <code>if</code> with one line if the condition is false the complier will ask the processor to jump 1 line this will increase the program counter with one to ignore the <code>if</code> block and execute the else block instead. look the overhead is just one command to increase the program counter.</p>

<p><code>program counter</code> is register that saves which line you are executing</p>

<p>and in the <code>if</code> with 1000 line it will be simply the same just increase the program counter with 1000 to jump the <code>if</code> block to execute the <code>else</code> block. One Operation the overhead is the same.</p>

<p>thats it even with <code>else</code> is the same if condition true <code>if</code> block will executed then jump the <code>else</code> block.</p>
