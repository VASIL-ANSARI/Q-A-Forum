<p>In your first example, you instantiate <code>weirdArray</code> in the object prototype, making this array property static. Therefore, each of your <code>RoundDiv</code> objects will share the same array to store your data.</p>

<p>Instantiating it in the <code>init</code> function as you do in your second example solves the problem. A new instance of <code>weirdArray</code> will be created each time you create a new <code>RoundDiv</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/uu6k3w2e/6/" rel="nofollow">this fiddle</a> that shows for each example how many times a new array is created, when, and the array size after each <code>push</code>.</p>
