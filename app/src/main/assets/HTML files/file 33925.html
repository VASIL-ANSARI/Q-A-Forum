<p>If they are both within the same container, just apply your <code>:hover</code> pseudo class to the parent element and apply the styles using that.</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;a class="hoverable"&gt;
    &lt;div id="a"&gt;Foo&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;dvi id="b"&gt;Bar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>

<pre><code>.hoverable:hover #a, .hoverable:hover #b {
    visibility:visible;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Should bear something similar. If however the items are not in a common parent this won't work for you. Please post your code so we can get a better understanding :)</p>

<p><strong>AN ALTERNATE CONCEPT</strong></p>

<p>If both elements are direct siblings you can also try something along the lines of </p>

<pre><code>#b:hover + #a {
    visibility:visible
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would require b to be drawn before a however. you could manipulate this ordering using other css.</p>
