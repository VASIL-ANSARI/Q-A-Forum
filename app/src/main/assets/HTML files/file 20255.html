<p>You should consider reading the documentation:</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html#ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html#ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE</a></p>

<p>It always give you a smaller image unless you set it to give you full sized:</p>

<h2>Directly from the Dev Site</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The caller may pass an extra EXTRA_OUTPUT to control where this image
  will be written. If the EXTRA_OUTPUT is not present, then a small
  sized image is returned as a Bitmap object in the extra field. This is
  useful for applications that only need a small image. If the
  EXTRA_OUTPUT is present, then the full-sized image will be written to
  the Uri value of EXTRA_OUTPUT.</p>
