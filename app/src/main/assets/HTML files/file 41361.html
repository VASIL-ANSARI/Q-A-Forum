<p>Assume you have an entity for Courses in a class, that entity has scalar properties of Location, Days and Time, but you find you want to abstract that so that other entities can use the same model.  So you can create a complex type that contains Days, Location and Time give it a name: ComplexType1.  Now other entities can use this type rather than individual scalar properties just by declaring ComplexType1 in the model definition.</p>
