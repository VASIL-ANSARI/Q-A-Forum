<li><p>The datasource should check the plot field using the predefined constants (<code>CPTBarPlotFieldBarLocation</code>, <code>CPTBarPlotFieldBarTip</code>, and <code>CPTBarPlotFieldBarBase</code>) rather than using "magic" numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Most bar plots will require at least a location and a tip value for each bar. Be sure the datasource returns the correct value for each field.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>length</code> of a plot range should be <code>max - min</code>, not <code>max</code>. In this case, it doesn't matter since the <code>min</code> value is zero, but it will matter in other cases.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are many examples of bar plots in the Core Plot example apps. The <em>Plot Gallery</em> app is a good place to start.</p>
