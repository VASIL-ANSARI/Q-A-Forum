<p><code>onStop()</code> fragment is no longer visible to the user either because its activity is being stopped or a fragment operation is modifying it in the activity.</p>

<p>This is generally tied to Activity.onStop of the containing Activity's lifecycle.</p>

<p>In Low memory, it is not guaranteed for both activity and fragment will call onStop() method</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that this method may never be called, in low memory situations where the system does not have enough memory to keep your activity's process running after its onPause() method is called.</p>
