<p>After more extensive testing we discovered that similar issues also occurred sproadically on SQL Server and Oracle.  It turns out that we were not closing a transaction on the <code>FAVORITE_FILE</code> table.  This Hibernate bug was the root cause of the error message we were getting.  Closing the transaction caused the error to disappear.</p>

<p>This problem was a great learning experience for us because we realized that when facing errors with Hibernate we should question the correctness of our own code before questioning the database.</p>
