<p>I am assuming as you have tagged the question with sockets that you are using .Net sockets namespace. This supports async accept connection as well as async reads. The following links explains it Properly -</p>

<p>To explain I will copy  and paste code -</p>

<pre><code>private static void Receive(Socket client) {
    try {
        // Create the state object.
        StateObject state = new StateObject();
        state.workSocket = client;

        // Begin receiving the data from the remote device.
        client.BeginReceive( state.buffer, 0, StateObject.BufferSize, 0,
            new AsyncCallback(ReceiveCallback), state);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The receive function above is called when a successful connection with the server is established. Notice the call to BeginReceive it takes a new AsyncCallback functiona as a parameter. Whenever there is data sent by the server this function (ReceiveCallBack) will be called which will do something with is it. This just works!</p>

<p>Hope this helps. </p>
