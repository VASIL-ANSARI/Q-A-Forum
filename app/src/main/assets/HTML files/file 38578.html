<p>If you need that for an especific field you could add a duplicate of the column with a different collation for prevent this issue.</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE yourTable ADD COLUMN `copiedColumn` VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET 'binary' COLLATE 'binary';
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you can change the collation of your column if you don't need the your current collation in this field</p>

<p>ALTER TABLE yourTable CHANGE COLUMN yourColumn yourColumn VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET 'binary' COLLATE 'binary';</p>
