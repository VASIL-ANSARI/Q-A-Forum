<p>Using <code>arp -a 192.168.1.1</code> on the command line you can get that information if you just need it once.</p>

<p>If you want to do it programmatically, there is a SendARP function in the windows API, documented <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366358%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
