<p>I don't think this can be done client-side using CSS - I'd use a server-side function that creates the bitmap with the specified color (possibly caching the result), and then call it from the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="createicon.ashx?name=truck&amp;color=0xff0000"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The original bitmap should use a pre-defined color for the background - let's say red, and not have any red part in the non-background area, then your code should look for all red pixels and replace them with a percentage of the new background color coresponding to the percentage of red in the original pixel - e.g. if the original pixel is 50% red and your new color is teal the pixel should become 50% teal.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9858202/applying-a-color-filter-to-a-bitmap-object">here</a> for some info on how to change color on a bitmap. </p>
