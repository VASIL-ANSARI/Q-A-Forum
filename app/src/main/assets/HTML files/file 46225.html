<p>Check if you are adding empty string to table that is mapped to <code>Member</code>.
Since <code>Duplicate entry '' for key 'UK_7pn834d04yft1rkvpqf0viuyc'</code> = you are trying to add the same value second time.</p>

<p>Look at this:<br>
<code>@Column(name = "username", nullable = false, unique = true)
    private String email;</code></p>

<p>Since you have marked this as <code>unique</code> propably you are trying to add <code>email</code> as empty string second time but you have a constraint on it saying you cannot add the same value.</p>
