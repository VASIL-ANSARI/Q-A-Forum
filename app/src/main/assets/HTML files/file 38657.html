<p>In case you know the aspect ratio of your carousel, you can use the "padding-bottom" hack to keep the carousel's size constant without specifying the height to keep things responsive:</p>

<pre><code>#carousel {
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.2%; // 16:9 for example
    height: 0;
}
#carousel &gt; div {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Google finds a lot for "responsive embedding" and "padding-bottom hack". Originally got used for responsive video embeds.</p>
