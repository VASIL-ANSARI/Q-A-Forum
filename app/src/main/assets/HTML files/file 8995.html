<p>A database table is just a huge spreadsheet. But instead of storing one piece of information in each cell, you clump them all together in one cell. You would never do that in spreadsheet.</p>

<p>You should create an item table like this:</p>

<pre><code>+----+--------+--------+
| ID | UserID | ItemID |
+----+--------+--------+
| 1  | 2      | 3      |
| 2  | 2      | 1      |
| 3  | 3      | 3      |
+----+--------+--------+
</code></pre>

<p>And possibly another table:</p>

<pre><code>+----+-------------+
| ID | ItemName    |
+----+-------------+
| 1  | Mathematics |
| 2  | Jogging     |
| 3  | Movies      |
+----+-------------+
</code></pre>

<p>That'll let you know that User 2 likes Movies and Mathematics, and User 3 likes Movies.</p>
