<p>I can think of nothing that's directly built in. So I'd suggest:</p>

<p>Split the string into components by <code>[NSCharacterSet +whitespaceAndNewlineCharacterSet]</code> and <code>[NSString -componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:]</code>. I considered recommending the higher-level <code>NSLinguisticTagger</code> to get out whole words but that wouldn't allow for things like words with a colon on the end.</p>

<p>Of those words, find the typographically largest using the UIKit addition <code>NSString -sizeWithAttributes:</code> (under iOS 7) or <code>-sizeWithFont:</code> (under 6 or below). You're going to make the assumption that the largest will remain the largest as you scale the font size down, which I think will always be true because Apple doesn't do aggressive font hinting.</p>

<p>If that word is already less wide than your view's width, you're done. Just show the string.</p>

<p>Otherwise use a quick binary search, repeatedly querying the size, until you find the smaller font size that you need to within whatever precision you think is appropriate (0.1 of a point sounds reasonable to me but you get the point). Then show the whole string at that size.</p>
