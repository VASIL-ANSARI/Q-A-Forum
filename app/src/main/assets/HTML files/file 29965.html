  <p>The <code>addslashes()</code> function is an obsolete hang-over from PHP's early days; it is not suitable for any escaping. Don't use it. Ever. For anything.    -<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/352765/spudley">Spudley</a></p>

<p>I think the function you're looking for is <code>htmlentities()</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?=htmlentities($desc1, ENT_QUOTES)?&gt;
</code></pre>
