<p>From what I understand, your application attempts to open a popup window following a page load.  The nytimes.com popup appeared in response to a mouse click.</p>

<p>There is an important difference between these two ways to open a popup: the latter follows a user-initiated action but the former does not.  As a result, popup blockers will generally block the former but not the latter.  A lot of users wouldn't be too surprised if a popup opened when they clicked a button, but they would be more irritated if a popup appeared when a page loaded.  The fact that your popup was ultimately triggered by an action on another page doesn't matter - what happens if you manually add to the URL the extra parameter that opens the popup?</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537632(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">Here's an old page on MSDN</a> on popup blockers.  It may describe the popup blocker in IE6 (of all browsers), but I think it still provides a reasonable explanation of when popup blockers typically permit or block popups.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to open a popup for your share dialog before calling back to the server?  I would expect that opening a popup in the onclick handler would work without needing to explicitly allow popups.</p>
