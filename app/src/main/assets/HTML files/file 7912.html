<p>You can't because the logical AND operator short circuits.  In the general case it is a good idea to avoid side effects from expressions like that, although there are perfectly valid uses (i.e., <code>if( someObj != null &amp;&amp; someObj.Value == whatever )</code>.  You could use the bitwise and operator (<code>&amp;</code>) which does not short circuit, but again, I wouldn't do that. </p>

<p>You should split those two method calls into variables first and then perform the check if you need them both to execute. </p>

<pre><code>bool first = SomeMethodCall();
bool second = SomeMethodThatMustExecute();

if( first &amp;&amp; second )
{
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
