<p>It's likely that <code>k</code> is not constructed when your breakpoint hits and is destroyed before you get a chance to examine it.</p>

<p>Try adding a line of code <em>after</em> where <code>k</code> is being initialized, and break there instead.</p>

<pre><code>static void b( int i ) {
     int k = i * 2;
     bool bk = true; // &lt;== BREAKPOINT HERE
}
</code></pre>
