<p><code>iif</code> is a special function from MS Access, which SQL Server has started supporting with the most recent version.  The correct SQL form is the <code>case</code> statement.  An improved version of your query, written in standard SQL, is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT (case when COUNT(hs.job)&gt;0 then #STD else #RED end) AS Colour,
       j.job, j.jobstatus, j.client, j.logdate
FROM jobs j INNER JOIN
     clients c
     ON c.client = j.client INNER JOIN
     holdsent hs
     ON hs.job = j.job
WHERE j.jobstatus in ('HOLD', 'CLIHOLD')
</code></pre>
