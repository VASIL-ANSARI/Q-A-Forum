<p><code>pandas.Series</code>, has a <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.tolist.html#numpy-ndarray-tolist"><code>tolist</code> method</a>:</p>

<pre><code>In [10]: import pandas as pd

In [11]: s = pd.Series([0,1,8,9], name = 'BayFail')

In [12]: s.tolist()
Out[12]: [0L, 1L, 8L, 9L]
</code></pre>

<p>Technical note: In my original answer I said that <code>Series</code> was a subclass of <code>numpy.ndarray</code> and inherited its <code>tolist</code> method. While that's true for Pandas version 0.12 or older, In the soon-to-be-released Pandas version 0.13, <code>Series</code> has been refactored to be a subclass of <code>NDFrame</code>. <code>Series</code> still has a <code>tolist</code> method, but it has no direct relationship to the <code>numpy.ndarray</code> method of the same name.</p>
