<p>Your first attempt is flawed because you are requesting a new iterator each time you call <code>package.iterator()</code> - I think you knew that because you then wrote the second one.</p>

<p>The fault with the second is more subtle - you need to use <code>package.iterator()</code> not <code>Package.iterator()</code>. The second should not work anyway.</p>
