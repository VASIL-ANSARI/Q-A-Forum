<p>You don't need to move it out. All you need to do is put a <code>.htaccess</code> file inside the folder of the framework with the following content:</p>

<pre><code># Access denied folder
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
</code></pre>

<p>Doing so you disable the access the folder to anyone outside the server.</p>
