<p>I downloaded your backup.</p>

<p>The database collation is set to <code>Hungarian_CI_AS</code>.</p>

<p>Sz is treated as a letter in its own right in Hungarian (<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz_(digraph)" rel="nofollow">the thirty-second letter of the Hungarian alphabet</a>). If you do not want this behaviour then you need to avoid Hungarian collations and it should work. (I tested all SQL Server 2014 collations with names ending <code>CI_AS</code> and the only ones showing the behaviour are <code>Hungarian_CI_AS</code>, <code>Hungarian_100_CI_AS</code>, <code>SQL_Hungarian_CP1250_CI_AS</code>)</p>

<p>You can do this either by altering the column collation (preferable) or by adding an explicit <code>COLLATE</code> clause to the query (less efficient and will block  queries such as <code>WHERE name LIKE 'tes%'</code> being resolved through an index seek).</p>

<p>You might also consider changing the database collation but this will not cascade through to pre-existing table columns created on the old collation.</p>
