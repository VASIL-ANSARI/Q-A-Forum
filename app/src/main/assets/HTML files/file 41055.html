<p>Resources are loaded by means of Resource Manager and, unlike with assets, the application has little control of this process. Calling <code>getResources().getString()</code> does not load the <code>strings.xml</code> file, as it's already been loaded based behind the scenes (once per app run). Thus, there is no point in placing these calls in AsyncTask.</p>
