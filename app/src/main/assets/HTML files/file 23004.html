<p>Errors 2 through 15 have a simple fix: your _fields.html.erb is missing some code on the first line. The entire line should read:</p>

<pre><code>app/views/layouts/_fields.html.erb   
&lt;%= render 'shared/error_messages', object: f.object %&gt; #object: f.object allows the form variable to 
                #access the associated object.
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately I can't do anything with the rest of your errors since your relevant code isn't attached.</p>
