<p>It looks like you are putting x- and y-ticks only at the coordinates of your matched amino acids. But you are using all the amino acid letters.</p>

<p>It is not entirely clear whether you want all of the labels (in their proper places) or only labels where you find a match. So you could do <strong>one</strong> of those two things depending on what you want:</p>

<p><strong>Only put labels where there are matches</strong>: In that case you need to change your definitions of <code>Sekwencja</code> 1 and 2:</p>

<pre><code>Sekwencja1 = [a[i] for i in x1]
Sekwencja2 = [b[j] for j in y1]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Put labels on everything</strong>: In this case you need to use <code>range(30)</code> instead of <code>x1</code> and <code>y1</code> when setting the ticks:</p>

<pre><code>plt.xticks([range(30)], Sekwencja1,'ko')
plt.yticks([range(30)], Sekwencja2,'wo')
</code></pre>
