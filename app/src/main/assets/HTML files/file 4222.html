<p>i'm one of the developers of <a href="http://opendatakit.org" rel="nofollow">open data kit</a>. odk has been successfully deployed by organizations <a href="http://opendatakit.org/about/deployments/" rel="nofollow">all around the world</a> for exactly what you describe. </p>

<p>we have a <a href="http://opendatakit.org/use/build" rel="nofollow">graphical form designer</a> (and good alternatives in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/purcforms" rel="nofollow">purcforms</a> and <a href="http://xform.childcount.org" rel="nofollow">xls2xforms</a>), a <a href="http://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate" rel="nofollow">server to host the forms</a>, and an android <a href="http://opendatakit.org/use/client" rel="nofollow">mobile client</a> (and good alternatives in <a href="http://bitbucket.org/javarosa/" rel="nofollow">javarosa</a>). all the pieces are free, open source, and are driven by an active community.</p>

<p>if you could list what specifically about odk doesn't fit your needs (say, a need form design on the phone), i'd be could recommend alternatives...</p>
