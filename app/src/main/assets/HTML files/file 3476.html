<p>Without knowing much about the error, the only thing I can guess (and this is a total guess) is that it looks like the PostIt.Date field in the database isn't a DateTime, and you're trying to put it into a DateTime field in a DataTable. I'm not sure that works.</p>

<p>As a side point, why would you need the overhead of creating a datatable anyway? What's wrong with the collection Linq to Sql is giving back to you?</p>
