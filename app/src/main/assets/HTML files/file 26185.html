<p>Well the link for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/64wh5743%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Compiler Error CS0433</a> makes it pretty clear that the core issue is not with multiple versions of the assembly being referenced - but with namespace + typename conflicts.</p>

<p>When you load up / reference a type - the compiler can't resolve which DLL to load that type from. If Sharepoint is going to load both your DLLs versions (as you say it needs to) - this error will always come.</p>

<p>Simplest fix would be to change the namespaces in the new DLL, since it does have your custom tweaks, and you control the code - mark it clearly as well.</p>
