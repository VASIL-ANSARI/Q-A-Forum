<p>Unfortunately, the actual 'name' of the font you reference in the .plist isn't necessarily the same as its file-name.</p>

<p>To find out the real name of the font, open it in Font Book, and you should be able to see it's real name. Maybe the actual name is "Gotham Narrow Book", or something like that, Font Book will tell you.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://kgriff.posterous.com/45359635" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> to find out more.</p>

<p>Also note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using the name from Font Book works well enough for fonts with one
  variant, but if your font has multiple variants, and you don't want to
  get involved with iOS's seemingly incomplete implementation of
  NSAttributedString, then you'll have to specify the variant explicitly
  when you load the font.</p>
  
  <p>Using UIFont's class method +fontNamesForFamilyName: you supply the
  font family name, for example "Cloister Black" which might have two
  variants "Light" and "Dark", and it will return an NSArray of all
  variants of that font, "CloisterBlack-Light" and "CloisterBlack-Dark".
  Notice no spaces.</p>
