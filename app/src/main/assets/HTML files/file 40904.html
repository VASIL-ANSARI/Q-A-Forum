<p>My first shot would be cron, php script and properties table (if needed, because for simple uses you could just store expiration date inside business entity).</p>

<ol>
<li>Cron runs php script periodically (e.g. once a day),  </li>
<li>scripts checks if there is anything to delete, based on properties table, or entity properties.  </li>
<li>If there is anything to delete, script performs deletion of selected content.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all and it is in fact very popular scenario.</p>
