<p>Since Date and group are reserved words you might try putting square brackets around the fields so they aren't processed. Doing so can get rid of "odd" issues like this. So that would make it:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE  (([Date] &gt; @start_date) AND ([Date] &lt; @end_date)) 
AND (@EmployeeID IS NULL OR emp_id = @EmployeeID) 
AND (@ClientID IS NULL OR client_id = @ClientID)
AND (@ProjectID IS NULL OR project_id  = @ProjectID)
AND (@Group IS NULL OR [group] = @Group)
</code></pre>
