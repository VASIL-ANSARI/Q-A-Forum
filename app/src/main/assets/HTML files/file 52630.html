<p>There are two packages on npmjs, ui-router and angular-ui-router.</p>

<p>They are both referencing same repository on github (<a href="http://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router</a>) and are managed by the same person: Christopher Thielen. If you take a look at the package description of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-ui-router" rel="nofollow">angular-ui-router</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ui-router" rel="nofollow">ui-router</a> you can notice that latest versions are different 0.2.18 vs 1.0.0-alpha0 (as of the moment of this post). I suppose Christopher did this on purpose to maintain legacy version and 1.*</p>
