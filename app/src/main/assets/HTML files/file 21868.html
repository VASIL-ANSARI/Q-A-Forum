<p>When I googled "oracle create list from sql", I found ListAgg.  In your case, you would want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>select empcode
, ListAgg(qualification_name, ',') 
within group (order by empcode) qualifications
from test1 join test2 on test1.qualification_code = test2.qualification_code
group by empcode
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't know this but I think it's pretty slick.</p>
