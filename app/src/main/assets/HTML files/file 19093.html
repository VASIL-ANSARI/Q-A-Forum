<p>Store the image filename in the database with each content record. This is the most flexible option because you can easily change the selected image by updating the database record.</p>

<p>Suppose you add some sort of backend/admin area to manage the content. To change the content's main image you can show a dropdown of files in the images folder (and a file upload option) and easily update the record to the chosen image.</p>

<p>If you want a slideshow of content images, you can simply select the image filenames from the table and output <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> tags pointing to the images.</p>

<p>If you do it without the database, by using a naming convention e.g. <code>content-image-{contentId}.jpg</code> then to change the image you would need to be renaming/deleting files and you would need to cater for different image file extensions. </p>
