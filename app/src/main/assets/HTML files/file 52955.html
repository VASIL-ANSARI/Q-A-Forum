<p>If it's there it can be accessed and JS wouldn't throw</p>

<p>Try instead</p>

<pre><code>{{result?.MyProperty}}
</code></pre>

<p>maybe Angular makes an attempt to access <code>result.MyProperty</code> before <code>result</code> has a value while <code>Stringify(result)</code> doesn't choke on <code>null</code>. 
When <code>result</code> is updated in the meantime (maybe because the value was received from the server, the view would update before you can recognized that an empty string was shown before.<br>
Your question doesn't provide enough context to know.</p>
