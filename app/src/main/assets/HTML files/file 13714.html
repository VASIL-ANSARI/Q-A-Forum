<p>I have the same issue on a lot of frameworks my solution is to set the action of the form to where i want it to go as the mvc usually uses something similar to <code>echo Form:open('action');</code> which kicks out an absolute path bear in mind this is on a php framework but id assume asp ones offer something similar so with my jquery i use</p>

<pre><code>$.post($(this).attr('action'), $(this).serialize(), function and so on
</code></pre>
