<p>Based on your comments you are looking to begin hosting your own website from your own computer. </p>

<ol>
<li>For starters I would checkout <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-forms/overview/older-versions-getting-started/deploying-web-site-projects/asp-net-hosting-options-cs" rel="nofollow">this</a> resource from MSDN</li>
<li>A less dense but simpler walkthrough is <a href="http://www.developer.com/net/asp/self-hosting-an-asp.net-web-api.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems like you're not quite sure how to begin researching this yourself, so I would begin looking at search terms like "host ASP.Net site", "self hosting ASP", and "setting up IIS for self hosting"</p>

<p>Another thing you will need to figure out is how to host your databases in SQL server, but running locally you shouldn't encounter any problems. If you're looking to host this online then I would definitely take a look at the services offered by Azure, they integrate so nicely and are a breeze (IMHO) to work with.</p>
