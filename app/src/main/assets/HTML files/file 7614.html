<p>MGTwitterEngine references but doesn't contain <a href="https://github.com/gabriel/yajl-objc" rel="nofollow">yajl</a>. You have to add it yourself. You can download and copy the files manually or add it as a framework following the instructions at the yajl page. </p>

<p>If you dig around in the MGTwitterEngine you'll see the yajl files in red, that means they are missing. You'll find the same problem with OAuthConsumer and TouchJSON.</p>
