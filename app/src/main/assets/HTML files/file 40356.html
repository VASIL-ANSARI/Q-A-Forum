<p>You need a <code>having</code> clause.  Aggregation functions don't belong in <code>where</code> clauses:</p>

<pre><code>HAVING SUM(cr.file_size) &gt; 5000000000
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this presupposes that you have a <code>group by</code> clause as well, because the <code>having</code> clause should go after the <code>group by</code>.  I'm not sure what that is, perhaps <code>group by user_id</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you should learn proper explicit <code>join</code> syntax.  Simple rule:  never use commas in the <code>from</code> clause.</p>
