<p>A quick and dirty method would be to use a Panel with a long list of Label controls on it that list out the various people and contributions. Then you need to set the Panel to be AutoScroll so that it has a vertical scrollbar because the list of labels goes past the bottom of the displayed Panel. Then add a time that updates the AutoScrollOffset by 1 vertical pixel each timer tick. When you get to the bottom you reset the offset to 0 and carry on. The only downside is the vertical scrollbar showing.</p>
