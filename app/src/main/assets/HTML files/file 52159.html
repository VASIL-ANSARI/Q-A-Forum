<p>Forkblur is extending <code>java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction</code> which contains the method <code>compute()</code> and describes it as 'The main computation performed by this task.' Basically what happens is the following:</p>

<p>when a you call <code>ForkJoinPool.invoke()</code> and specify a task to be executed (in this case ForkBlur is a <code>ForkJoinTask</code> implementation), JAVA SDK actually starts a number of threads, each one executing the indicating task, in parallel approach. The actual actions to be executed are defined in <code>compute()</code> method. Therefore, this method is always invoked by JAVA SDK, and never by the programmer.</p>
