<p>In your <code>LocationService.onCreate()</code> method your code checks if the GPS provider is disabled.</p>

<p><code>if (locationManager.isProviderEnabled(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER)){</code></p>

<p>But you only start the subscription if it is already enabled.  Note that your listener is then never registered with the LocationManager and will not receive any updates of location providers being disalbed or enabled.  Rather change your onCreate method to always call </p>

<p><code>locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 5 * 60 * 1000, 100, this);</code></p>
