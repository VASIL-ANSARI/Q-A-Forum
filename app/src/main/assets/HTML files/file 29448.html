<p>I don't know about Backbone router, but I built a simple router that listens to every message each component send and update the URL, and listens for every change in URL and sends specific messages. As an extension I couldn't make it work (because it would render before the components that needed to listen for its messages -- at least the first based on the initial URL), so I built it as a component.</p>
