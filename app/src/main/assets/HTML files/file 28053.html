<p>I haven't worked with java for a while, but I remember that there is a possibility to write explicit named query for the matter using annotation NamedQuery on class level. Examples of named queries are here - <a href="http://www.mkyong.com/hibernate/hibernate-named-query-examples/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mkyong.com/hibernate/hibernate-named-query-examples/</a></p>

<p>I am not sure if it works without having the deleted flag mapped to attribute though, you would have to try it. </p>
