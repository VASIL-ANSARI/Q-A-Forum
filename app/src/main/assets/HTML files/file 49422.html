<li>One way of doing this is broker-subscriber. Let's call the communication class the broker, and the class that wants to receive data the subscriber. What the subscriber should do is call into the broker specifying a (class) method/function to be called when the broker receives data. In the broker, when it receives data it calls this subscriber function - there could even be a list of them.</li>
<li>Another way to do this is for the broker to put messages/data into a Queue, and the subscriber to wait on the queue.</li>
