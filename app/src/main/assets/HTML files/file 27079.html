<p>1, jQuery isn't linked. Meaning, you don't have <code>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='myjQueryfile.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> in your HTML, you'll want to put it before your script.</p>

<p>2:
Because the element with the ID of <code>blue</code>, doesn't exist yet. The DOM - basically the object of your HTML - has yet to be constructed when your script is run, which in this case is the top of the page, before <code>blue</code> comes into existence. You'll want to use an event to fix this, typically <code>$(function(){ ... });</code> which will execute your code when the DOM is ready.</p>

<p>Also, <code>document.write</code> just writes code then and <em>there</em>, meaning exactly where the  <code>document.write</code> calls is made, the HTML will be outputted.</p>
