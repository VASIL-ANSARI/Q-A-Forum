  <p>Is there a reason for not using same

  instance variable?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. Some people like the convention of prefixing the instance variables with an underscore. (Seems pointless to me.) Other people like to change the property names for boolean variables:</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize isEmpty = empty;
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to use a shorter identifier for the instance variable and more descriptive name for the property (<code>audioPlayer = player</code>). And one final application comes to mind, renaming variables in combination with protocols:</p>

<pre><code>@interface LowLevelAudioPlayer : NSObject &lt;AudioLevelProvider&gt; {â¦}

@interface Jukebox : NSObject {
    LowLevelAudioPlayer *player;
}

@property(readonly) id &lt;AudioLevelProvider&gt; levelMeter;
@synthesize levelMeter = player;
</code></pre>

<p>Here itâs beneficial to rename the variable as you are only providing access to one of its facets.</p>
