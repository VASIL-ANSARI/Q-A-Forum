<p>What you do with <code>nanoTime()</code> is basically totally random regarding to get a dot or a hash. There're two things you're interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the light gets bright enough to count as "flash is on" or "flash is off". This is in the value of the <code>SensorEvent</code> and you already check that with <code>event.values[0] &gt;= 50</code>. To put it in one line of code:</p>

<p><code>boolean isFlashOn = (event.values[0] &gt;= 50)</code></p></li>
<li><p>Second is to count the time between changes of <code>isFlashOn</code>. You get the actual time of a event <strong>only</strong> from the <code>SensorEvent</code> itself as it might take some time, till the event is delivered to you. So never try to compare with the current system time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Saying all that there's still a chance, that the light sensor delivers noise, which would be measure of darkness during a flash. If this is the case, you would need some kind of noise filtering which can get tricky, especially with something with very short durations like a flash. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_noise" rel="nofollow">Signal noise</a> for a discussion about noise and noise filtering.</p>
