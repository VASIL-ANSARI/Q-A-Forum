<p>Why not simply have clicking the span set a boolean called "inputFocused" to true and then let the input pay attention to that scope variable. I.e.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span ng-click="inputFocused = true"&gt;FOCUS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;input ng-focus="inputFocused" value="GIVE ME FOCUS"&gt;
</code></pre>
