<p>You are correct in that to use an interface (or class, struct etc...) you must reference that assembly. If you do not wish to have your plugins reference the main application (which makes sense) Why not add a new assembly for this purpose? Calling it 'framework' or 'util'.</p>

<p>E.G</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Framework Assembly
 - IPlugin

PluginOne Assembly (references Framework)
 - PluginOne : IPlugin

Main App Exe (references PluginOne &amp; Framework assemblies)
</code></pre>
