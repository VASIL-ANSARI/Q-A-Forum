<p>In javascript when you assign an <code>object</code> to another <code>variable</code>, its <code>memory reference</code> will be shared. It will not create a copy. At the same time, <code>primitive values</code> will act exact opposite to that. It will create a copy when it got assigned to another one <code>variable</code>.</p>

<p>Also you have to note about this odd situation,</p>

<pre><code>var x = { a: 10 };
var y = x;
x = 5;
</code></pre>

<p>At a first look, after hearing a basic explanation about objects, everyone(new learners) would tell that, <code>y</code> will contain <code>5</code>. But that is wrong. <code>y</code> will have the older value, that is <code>{a:10}</code>. Because at this context, <code>x</code>'s old reference will be cut off and new value will be assigned with new memory location. But <code>Y</code> will hold its reference that was given by <code>x</code>.</p>
