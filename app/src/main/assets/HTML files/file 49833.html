<p>Taking wallyk's advice I went into MySQL Workbench to work some things out with the joins and I think I finally got it.</p>

<p>The query ends up being </p>

<pre><code>SELECT `players`.`userid`,`players`.`username`,`players`.`acct_id`,`inventory`.`id` AS `inv_id`,`inventory`.`item_id` AS `inv_item_id`,`inventory`.`amount` AS `inv_amt`,`vault_inventory`.`id` AS `vault_id`,`vault_inventory`.`item_id` AS `vault_item_id`,`vault_inventory`.`amount` AS `vault_amt`
FROM `players`
LEFT JOIN `inventory` ON `inventory`.`userid` = `players`.`userid` AND `inventory`.`item_id` = 601
LEFT JOIN `vault_inventory` ON `vault_inventory`.`userid` = `players`.`userid` AND `vault_inventory`.`item_id` = 601
WHERE `inventory`.`item_id` IS NOT NULL
OR `vault_inventory`.`item_id` IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY `players`.`userid` ASC
</code></pre>
