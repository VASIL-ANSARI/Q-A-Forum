<p>I believe you'd need N variables, ie for 3 rows you'd need something like this:</p>

<pre><code>set @previousRow1 = 0.0,@previousRow2 = 0.0,@previousRow3 = 0.0;
ALTER TABLE b ADD previousRow Double;
UPDATE `b` SET `result`=@previousRow1 
      , @previousRow1 = @previousRow2
      , @previousRow2 = @previousRow3
      , @previousRow3 = `x`;
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure about the syntax in MySQL exactly, can't test it presently.</p>

<p>Of course in most other DBMS you could use LEAD/LAG functions, I don't think there's a solution in MySQL that doesn't involve joins.</p>
