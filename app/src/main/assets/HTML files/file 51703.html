<p>It's strange because I actually don't see this method createTextRange in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement" rel="nofollow">HTMLElement API</a></p>

<p>Where did you get this method, because where is no such method in API at all, maybe you using some external libs.</p>
