<p>I think it makes more sense that only a single place would set the value of the field, and it should be the last method being called. It makes the code easier to understand. Your first snippet looks much more readable to me.</p>

<p>Here's another snippet which, in my opinion, supports this convention :</p>

<p>Lets say we have an int member with two setters - one accepts an int and the other accepts a String representation of that int (which is used, for example, if we de-serialize an instance from an XML String).</p>

<pre><code>int value;

public void setIntField (String value) 
  throws SomeException
{
    if (value == null)
        throw new SomeException();
    try {
        int val = Integer.parseInt (value);
        setIntField (val);
    }
    catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
        throw new SomeException();
    }
}

public void setIntField (int value)
    throws SomeException ()
{
    if (value &lt; MIN_ALLOWED || value &gt; MAX_ALLOWED)
        throw new SomeException ();
    this.value = value;
}
</code></pre>
