<p>There is no way to tell if a device's clock is correct with 100% certainty. That said, you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX" rel="nofollow">AJAX</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" rel="nofollow">WebSockets</a> to try to ask a trusted server for a datetime stamp and compare that with what the device reports. At minimum, there will be a margin of error largely involving network latency.</p>

<p>Anyway, something practical:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  function myCallback(json) {
    var internalNow = new Date();
    var externalNow = new Date(json.dateString);
    var msg = '';
    if(
         internalNow.getUTCFullYear() == externalNow.getUTCFullYear()
      &amp;&amp; internalNow.getUTCMonth() == externalNow.getUTCMonth()
      &amp;&amp; internalNow.getUTCDate() == externalNow.getUTCDate()
    ) {
      msg = 'Date matches.';
    }
    else {
      msg = 'Date DOES NOT match.';
    }
    alert(msg);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.timeapi.org/utc/now.json?callback=myCallback"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This relies on www.timeapi.org which doesn't support HTTPS. I'm not aware of a similar service that does. You might be better off setting up your own time service. It also doesn't check for normal, minor fluctuations so there's likely to be issues around midnight UTC.</p>
