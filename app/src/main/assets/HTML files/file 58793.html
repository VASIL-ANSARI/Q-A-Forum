<p>Corrected the problem...
It is Google Chrome that was the problem.
Apparently, when you use ids that are a form of 'username' and 'password' Chrome tries to 'help' by inserting the previous text that was used as a username and password.</p>

<p>To fix the problem, I changed my ng-model names to variations of UsrNm and Pwd.</p>

<p>It works now.</p>
