<p>While I'm not at all familiar with ruby, I use <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/" rel="nofollow">jQuery UI autocomplete</a> often. You can trigger it to run only after a certain number of characters are typed (See minLength in 'options'). </p>

<p>Also you can pass additional parameters to your server side scripting. I pass one called Limit and set it to a sensible value (10 in most cases), I use this in the SQL query (where rownum &lt;10), that way you don't hammer the database.</p>
