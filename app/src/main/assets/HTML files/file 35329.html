<p>What coding languages can you use? I would recommend either PHP or JavaScript, depending on where you want to put the file (your desktop or a web server).</p>

<p>A general solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Parse the JSON into an Array/Object</li>
<li>Render HTML from the values in the Array/Object</li>
</ol>

<p>Let us see some code you have tried!</p>
