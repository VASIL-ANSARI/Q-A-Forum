<p>You could try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>sections[2].country =  country;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, writing <code>sections[2]</code> we peek a reference to the third item of the <code>sections</code>. Then we define a property called <code>country</code> and we assign to it the value we want.</p>

<p>Why push didn't work?</p>

<p>The push is an array method, that gives you the ability to push an element at the end of an array. If you try to make use of push on <code>sections[2]</code> will not work, since <code>sections[2]</code> is not an array. The same holds for the <code>splice</code>, it's an array method. </p>
