<p>I think what you are looking for is in the tests in the cocos2d source file.</p>

<p>Look at 'attachDemo' under the 'tests' folder.</p>

<p>It demonstrates adding and removing a cocos2d view.</p>

<p>It seems to create an EAGLView and add that as a subview of the UIView, then set up the director and cocos2d as normal within that glview.</p>

<p>mainView is a UIView.</p>

<pre><code>    EAGLView *glview = [EAGLView viewWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 250,350)];
    [mainView addSubview:glview];

    CCDirector *director = [CCDirector sharedDirector];
    [director setOpenGLView:glview];

    CCScene *scene = [CCScene node];
    id node = [LayerExample node];
    [scene addChild: node];

    [director runWithScene:scene];
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this solves your problem!</p>
