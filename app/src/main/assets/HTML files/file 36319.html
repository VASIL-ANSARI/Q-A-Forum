<p>The major issue with this is that you use <code>sizeof(_data) / sizeof(_data[0])</code> as an attempt to compute the length of the array. However, since <code>_data</code> is of type <code>int16_t *</code>, i.e. just a pointer, then <code>sizeof(_data)</code> will return the size of a pointer (which, in your case, is just 8). You'll need some other way to pass in the length of the array.</p>
