<p>In Java, enumerations are classes that are subclasses of the provided <code>Enum</code> class.</p>

<p>You cannot give them a common abstract ancestor, neither you can subclass them. If you really want to keep the commodity of referring to your units with compile time constants from a set of an enumeration then you can't do it.</p>

<p>If you discard using enumerations and maybe declare them as normal classes then you can do it freely as with everything else, eg</p>

<pre><code>class VolumeUnit extends AbstractUnit {
  public static final VolumeUnit CUBIC_METER = new VolumeUnit(params);
  ..

  VolumeUnit(..) {
    ..
  }
}
</code></pre>
