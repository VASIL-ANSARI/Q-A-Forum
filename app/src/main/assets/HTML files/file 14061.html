<p>Yes, the layout is partially cached if you set <code>treemap.sticky(true)</code>. See the documentation for <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Treemap-Layout#wiki-sticky">treemap.sticky</a>.</p>

<p>The expectation with treemap.sticky is that you use the same root node as input to the layout but you change the value function to alter how the child nodes are sized. See the <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/treemap.html">treemap visualization</a> on the D3 website for an example of changing the value function with a sticky treemap layout. The reason for this constraint is that with a sticky layout, the topology of the tree can't changeâyou must have the same number of nodes in the same hierarchy. The only thing that changes is the value.</p>

<p>So, if you are calling <code>drawGraphFromJson</code> with two different sets of data, then you either need to set <code>treemap.sticky(false)</code>, or you need to merge your two datasets into a single hierarchy and then change the value function to animate between the two.</p>

<p>Also: you haven't included your rendering code, so it's possible there's an error in your data join. However, I think the sticky explanation is more likely. See <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/">Thinking with Joins</a> for an explanation.</p>
