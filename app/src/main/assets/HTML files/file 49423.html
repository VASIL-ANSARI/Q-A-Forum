<p>This looks like it might be a race condition. </p>

<p><code>console.log()</code> will show you the object as it is <em>right now</em>, and <em>not</em> what is was when you called <code>console.log()</code>. To see the properties of an object at a certian point in time you must copy its content and send them to <code>console.log()</code>, for example by stringifying it: </p>

<pre><code>console.log(JSON.stringify(myObject))
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you are using Angular: </p>

<pre><code>console.log(angular.extend({}, myObject));
</code></pre>

<p>This is confusing (it has messed with me several times). Remember that you are sending <code>console.log()</code> an <em>object reference</em>, not a copy of the object. </p>
