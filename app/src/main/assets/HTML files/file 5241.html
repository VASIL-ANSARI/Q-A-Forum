<p>As far as I know in mysql, there is no limit for items in the <code>IN</code> statement.</p>

<p>In oracle altough, there is a limit of 1000 items in the <code>IN</code> statement.</p>

<p>But more the items in <code>IN</code>, your query performance will slow down unless that column is indexed.</p>
