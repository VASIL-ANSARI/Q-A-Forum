<p>It is certainly possible to put XML files on a server and affect the different properties of all views (frame, background colour, alpha, even images if you also download them). </p>

<p>I suggest using NSDictionary instead of an XML, because downloading the file and parsing it is made very easily in a single function: <code>initWithContentsOfURL:</code>. It is also possible to edit the plist files for the NSDictionary using XCode.</p>

<p>Just remember a few things: </p>

<ol>
<li>You do not want to block the UI during the download, so ou probably want to download in a different thread, or at least ha an animated indicator that the file is being downloaded.</li>
<li>Make sure that you application responds correctly if the file cannot be downloaded (the user does not have Wifi access and no data plan, the user is using airplane mode, etc.</li>
<li>Some mechanism like eTag would help you diminish the load on the server and speed-up the loading by not redownloading the file if it has not changed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many application seem to use this technique to provide different skins and they are accepted by Apple, as long as what you download only affects UI.</p>
