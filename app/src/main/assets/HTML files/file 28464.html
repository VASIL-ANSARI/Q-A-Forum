<p>There is few options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can use <strong>async_read_until</strong> to read until your "ending
sequence"(so until end of message).</p></li>
<li><p>If your "ending sequence" depends
on "starting sequence", you can make it to read fixed buffer (equal
to starting sequence length); calculate the ending sequence; and then
setup <strong>async_read_until</strong>.</p></li>
<li>Also, you can make call to <strong>async_read_some</strong> to read any amount of bytes which arrived into socket buffer. Then check your buffer with your own function for containing complete packet or need to read next part.</li>
</ul>
