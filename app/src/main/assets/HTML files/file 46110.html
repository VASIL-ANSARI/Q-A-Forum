<h1>Against rolling your own encryption on production code</h1>

<p>You'd prefer not using any library, <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> you can find the official AES (Rijndael) specifications.<br>
They are quite concise and simple, you have got to have, of course, the minimal mathematical background for developing encryption schemes. In this case the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field" rel="nofollow">Finite Fields</a> will do.</p>

<p>Let me kindly warn you about this choice of your unless you are doing it for studying how ciphers work.<br>
An encryption algorithm is most of the time useless, you need an encryption scheme.<br>
For example without also implementing a CBC chaining, you are basically doing nothing.<br>
So you also have to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation" rel="nofollow">block cipher mode</a>.  </p>

<p>It takes a lot of time, but most importantly: <strong>you absolutely have to fully understand, mathematically and programmatically (even at a lower level) every aspect of the algorithm</strong>.<br>
You may swap two instruction or perform a simple innocent optimization and your whole scheme is broken.

<p>Libraries like OpenSSL do encryption since a long time ago, they really know what they are doing.<br>
Furthermore such libraries are easy to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9889492/how-to-do-encryption-using-aes-in-openssl">use</a>!</p>
