<p>That method is part of <code>PFQueryTableViewController</code>, a tableview subclass that Parse created to make it easier to display info in a tableview. However, the line <code>[query orderByAscending:@"name"];</code> is not specific to that class, you can use that on any query. I would suggest adding a query to your collection view, ordering it how you wish, and displaying it in the collection. I don't think you should use the PFQTVC as it is meant to be used with tables.</p>
