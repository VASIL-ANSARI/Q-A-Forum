  <p>Is there anyway around this or do I just have to use a different name?</p>

<p>There are some words that you can't work around (see below). There may be a way to work around 'case' but you'll make life easier on yourself by changing the name. Don't sweat the small things - there're are plenty of real problems to worry about :-)</p>

<p>Other reserved words <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ReservedWords" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.yup.com/articles/2007/01/31/no-reservations-about-keywords-in-ruby-on-rails" rel="nofollow">here</a>

<p>Good luck!</p>
