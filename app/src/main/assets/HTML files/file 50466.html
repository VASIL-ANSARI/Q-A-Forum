<p>There is no elegant way to do this in Posix, and C++ threading model is almost a thin wrapper on Posix.</p>

<p>You can join a specific thread (one at a time), or you can wait on futures - again, one future at a time.</p>

<p>The best you can do to avoid looping is to employ a conditional variable, and make all threads singal on it (as well as indicating which one just exited by setting some sort of per-thread flag) just before they are about to exit. The 'reaper' would notice the signal and check the flags.</p>

<p>The issue is that this solution requires thread cooperation. But I know not of any better.</p>
