<p>For your first question, you can simply place both checkboxes in the same <code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</code> to get them side-by-side. Change the code to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td width="35%"&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" name="citizen" value="yes"&gt;Yes&lt;input type="checkbox" name="citizen" value="no"&gt;No&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As for the image, you don't seem to have included the code pertaining to it. If you could provide the code in context around this Form so I could see how the image is being placed, it would aid in discovering why it's moving.</p>
