<p>Your best bet is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start your gem extension version at 0.0.1 as first release.</li>
<li>Make sure you maintain solid test suite so you test your parent gem (in your case "split") maintains the behaviour you depend on. Whatever you do, do not skip this!</li>
<li>Always maintain a documentation saying what version of your parent gem ("split") are you supporting for sure. Example: "split" gem has 1.1.0, 1.1.6, 1.2.1 versions. If the last version you tested is 1.1.6, make a README which says: "split-export" is proven to work with all versions of "split" up to 1.1.6. Use further versions at your own risk. Or something similar.</li>
<li>And of course, needless to say, track the version history of your parent gem and run tests against it periodically.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are very basic TDD practices, but it never hurts to reiterate them. Hope I helped.</p>
