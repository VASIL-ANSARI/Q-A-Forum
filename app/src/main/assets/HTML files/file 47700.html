<p>Seems you want to include a unique identifier for different objects in a log file. Then </p>

<pre><code>System.identityHashCode(object);
</code></pre>

<p>is the way to go. In case of array it is also true that </p>

<pre><code>System.identityHashCode(array) == array.hashCode()
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is a unique identifer, but not a memory address like the address of a pointer in C.</p>
