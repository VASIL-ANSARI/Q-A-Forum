<p>What's likely happening is that the <code>TextBox</code> still has focus when you select your menu item. By default, bindings in WPF update when the control loses focus (so that updates don't take place constantly, as they do when <code>PropertyChange</code> is the update type). When you use the button, the <code>TextBox</code> loses focus because the button gets it.</p>

<p>You can test this out by putting another control (any kind) on the window and clicking on it before selecting your menu item. </p>

<p>If this addresses the issue, then the simplest fix is to change the binding update type to <code>PropertyChange</code> (this can be done in the binding options area of the designer).</p>
