<p>I will say use neither of them in production. You should handle exceptions in other ways, like logging the exception or saving the stacktrace somewhere to review it later and probably display a nice message to the user saying that the app or method failed.</p>

<p>But if you just ask about which of those approaches to use, I will say the latter is better because <code>System.out.println(e)</code> will call <code>Throwable#toString</code> that only provides the message of this exception and maybe you won't get the real cause of the problem.</p>
