<p>Your problem is here:</p>

<pre><code>       if (scanner.nextLine().isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("BREAKING");
              break;
         }
</code></pre>

<p>You are eating the next line just to check if it is empty. If it isn't you have now lost that line and advanced the Scanner. You should have this block at the beginning of your loop and first assign the value of the line to a variable so the value is not lost.</p>

<p>Try changing your while loop to something like this:</p>

<pre><code>String line = null;
while(!(line = keyboard.nextLine()).isEmpty()) {
</code></pre>
