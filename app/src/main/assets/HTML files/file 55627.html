<p>The value of <code>body</code>, <code>{"event" : "plan"}</code> is not a string: it's a JSON object.</p>

<p>I do not know why the behaviour of your JSON library has changed between versions 2.2 and 2.3, but the behaviour in 2.3 seems correct.</p>

<p>If you want to get a <code>String</code> representation of the object, you might try:</p>

<pre><code>bodyJsonObject.getJSONObject("body").toString();
</code></pre>
