<p>The task is picked by a worker, but not acknowledged.</p>

<p>It means should the power run out, the task will be re-fetched by a different (or the same) worker later.</p>

<p>The task's args/kwargs are kept in worker's memory until it's finished, so please keep this in mind because you might run out of it really quick with lots of countdown tasks and large args/kwargs.</p>
