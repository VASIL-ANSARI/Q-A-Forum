<p>It is a very bad coding practice to name files and classes in such a manner.
The best solution would be to use English names for files and classes. Furthermore 
Cake would lose it's "convention power" if you use any language except English as the Inflector class which is responsible for managing the naming conventions would not 
do it's job at all because it would not manage to "pluralify/singalify" any of the Spanish (or whatever other language) words you would use for your files/classes.</p>

<p>Check out what <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/core-utility-libraries/inflector.html" rel="nofollow">Inflector</a> does if you're interested in this.</p>

<p>I am not saying that it is not possible but this renders CakePHP's "Convention over configuration" principle useless.</p>
