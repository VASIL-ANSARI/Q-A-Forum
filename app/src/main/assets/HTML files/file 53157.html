<p>I don't think you're mixing things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jupyter (previously know as python) can tell that the object has an representation (whether it's a string, a float, an image, a js script...) after calling <code>plt.plot()</code>. This representation is embedded into a html page, which <em>can</em> be displayed in a browser. Do mind that all this happens without using <code>DISPLAY</code></li>
<li>In that virtual machine, are you using a graphical interface ("desktop") or bare-bones terminal? if the previous, <code>DISPLAY</code> should be set. If the later, then you cannot display on bare-bones terminal, and should use other resources to forward display or output your image as a file.</li>
</ul>
