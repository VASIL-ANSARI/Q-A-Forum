<p>I think your best shot is to create a local database to store all your checklists. Access is really fast so your user won't notice anything. The only down side is the work needed to update the database design after you released your app. </p>

<p>Android uses SQLite. There are many tutos available. </p>

<p>Edit:
The way you describe your app, I suggest you create at least one table for the checklists and on table for the tasks. </p>

<p>Checklist would have columns for : _id , name, tasks_count, creation_date, last_edition_date, importance, due_date, all_complete</p>

<p>Tasks would have columns for: _id, checklist_id, name, description, date_created, date_completed, importance, due_date</p>

<p>My advice to you is to create more columns than you need at first. Design your database for features to come in the future, even though you may never implement them. There is nothing more painful than changing the design of your tables many times during dev and even worse after deployment. </p>
