<p>Well certainly there are drawbacks of using thousands of variables in a form post. Performance will drop on both sides, server and client. All values are encoded, copied and decoded several times, so this eats up performance and memory. And what for?</p>

<p>But I'd say that this is not really the point. The thing you should give some thought is this: why the heck does that stuff required thousands of variables in a post? That sounds <em>insane</em>. I suggest you should rethink the architecture behind that. There should be a much easier and more robust solution. A typical approach would be to encode all those variables in a single one, typically some JSON data block. </p>

<p>So far I have seen only one example of an architecture where someone tried to implement a csv file editor as a single html/http based form, posting <em>all fields as separate variables</em>. Believe me, there are better approaches for this. </p>
