<p>I don't know what's your situation but, imho, you shouldn't use new urls.. it would only be a useless waste of resources (all kinds of resources).. If your website's client-side is javascript-based, you could use libraries like <a href="http://i18next.com" rel="nofollow">i18next</a>, which gives you great support in localizations.. That's a valid alternative if you agree leaving the localization at you application's client-side.</p>

<p>For server-side localization in php, i wouldn't be of any help..</p>
