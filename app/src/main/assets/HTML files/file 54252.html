<p>During <code>viewDidLoad</code>, the view is just loaded and its bounds wont be still finalized, you should check for the final bounds in either <code>viewWillappear</code>, <code>viewDidAppear</code> or <code>viewWillLayoutSubViews</code> method.</p>

<p>But in you're case, I believe the <code>myWheel</code> view that you have added as subview has its constraints setup so that the view's bounds varies along with the parent's. For eg Setting Trailing space, Leading space w.r.t parent. </p>

<p>If you want the circle to be drawn at the center, you can set the center x, y constraints along with desired height, width constraints for the <code>myWheel</code> view.</p>
