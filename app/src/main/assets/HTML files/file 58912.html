<p>Not been able to reproduce this:</p>

<p><strong>I've got this after add-migration with the same setup you have:</strong></p>

<pre><code>public override void Up()
{
    CreateTable(
            "dbo.Users",
            c =&gt; new
            {
                Id = c.String(nullable: false, maxLength: 128),
                Email = c.String(),
                UserName = c.String(),
                Password = c.String(),
                SecurityStamp = c.String()
            })
        .PrimaryKey(t =&gt; t.Id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing I've removed is your base class on Credential: ValueObject because I don't have it. Everything looks good so maybe there's something wrong with that class?</p>
