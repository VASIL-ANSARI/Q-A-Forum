<p>A round-capped, thick path with a shadow on it is probably the best solution for you. That would involve:</p>

<pre><code>CGContextSetLineWidth()
CGContextSetLineCap()
CGContextSetShadowWithColor()
</code></pre>

<p>You'd want a zero offset shadow, and you'll need to experiment with the radius and blur parameters to get the effect you're after. </p>
