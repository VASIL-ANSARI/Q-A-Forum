<p>Its not a good idea to modify the <code>desginer.cs</code> file. Attach the event in the form designer or you can attach the event in the code behind <em>(form.cs)</em>. It is probably disappearing if you are loading the form in the designer and you are getting the message to ignore changes and reload design.</p>
