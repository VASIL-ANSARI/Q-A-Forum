<p>Not sure what are you really trying to achive/prove by the example. Even if it was possible to clone only superclass, the result would still remain the same as it would simply just copy the <code>a</code> field.</p>

<p>Anyway, the answer is no. The clone is method by purpose so you don't need to care about the real class in the background. If you wished to do partial clone for specific super class you could easily achieve this by calling specific constructor/setters as you have all the information in compile time.</p>
