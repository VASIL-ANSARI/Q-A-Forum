<p><strong>Associations</strong></p>

<p>I don't think you can have a <code>belongs_to :through</code> association (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4021322/belongs-to-through-associations">belongs_to through associations</a>), and besides, your models look really bloated to me</p>

<p>I'd look at using a <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#the-has-many-through-association" rel="nofollow"><code>has_many :through</code> association</a>:</p>

<pre><code>#app/models/brand.rb
Class Brand &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   has_many :cars
end

#app/models/car.rb
Class Car &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   #fields id | brand_id | name | other | car | attributes | created_at | updated_at
   belongs_to :brand

   has_many :configurations
   has_many :models, through: :configurations
   has_many :colors, through: :configurations
   has_many :body_styles, through: :configurations
end

#app/models/configuration.rb
Class Configuration &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   #id | car_id | body_style_id | model_id | detailed | configurations | created_at | updated_at
   belongs_to :car
   belongs_to :body_style
   belongs_to :model
end

#app/models/body_style.rb
Class BodyStyle &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   #fields id | body | style | options | created_at | updated_at
   has_many :configurations
   has_many :cars, through: :configurations
end 

etc
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow you to perform the following:</p>

<pre><code>@car = Car.find 1
@car.colours.each do |colour|
   = colour
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>OOP</strong></p>

<p>Something else to consider is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" rel="nofollow"><code>object-orientated</code></a> nature of Ruby (&amp; Rails). </p>

<p>Object orientated programming is not just a fancy buzzword - it's a core infrastructure element to your applications, and as such, you need to consider constructing your Models etc <em>around</em> objects:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/SrC55.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>This means that when you're creating your models to call the likes of <code>Car</code> objects, etc, you need to appreciate the <code>associations</code> you create should directly compliment that particular object</p>

<p>Your associations currently don't do this - they are very haphazard &amp; mis-constructed. I would recommend examining what objects you wish to populate / create, and then create your application around them</p>
