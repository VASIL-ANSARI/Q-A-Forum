<p>I think you need a submit button. try:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="submit" value="Add Group" /&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Also i think you will need to add a reference to as it doesn't look like it is included anywhere:</p>

<pre><code>jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js
</code></pre>

<p>I think you can get it through nuget if you dont have it already.</p>

<p>otherwise here is a script tag that includes a CDN link: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/mvc/3.0/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
