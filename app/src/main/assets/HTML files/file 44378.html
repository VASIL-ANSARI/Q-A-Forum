<blockquote>
  <p>MONTHS_BETWEEN returns number of months between dates date1 and date2.
  If date1 is later than date2, then the result is positive. If date1 is
  earlier than date2, then the result is negative. If date1 and date2
  are either the same days of the month or both last days of months,
  then the result is always an integer. Otherwise Oracle Database
  calculates the fractional portion of the result based on a 31-day
  month and considers the difference in time components date1 and date2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So on example 1, there are 31 days in between both dates, so the result is 1.<br>
On example 2, date 1 is later then date 2, so the result is positive, and because its one day more then a full month, the result is 1.03<br>
The same thing happens with example 3, but now there are 2 days more then a full month of time difference, so the result is 1.06<br>
On the last example we have two dates that are the last dates of those months, so the result is again 1.</p>

<p>In short, the function works as it was designed, but it might not suit your particular needs.</p>
