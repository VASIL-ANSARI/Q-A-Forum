<p>I would go with 4:</p>

<p>It will basically tell you that the use of the method or class is discouraged; it is NOT 100% that they will keep backward compatibility (they can decide to not include that method in future releases), so you should try to use the replacement of the method or class. This is <em>sometimes</em> not possible to use the new methods (for instance, if you want to support devices running older versions).</p>

<p>Some other times it is actually possible. For instance, the <code>showDialog</code> method is now deprecated and they recommend to use <code>DialogFragment</code> class. You can achieve that even in older versions of Android by using the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/compatibility-library.html">compatibility library</a>.</p>
