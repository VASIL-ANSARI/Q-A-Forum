<p>You appear to only want to use the elements in list2 that correspond to <code>i*2</code> and <code>i*2+1</code>, That is elements 0, 1 and 2, 3, ...</p>

<p>You only need one loop.</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(len(list1)):
    j = list[i*2]
    k = list2[j+1]
    # Process function using j and k
</code></pre>

<p>You will only process to the end of list one.</p>
