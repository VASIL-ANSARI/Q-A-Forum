<p>I would recommend you to add the search code in the index method of buildings controller, there are many things you can do but here is what i will recommend:</p>

<pre><code>def index
   # 
   if params.has_key?(:name)
     @buildings = Building.joins(:rooms).
                  where([
                     'lower(buildings.name) like ? or lower(rooms.name) like ?', 
                     "%#{params[:name].downcase}%",
                     "%#{params[:name].downcase}%"
                  ])
   else
     # your normal code goes here.
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Any other information you need such address ( is that a different model ) can he included in there.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>PD: if necessary you can render a different view when a search is present inside your if block </p>

<pre><code>render action: 'my_custom_view', status: :ok
</code></pre>
