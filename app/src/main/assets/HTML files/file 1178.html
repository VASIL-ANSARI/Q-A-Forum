<p><a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002363" rel="nofollow">ActiveRecord::Base#connection</a> internally relies on <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002369" rel="nofollow">ActiveRecord::Base.connection</a> (class method) which return a concrete implementation of the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/AbstractAdapter.html" rel="nofollow">ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractAdapter</a> class.</p>

<p>You should search the <code>#indexes</code> method in your concrete adapter, for instance <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/PostgreSQLAdapter.html#M002080" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQLAdapter#indexes</a>.</p>

<p>RDoc doesn't provide any hint on the object type returned by a method call. You should dig into the source code or have a deep understanding of the package itself.
There are alternatives such as <a href="http://yardoc.org/" rel="nofollow">Yard</a> which generates a much more complete API documentation.</p>

<p>There's also the <a href="http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v2.3.5/" rel="nofollow">Rails Searchable API Doc</a> Project which offers a searchable Rails API.
You can enter the method name and have a list of all objects implementing that method.</p>
