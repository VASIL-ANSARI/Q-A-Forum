<p>Here is quite a large section of the documentation easily found by doing some <strong>research</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/install/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/install/index.html</a></p>

<p>It appears that you will want to run:</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py install --prefix="\Temp\Python"
</code></pre>

<p>to install modules to the \Temp\Python directory on the current drive.</p>

<p>Some more info:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you donât choose an installation directoryâi.e., if you just run
  setup.py installâthen the install command installs to the standard
  location for third-party Python modules.</p>
  
  <p>The default installation directory on Windows was C:\Program Files\Python under Python 1.6a1, 1.5.2, and earlier.</p>
