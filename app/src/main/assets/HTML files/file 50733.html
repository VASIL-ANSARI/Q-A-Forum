<p>Your overall model actually makes a fair amount of sense. You've identified the repeated code and separated it out into a class. Your use of generics helps keep that clean. Whether it's worth explicitly separating out layers of the tree (for that's what this essentially is) as Subchapters, Chapters, etc depends on your exact requirements.</p>

<p>It might be simpler just to define tree nodes and leaves, but if you do need different behavior at each layer and don't need flexibility to add or remove more layers then this is fine. Consider for example if you will ever have an omnibus with Omnibus->Book->Chapter->Subchapter->Paragraph, or a book with Book->Chapter->Section->Subchapter->Paragraph. Could your model support those? If not does it need to?</p>

<p>Some of the naming could be clearer (for example nr as number) or doesn't follow style conventions (Title should be title).</p>

<p>The main mistake I'd say would be to store the number inside the object at all. That is fragile as it means you constantly have to update it as things are added, removed, etc.</p>

<p>You can always find out the number by just looking at the position in the parent. Essentially you are duplicating that information.</p>

<p>As GrÃ©gory pointed out in the comments all variables should be private and accessed via getters and setters.</p>
