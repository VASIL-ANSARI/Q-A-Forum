<p>Why aren't you using a Long Press?  Or are you using that already for something else?  The advantages of a Long Press over a Double Touch:</p>

<ul>
<li>Long Press is a recommeded interaction in the UI Guidelines, Double Touch is not.</li>
<li>It's what users expect; a user might not find a Double Touch action as they won't go looking for it</li>
<li>It's already <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterView.OnItemLongClickListener.html" rel="nofollow">handled in the API</a>.</li>
<li>Implementing a Double Touch will affect handling of Single Touches, because you'll have to wait to see if every Single Touch turns into a Double Touch before you can process it.</li>
</ul>
