<p><code>item</code> is a method, so you call it with a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>txt.item(0)
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could access it as</p>

<pre><code>txt[0]
</code></pre>

<p><code>getPropertyValue</code> is for getting CSS property values from a style object, and is not relevant here. You simply want to access the <code>value</code> member of the input element:</p>

<pre><code>txt.item(0).value
txt[0].value
</code></pre>

<p>However, there is really no need to use name attributes, except in special situations such as to group radio buttons. You're better off using IDs and <code>getElementById</code>. Then you don't have to worry about taking the first item.</p>
