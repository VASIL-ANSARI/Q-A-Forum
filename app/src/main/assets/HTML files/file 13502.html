<p>AFAICT QAudioOutput doesn't have any built-in support for audio looping, so I think you would have to simulate audio-looping by sending fresh audio buffers to the QAudioOutput device periodically so that it would never run out of audio bytes to play.</p>

<p>I think the easiest way to do that would be to write your own subclass of QIODevice that pretends to be a very long (infinite?) file, but returns your looping samples over and over again when queried.  Then pass your QIODevice-subclass-obect as an argument to QAudioOutput::start().</p>
