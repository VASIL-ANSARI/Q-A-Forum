<p>Once you re-load the url (<code>window.location</code> change) the context (and scope) of that <code>setInterval</code> become moot (the page is discarded and the next is loaded). The script's then reloaded and <code>setInterval</code> reassigned.</p>

<p>Oh, and syntactically that code is invalid. You probably want to wrap the <code>window.location</code> portion in a <code>function(){}</code>, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>setInterval(function(){
  window.location = $('#thisLink').attr('href')
}, 1000);
</code></pre>

<p>otherwise it's not actually executing in an interval fashion, but immediately.</p>
