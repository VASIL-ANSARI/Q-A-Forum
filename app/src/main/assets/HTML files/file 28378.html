<p>If you remove the group by and run the query without the aggregates, you will see why. </p>

<pre><code>select o.prodid, p.prodname, o.qtysold, q.score
from orderline o
   join product p
      on o.prodid = p.prodid
    join allocation a
      on a.prodid = p.prodid
    join qualitycheck q
      on q.prodid = a.prodid
order by 3;
</code></pre>

<p>The joins to the two new tables have produced a Cartesian product and tripled the number of rows.  The join conditions for one of the two new joins needs another predicate to be added to eliminate the duplicates.</p>
