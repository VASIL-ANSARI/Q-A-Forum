<p>I noticed this too and always meant to find out why it worked. 
It <em>used</em> to be true that you couldnât install an App Store build but that appears to have changed, Iâm guessing either in iOS6 or 5.</p>

<p>I found that I could only install App Store provisioning profile builds when a compatible Ad Hoc profile was already installed. Developer profiles did not work. I did not try wildcard profiles. So it looks like the Ad Hoc rules changed.</p>

<p>I canât find the rules for installing an Ad Hoc build, but on the topic of <em>launching</em> the âAd Hoc Provisioning Profiles in Depthâ section of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/TestingYouriOSApp/TestingYouriOSApp.html">Appleâs App Distribution Guide</a> says that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The app successfully launches if the appâs bundle ID matches the App ID, <em>the signature matches the distribution certificate</em>, and the device is in the device list of <em>the</em> ad hoc provisioning profile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I guess technically an AppStore builds meet these Ad Hoc requirements because it too is signed with the same distribution certificate. The use of âtheâ is misleading here because it makes it sound like iOS consults your <code>embedded.mobileprovision</code>, which is untrue. It should read âanâ ad hoc profile. </p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: The install only worked when the Ad Hoc profile was already installed on the device, so thatâs one reason to make separate ad hoc builds. </p>

<p><strong>NB</strong>: This is all conjecture, another explanation could be that Xcode handles the installation of the <code>embedded.mobileprovision</code> and now continues when the AppStore profile installation fails.</p>

<p>This raises another question for me: why does iOS DWIM for App Store builds yet refuses to launch Ad Hoc builds with expired provisioning profiles when a perfectly valid replacement is installed?</p>
