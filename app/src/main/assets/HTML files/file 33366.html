<p><code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> is called every time when a cell comes to view. </p>

<p>Don't expect it to be called a certain times nor expect any specific sequence. </p>

<p>Example: 
There is one section only with 15 rows. Therefore the table will have 15 cells in total - from the user's point of view. <code>numberOfRowsInSection</code> will return 15. </p>

<p>Let's say that 10 of them are visible on an iPhone 5 and 9 of them are visible on an iPhone 4. 
At start <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> is called 9 times on an iPhone 4 and 10 times on an iPhone 5. </p>

<p>Let's continue with the iPhone 5. The user now scrolls to the bottom of the table. 5 more cells come into view. Then <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> is called 5 times. 
BTW 4 of these cells that disappeared earlier can and will be reused. (given that all cells are of the same type and reuse-identifier)</p>

<p>So far <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> was called once for each cell. </p>

<p>Now the user scrolls up again to the top of the table. <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> is now called again for cell of row 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0. </p>

<p>So far <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> was called 20 times for 15 cells. </p>

<p>Now the user ...</p>
