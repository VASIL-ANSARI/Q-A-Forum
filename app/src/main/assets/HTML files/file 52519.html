<p>It would be helpful if you posted the code for the AppDelegate. The initial values set in your user default dictionary should match the settings in the plist. I also always save my user defaults after creation, by calling synchronizing, though this should not strictly be necessary (its done periodically by the OS). </p>

<pre><code>//syncronize (save) the defaults
[defaults synchronize];
</code></pre>

<p>You can regisiter for the NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification to confirm that the app is periodically saving your defaults. It is also important to keep in mind that NSUserDefaults only supports saving the standard plist types as stated in the Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSUserDefaults_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSUserDefaults/synchronize" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>. </p>
