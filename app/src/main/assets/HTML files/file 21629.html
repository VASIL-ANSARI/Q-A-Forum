<p>Your searches aren't equivalent. <code>LIKE %1%</code> will find ANYTHING that contains a <code>1</code>, e.g. <code>100</code>, <code>911</code>, <code>0.1</code>. It's just a plain substring match. <code>MATCH ('+1')</code> would theoretically work, but FULLTEXT by default ignores any "words" that are &lt;4 characters in length. However, assuming you relaxed the fulltext length limit, <code>+1</code> would find any INDEPENDENT <code>1</code>, but not any that are embedded in another word. For that you'd need <code>+*1*</code>.</p>
