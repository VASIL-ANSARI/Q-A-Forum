<p>I would extract the date into a package datetime variable. Then, use the data flow to extract your data as you mentioned. After that within the same dataflow, I would then use a derived column tranformation to add the date variable to your buffer which would then be loaded into your table. It's similar to what you had in mind but, requires one less open and close db connection which would be created and disposed using your sql task.</p>
