<p>I think your text file is not plain text but rather a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format" rel="nofollow">RTF</a> file which supports formatting. When you view it you probably use a tool which supports RTF, such as TextEdit. If you view it with less or cat you should also see the RTF markup. </p>
