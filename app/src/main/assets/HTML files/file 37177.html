<p>Well for the first day in this view something like this should do it</p>

<pre><code>//Using UTC to counter daylight saving problems
var month = new DateTime(2014, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc); 
var firstInView = month.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromDays((int) month.DayOfWeek));
</code></pre>

<p>For the remaining days you just need to calculate the amount left in (7 * NumRows) - (DaysOfCurrentMonth + DaysOfPreviousMonth), where DaysOfPreviousMonth is the DayOfWeek property of this month first day again.</p>
