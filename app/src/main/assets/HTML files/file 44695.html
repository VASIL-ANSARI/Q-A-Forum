  <p>Are there any known methods for converting such <code>n</code><sup>2</sup> algorithm to <code>n</code>*log<code>n</code>?</p>

<p>In situations when one of the two <code>n</code>s that you multiply comes from accessing a linear data structure, such as your linked list, you can improve to <code>n</code>*log<code>n</code> by moving to a faster data structure, such as a balanced binary tree.</p>

<p>This would translate into replacing the <code>while</code> loop search, which is linear, with a search in a binary tree, which is log<code>n</code>.</p>
