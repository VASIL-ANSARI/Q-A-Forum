<li><p>You may be running into concurrency issues, depending on how your application runs. Try performing your reads with the "nolock" keyword. </p></li>
<li><p>Try adding in table aliases for your columns (and avoid the use of SELECT *), this helps out MSSQL, as it doesn't have to "guess" which table the columns come from. </p></li>
<li><p>If you aren't already, move to SPROCs, this allows MSSQL to index your data better for a given query's normal result set.</p></li>
<li><p>Try following the execution plan of your SPROCS to ensure they are using the indexes you think they are.</p></li>
<li><p>Run a trace against your database to see what the incoming requests look like. You may notice a particular SPROC is being run over and over: generally a good sign to cache the responses on the client if possible. (lookup lists, etc.)</p></li>
