<p>As you can check from the source code, <a href="https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest/blob/5f79ba7f0c15871f02a95c622c954eefedfcf183/hamcrest-core/src/main/java/org/hamcrest/Condition.java" rel="nofollow">Condition</a> doesn't do the trick. You can play with logical conditions as follows:</p>

<pre><code>assertThat(myList,  
     either( allOf(is(expectedResult), matchesUsingMyCustomMatcher(otherList)) ) 
     .or( allOf(not(is(expectedResult)), not(matchesUsingMyCustomMatcher(otherList.subList(start, end))) ) ) 
         );
</code></pre>

<p>But let me say that I cannot imagine a test in which you don't know if a flag value is true or false. If both scenario can happen, the two tests must be written.</p>
