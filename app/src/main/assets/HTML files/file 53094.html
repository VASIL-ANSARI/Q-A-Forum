<p>Change reports to this:</p>

<pre><code>class Report &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :report_exposures
  has_many :ncaa_games
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :ncaa_games
end
</code></pre>

<p>And read about doing nested forms here:</p>

<p><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#nested-forms" rel="nofollow">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#nested-forms</a></p>

<p>There are a lot of examples of people asking questions about nested_forms with a has_many through relationship. Take a look at those for guidance:</p>

<p>Don't try to manipulate the join object (ReportExposure) unless you are actually dealing with adding metadata to that object. That is what the ORM is for. </p>
