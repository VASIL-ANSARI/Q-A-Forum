<p>You should put your image in a scrollView to be able to zoom it.
Your tags are views added on the [scrollView superView], so you can zoom the image and your tags keep the same size.
Then with a bit of logic and the convertPoint methods of UIView you should retrieve the coordinate of the anchor in the resized image.</p>

<pre><code>- (CGPoint)convertPoint:(CGPoint)point toView:(UIView *)view
</code></pre>

<p>It's not a fully baked answer but you should have steps. Maybe you can also find some open source implementation to use or inspirational</p>
