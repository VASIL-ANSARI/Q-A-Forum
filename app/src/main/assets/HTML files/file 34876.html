<p>The problem is that when the dialog is opened then the focus is set on the input which triggers the datepicker. The solution is to either you trigger the blur event on input when dialog is shown or you can use this code before you call the dialog, it will clear autofocus :</p>

<pre><code>$.ui.dialog.prototype._focusTabbable = function(){};
</code></pre>
