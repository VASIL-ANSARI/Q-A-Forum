<p>If you're using C, just use the print f function: </p>

<pre><code>printf("%x", DATA[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>that will print it as hex.  If you want to print it as a string, just print it like this:</p>

<pre><code>printf("%s", DATA); 
</code></pre>

<p>Decimal:</p>

<pre><code>printf("%d", DATA[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like its printing its ascii values right now.  </p>
