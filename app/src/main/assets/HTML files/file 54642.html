<p>You can add elements with <code>add(int index, E element)</code> method at the specified position using ArrayList object. It shifts automatically the element currently at that position.</p>

<p>You are getting that exception because you are trying to replace an element at the second position when you just have two elements. See the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#set%28int,%20E%29" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for more information.</p>
