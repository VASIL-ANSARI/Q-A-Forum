<p>I encountered the exact same problem recently when I went to use the row editor capability (attached to grid).  Being a long time ExtJS user, I never stopped to think about the lack of documentation accompanying the examples, but your comments are spot on.</p>

<p>For the RowEditor, <a href="http://edspencer.net/2009/09/using-the-extjs-row-editor.html" rel="nofollow">I found documentation on the internet</a>.  I also find the <a href="http://yui-ext.com/forum/showthread.php?t=20793&amp;highlight=ColumnTree" rel="nofollow">ExtJS forums</a> to be a great place to find suggestions, code samples, and links to documentation .</p>
