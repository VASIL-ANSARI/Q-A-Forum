<p>try this man : just pull out the click assignment from all of your if - else statement thats it, something </p>

<p>like the below code. So what is the problem and what is the solution of it?</p>

<p>you said that when i click on item 1 in list after populating the list with 14 items every thing works well but when the list populates with more items when i click on item 1, item 15th also responds. so why?</p>

<p>this is because of convertView. convertView is a view thats created and recycled through scrolling the list. this view makes GC be called less and also save memory for you. it first assigned by your earliest items of list after you scroll the list, for example item one of list disappears and you see item 15 the convertView of item one is passed again to you. in this time it is not null so you skip click assignment to it and it holdes the reference of last click assignment that is the assignment of item one. so when you click on item 1 it means you also click on item 15 because the click assignment for both of them is the same. so each row must be assigned by new event listener . </p>
