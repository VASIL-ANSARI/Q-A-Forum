<p>You can make your code more pythonic by replacing the list comprehension with a simple call to <code>list</code>:</p>

<pre><code>print(list(hist_full_g(img.scale(12,44))))
</code></pre>

<p>There is never a good reason to do:</p>

<pre><code>[x for x in iterable]
</code></pre>

<p>since <code>list(iterable)</code> yields the same result.</p>

<p>You might also want to use two lines to break up the code a little:</p>

<pre><code>hist = hist_full_g(img.scale(12, 44))
print(list(hist))
# or
hist = list(hist_full_g(img.scale(12, 44)))
print(hist)
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice too that I added a space after <code>,</code> in the call to <code>img.scale</code>.  Having spaces separate function arguments keeps everything from looking so compact.  In fact, this style is used all throughout <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out" rel="nofollow">PEP 0008</a> (the official style guide for Python code).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to use a for-loop:</p>

<pre><code>value = img.scale(12, 44)
for f in hist_full_g, list, print:
    value = f(value)
</code></pre>

<p>The readability may not be great, but it gets rid of all the parenthesis.</p>
