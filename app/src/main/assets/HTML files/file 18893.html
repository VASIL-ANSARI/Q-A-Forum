<p>The good news is, if you're using the same version and release of MySQL now as you were before, your data is probably not lost.  You just have to sort out why MySQL cannot find the database files.</p>

<p>If you can get the MySQL command line program to start, try running the query</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>show variables like 'datadir';</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See if the data directory is set where you expect it to be.  If not, edit my.ini (it may be taking a my.ini from a location you don't expect).</p>

<p>If you cannot get the MySQL Windows Service to start, check the Windows event log.</p>
