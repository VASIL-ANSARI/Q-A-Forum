<p>In <code>img src</code> you are supposed to have <code>../../../../assets/images/bottom/123.png</code>, not <code>url(../../../../assets/images/bottom/123.png)</code>. The parenthesis at the end (but nothing at the start) is the result of the browser trying to make sense out of nonsense. <code>url(...)</code> is CSS; you've mixed up the languages.</p>
