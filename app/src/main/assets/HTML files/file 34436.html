<p><code>currLatLong</code> is already defined as <code>LatLng</code> object. Therefore, if the map is loading perfectly but the marker isn't, this should solve the problem:</p>

<pre><code>marker = new google.maps.Marker({
    position: currLatLong,
    map: map,
    title:"a" // also possible typo problem comma
});
</code></pre>
