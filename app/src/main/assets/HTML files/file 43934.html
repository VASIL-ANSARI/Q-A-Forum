<pre><code>continue_element.visible? 
</code></pre>

<p>is not going to raise an error, it is just going to return a boolean. It sounds like this element doesn't actually end up visible, and this would still raise the error regardless of the implicit wait:</p>

<pre><code>raise unless continue_element.visible?
</code></pre>

<p>Also, a better pattern for this is: </p>

<pre><code>continue.wait_until_present 
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>continue.when_present.click 
</code></pre>

<p><code>.present?</code> just means <code>.exists?</code> &amp;&amp; <code>.visible?</code> which is actually what you want, and this pattern will give you a better error message.</p>
