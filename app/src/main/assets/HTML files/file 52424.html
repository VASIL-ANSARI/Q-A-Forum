<p>Page load shouldn't be that much of a problem. But some of the images are quite large, especially the ones being served up for your article images, some of these images are over 1000px wide but only being used at 450px or less. </p>

<p>As these are CSS background images this can easily be dealt with the aid of media queries. </p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>.article-card.privacy {
    url(/images/articles/whatsapp-small.jpg);
}

@media (min-width: 720px) {
    .article-card.privacy {
        url(/images/articles/whatsapp-medium.jpg);
    }
}

@media (min-width: 960px) {
    .article-card.privacy {
        url(/images/articles/whatsapp-large.jpg);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would obviously need to create three different images, one for each size and of course.</p>

<p>You could help speed up their download times by compressing them a little further. Try an online service such as <a href="https://kraken.io" rel="nofollow">https://kraken.io</a>, even if you've saved for web in photoshop you can always squeeze a little more out of them.</p>
