<pre><code>auto the_one = std::min_element(nums.rbegin(), given,
  [given](int a, int b) {
    bool good_a = a &gt; *given;
    bool good_b = b &gt; *given;
    return (good_a &amp;&amp; good_b) ? a &lt; b : good_a;
  });
</code></pre>

<p>The trick is to write a comparison function that declares any "good" element (one that's greater than <code>*given</code>) to compare smaller than any "not good" element. Two "good" elements are compared normally; two "bad" elements are always declared equivalent.</p>
