<p>You're declaring the default argument value in the function declaration ("prototype") on line 32, <em>and</em> in its definition on line 53.  For reasons unknown to me, the gods of C++ have decided that this is not allowed: see the following excerpt from 8.3.6/4 of the C++ 2003 standard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A default argument shall not be redefined by a later declaration (not even to the same value).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this is from the now quite old C++ 03 standard -- but either the compiler you're using is still in that mode, or this behaviour remains unchanged in C++11, or both.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> I forgot to mention how to solve the problem!  Just delete the default argument from every declaration except the first.</p>
