<p>Most likely the scope that allocated <code>struct job_data job_info</code> on the stack no longer exists when you retrieve your pointer.</p>

<p>If the scope has ended by the time you retrieve your pointer then the contents will most likely have been overwritten by then.</p>

<p>You can fix this by either making sure the scope is valid as long as the pointer has to be accessed or to allocate the struct on the heap (<code>malloc</code> and family).</p>
