<p>By installing typescript with</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g typescript 
</code></pre>

<p>you should get also the command line compiler (<code>tsc</code>) that you can invoke like you were doing</p>

<pre><code>tsc main.ts --module commonjs -out out/main.js
</code></pre>

<p>what you were trying to execute is probably not taking the arguments at all (did you build typescript from source?), all compilation should be done with <code>tsc</code>. Even the <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Tutorial" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> suggests doing so, and you can find more examples in the <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook" rel="nofollow">handbook</a>.</p>
