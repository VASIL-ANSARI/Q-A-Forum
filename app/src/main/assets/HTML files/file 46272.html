  <ol>
  <li>Why is the response in an array when I use promise? </li>
  </ol>

<p>Because the <code>request</code> library is violating the callback contract by resolving the callback with multiple parameters. Bluebird has no choice but to wrap it in an array. You can easily <code>.get(0)</code> or <code>.get(1)</code> in order to access the specific property.</p>

<pre><code>request.getAsync("...").get(0); // just the response
request.getAsync("...").spread(function(response, body){ // spread arguments
      // ...
});
</code></pre>

  <ol start="2">
  <li>Why is the clientError predicate is not being called at all?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the promise is not at an exception state, the previous promise <em>resolved</em> and the <code>then</code> callback ran.</p>
