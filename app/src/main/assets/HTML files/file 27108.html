<p>Recursion is not going to be faster then loops.  In fact, due to pushing a function call onto the stack, it could very well be slower.</p>

<p>Right now your code makes no sense, you are printing out "I am in first/second/third" inside the loop.  You aren't really doing anything arithmetically that can be improved.  The only main suggestion I have is to not name all the variables x, that is very confusing.  </p>

<p>As long as you have those three loops and want to do all that printing, nothing can make it go faster.</p>
