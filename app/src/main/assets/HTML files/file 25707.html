<p>The <code>EXISTS</code> looks alright, but without seeing which rows are being deleted it's hard to tell what the problem is, and I don't want to review 145,000 rows any more than you do :)</p>

<p>Try this alternative and see if it makes any difference:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM A
WHERE (SKU, TRIM(TypeDesc)) IN (SELECT SKU, TRIM(TypeDesc) FROM B)
</code></pre>
