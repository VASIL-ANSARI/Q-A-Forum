<p>Could be an issue with anti-aliasing.  Try enabling it on the <code>Paint</code> object via <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html#setAntiAlias(boolean)" rel="nofollow"><code>setAntiAlias(true)</code></a>.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, please post a screenshot of what you're seeing.</p>
