<p>You can use <code>Tag</code> for storing data that you need, for example you can save a <code>Tuple&lt;int,int&gt;</code> in <code>Tag</code> so when a picture box is clicked you can retreive it via <code>((sender as PictureBox).Tag as Tuple&lt;int,int&gt;)</code> in <code>OnClick</code> event handler, then you know this picture box is in which row and in which column, 
Do not forget to assign <code>Tag</code> when you are populating your <code>tiles</code> array</p>
