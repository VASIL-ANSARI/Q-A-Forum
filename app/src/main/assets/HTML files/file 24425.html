<p>Do you have mingw47_32 installed? The Qt you download needs the very same compiler the Qt libraries where compiled with, and that is the one that appears in the name of the download.</p>

<p>So my guess is that you're compiling with some other mingw which is not version 4.7 / 32 bits. Download that version, point Qt to it in Tools >> Options >> Kits. Rebuild then.</p>
