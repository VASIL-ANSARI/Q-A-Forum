<p>From a Vala developer in irc, #vala on irc.gnome.org:</p>

<pre><code>   18:57 &lt; flo&gt; It is of course possible to distribute the C code as
         well. The compiler itself is shiped with vala and C code. We
         actually access C-libraries over an abstract interface with all
         advantages and disadvantages of the libraries we are using,
         including platform dependencies.
