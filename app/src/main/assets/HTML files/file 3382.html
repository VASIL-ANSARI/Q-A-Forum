<p>Never rely on raw strings for path literals, as raw strings have some rather <em>peculiar</em> inner workings, known to have bitten people in the ass:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When an "r" or "R" prefix is present, a character following a backslash is included in the string without change, and all backslashes are left in the string. For example, the string literal <code>r"\n"</code> consists of two characters: a backslash and a lowercase "n". String quotes can be escaped with a backslash, but the backslash remains in the string; for example, <code>r"\""</code> is a valid string literal consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double quote; <code>r"\"</code> is not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes). Specifically, a raw string cannot end in a single backslash (since the backslash would escape the following quote character). Note also that a single backslash followed by a newline is interpreted as those two characters as part of the string, not as a line continuation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To better illustrate this last point:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; r'\'
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
&gt;&gt;&gt; r'\''
"\\'"
&gt;&gt;&gt; '\'
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
&gt;&gt;&gt; '\''
"'"
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; r'\\'
'\\\\'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '\\'
'\\'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print r'\\'
\\
&gt;&gt;&gt; print r'\'
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
&gt;&gt;&gt; print '\\'
