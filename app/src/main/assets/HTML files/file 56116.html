<p>While people have already commented and down voted you for your question.  And I agree if you have program and DB design control I would suggest storing the tags in a separate many to many table.</p>

<p>However, there are actually plenty of valid reasons to store a concatenated value in a database and sometimes you will need to spit or search the values.  Run a search for split concatenated string to rows.  Here is a stackoverflow question on it already.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5493510/turning-a-comma-separated-string-into-individual-rows">Turning a Comma Separated string into individual rows</a></p>

<p>If that is too much trouble @Rahul mentions you can use <code>LIKE</code> in which case you would actually do something like</p>

<pre><code> WHERE [Tags] LIKE '%' + @a + '%'
OR WHERE [Tags] LIKE '%' + @b + '%'
</code></pre>

<p>etc..  The problem with this approach is say someone tags the word "things" and someone else tags another record "something" and the user searches for "thing" both would be returned.</p>

<p>you can also go the route you are going and do some crazy <code>substring</code> magic. The trick to troubleshooting that would be to create columns with the where conditions to see what values you are actually getting and tweak your statements as needed. Without a dataset I am not going to try to figure out what is wrong with the index positions. I personally would chop the string up though.</p>
