<p>Android only allows your application's handlers five seconds to execute before you'll get an "App not responding" message. Depending on the loop count, your <code>onClick</code> method could easily exceed that limit.</p>

<p>If you want to display an automatically updating counter, you will need to launch an asynchronous task that executes in the background.</p>
