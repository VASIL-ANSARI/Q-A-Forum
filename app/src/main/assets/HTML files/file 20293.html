<p>There are multiple ways to get the mapview centered on a user, you seem to be doing three of them and got all of them wrong.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In <code>showCurrentLocation</code> you turn on the userlocation on the map, then a micro second later you ask it for the location and try to set that as your centre, you haven't given it time.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>viewDidLoad</code> you turn on the location manager but you haven't implemented <code>didUpdateToLocation</code> which is the method that gets called when location information is received.</p></li>
<li><p><code>mapView.userTrackingMode=YES</code> is bad. The tracking mode is not a boolean, set it to a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKMapView_Class/MKMapView/MKMapView.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/MKUserTrackingMode" rel="nofollow">valid value</a> and it'll do something more useful </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a summary of how to use them</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you want to show the user's blue dot and occasionally let them center back on that location, turn on the showsUserLocation and when the button is pressed get the user's location from the map.</p></li>
<li><p>If you only want to go to the user's location when a button is pressed, and you don't need to show their location the rest of the time, start the location manager and implement the missing delegate methods. Every time <em>valid</em> location data is received, save it somewhere and when the button is pressed you can recall it and set that as center.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want the standard map button that will cycle through showing the user, tracking the user, and turning to face the way they faced then add a <code>MKUserTrackingBarButtonItem</code> and link that button to your map. It then takes care of moving the view and rotating it according to what the user presses, and it'll turn itself off if they scroll away from it.</p></li>
</ol>
