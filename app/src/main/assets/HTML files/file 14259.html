<p>Its timing out. This link may help. </p>

<p>Control channel keep-alive feature:
During file transfers, the data connection is busy, but the control connection is idle. FTP servers know that the control connection is in use, so won't close it through lack of activity, but it's a lot harder for network routers to know that the control and data connections are associated with each other. Some routers may treat the control connection as idle, and disconnect it if the transfer over the data connection takes longer than the allowable idle time for the router. 
One solution to this is to send a safe command (i.e. NOOP) over the control connection to reset the router's idle timer. This is enabled as follows:</p>

<pre><code> ftpClient.setControlKeepAliveTimeout(300); // set timeout to 5 minutes
</code></pre>

<p>This will cause the file upload/download methods to send a NOOP approximately every 5 minutes.</p>
