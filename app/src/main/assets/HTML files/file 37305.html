<p>When writing your own gem, you should include all its requirements in a <code>.gemspec</code> file. That way, the <code>gem</code> program can make sure it installs all the dependencies when the user runs <code>gem install gem_name</code>, and your code won't crash when it runs the <code>require 'my_dependency'</code> line. </p>

<p>If you want to use other libraries in your code, you need both parts. The Gemspec file makes sure dependencies are installed; the <code>require</code> statement loads it when your code runs. </p>

<p>In this case, you should use the <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/#add_runtime_dependency" rel="nofollow"><code>add_runtime_dependency</code> method</a> in your Gemspec. Something like this: </p>

<pre><code>Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  # Required attributes omitted
  s.add_runtime_dependency('cssmin') # If you don't care which version is installed
  s.add_runtime_dependency('nokogiri', '&gt;= 1.2') # If you want a version greater than or equal to 1.2
  s.add_runtime_dependency('kaminari', '~&gt; 1.1') # If you want a version between 1.1 and 1.9.
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can read more about declaring dependencies in <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#declaring-dependencies" rel="nofollow">the Rubygems documentation</a>.</p>
