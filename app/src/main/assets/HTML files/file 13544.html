<p>Any recursive function can be converted to a non-recursive function.</p>

<p>For example, use a queue of some kind. Push the different parameters to the <code>isConnected2</code> method onto the queue, and then continually pop a set of parameters from the queue, and evaluate them. If that evaluation results in what would have been more calls to the function, push a new set of parameters on to the queue. You can then terminate if the queue gets too large or after a certain length of time has passed.</p>

<p>This way you use the heap instead of the stack, and avoid the potential for a stack overflow.</p>
