<p>Yes, you have to encode it.</p>

<p>From Wiki: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Authorization field is constructed as follows:</p>
  
  <p>Username and password are combined into a string "username:password".</p>
  
  <p>The resulting string is then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of
  Base64, except not limited to 76 char/line.</p>
  
  <p>The authorization method and a space i.e. "Basic " is then put before the encoded string.</p>
  
  <p>For
  example, if the user agent uses 'Aladdin' as the username and 'open
  sesame' as the password then the field is formed as follows:</p>
  
  <p>Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==</p>
