<p>It looks like you're using the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/" rel="nofollow">Railsinstaller</a> ruby binary, which is basically a redistribution of <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/" rel="nofollow">RubyInstaller</a> with some of the essentials for Rails development bundled. </p>

<p>However, everything is actually working as intended.</p>

<p>Cygwin doesn't won't use <code>PATHTEXT</code> because it doesn't need to. In other words, it will call the <code>rails</code> binstub instead of the <code>rails.bat</code> batch file. Since there is a <code>hashbang</code> in the binstubs, cygwin handles the entire execution itself.</p>

<p>Also, the RubyInstaller distribution wasn't compiled for Cygwin. So <code>ruby.exe</code> doesn't understand the look-up of the Cygwin paths. That is why you're getting a <code>LoadError</code>. </p>

<p>In my opinion, you should probably check out <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12252443/527152">this answer by Luis Lavena to a similar question</a>. However, if you really want to, you can recompile Ruby in Cygwin or get a Cygwin Ruby distribution.</p>
