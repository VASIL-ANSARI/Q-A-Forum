<p>The issue is likely that the notification is sent (and therefore received) on a different thread than the main thread.  Only on the main thread will you be able to update UI elements (like a label).</p>

<p>See my answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8032652/is-it-ok-to-use-of-a-notification-to-communication-back-to-the-main-thread-of-an/8033344#8033344">this question</a> for some insight into threads and NSNotifications.</p>

<p>Use something like:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@"Code executing in Thread %@",[NSThread currentThread] );
</code></pre>

<p>to compare your main thread versus where your recieveNotifcation: method is being executed.</p>

<p>If it is the case that you are sending the notification out on a thread that is not the main thread, a solution may be to broadcast your nsnotifications out on the main thread like so:</p>

<pre><code>//Call this to post a notification and are on a background thread      
- (void) postmyNotification{
  [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(helperMethod:) withObject:Nil waitUntilDone:NO];
}

//Do not call this directly if you are running on a background thread.
- (void) helperMethod{
  [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"SOMENAME" object:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you only care about the label being updated on the main thread, you can perform that operation on the main thread using something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_sync(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){
                            [label setText:@"Success!"];
                        });
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that was helpful!</p>
