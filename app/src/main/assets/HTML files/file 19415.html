<p>If you are not constrained to do this within sql server, your best bet is to </p>

<ol>
<li>export your data to a text file </li>
<li>write a program in your favorite language to process that text file (i would recommend just exporting recnum and the new groupid, and only those where the groupid is not null)
<ul>
<li>even over 35 million+ rows, this should only take a few minutes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188365.aspx" rel="nofollow">bulk insert</a> to bring your data back into sql server
<ul>
<li>again, just a few minutes</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>use an UPDATE ... FROM statement to join your bulk-inserted table back to your 
original table to update the groupid column</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE o 
SET GroupID = bi.GroupID
FROM OriginalTable o 
    INNER JOIN BulkInsertTable bi 
    ON o.RecNum = bi.RecNum
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>this one will take significantly longer, but since the time it is taking is the time to write your data to disk, it is unavoidable</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
