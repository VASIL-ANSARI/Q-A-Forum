<p>You could <code>.build</code> the associated dismissal:</p>

<pre><code>record = BowlingRecord.new(
  extra_balls: 5,
  maidens: 3,
  runs: 56
)

record.dismissals.build dismissal_type: :bowled

record.save!
</code></pre>

<p><code>.build</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns a new object of the collection type that has been instantiated with attributes and linked to this object, but have not yet been saved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/CollectionProxy.html#method-i-build" rel="nofollow">ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Through <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/AutosaveAssociation.html" rel="nofollow">ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation</a>, the dismissal is saved automatically when the parent BowlingRecord is saved. This happens within a transaction, so you don't end up in an inconsistent state if one of the two fails to save.</p>
