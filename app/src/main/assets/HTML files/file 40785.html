<p>Looking at your JSFiddle, there was a commented block which was close to the right answer, however you missed a couple of things.  Firstly circles use the cx and cy properties rather than x and y so you need to refer to those for position.  Secondly you were calling s.shapes.each before the draw method and the shapes property of the series is only populated after drawing.  You could move the block after the draw method, but I have switched it to use the series.afterDraw property instead:</p>

<pre><code>s.afterDraw = function (shp, d) {
    var shape = d3.select(shp);
    svg.append("text")
        .attr("x", parseFloat(shape.attr("cx")))
        .attr("y", parseFloat(shape.attr("cy")) + 4)
        .style("text-anchor", "middle")
        .style("font-size", "10px")
        .style("font-family", "sans-serif")
        .style("opacity", 0.7)
        .text(d.zValue);
};
</code></pre>
