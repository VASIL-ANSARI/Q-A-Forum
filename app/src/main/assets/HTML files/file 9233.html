<p>The problem is that you are building a wrong query, since you pass the params to the questionmarks all the way through your statement.</p>

<p>Your resulting query looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code> =&gt; ["color = ?", "black", "doors = ?", "4", "type = ?", "sedan"] 
</code></pre>

<p>In order to achieve your desired array, you would have to do something like this.</p>

<pre><code>conditions = []
conditions += ["color = ?", "black"]
array = ["doors = ?", "4"]
conditions[0].concat(" AND ")
conditions[0].concat(array[0])
conditions &lt;&lt; array[1]
</code></pre>

<p>If you repeat the last steps, you should get your required result.</p>
