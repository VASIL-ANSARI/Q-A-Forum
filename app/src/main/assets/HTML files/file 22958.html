<p>It's rather unclear from the code, but based on the video and a hunch I'd guess a single swipe with the finger ends up as several line segments. This means that the dashing starts from scratch several times, creating the effect in the video. You probably need a NSMutableArray where you put all those currentPoint into, and then draw them all as one line every time you redraw.</p>

<p>This question has more information on how to draw lines in this way: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4229871/iphone-core-graphics-thicker-dashed-line-for-subview">iPhone Core Graphics thicker dashed line for subview</a></p>
