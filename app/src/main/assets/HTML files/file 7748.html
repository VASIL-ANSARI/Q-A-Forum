<p>The built-in HTML helpers in both Web Pages and MVC automatically HTML encode all the input values. I'm quite sure there isn't any way to get your scenario to work using the built-in helper.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, all the source code to these helpers is available on the CodePlex site as part of the <a href="http://aspnet.codeplex.com/releases/view/58781" rel="nofollow">MVC source code release</a>. You can have a look at that source code and write a custom helper that is better targeted to your scenario of having indentation.</p>
