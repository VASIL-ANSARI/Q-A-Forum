<p>I think you may need to use the pre link function of the directive (or maybe even the compile function) when you modify the DOM and angular needs to be aware of the new elements (ie: the injected elements contains angular code).</p>

<p>See <a href="https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.16/docs/api/ng/service/" rel="nofollow">https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.16/docs/api/ng/service/</a>$compile</p>

<p>To change it to a pre-link, do the following: </p>

<pre><code>.directive('chartType', ['$compile', function($compile) {
    return {
        scope: {
            type : '@chartType'
        },
        link: {
            pre : function (scope, element, attributes) {
                attributes.$set(scope.type, "");
                $compile(element.contents())(scope);
            }
        }
    }
}]);
</code></pre>

<p>If this doesn't work, then you might need to use the compile function instead. But I've done this kind of directive in the past and never needed to use the compile function, pre-link was alright for my case.</p>
