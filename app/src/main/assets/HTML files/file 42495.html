<p>Without testing the code I just assume that the problem might be related to rounding errors of the <code>float</code> or <code>double</code> variable <code>change</code>. 1.25 - 1.00 - 0.20 might become slightly less than 0.05.</p>

<p>This would actually lead to an infinite loop, because your code does not terminate when <code>change</code> is smaller than 0.05. </p>

<p>I'd recommend using an <code>int</code> or a <code>long</code> variable and having the price in cents and terminating the loop when the <code>change</code> is smaller than the smallest coin.</p>

<p>If this is not feasible, please have a look at the type <code>BigDecimal</code> that is preferred when you need to deal with money amounts.</p>
