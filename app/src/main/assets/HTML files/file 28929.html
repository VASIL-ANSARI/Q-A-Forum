<p>Given that a person can have multiple roles for a book, I would create a separate table (say book_person_role) with person-id/book-id as foreign key and a role-id. Thus you get a one-to-many relation from book_person to book_person_role. I wouldn't create a table per role; that would mean changing the schema when a role is added/deleted/changed.</p>
