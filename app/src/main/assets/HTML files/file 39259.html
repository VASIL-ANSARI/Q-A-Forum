<p><a href="https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ddl-generator" rel="nofollow">DDL-generator</a> can do this. It can generate DDL's for YAML, JSON, CSV, Pickle and HTML (although I don't know how the last one works). I just tried it on some data exported from Salesforce and it worked pretty well. Note you need to use it with Python 3, I could not get it to work with Python 2.7.</p>
