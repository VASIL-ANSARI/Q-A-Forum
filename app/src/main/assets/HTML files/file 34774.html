<p>Definitely not a UIView for each - instead, a single UIView for the entire equalizer. Fill in the drawRect method with the appropriate CG calls to draw whatever is required. You can queue the view to refresh as needed with the appropriate data. Tapping into CADisplayLink will help you get the frame-rate you're looking for.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also subclass CALayer and draw in it if you prefer something lighter-weight than UIView but I think you'll be fine with the former.</p>
