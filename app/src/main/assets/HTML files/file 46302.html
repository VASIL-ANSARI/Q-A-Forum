  <p>Tuples are useful for temporary groups of related values. They are not suited to the creation of complex data structures. If your data structure is likely to persist beyond a temporary scope, model it as a class or structure, rather than as a tuple. For more information, see Classes and Structures.</p>

<p>And your tuple is pretty complex, so whether or not you need to persist the data I'd recommend using a struct or class anyway.  Otherwise it will inevitably become hard to read and work with and will hurt the productivity of you and anyone you're working with that has to use it.</p>
