<p>The ANTLR plugin for Visual Studio only provides editor features and simplified ability to add new grammars to a project. It does not perform any code generation itself.</p>

<p>The C# targets for both ANTLR 3 and ANTLR 4 are seamlessly integrated with MSBuild. By design, the target does not support command line generation of parsers because they do not meet requirements I have for reliable software builds. However, I would be open to including support for non-MSBuild support provided the generation always occurs as part of the build, and not as an independent step. All properly-configured installations of the C# target will automatically regenerate the parsers following your modifications when you build the project, even if Visual Studio is not installed.</p>

<p>For ANTLR 4, follow the <a href="https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4cs" rel="nofollow">instructions here</a> for generating code, but skip the parts involving the optional Visual Studio extension. If you have trouble with any specific part, please create a new issue and describe the steps you tried and the system configuration you are working with.</p>

<p>For ANTLR 3, the instructions were created prior to migrating the project to GitHub, so they are <a href="https://github.com/antlr/antlrcs/raw/master/ANTLRCSharpDocumentation.docx" rel="nofollow">in Word format here</a>. Issues related to this documentation can be created on the <a href="https://github.com/antlr/antlrcs" rel="nofollow">ANTLR 3 C# Target project on GitHub</a>. <strong>Important note (edit):</strong> The documentation was also written prior to the creation of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Antlr3/3.5.0.3-alpha002" rel="nofollow">Antlr3</a> NuGet package. Installing this NuGet package using the NuGet package manager will automatically configure the project file, eliminating the need for steps 1.1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 in the documentation.</p>
