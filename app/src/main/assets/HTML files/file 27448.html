<p>In order for your first column of labels to be one under the other, then all those labels need to be in one parallel group.  Your code creates parallel groups for each label/field combo, and adds those groups separately, so they do not appear in the same vertical (or horizontal) columns (or rows) as each other.</p>

<p>Your code is going to need to determine how many label/field pairs you want to display in each column, and create one parallel group that contains them all.</p>

<p>(alternately, I supposed you could have a panel that contained the label and field, and put a group of those panels in the same parallel group.  I think it would be easier to align all the labels and fields, however, if they were in their own columns.)</p>
