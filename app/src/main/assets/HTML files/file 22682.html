<p>You are using <code>IXmlLineInfo</code> and from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.ixmllineinfo.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Provides an interface to enable a class to return line and position
  information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which may be the cause of this error. I guess nothing is returned using <code>yield return</code> (since it is never called) and using <code>item.MoveNext()</code> results in <code>objXmlReader</code> move to the last element of the xml which results in an exception.</p>

<p>Note that, this is just a guess based on the data you have provided.</p>
