  <p>Each time this happened, the users whose addresses got mixed up, had logged in at the exact same time (+- 2 seconds). I unsuccessfully tried to reproduce this by logging in with two different users at the same time and comparing the Session data.</p>

<p>The problem you describe has most likely arisen because of overzealous caching and / or problems with data leakage at one end or the other.</p>

<p>I think its very unlikely that the sessions are getting confused at the PHP end - however there may be problems with session aliasing in your code. It would have been helpful to know if your PHP instances are running as forked processes or threads.</p>

<p>The right way to test if the problem is on the remote server (which is significantly more likely of the remote server uses threading) is to script the operation - NOT use a browser - and run the test hundreds of times with different pairs of credentials - not just once.</p>
