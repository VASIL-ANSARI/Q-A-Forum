<p>Simply put, it's because the <code>getClass</code> method returns <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, no matter what type of class the object actually is. Even though the reference of type <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code> is, in this instance, pointing to an object of type <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code>, the method signature defines the return type as <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, so that is what the compiler is expecting back.</p>

<p>To the compiler, you are casting a <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code> to a <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code>, and that flags a warning because there is no way to ensure, <em>by return type alone</em>, that this is the case.</p>
