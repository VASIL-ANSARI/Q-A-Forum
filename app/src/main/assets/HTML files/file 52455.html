<p>This is because mysql full text search has a stop word list <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-stopwords.html" rel="nofollow">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-stopwords.html</a></p>

<p>which contains some common words which will be ignored for the search. Hence you are getting no result for <code>Hello</code></p>

<p>If you want to disable that follow this for myisam engine <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12678920/ignoring-mysql-fulltext-stopwords-in-query">ignoring mysql fulltext stopwords in query</a></p>
