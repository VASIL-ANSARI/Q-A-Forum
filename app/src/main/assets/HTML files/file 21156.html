<p>Seems like you are using EF Code First with MVC.</p>

<p>The simplest answer is that you need to a List of Executives, pass the list in a model back to your View, create a select list, and render a drop down list.</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Execx()
{
    Model Model = new Model();
    Model.execList = dbcontext.Executives;

    return View(Model);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your View:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.execId, new SelectList(Model.execList, "ExecutiveId", "ExecutiveName "))
</code></pre>

<p>This is untested code. I slapped the pieces together to give you the idea.</p>
