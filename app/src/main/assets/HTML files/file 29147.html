<p>The answer is that on Ubuntu 13.04 the Ubuntu Software Center informed me of the existence of lua5.2 but did not inform me of the existence of liblua5.2-0-dev.</p>

<p>I used apt-get to find it based on the suggestion for lhf that I needed the 5.2 headers.</p>

<p>My lua script calling a native dll/so demo went off just fine as a result</p>
