<p>I think that will be difficult with VBA.</p>

<p>If you can limit the functionality to Office 2003+, you can use the Visual Studio Tools for the Office Runtime (VSTOR) to develop an add-in with managed .NET code, which I expect will be a much easier route.</p>

<p>There is a tool that is installed with Visual Studio called wsdl.exe, which can be used to generate the appropriate classes from your wsdl.</p>

<p>As to the specifics of ws-security, I'm not much help.</p>
