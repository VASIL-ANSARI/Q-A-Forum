<p>You could use a command like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE copied AS SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE 0
</code></pre>

<p>but due to SQLite's dynamic typing, most type information would be lost.</p>

<p>If you need just a table that behaves like the original, i.e., has the same number and names of columns, and can store the same values, this is enough.</p>

<p>If you really need the type information exactly like the original, you can read the original SQL <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement from the <code>sqlite_master</code> table, like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='mytable'
</code></pre>
