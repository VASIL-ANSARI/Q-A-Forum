<p>You cannot have the pipe <code>|</code> character in your filename. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.text.privatefontcollection.addfontfile%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">PrivateFontCollection.AddFontFile</a> requires a valid filepath.  Hence your "Illegal characters in path" exception. The input at MSDN is <code>A String that contains the file name of the font to add.</code>  Try passing a single file at a time - I don't know about this piping idea..</p>

<p>As for your Postscript desire, the Remarks section states that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType" rel="nofollow">OpenTypes</a> have limited support.</p>
