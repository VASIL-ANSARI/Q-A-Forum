<p>I think this is what you need:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name="nameInput" type='text' ng-model='user.username' ng-pattern="/^[A-Z0-9]*$/i"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/input" rel="nofollow">Angular documentation</a> explicitly states that you should not use the g flag.</p>

<p>The asterisk in the regexp means 'zero or more', so the empty string will be regarded as valid. You could use '+' instead ('one or more'), but this implies that the error message will appear right away, when the user hasn't typed anything in the input field yet. You could use ng-required instead.</p>
