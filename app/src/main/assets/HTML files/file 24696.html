<p>It is good practice to provide different sized versions (actual width x height pixel sizes) of each of your images in each of the corresponding folders. This ensures that Android picks the appropriate one based on the device to deliver the sharpest image. You can put them all in the <code>/drawable/</code> folder only but this will result in blurry looking images - this is especially apparent at higher densities. Give this a read again, it explains it well: <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#support" rel="nofollow">Supporting Multiple Screens</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The "default" resources are those that are not tagged with a configuration qualifier. For example, the resources in drawable/ are the default drawable resources. The system assumes that default resources are designed for the baseline screen size and density, which is a normal screen size and a medium density. As such, the system scales default density resources up for high-density screens and down for low-density screens, as appropriate.</p>

<p>As to the bitmap out-of-memory error, this is a complex issue to do with memory-allocation on Android. Unfortunately you cannot accurately tell in advance how much memory you have available, and putting Bitmaps into memory is quite expensive. Without knowing about the rest of your application it's hard to give an exact solution but there are defensive measures you can take to ensure this doesn't happen, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making a global, static reference to a bitmap and re-using it</li>
<li>Making sure you are removing any references to that Bitmap from views and calling <code>Bitmap.recycle()</code> when you are done with it</li>
<li>Using a <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/cache-bitmap.html" rel="nofollow">Memory Cache</a></li>
</ul>
