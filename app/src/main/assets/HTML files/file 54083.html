<p>Because you're encoding the filename yourself, you're using the non-standard MIME encoding format, as described in the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/faq/index.html#encodefilename" rel="nofollow">JavaMail FAQ</a>.  That non-standard encoded text is then being split into multiple parameters using the standard RFC 2231 technique.  It's this mix of non-standard and standard format that's probably causing the confusion for the mail reader.</p>

<p>Try letting JavaMail do the encoding for you by removing the call to <code>MimeUtility.encodeText</code>.  If that doesn't work, set the System property <code>mail.mime.encodeparameters</code> to <code>false</code> to disable the RFC 2231 encoding.</p>
