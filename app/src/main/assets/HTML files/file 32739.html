<p>I think it's your last line. You need to call the CatViewSet as_view(). I would go with:</p>

<pre><code>response = view(request)
</code></pre>

<p>given that you already defined <code>view = CatViewSet.as_view()</code></p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Can you show your <code>views.py</code>? Specifically, what kind of <code>ViewSet</code> did you use? I'm digging through the DRF code and it looks like you may not have any actions mapped to your ViewSet, which is triggering the error.</p>
