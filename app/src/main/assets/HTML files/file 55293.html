<p>These functions are provided by <em>an</em> expectation/assertion library to determine the 'result' of a testable operation. By itself, protractor merely provides the glue/harness for Angular-Selenium (to run within a testing framework) that exposes testable operations.</p>

<p>In this case that could be <a href="https://github.com/mjackson/expect" rel="nofollow">expect</a>. (See the link for standard expectations.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you use <code>expect</code>, you write assertions similarly to how you would say them, e.g. "I expect this value to be equal to 3" or "I expect this array to contain 3"..</p>
