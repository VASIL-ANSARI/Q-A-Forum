<p>I assume that <code>show</code> is some <code>Collection</code> type.</p>

<p>My best guess is that before you call this function, <code>show</code> doesn't actually have anything yet (i.e. <code>show.size()</code> is 0).</p>

<p>Since <code>x</code> is the number of shows, you should probably be looping like <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++)</code>, and creating new instances of <code>showInfo</code> using your data, and inserting those into <code>show</code> within your loop.</p>
