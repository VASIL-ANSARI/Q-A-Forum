<p>C# does not care. The it's the CLRs job to do the GC.</p>

<p>The GC starts at known root objects(static fields, local variables,...) and walks the references until it has found all reachable objects. All other objects can be collected(excluding some finalizer related stuff).</p>

<p>So if the child references were really the only references to these objects then the grand children will be collected too. But if some alive outside object still has a reference to one of your nodes this node and all other objects referenced by it will be kept alive.</p>

<hr>

<p>Managed memory leaks are caused by references which keep objects alive.</p>

<p>For example when using databining the GUI has references to the objects keeping them alive. </p>

<p>Similarly being subscribed to an event keeps the object associated with the event handler alive. So sometimes events use weak references to avoid this problem.</p>
