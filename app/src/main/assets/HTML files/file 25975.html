<p>The successive separate result in TDS do not have names; they are just sequential grids of results. So no, there is no way to do this. Your code needs to know (or be able to deduce) what results it is expecting. One option might be to look at the schema of each as it comes back.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at this is to look at the line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now the Stored Procedure has changed to 2 or 5 and the order is different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a breaking change; avoiding breaking changes is a <em>really</em> good idea.</p>
