<p>In multithreaded case you call the <code>Close</code> methods sooner than <code>DoRequest</code> does its work.</p>

<p>It is because these two lines are in finally block.</p>

<pre><code>socketStream.Close();
connection.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>These two lines are executed immediately after the <code>Start</code> method starts the new thread, but before that thread completes its work in <code>DoRequest</code>.</p>

<p>I would recommend you to call these methods inside <code>DoRequest</code>. You can pass <code>connection</code> object into <code>DoRequest</code>, then create <code>socketStream</code> internally in <code>DoRequest</code> and when you are finished, close both these objects before finishing the <code>DoRequest</code> method. (Or you can use any other solution, this is just one option.)</p>
