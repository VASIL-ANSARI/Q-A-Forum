<p>Yes you're right on point here. Though I think its a little less complicated. Calendars do not have to have many users. The relationship, hierarchically is ok with just users having calendars. Then, for calendars, create a polymorphic join table to allow a calendar to have many users associated with.</p>

<pre><code>#user.rb

 has_many    :calendars


#calendar.rb

 belongs_to  :many_users, :polymorphic =&gt; true
 has_many    :users, :as =&gt; :many_users
</code></pre>

<p>Your calendar table should have a <code>many_users_id</code>, and a <code>user_id</code> field.</p>
