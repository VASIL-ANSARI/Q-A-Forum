<p>I cannot totally figure out what fields/data you are passing from the huge amount of code you posted here, but to make the <code>DoctrineObject</code> hydrator find and use existing entities from the database and subsequently use these for hydration of your new object you need to pass the field(s) that correspond with the identifiers of the associating objects. </p>

<p>So let's say you want to create a new <code>Product</code> with an existing <code>Genre</code> it would mean passing the <code>genre_id</code> in the data. So something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$hydrator = new DoctrineObject($objectManager);

$data = array(
    "genre" =&gt; array(
        "genre_id" =&gt; 1
    )
);

$product = new Product();

$hydrator-&gt;hydrate($data, $product);
</code></pre>

<p>In this very basic code example the hydrator will recognize the identifier field from the <code>Genre</code> entity and use it to collect it before hydrating your new <code>Product</code>. So if you pass identifier fields in your data sets it should work.</p>

<p><code>DoctrineObject</code> won't collect any entities using other than identifier fields. So if you would pass any but identifier fields it assumes you want to make a new association with a new entity and it will use the data you pass to hydrate the new relating entity.</p>

<p><em>If passing identifier fields is what you are doing and it doesn't work, then please explain in detail what data you are exactly passing...</em></p>
