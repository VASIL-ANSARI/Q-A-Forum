<p>You said in your comment, that you're using Jackson in version <em>"2.5.4"</em>, but you're importing the <code>ObjectMapper</code> class from the <code>org.codehaus</code> package. This means, that this class is from version 1.9.13 (or from an older version).</p>

<p>I can reproduce your problem if I mix the versions using <code>ObjectMapper</code> and <code>JsonIgnoreProperties</code> from version 1.9.13 (<code>org.codehaus</code>) and <code>JsonProperty</code> from version 2.6.0 (<code>com.fasterxml</code>).</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sample [prop1=null, prop2=2, prop3=null, prop4=4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I only use version 1.9.13 or 2.6.0, then the result is ok:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sample [prop1=1, prop2=2, prop3=3, prop4=4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(for both)</p>

<p>So I recommend to make sure that you don't mix the used libraries and I recommend to use the newest version, which is from <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson" rel="nofollow">FasterXML</a>.
But the used version is up to you.</p>

<p>You can download the jar file from here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.codehaus.jackson" rel="nofollow">org.codehaus.jackson v1.9.13</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core" rel="nofollow">com.fasterxml.jackson (core) v2.6.0</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Btw about your comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@OldCurmudgeon, Thanks for responding. Changing the fields to public has not fixed the issue. I have removed the @JsonProperty annotation and then changed the setter methods to setProp_1 &amp; setProp_3, it worked. So does it mean that there is an issue with @JsonProperty annotation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you have (or hopefully had :P) a problem with that annotation: it was from a different Jackson version.</p>

<p>About your edit:</p>

<p>The link to the Jackson lib from fasterXML in the maven repository has one big advantage: it shows you which lib you should download to work with Jackson in your project.</p>

<p>You need:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind" rel="nofollow">Jackson Databind</a> (which also has the <code>ObjectMapper</code> class)</li>
<li><a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core" rel="nofollow">Jackson Core</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-annotations" rel="nofollow">Jackson Annotations</a></li>
</ul>
