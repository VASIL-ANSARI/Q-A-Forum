<p>You need to specify which directory the program can be found. This is usually the current directory in the situation you've shown, and would be expressed with <code>./</code>. So you should be able to use</p>

<pre><code>./a.out
</code></pre>

<p>As @HunterMcMillen pointed out, the reason for having to use ./ is because, unlike Windows, *nix based systems dont include the current directory in the search path. (In Windows, you can just run an executable by typing its name while in the same directory.)</p>
