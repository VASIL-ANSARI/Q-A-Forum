<p>Well, my quest for finding logically reasoning is still not satisfied, but I get the simple thing done simply. 
@Daniel, as I said I think the two questions are related, well the answer is indeed related. Maybe you can explain my finding that I am putting as answer here.</p>

<p>I simply set the TabIndex property of my Textbox and other control [TreeView] as 1 and 2, now when I press TAB or select the TreeView item using mouse, i got Lostfocus fired up. and since I have Tab Index set within control, it doesn't select Menu item of parent [it does select it as last now]. So that make Lostfocus the function I should use for my purpose. </p>

<p>Anyone with explanation or better solution is still requested to share it. Thanks.</p>
