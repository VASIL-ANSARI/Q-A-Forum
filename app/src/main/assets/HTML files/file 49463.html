<p>The second version is more performant, as is does not require the check, which will happen in every iteration of the loop and only in one case yield true.</p>

<p>Furthermore you can improve even more if you write:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i; i &lt; size; i++)
{
    temp = first_array[i];
}
second_array[size-1]= 0;
</code></pre>
