<p>This problem usually occurs because the coder used <code>GetWindowPos</code> to get the position to save, but the window is closed while minimised, so the position is a tiny window hidden by the taskbar. This is then the position which is saved. The correct method is to use <code>GetWindowPlacement</code> to save the position.</p>

<p>You could enumerate all top-level windows, check <code>GetWindowPlacement</code> to see which are visible and restored but with an inappropriate size or position (e.g. off-screen, too small). Then you could call <code>SetWindowPlacement</code> to move those windows back to a reasonable minimum size on-screen.</p>

<p>In all likelihood when they save their position again they will save the new position.</p>

<p>Don't poll though. Instead make it a utility that the user can run when they need to. (You will probably need an exceptions list too - some utilities might create an off-screen window on purpose.)</p>
