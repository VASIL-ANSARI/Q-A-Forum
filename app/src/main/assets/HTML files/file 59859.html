<p>When you say you accept 9 numbers and want to change it to be 10 numbers, I'm assuming that you mean that the number is 9 digits in length, and you want it to be 10 digits.</p>

<p>The maximum size of a 32-bit integer is ~2.1 billion. You could use a <code>long</code> instead, which is a 64-bit integer with a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.</p>
