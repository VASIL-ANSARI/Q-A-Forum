<p>Your assumption is correct: as given, your upper function returns nothing.  You've disabled the loop with a <strong>False</strong> entry condition: it won't run at all.  The only <strong>return</strong> in the function is inside that loop.</p>

<p>Thus, all that routine does is to create two sets of a single character each, and then return <strong>None</strong> to the main program.  Since you haven't included code to reproduce the problem -- in fact, the line that throws the error isn't in your example -- and no trace-back, we can't help much farther than this.</p>
