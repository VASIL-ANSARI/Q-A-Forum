<p>The child selector <code>&gt;</code> is fully supported by IE7 and later, and not at all in IE6 and earlier. Of course, all versions of all other major browsers in use today support it fully as well.</p>

<p>All CSS2.1 selectors are well-supported by IE8 and later so <a href="http://caniuse.com/css-sel2" rel="nofollow">you can use them today</a>, unless you're writing legacy code that needs to cater to IE6, in which case avoid them where possible.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/childselector" rel="nofollow">SitePoint Reference</a> does mention an obscure parsing bug related to comments that affects IE7, but it only breaks the selector if a comment is there. You don't usually put comments in the middle of selectors unless you're doing so as a hack, so you don't need to worry about this bug.</p>
