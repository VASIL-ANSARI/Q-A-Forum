<p>Change <code>*.?</code> into <code>.*?</code>:</p>

<pre><code>re.split("&lt;!--pagebreak.*?--&gt;", str)
</code></pre>

<p>Your current regex accepts any number of literal <code>k</code>'s, optionally followed by (any character).</p>

<p>Also, I would recommend using raw strings (<code>r"..."</code>) for your regular expressions. It's not necessary in this case, but it's an easy way to spare yourself a few headaches.</p>
