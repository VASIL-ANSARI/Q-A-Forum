<p>The easiest solution here is to set the warning level on a per-file basis instead of the global <code>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</code>. That way, only your own code gets the higher warning levels and you don't have to care about third-party code.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>COMPILE_FLAGS</code> property, which is available as both a <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.11/cmake.html#prop_tgt%3aCOMPILE_FLAGS" rel="nofollow">target</a> and <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.11/cmake.html#prop_sf%3aCOMPILE_FLAGS" rel="nofollow">file</a> property:</p>

<pre><code>set_property(TARGET &lt;your_target_goes_here&gt; 
             APPEND PROPERTY COMPILE_FLAGS "-Werror -Wall -Wextra")
</code></pre>

<p>The disadvantage is that you have to repeat this line for every of your targets, so you might want to wrap that into a CMake function for convenience.</p>
