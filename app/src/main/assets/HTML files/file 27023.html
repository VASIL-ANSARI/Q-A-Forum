<p>I personally avoid scaling images for mobile devices especially in AIR. Embedding images will also bloat your memory usage and swf size which is not ideal given the limited resources. I separate my asset folder structure into 160, 240, 320 and query the application DPI at runtime before loading the assets.</p>

<p>Creating a simple class containing a static method like this could be useful.</p>

<pre><code> public static getAssetPath(name:String, ext:String):String {
    switch(DPI) {
        case 320:
             return "assets/320/" + name + ext;
        case 240:
             return "assets/240/" + name + ext;
        case 160:
             return "assets/160/" + name + ext;
        default:
             throw new Error("Unknown device DPI");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
