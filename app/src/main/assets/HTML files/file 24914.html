<p>Don't use <code>.readlines()</code>. Use the file directly as an iterator:</p>

<pre><code>for file in files:
    with open(file, "r") as currentfile, open(file[:-4]+"_RGB_moved.pts", "w") as out:
        firstline = next(currentFile)
        out.write(firstline.split(None, 1)[0])

        for line in currentfile:
            out.write('\n')
            words = line.split()
            newwords = [str(float(words[0])+offsetx), str(float(words[1])+offsety), words[2], str((int(words[3]) + 2050) / 2)]              
            out.write(" ".join(newwords))
</code></pre>

<p>I also added a few Python best-practices, and you don't need to turn <code>words[2]</code> into a float, then back to a string again.</p>

<p>You could also look into using the <code>csv</code> module, it can handle splitting and rejoining lines in C code:</p>

<pre><code>import csv

for file in files:
    with open(file, "rb") as currentfile, open(file[:-4]+"_RGB_moved.pts", "wb") as out:
        reader = csv.reader(currentfile, delimiter=' ', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)
        writer = csv.writer(out, delimiter=' ', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)

        out.writerow(next(reader)[0])

        for row in reader:
            newrow = [str(float(row[0])+offsetx), str(float(row[1])+offsety), row[2], str((int(row[3]) + 2050) / 2)]              
            out.writerow(newrow)
</code></pre>
