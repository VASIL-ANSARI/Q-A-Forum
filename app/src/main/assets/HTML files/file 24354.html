<p>Your query selects the right rows.  I think the only issue is the ordering:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT genre.genre, movies.movie, movies.year
FROM `genre` JOIN
     `movies`
     ON genre.id = movies.genre_id
WHERE genre.display = 1 AND movies.display = 1
order by genre.genre, movies.year desc;
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want the genre to duplicate, you can use a funky trick.  That is, <code>union</code> the genres in with <code>NULL</code> movies, then order them correctly and remember to remove the names after that:</p>

<pre><code>select (case when movie is NULL then genre else NULL end) as genre,
       movie, year
from ((select genre, NULL as movie, NULL as year
       from genre
       where display = 1
      ) union all
      (SELECT genre.genre, movies.movie, movies.year
       FROM `genre` JOIN
            `movies`
            ON genre.id = movies.genre_id
       WHERE genre.display = 1 AND movies.display = 1
      )
     ) t
order by genre,
         movie is null desc,
         year desc
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, I would say to do this in the app layer, but it can be fun to put together the SQL for something like this.</p>
