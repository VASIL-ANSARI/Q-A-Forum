<p>The only reason I see for those methods in production code is, that you can have sealed or frozen objects, for integrity purposes.</p>

<p>For instance, I write a little library, which works just great and offers you a set of methods in an object, but I don't want to you to change or overwrite any of my properties or methods. I'm not saying I can prevent you from doing that, but I can try to prevent you do it by accident which maybe is more important.</p>

<p>Also, those methods are easy to 'shim' in environment which doen't know about them, by just returning the original object. Of course it would have no effect then.</p>

<p>I don't see any performance related reasons to do this.</p>
