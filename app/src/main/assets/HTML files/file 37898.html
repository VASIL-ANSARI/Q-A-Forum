<p>A Python set is optimized for equality tests and duplicate removal, and thus implements a hash table underneath. I believe this would make it <em>very slightly</em> slower than a list, if you have to compare every element to <code>comparephrase</code>; lists are very good for iterating over every element one after the other. The difference is probably going to be negligible in almost any case, though.</p>
