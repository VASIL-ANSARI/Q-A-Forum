<p>Per the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/p2p/WifiP2pConfig.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, the higher the number, the higher the odds that you will be the group owner, however this might not be 100% sure. Has the group information been persisted on the phone? Check the WiFi Direct settings on the phone and see if the group has been saved. If so, delete it and try to connect again, specifying the highest number possible.</p>

<p>You can edit the values of your Wifip2pConfig object. Including the groupOwnerIntent</p>
