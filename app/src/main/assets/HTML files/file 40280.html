<p>You can control the lifetime manually of objects on the stack by using braces.</p>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
    int x = 5;
    int y = 2;

    {          // This introduces a new scope
    int z = 3;
    }          // After this brace, z is now out of scope

    int a = x + y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But note that once the variable falls out of scope, when this memory is used again is not specified. Just because I declared another <code>int</code> named <code>a</code>, doesn't mean it will be assigned the address where <code>z</code> used to be.</p>
