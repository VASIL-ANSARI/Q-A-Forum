<p>I do that on some models, but usually prefer to avoid it just because many times the logic is different on create and update.</p>

<p>Anyway the following doesn't work if you haven't that field in the view.</p>

<pre><code>{!! Form::text('name_ar', old('product_meta.price') ,['class' =&gt; 'form-control']) !!}
</code></pre>

<p>old() refers to a input with that name, so if the field is named "name_ar" you can't get the old value of that using 'product_meta.price'.</p>

<p>But old() also accepts a second argument as a fallback, so you could check for the old input, then if doesn't exist (no submit has been done) set the value with the relation data like that:</p>

<pre><code>{!! Form::text('name_ar', old('name_ar', ( isset($product) ? $product-&gt;product_meta-&gt;price ,'') ) ,['class' =&gt; 'form-control']) !!}
</code></pre>

<p>The above will look for the old input named 'name_arr' on the last submit, then if it's not found (you haven't submitted yet), will look if the variable $product is set (so you're editing), than if it's not set set the value empty '' (you're creating)</p>

<p>Hope this help</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
