<p>The time zone database you are describing <em>already exists</em>. It's called the Olson zoneinfo database, it's correct for all dates after 1970, and <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones" rel="nofollow">it's available online</a>.</p>

<p>Better yet, Java's native date-and-time APIs use this database. You can load an arbitrary time zone using <code>java.util.TimeZone.getTimeZone()</code>, and get offsets or perform conversions using this object (e.g, using <code>TimeZone.getOffset(long)</code>. For instance, you'd load the <code>"America/Indiana/Indianapolis"</code> zone to convert dates and times in Indiana.</p>

<p>The one thing you can't do easily with the <code>TimeZone</code> database is actually query the rules it's using. For that, I believe you'd have to dig into the tz files directly. In most cases, though, just getting offsets for specified dates should be sufficient.</p>
