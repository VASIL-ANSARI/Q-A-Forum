<p>I got the solution.</p>

<p>Here is a "FB.init" function which calls everytime automatically when the page is loaded or refreshed . It has a function "FB.getLoginStatus" which was pretending to destroy the session because it was invoking again and again and new session was creating. On basis of which signin page checking for the session variables and getting session variables value even after destroying the session using logouy which was making the signin page to redirect to member page.
But now I removed the FB.getLoginStatus function from FB.init and now the site is working fine.</p>
