<p><code>startTime</code> is marked protected. You can't reference it from outside like you did. There must be a getter function 'getStartTime()' function in that object that would allow you to reference it publicly. </p>

<p>EDIT: Also it is returning an object array - not an single object, so you would need to reference the it like: <code>$event[0]-&gt;getterFunction()</code> or loop through the array with a <code>foreach</code> accessing the individual objects in the loop</p>
