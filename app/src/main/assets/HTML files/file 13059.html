<p>Query resources don't persist across sessions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is currently impossible to register resource variables in a
  session. For example, you cannot create a connection to a database and
  store the connection id as a session variable and expect the
  connection to still be valid the next time the session is restored.
  PHP functions that return a resource are identified by having a return
  type of resource in their function definition.</p>
