<p>If I am not mistaken, the tooltip uses fixed coordinates to display. So there is no easy fix. You could have the possison modified based on the amount you scroll. Say if you scroll 50px in the scrollable, you move the tooltip 50px y axis. This would require modifying the properties directly, and it might cause some weird problems.</p>

<p>Thats my 2 cents on how you would fix your problem.</p>
