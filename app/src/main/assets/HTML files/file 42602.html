<p>Your server seems to be okay. The reason why your server isn't able to read more than one time is this line on <strong>client-side</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("echo: " + in.readLine());
</code></pre>

<p>The client expects an answer from the server, but your server does not send anything back. So remove the above line or make the server send a response.</p>
