<p>That's not a valid decimal in French. In French the decimal sign is a comma.  </p>

<p>If your string always has a period as decimal sign, it makes no sense to use the current culture. Better to use the invariant culture:</p>

<pre><code>Convert.ToDecimal("0.000001", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>On a different note:</p>

<p>C# knows <code>using</code> directives, so you don't have to fully qualify all your types.</p>

<p>Instead of writing <code>System.Globalization.CultureInfo</code>, you can just put <code>using System.Globalization;</code> at the top of your C# file and use <code>CultureInfo</code> in your code.<br>
That makes your code a lot more readable.</p>
