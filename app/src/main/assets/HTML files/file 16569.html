<p>The <code>private</code> modifier on a setter means - private to the enclosing type.</p>

<p>That is, the property can be set by the containing type only.</p>

<p>If this was not the case, you would never be able to set the property and it would effectively be read-only.</p>

<p>From MSDN - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/st6sy9xe.aspx" rel="nofollow">private (C# Reference)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private members are accessible only within the body of the class or the struct in which they are declared</p>
</blockquote>
