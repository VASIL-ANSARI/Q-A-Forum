<p>Test frameworks generally permit you to assert that an actual result is equal to an expected result, and when that assertion fails, will print out the assertion as well as the expected and actual results.</p>

<p>There's not much more they can do. What you seem to be looking for is magical intuition on the part of software.</p>

<p>Try something like:</p>

<pre><code>response.status_code.should == 200
</code></pre>

<p>This compares the actual <code>status_code</code> with the expected <code>status_code</code>, asserting their equality, and printing both if the assertion fails.</p>
