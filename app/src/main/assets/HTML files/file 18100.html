<p>I did not work with NFC-Tech or Android this far, but it should be possible.
Having the C#-Code constantly listening to the Android device is ok, like you said, you will need your android device to route the NFC-Listener.</p>

<p>When the Android device detects an NFC-Card, it should be easily given to the C# Code via some custom method.</p>
