<p>You are effectively trying to create a pivot table. You can accomplish this by chaining together quite a few joins, here's one that works for your sample data:</p>

<pre><code>select q1.aspect, q1.value 'period 1', q2.value 'period 2', q3.value 'period 3'
  from 
    (select aspect, value 
       from the_table 
         where month = 1
    ) q1
    inner join
    (select aspect, value
       from the_table
         where month = 2
    ) q2
    on q1.aspect = q2.aspect
    inner join
    (select aspect, value
       from the_table
         where month = 3
    ) q3
    on q1.aspect = q3.aspect;
</code></pre>

<p>The general form there is tedious, but simple to expand.</p>

<p>Here's a demo fiddle: <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/6eb5d/9" rel="nofollow">http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/6eb5d/9</a></p>

<p>And here's a slightly more specific version that uses a little bit of voodoo math to work:</p>

<pre><code>select aspect, 
  sum(value * (1 - abs(sign(month - 1)))) as 'period 1', 
  sum(value * (1 - abs(sign(month - 2)))) as 'period 2', 
  sum(value * (1 - abs(sign(month - 3)))) as 'period 3'
from the_table
group by aspect
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be seen compared to the first query here:
