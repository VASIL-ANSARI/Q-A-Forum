<p>Taking your questions in order:</p>

<p>1.) Yes matplotlib is a contained python module.  It does have external dependancies but in Windows these dependencies are packaged with the matplotlib install.  Do you need to worry about these when you install on other machines?  That depends on how you are going to install.  Are you packing to an exe?  Having the end users install Python and matplotlib?  As an example you can package matplotlib into your exe with py2exe, see <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/MatPlotLib" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Of course you'll have to customize those scripts for your backend, wx.</p>

<p>2.) You are seeing the panels with plots because matplotlib provides the <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/backend_wxagg_api.html" rel="nofollow">FigureCanvasWxAgg</a>, which is a wxWidget derived from wxPanel that plays nice with matplotlib.  The advantages of using it are that you <a href="http://www.scipy.org/Matplotlib_figure_in_a_wx_panel" rel="nofollow">can set handlers for stuff like resize and painting.</a></p>

<p>Your wxBitMapButton, though is looking for a wxBitmap for the image.  You might be able to give it a file handle (cStringIO.StringIO) to a matplotlib plot and eliminate the need to write a file to disk.  You also could probably hook it's resize event and get matplotlib to redraw the figure to the appropriate size.  You aren't going to have the amount of flexibility as using the FigureCanvasWxAgg. I can't research any of this, though, as it seems the wxPython web-site is down.</p>

<p>3.) You can package wxPython into executable.  How depends on what packager you are using.  I've done this with py2exe many times.</p>
