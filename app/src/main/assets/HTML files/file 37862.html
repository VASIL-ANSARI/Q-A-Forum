<p>Note you're passing in <code>ans</code> into the function (which conveniently contains the question and answer pair), but you're not actually <em>using</em> that anywhere.</p>

<p>The line:</p>

<pre><code>var answer =prompt (questions[i] , '');
</code></pre>

<p>Should probably be:</p>

<pre><code>var answer = prompt(ans[0], ''); // Display the question
</code></pre>

<p>And the line:</p>

<pre><code>if(answer == questions[1]){
</code></pre>

<p>Should probably be:</p>

<pre><code>if(answer == ans[1]) { // Compare answer to correct answer
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it might be better to store all your answers as strings rather than numbers, since you're comparing them to strings entered by the user.  <code>['whats 3 * 3' , 9]</code> should be <code>['whats 3 * 3' , '9']</code></p>

<p>A better design also might be to use JavaScript object literals to store the question/answer pairs.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>var questions = [
  {Question: 'whats 2 + 2', Answer: '4'},
  {Question: 'whats 3 * 3', Answer: '9'},
  {Question: 'whats 2 * 7', Answer: '14'}
];
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can change your code to:</p>

<pre><code>var answer = prompt(ans.Question, ''); // Display the question
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>if(answer == ans.Answer) { // Compare answer to correct answer
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bit easier to read.</p>
