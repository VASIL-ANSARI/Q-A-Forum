<p>Your problem starts at <code>card.substring(0);</code>, which equals <code>card</code> because the substring from the start of the String. Maybe you wanted <code>card.charAt(0);</code>? But that is also wrong because <code>"10S"</code> will have three characters, two for the face value. </p>

<p>You'll need to handle a three-character input specially or be smarter about the <code>substring</code>-ing.</p>

<p>You know the suit will always be the last character, so use the length of the string to <code>charAt</code> for that. </p>

<pre><code>int suitIndex = s.length() - 1;
String suit = ""+s.charAt(suitIndex);
String face = s.substring(0,suitIndex);
</code></pre>

<p>You can also simplify the cases</p>

<pre><code>case "J":
    System.out.println("Jack of ");
    break;
case "Q":
    System.out.println("Queen of ");
    break;
case "K":
    System.out.println("King of ");
    break;
case "A":
    System.out.println("Ace of ");
    break;  
default:
    System.out.println(face + " of "); // handle all the numbers
    break;
</code></pre>
