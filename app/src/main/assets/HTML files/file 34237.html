<p>1) Yes. x264 includes the automatically. Its an SEI slice, and you can throw it away if you want.</p>

<p>2) set i_slice_max_size = 1390</p>

<p>3) Take a look at x264_param_t in x264.h. The settings are fairly self explanatory. As for setting the profile and preset call <code>int x264_param_apply_profile( x264_param_t *, const char *profile )</code> and <code>int x264_param_default_preset( x264_param_t *, const char *preset, const char *tune )</code></p>

<p>4) Yes, it is true, I want lying when I said that. Look online/on stack overflow there are a million resources on compiling ffmpeg. In fact if you compiled x264 with avcodec support you already have it on your system.</p>

<p>5) Yes!, you should be a good stack overflow citizen and up vote and accept answers form people who donate there free time and knowledge (which takes years to acquire) to helping you. </p>
