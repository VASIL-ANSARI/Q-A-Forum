<p>Actually it doesn't, but your output is <em>buffered</em>. There is buffering in the C++ stream object, in the OS data pipe, and in your terminal.</p>

<p>Your stream thinks it would be a waste of resources passing characters through one at a time, and it's kind of right: the stream doesn't know you have a second to wait in between each one.</p>

<p>You don't need the newline, though; you can basically force a flush like so:</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; std::flush;
</code></pre>

<p>Recall that <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl</code> is equivalent to <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt; std::flush</code>, and it's the <code>'\n'</code> part that you don't want.</p>

<p>This is usually enough but you <em>may</em> also need to reconfigure your terminal to turn off line buffering. (That's unlikely for <em>output</em> but quite common for input).</p>
