<p>I am not sure if this is the optimal solution but to make some changes on subviews or getting information like you do, I create a method on the subview like "prepareSubviews" or "refresh" or "populateWithData". After initializing/ loading view from IB, I invoke that method inside "viewDidLoad", at that point the xib file should be loaded and working properly.</p>
