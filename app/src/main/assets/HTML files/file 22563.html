<p>I'd recommend a server-side solution. Set a condition to add/omit the style tag from the code. Even if it's coming from a third party like an iFrame you can always use cURL to fetch the data and remove the style tag before sending it to the browser.</p>

<p>Focus on adding the style when you need it rather than removing it when you don't.</p>
