<p>I tried to use Richfaces 4.3.2 and Primefaces 3.5 together as they both include the same jQuery version 1.8.3, but it terribly <strong>failed</strong>.</p>

<p>The inspection if head-script order did not help.</p>

<p>This observation may help you: the problems even persisted, as I completely removed any primefaces components; removing the primefaces.jar (or going back to primefaces 3.3.1) <strong>DID</strong> solve the problems.</p>
