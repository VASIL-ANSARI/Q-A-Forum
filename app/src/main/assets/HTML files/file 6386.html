<p>Have you tried the <strong>singleTop</strong> launch mode?</p>

<p>Here is some of the description from <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... a new instance of a "singleTop"
  activity may also be created to handle
  a new intent. However, if the target
  task already has an existing instance
  of the activity at the top of its
  stack, that instance will receive the
  new intent (in an onNewIntent() call);
  a new instance is not created. In
  other circumstances â for example, if
  an existing instance of the
  "singleTop" activity is in the target
  task, but not at the top of the stack,
  or if it's at the top of a stack, but
  not in the target task â a new
  instance would be created and pushed
  on the stack.</p>
