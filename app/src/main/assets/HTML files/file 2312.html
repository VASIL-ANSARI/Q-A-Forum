  <p>However, if i set the layout_height of
  the TabWidget to e.g. 30px, i can't
  see the tab labels (indicator) on the
  tabs at all.</p>

<p>Note that the techniques for doing this won't necessarily be reliable in future Android releases, if they change up how a <code>TabHost</code> is constructed.</p>

  <p>Is there a way to adjust the
  positioning of the indicator?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting with API Level 4 (a.k.a., Android 1.6), <code>TabHost.TabSpec</code> accepts a <code>View</code> as the indicator via <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/reference/android/widget/TabHost.TabSpec.html#setIndicator%28android.view.View%29" rel="nofollow"><code>setIndicator()</code></a>. I haven't tried it, but it may give you greater control over the layout of an individual tab's indicator. </p>
