<p>The exact solution is not that simple (an approximate solution is just given by linear interpolation). You're not going to love it.</p>

<p>The trajectory follows a great circle, which is the intersection between the sphere and a plane through the center and the two given points.</p>

<p>First convert from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system#Cartesian_coordinates" rel="nofollow">spherical</a> to Cartesian coordinates. Then by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Matrix_notation" rel="nofollow">cross product</a> of the vectors from the center to the two points, determine the direction of the normal to the plane (normalize the vector). Then use the formula for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Rotation_matrix_from_axis_and_angle" rel="nofollow">3D rotation</a> around this axis and rotate the starting point. The rotation angle is given by the desired distance divided by the radius of the Earth. Finally, convert back to spherical coordinates.</p>
