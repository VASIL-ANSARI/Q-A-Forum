<p>Does it have to be one regex? How about something like this:</p>

<pre><code>   string
     .replaceAll("""\w+?\(|\)+""", "")
     .split(",\\s*")
     .grouped(11)
</code></pre>

<p>This should work as long as the string values on your data do not contain parentheses or commas. But if they do, then you are screwed anyway, there is no regex solution, you need a real syntax parser.</p>

<p>In response to the last comment (about inner lists being variable size).
I never actually meant to provide you with a complete solution (you may have better lack on freelancer.com getting people to write code to your exact specifications), just wanted to kinda point you in the right direction. But, ok, how about this: </p>

<pre><code>  string
    .split("""\({2,},?\s*""")
    .map { _.replaceAll("""\w+?\(|\)+""", "").split(",\\s*") }
</code></pre>
