<p>You could do something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read a line of text from user input (which may have multiple words)</li>
<li>Split the line into words</li>
<li>Translate each word into Pig Latin</li>
<li>Print the words out with spaces between them</li>
</ol>

<p>Rather than thinking of this in terms of "how can I change these keys to mean something else", think of it in terms of "how can I best work with what the user is expecting to type". If the user is expecting to type spaces between words (makes sense), then design your program so that it can handle that kind of input.</p>
