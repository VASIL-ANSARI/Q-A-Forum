<p>It's the same (or almost the same - there might be some corner case) as casting to bool. If <code>$row</code> would cast to true, then <code>!! $row</code> is also true.</p>

<p>But if you want to achieve <code>(bool) $row</code>, you should probably use just that - and not some "interesting" expressions ;)</p>
