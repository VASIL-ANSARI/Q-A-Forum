<p>I think it's probably a better solution to just embed a hidden iFrame in the HTML body and have the JS set the src of the iFrame to the URL. Once the src is set, that'll immediately trigger the Save-As dialog if the src URL wants it to e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
...
...
&lt;iframe style="display:none" id="hidden-iframe"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and...</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById("hidden-iframe").src = myURL;
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to be working in all the browsers I've checked so far, including IE (gasp!).</p>
