<p>The easiest way is using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29" rel="nofollow">AJAX</a> - most libraries like jQuery have direct support. Note that by design, browsers do not allow you to access a web service that's running on a different domain to the host page (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" rel="nofollow">this</a>) but there are ways round this using techniques like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP" rel="nofollow">JSONP</a>.</p>

<p>The quickest way to get started is probably to use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">jQuery's ajax()</a> function. Hope this helps!</p>
