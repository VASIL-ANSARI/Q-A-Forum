<h1>Theory about multiple to-many relations</h1>

<p>Say you have the entity CHILD which is either a boy or a girl. Each child can have a set (to-many) of all their siblings. But each child could also have two more sets (to-many) of all their 1: brothers and 2: sisters. </p>

<p>The reverse relation of "siblings" would be "isSiblingTo" (or siblings). And the reverse of "brothers" and "sisters" would be "isBrotherTo" and "isSisterTo". </p>

<p>This was very simple since both entities where the same. </p>

<p>Say instead I am a child who has a set of crayons and a set of toys. I probably have my red crayon in both these sets, i.e. I have to to-many relations to it. </p>

<p>It all boils down to that the red crayon is both my CRAYON and my TOY. 
As with the sibling example above, a child's brothers are both their siblings and their brothers and their sisters are both their siblings and their sisters.</p>

<strong>Update:</strong>

<p>You don't need to be a part of both relations. You can have a child without the siblings relation but with both the brothers and sisters relations and the other children would have the reverse relations to them (this is closer to your color+filter example)</p>

<h1>Applied on your example</h1>

<p>So, if you have a use for it, it is doable. Just think of their relations in day-to-day language and set the reverse as isForegroundColorTo and isBackgroundColorTo.</p>
