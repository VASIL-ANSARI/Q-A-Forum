<pre><code>var a = new Number(10);    
x(a);
alert(a);

function x(n) {
    n = n + 2; // NOT VALID as this would essentially mean 10 = 10 + 2 since you are passing the 'value' of a and not 'a' itself
}
</code></pre>

<p>You need to write the following in order to get it working</p>

<pre><code>var a = new Number(10);
x(a);
alert(a);

function x(n) {
    a = n + 2; // reassign value of 'a' equal to the value passed into the function plus 2
}
</code></pre>
