<p>This is probably because you are specifying version 3.3 for the context creation and your opengl version is lower than 3.3.</p>

<p>OpenGL: GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR and GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR are not hard constraints, but creation will fail if the OpenGL version of the created context is less than the one requested.</p>

<p>This might happen if you are using a laptop that has 2 GPU's. They do that for power-consumption reasons, most applications will be run with the standard GPU and for games for example it will use the high performance one.</p>

<p>For example my laptop has a built-in Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000(3.1 opengl version) GPU and a NVIDIA geforce gt 630M(4.4 opengl version) GPU.</p>

<p>You can see if your laptop has this functionality if you right click on an application shortcut and have the option "run with graphics processor": - "High performance (NVIDIA) processor" - "Integrated graphics (default)"</p>

<p>The problem is that the editor(eclipse/ms visual studio, etc..)(in which you run your code) will use the default one and usually has a much lower version of opengl than your other GPU.</p>

<p>You can fix this by always running your editor program with your high performance GPU.</p>

<p>If you're not using a laptop or only have one GPU then try updating your drivers.</p>
