<p>Use something like this for the front end:</p>

<p><a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/" rel="nofollow">http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/</a></p>

<p>If you don't want to manipulate the date string in PHP, set the datepicker to work in YYYY-MM-DD format (which is used in the MySQL DATE type). Then either send your information off with Javascript or as a part of a form.</p>
