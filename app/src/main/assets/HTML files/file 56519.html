<p>What you pass as a third parameter is the primary key's value, hence as you don't pass a fourth parameter which identifies the key, it searches for a record with <code>id</code>, by default, that has a value of <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>So, you need to pass a fourth parameter, this way, it will ignore all the rows with deleted properties that have the value of <code>1</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;validate($request, [
    'business_name'   =&gt; 'required|max:255|unique:banks,business_name,1,deleted',
    'abi'             =&gt; 'required|max:5|min:5|unique:banks,abi,1,deleted'
]);
</code></pre>
