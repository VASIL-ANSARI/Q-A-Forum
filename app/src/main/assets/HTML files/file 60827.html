<p>I think the problem is that your Objective-C code does not know the â<code>open var</code>âs <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delegate</code> of the <code>LiquidFloatingButton</code> Swift code.<br>
To make them known, a Obj-c header file is required that exposes these Swift infos to your Obj-C code. This is described in detail in the Apple docs â<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html" rel="nofollow">Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project</a>â, in your case particularly in the section â<em>Importing External Frameworks</em>â.  It says:<br>
<em>You can import a framework into any Objective-C .m file within a different target using the following syntax:</em>  </p>

<pre><code>@import FrameworkName;
</code></pre>
