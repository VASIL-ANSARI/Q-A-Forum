<p>Assuming that you don't want all columns that would be returned with <code>select * from ...</code> <sup>(a)</sup>, you can simply list the desired columns explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>select fname, lname from ...
</code></pre>

<p>For example, suppose you know your user ID is jbug01 and you just want the corresponding email address:</p>

<pre><code>select email
from   users
where  userid = 'jbug01'
</code></pre>

<p>In terms of doing this within PHP, the following code snippet may help:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    $conn = mysql_connect ("localhost", "paxdiablo", "supersekritsauce");
    if (!$conn) {
        die ('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
    }
    mysql_select_db ("my_database", $conn);
    $result = mysql_query ("select email from users where userid = 'jbug01'");
    while ($row = mysql_fetch_array ($result)) {
        echo $row['email'] . "&lt;br /&gt;";
    }
    mysql_close ($conn);
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><sup>(a)</sup> There are precious <em>few</em> cases where selecting <code>*</code> makes sense (other than tools that <em>need</em> to get all columns such as DB viewers).</p>

<p>You should usually prefer to be explicit with your column selections. This may allow you to detect problems with schema changes much earlier in the process than will be the case if you just blindly select everything.</p>

<p>It will also result in less information being transmitted which may not be important for small databases or systems where everything runs on the same box but it <em>will</em> affect scalability of your system, both in terms of data size and distribution across a network.</p>
