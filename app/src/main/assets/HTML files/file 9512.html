<p>Should have went with my answer :-D. Make sure $html is NOT empty; as in make sure you're actually getting something back from that URL and it's stored in that variable. My answer was shorter than his crazy big O nightmare. So if you see the numbers 8,15 (below), that means match a number between 8 digits and 15 digits long. I changed the code below.</p>

<pre><code>include('lib/simple_html_dom.php');

$html = file_get_html('http://soundcloud.com/oembed?url=http://soundcloud.com/kiwinest/linkin-park-iridescent');

preg_match_all('/[0-9]{8,15}/', $my_string, $ids);

echo $ids[0];
</code></pre>
