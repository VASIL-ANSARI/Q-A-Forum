<p>If you want to use Push Notifications, then there really is no better way than to use <a href="http://urbanairship.com/" rel="nofollow">Urban Airship</a></p>

<p>Here are a pair of tutorials which will get you up and running using Urban Airship: <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/iphone-sdk_apns/" rel="nofollow">Part 1</a> &amp; <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/ios-sdk_push-notifications_part-2/" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a> (<em>I can also verify these work properly as I have followed them many times</em>)</p>

<p>If you would like avoid using a third party and instead have access to your own PHP capable server then here is another pair of tutorials which will help you get setup: <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/3443/apple-push-notification-services-tutorial-part-12" rel="nofollow">Part 1</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/3525/apple-push-notification-services-tutorial-part-2" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a></p>
