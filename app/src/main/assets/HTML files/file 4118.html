<p>My guess would be that Python doesn't know your egg cache location (or doesn't have privileges to it). You just need to set that. More information <strong><a href="http://lethain.com/entry/2009/feb/13/when-psycopg2-can-t-import-tz/" rel="nofollow">here</a></strong>. Try setting the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ConfigurationDirectives#WSGIPythonEggs" rel="nofollow"><code>WSGIPythonEggs</code></a> directive.</p>
