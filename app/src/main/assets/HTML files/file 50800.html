<p>Try assigning the function to a variable, ie</p>

<pre><code>// in window 1:
&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
var someVariable = "hello, world";
var myFunc = function(msg) {
    alert(msg);
}
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It's hard to say otherwise based on the code you provided, since you're not setting a URL property anywhere in there.. May be a config issue with your environment.</p>
