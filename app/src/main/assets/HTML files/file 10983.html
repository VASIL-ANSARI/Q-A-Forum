<p>If that construct is used as heavily as you say, I would definitely replace it with (the) real types (explicitly write out the List or create a new type). If someone happens to change one of the type declarations, like</p>

<pre><code>using pType1 = List&lt;type2WhichType1InheritsFrom&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>because (s)he thinks the base version does something better without looking at all places where it is used, there might be some unwanted side effects.</p>
