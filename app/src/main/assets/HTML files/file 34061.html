<p>Are you using story board? If I am understanding what you are asking. I would say just make a uiimageview named say displayImage, as well as an int count = 0 that both buttons can access. Have it load the image at images[0] when the app starts. Then when the right button is clicked have int count +1 if its is &lt;= images.length. Then load images[count] to displayImage. Then when the left button is clicked have int count -1if it is >= 0. Then load images[count] to displayImage. Then just do this for all eight images. If you don't get it let me know and I can do the code out for you.</p>
