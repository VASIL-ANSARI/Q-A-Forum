<p>The second issue is simply a forgotten $ -- it looks like your current example would throw a parse error. It should be:</p>

<pre><code>$mail-&gt;MsgHTML($html_page.$track_image);
</code></pre>

<p>In order to send individual emails, instead of sending one email with a bunch of BCC's, you'd need to create a new $mail object each time inside the loop, instead of appending them all to a single $mail object which was already defined outside the loop.</p>
