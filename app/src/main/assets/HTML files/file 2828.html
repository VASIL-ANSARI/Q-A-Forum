<p>Are you asking whether RMI or low-level socket programming is better? I'd say unless you had a real good reason, use something more high-level for the networking. A drawback with RMI would be that it is tied to Java. If that is a problem, you can look at other, more cross-platform remoting protocols.</p>

<p>Either way, the networking issue seems to be completely unrelated to "handling transactions with an Oracle DB".</p>
