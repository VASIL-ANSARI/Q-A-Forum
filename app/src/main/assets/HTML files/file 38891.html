<p>You most probably want to perform <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/rewriting.html#module-sympy.simplify.cse_main" rel="nofollow">common subexpression elimination</a>.
In your example <code>siny</code> is the only expression actually being reused:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; expr = pi*sin(pi*x)*sin(pi*y) + sin(pi*y)*sin(pi*z)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(cse(expr))
([(x0, sin(pi*y))], [pi*x0*sin(pi*x) + x0*sin(pi*z)])
</code></pre>

<p>Usually compilers should already do these transformations - at least if you ask it
to ignore the non-associativity of e.g. floating point multiplication (by passing e.g. <code>-ffast-math</code>). I don't have any experience with <code>nvcc</code> though.</p>

<p>If you run into limitations when working with codegen for generating CUDA code - please feel free to improve upon it at and send Pull Requests to the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/" rel="nofollow">SymPy project</a>. Be sure to have the latest master branch checked out though since Jim Crist is currently refactoring the code printers: <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/7823" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/7823</a></p>
