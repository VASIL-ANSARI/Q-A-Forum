<p>In the FAQ at <a href="https://realm.io/docs/java/0.80.0/#faq" rel="nofollow">https://realm.io/docs/java/0.80.0/#faq</a> explains why the file size of a Realm might increase (see section "Large Realm file size"). </p>

<p>I would recommend that you compact your Realm file when the app either starts or resumes (and before it opens a Realm instance). The method <code>Realm.compactRealmFile()</code> is the method you should be looking for (see <a href="https://realm.io/docs/java/0.80.0/api/io/realm/Realm.html#compactRealmFile-android.content.Context-" rel="nofollow">https://realm.io/docs/java/0.80.0/api/io/realm/Realm.html#compactRealmFile-android.content.Context-</a>).</p>
