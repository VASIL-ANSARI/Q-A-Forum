<p>I've long forgotten the Taylor's theorem (tho I knew it a while back), so I won't delve deeper into your implementation of it. However, I do see this:</p>

<pre><code>for(int n = 1;((Math.round(ans * 10000.0) / 10000.0)==ans2)&amp;&amp;n&gt;10; n++)
</code></pre>

<p>Which makes no sense since this loop will exit immediately because of <code>&amp;&amp; n&gt;10</code> which is not true in the first passing through it. Also check the second for loop since it also does not check the value of <code>int k = 0</code> declared in the for loop. I'm certain that is the problem, might not be the only one though.</p>
