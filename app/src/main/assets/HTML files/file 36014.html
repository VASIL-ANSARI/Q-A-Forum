<p>No, you cannot, cell tower locations are only known by telephony providers and certain gubernamental organizatons (police as an example).</p>

<p>Without the exact location of each tower you cannot triangulate position, if you ask to the sim (if you were able to) it will only tell you which are nearby towers and it's signal strength, so it becomes impossible without knowing all the tower locations.</p>
