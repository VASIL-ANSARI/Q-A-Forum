<p>When it's in a jar file, it <em>isn't</em> a file on the file system, is it? You'll <em>either</em> have to copy the file out of the jar file into some temporary location, or use APIs which don't require a file (e.g. ones which only need an <code>InputStream</code> or a <code>URL</code>, both of which are easily available from jar files using <code>getResourceAsStream</code> or <code>getResource</code>.).</p>

<p>You haven't shown where you're using <code>soundFile</code> - if you show us which APIs you're trying to use, we can try to suggest an appropriate alternative.</p>
