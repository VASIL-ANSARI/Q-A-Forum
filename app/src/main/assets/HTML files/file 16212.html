<p>There are two points to note:</p>

<ol>
<li>PayPal has an <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/paypal/documentation-tools/quick-start-guides/mobile-payment-libraries">in-app payment system which will work on Android</a>.</li>
<li>Google Market will <strong><em>not</em></strong> allow in-app payments <a href="http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html">which aren't Google Checkout</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, you can add in-app payment using PayPal as long as you don't distribute the app via Google Play.</p>
