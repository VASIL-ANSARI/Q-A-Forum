<p>Android like java has garbage collection, and android will close down apps if to much memory is being used elsewhere. So it is possible that during the time the Google Maps is up guiding your user that Android OS shuts down your applications and removes it from memory to free up space for something else.</p>

<p>However without any code I cant realy give you any more information or advice. Other than in the broadcast receiver start and Intent to open up your application and make sure that the state of your app is stored when the app is destroyed so that you can bring it up where you left off before.</p>
