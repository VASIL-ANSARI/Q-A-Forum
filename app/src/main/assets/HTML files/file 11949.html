<p>Java doesn't have any direct equivalent - all state which you want to be persisted across method calls has to be stored in fields rather than local variables. So you can have this:</p>

<pre><code>private int counter = 0;

public void increment() {
    counter++;
    System.out.println(counter);
}
</code></pre>

<p>... but of course the other methods in the same class have access to <code>counter</code> as well.</p>
