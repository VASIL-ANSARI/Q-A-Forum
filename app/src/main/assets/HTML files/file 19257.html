<p>It doesn't <em>have to</em> be that way.  It was just rule that Guido found to be sensible.</p>

<p>In Python 3, the rules for unpacking have been liberalized somewhat:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a, *b, c = range(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
9
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on whether Guido feels it would improve the language, that liberalization could also be extended to function arguments. </p>

<p>See the discussion on <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/">extended iterable unpacking</a> for some thoughts on why Python 3 changed the rules.</p>
