<p>When <code>background.start()</code> is called, <code>isRunning</code> is still false, so the thread is started(but didn't enter the while loop) and stopped immediately.</p>

<p>To ensure the thread to enter the while loop when <code>startThread</code> is called, you can put the following code in the <code>startThread()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>public void startThread(){
    isRunning = true;
    start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you don't call <code>background.start()</code> in <code>onCreate()</code>, just remove that line.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If you want to keep a single thread alive, so you can "start" it and "stop" it as many times as you like, you can use the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public void run () {
    while (isRunning) {
        if(!isWorking) {
            try { Thread.sleep(10); } catch (InterruptedException ex) { }
            continue;
        }
        //.. do your work here.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You control the running state of the thread with <code>isRunning</code>, and the working state with <code>isWorking</code>.</p>
