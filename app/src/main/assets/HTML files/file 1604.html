<p>One thing I know is that Django has no official support for IronPython - just CPython and Jython. In addition, PIL - which provides Django's support for image fields - does not natively support IronPython, though the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/" rel="nofollow">ironclad</a> project could help with that. (Caveat: I have never actually used IronPython, this is just based on research.)</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to use a standard Python interpreter to run Django and use either FastCGI or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/isapi-wsgi/" rel="nofollow">isapi_wsgi</a> to connect it to your IIS, as Django has more support for FastCGI and WSGI.</p>
