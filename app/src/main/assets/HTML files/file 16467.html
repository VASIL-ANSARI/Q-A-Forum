<p>Question 1:</p>

<p>It's not just css. </p>

<p>Use a table to store however many elements you want in every row, and then set a general width to the whole table.</p>

<p>Use a javascript/jquery to calculate the width for each element according to that table size.</p>

<p>Question 2:

You might want to take a look at that. As far as I see on Amazon's site, the sidebar never dissappears.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>1.Say you have a page of 1000px width.
2.First 200 px from the left is set for the sidebar.
3.Use jQuery to check the current page width. 
4.if pageWidth&lt;1000px, sidebar{display:none;}</p>

<p>But really, these codes are everywhere on the net.</p>
