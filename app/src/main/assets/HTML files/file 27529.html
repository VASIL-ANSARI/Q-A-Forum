<p>In the controller under the action, you can create a random number and have a third field on your table that accepts the unique key. This unique key value would be the random number.</p>

<p><code>@unique_key = rand[99999999999]</code></p>

<p>However, this approach does allow a small 1/99999999999 chance that you would create the same <code>unique_key</code> value as another office. Instead, you may want to create a random hash instead to reduce the possibility of creating the duplicate.</p>

<p><code>@unique_key = SecureRandom.hex</code></p>

<p>To make this even less likely, you could do</p>

<p><code>@unique_key = "#{SecureRandom.hex}#{SecureRandom.hex}"</code></p>

<p>which would still technically be possible, but extremely unlikely.</p>

<p>This example is if you're using simple_form. You would want to modify to your own specifics</p>

<p><code>&lt;%= f.input :unique_key, :as =&gt; :hidden, :input_html =&gt; {:value =&gt; @unique_key} %&gt;</code></p>
