<p>If you do not sort the data once you retrieve it from the database and you see that the data is sorted, then that might be because of the <code>SQL-query</code> that is executed against the database. Any differenc <code>SQL-query</code> might result in differen ordering. This is because <code>JOIN</code>ing to other tables or <code>GROUP</code>ing results, and the use of <code>INDEXES</code>.</p>

<p>Generally you cannot be sure that by not using <code>ORDER BY</code> in <code>SQL-query</code> that the result is not sorted; it might be.</p>

<p>p.s. A topic to dive in in your case is also the <code>natural sorting</code>. This sorts <code>A1, A2, A10</code> instead to <code>A1, A10, A2</code>.</p>
