<p>Your Android Manifest is fine for getting permissions. However, if you are trying this on Android 6.0, the app will fail because the Permission System in Android Marshmallow is different. <code>SEND_SMS</code> is classified as "Dangerous" permission, so you need to use <code>checkSelfPermission()</code> and <code>requestPermissions()</code> in Marshmallow. Like this -</p>

<pre><code>//This code will fail on devices below Android 6.0, so the below if statement is neccessary
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(thisActivity, Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        ContextCompat.requestPermissions(thisActivity,
            new String[]{Manifest.permission.SEND_SMS});
    }
}
</code></pre>
