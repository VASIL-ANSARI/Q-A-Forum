<p>Maybe the instance of SQL Server 2012 has a max number of concurrent connections and you exceed that with your two connections at once (SSMS connection and application's connection).  Check the settings in SSMS.</p>

<p>Another thing to try - Based on your connection string, you are using Integrated Security, which in my experience means the application connects using Windows credentials.  That can be fragile, because it means that whatever 'user' runs the application (if hosted in IIS, this will be the App Pool user) is the one whose Windows credentials are used.  I would suggest creating a SQL login user (in SSMS) for the database, with db_owner access, and then changing the application's connection to be username/password based instead.  You may need to enable Mixed Authentication for the SQL Server instance in SSMS if it doesn't already allow it.</p>
