<p>This doesn't sound like the best approach. Kicking off an async task to get a <code>Future</code>, then simply calling <code>Future.get</code> in the requesting thread means you've got <strong>two</strong> threads occupied - one doing the work for the async task and one waiting for that work to complete.</p>

<p>If something happens on the requesting thread in between the async task starting and the call to <code>get</code>, then I can understand this. Otherwise, it's better to simply make a synchronous call.</p>
