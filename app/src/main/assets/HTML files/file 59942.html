<p>The problem is most likely because <code>$user = User::find($activation-&gt;user_id);</code> returns <strong>null</strong> or <strong>false</strong>.</p>

<p>When you end up in these kinds of situations always try dumping the variable where the problem is occurring, in this case <code>dd($activation-&gt;user_id)</code></p>

<p>I would suggest using <code>Auth::user()-&gt;id</code> instead.</p>
