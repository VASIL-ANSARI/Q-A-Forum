<p>The way I do is to store the provider and the provider identifier in a database, which seems to be the way you implemented as well.</p>

<p>If the user does not exist, I create it and then redirect the user to the user profile editor. Otherwise I just redirect to the main page or dashboard.</p>

<p>The provider data has all the required fields for creating a basic profile. If you need something else, redirect the user to a page with a form for him to complete the registration. Store anything else you need in SESSION or similar. You can use $hybridauth->restoreSessionData($_SESSION['HYBRID']) to keep the session on.</p>
