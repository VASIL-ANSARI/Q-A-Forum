<p>To start, I would put a simple index.html with some kind of "hello world!" on your server, so when it does come up, it is a clear success.</p>

<h3>Things to check</h3>

<p>Try only the IP address of the server in the browser, this should give you either the index.php or index.html in the <code>/var/www/html</code>.  This helps narrow down where the path breaks down (gets rid of hostname issues).</p>

<p>If it is a virtual server on your computer, you may have to use the port forwarding values like 127.0.0.1:8080, if port forwarding was set up.</p>

<p>Check the file permissions on /var/www/html, you can use this .sh script (might need to replace root with a username with root privs, depending on your setup):</p>

<pre><code>sudo find /var/www -exec chown root:www-data {} \;
sudo find /var/www -type d -exec chmod -v 750 {} \;
sudo find /var/www -type f -exec chmod -v 640 {} \;
</code></pre>

<p>If you put up a firewall, you need to double check port 80 is open.</p>

<p>As a last ditch effort, you can run <code>netstat -ant</code> on your server and you should see:</p>

<pre><code>tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN 
</code></pre>

<p>Indicating that Apache is indeed listening on port 80. </p>

<p>Hopefully one of those things will help you figure it out, good luck!</p>
