<p>Exactly, as you said <em>"replace the implementation of an abstract class with another implementation"</em> if by it you mean, you can use runtime polymorphism and change the instances of concrete classes with instances of another set of concrete classes.</p>

Have a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern" rel="nofollow">wiki page</a>, as it explains this very nicely, even with a code example along with diagram.</p>
