<p>Why don't you simply add to your delete.php, after the unlink($file):</p>

<pre><code>header('Location: list.php');
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that your first code snippet is on a file named <em>list.php</em></p>

<p>BTW, be aware that you delete.php opens a big security hole. Anyone can ask your script to delete any file that your php process can access.</p>

<p>The same goes to download, anyone can download files you don't want to be downloaded.</p>
