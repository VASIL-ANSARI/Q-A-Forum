<p>At the moment, you cannot set this kind of filter. From the AdMob help documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I filter or manage the keyword targeted and GCAN ads that run in my application? Do the existing filters I set for my application apply to these ads?</p>
  
  <p>No, at this time you are not able to apply any filters on the content of keyword-targeted or GCAN ads that run inside your application.</p>
