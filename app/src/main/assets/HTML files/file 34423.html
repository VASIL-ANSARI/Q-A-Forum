<p>It isn't a lot of data so you can do both, store in the database as well as store in a cookie. Ideally for performance, you should retrieve from the cookie first and then retrieve from the database if the cookie doesn't contain any user information pertaining to that link. Depending on your performance requirements and the amount of traffic you anticipate, you can use database storage, in-memory storage and asynchronous updates. </p>

<ul>
<li>database updates are instant but can impact overall performance and page load times</li>
<li>in-memory caching such as apc gives best performance but data needs to be synchronised to the database</li>
<li>asynchronous updates are great for balancing out performance hits because you can register a view from the client side using JavaScript after the page has loaded, rather than during php execution on server side.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I would use all 3 if possible because it gives a good platform for future development.</p>
