<p>Probably some issue regarding the use of the source image <code>phalcon/ubuntu</code> from what I can see.</p>

<p>There's actually no reason to build your own PHP-FPM image, as official ones are supplied: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php/" rel="nofollow">https://hub.docker.com/_/php/</a> This way you can select the exact PHP version you want to use.</p>

<p>Just for kicks, here is the repository from which the image is built (PHP 5.6): <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/php/tree/master/5.6/fpm" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/docker-library/php/tree/master/5.6/fpm</a></p>
