<p>You are correct.</p>

<p>For a UTF-8 input, the <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> method really should be asking for a <code>const unsigned char *</code> as all 8 bits are being used for data. Their implementation certainly shouldn't be using a signed comparison to check the top bit, because a simple compiler flag can set the default for <code>char</code> to be either <code>unsigned</code> or <code>signed</code> and the former would break the code.</p>

<p>As for your concerns over the cast, this is one of the more benign ones. Casting away signedness on <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> is usually a <em>very bad thing</em> (TM) - or at least a clear indicator that you have a problem.</p>

<p>When dealing with pure ASCII, you are correct that there are 7-bits of data, but the remaining 8th bit is meant to be used for a parity bit, not as a sign bit.</p>
