<p>The <code>#include</code> directive is not processed by the compiler, but by the preprocessor.  It takes the contents of the included file and essentially pastes it verbatim into the source file.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the following files:</p>

<p>myfunc.h:</p>

<pre><code>int myfunc1(int x);
int myfunc2(int x);
</code></pre>

<p>main.c</p>

<pre><code>#include "myfunc.h"

int main()
{
    int x = myfunc(2);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>After main.c is processed by the preprocessor, the output will be the following:</p>

<pre><code>int myfunc1(int x);
int myfunc2(int x);

int main()
{
    int x = myfunc(2);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once the preprocessor has finished its job, then the compiler will work on the resulting file to create an object file, and the linker will create an executable.</p>

<p>Typically, the preprocessor and compiler steps happen together (and the linker as well), however you can run them as separate steps if need be.</p>
