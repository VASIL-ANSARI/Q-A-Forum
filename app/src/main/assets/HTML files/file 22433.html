<p>If I were you, I would create to jpeg's one red, and other white.. or whatever, then create session based upon each SUBMIT, or you could say. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 

if(isset($_SESSION['on']) &amp;&amp; !empty($_SESSION['on'])) {
echo "&lt;img src='red.jpg' /&gt; ";
}else {
echo "&lt;img src='yellow.jpg' /&gt;";
} ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The above code guaratees you, that if session "on" is set, it will change to red, otherwise, it will always be yellow color.</p>

<p>Now, with the button, how to turn things on and off</p>

<p>I suppose to active the session, you could do something like this below. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 

if(isset($_POST['on'])) {
$_SESSION['on'] = true;
}else {
$_SESSION['on'] = false;

}
?&gt;
</code></pre>
