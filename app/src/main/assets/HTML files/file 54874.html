<p>I have resolved problem. When you put dropzone to form element, it give you extra border on all form. So to set up dropzone preview properly i had to add style to form and set border on element where i want to see dropzone. After that i had to change set up "clickable" on that preview element. So in my case i have used:</p>

<p>in form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% simple_form_for @something , html: { class: "form-horizontal dropzone" style: "border: 0"} do |f| %&gt;
(...)
&lt;div class="dropzone-previews" style="border-style: dashed;"&gt;
(...)
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in js:</p>

<pre><code>clickable: ".dropzone-previews"
</code></pre>
