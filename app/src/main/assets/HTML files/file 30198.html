<p>Yes you are right this is not following MVVM and the problem is in how you are setting ItemSource -</p>

<pre><code>ItemsSource = "BaseClassesData",
</code></pre>

<p>I think you might have to first specify TreeNode's DataContext and then create a binding to specify ItemSource (instead of just specifying <code>ItemsSource = "BaseClassesData</code>") 
Or directly specify ItemSource as you mentioned in your comment.</p>

<p>Both the above cses will require you to access your ViewModel in View, and there is nothing wrong in <code>View accessing ViewModel</code>; in MVVM view always depends on ViewModel and always knows about it and uses it ( Indirectly through Bindings and Directly in code).</p>

<p>Finally, In case this is not just a temp. project and needs to be maintained/enhanced in future I would suggest you to implement proper MVVM; you will come across a lot of requirements like selection, expansion, dynamic loading, search etc., and doing all this in code will be very cumbersome and unmaintainable. </p>

<p>Also have a look at following SO question having code for doing something very similar using MVVM -</p>
