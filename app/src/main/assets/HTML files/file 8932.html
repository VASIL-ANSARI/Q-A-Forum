<p>I don't know where you're running the site from on your computer, but you have an absolute file path to your C drive:  C:\Users\VIRK\Desktop\66.jpg</p>

<p>Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img  src="[PATH_RELATIVE_TO_ROOT]/66.jpg" width="400" height="400" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I don't know what your <code>$PROJECTHOME</code> is set to.  But say for example your site files are located at C:\Users\VIRK\MyWebsite.  And let's say your images are in an 'images' folder within your main site, like so:  C:\Users\VIRK\MyWebsite\images. </p>

<p>Then in your HTML you can simply reference the image within the images folder relative to the site, like so: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;img  src="images/66.jpg" width="400" height="400" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or, assuming you're hosting at the root of localhost and not within another virtual directory, you can do this (note the slash in the beginning):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img  src="/images/66.jpg" width="400" height="400" /&gt;
</code></pre>
