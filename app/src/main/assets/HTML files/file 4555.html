<p>I saw <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0132130807" rel="nofollow">this</a> this book is available as an e-book, it should really get you started with a lot of examples and over a thousand pages should be enough for some indexing so you can search "your" questions in the book.</p>

<p>For the Android part, I don't know if you want to go for a book or just read Googles own documentation, many android books are just Googles documentation... But I have read "Unlocking Android" and that one was actually pretty good for getting you started, but it's not needed just luxurious.</p>
