<p>I think the issue is that you're calling the playmymusic without the colon. The colon is needed because of the sender parameter.</p>

<p>The compiler is trying to call a method with this name:</p>

<pre><code>func playmymusic() 
</code></pre>

<p>instead of the real one:</p>

<pre><code>func playmymusic(sender: UIButton!)
</code></pre>

<p>So just try to add the colon (:) at the end of action like this:</p>

<pre><code>cell.playbutton.addTarget(self, action: "playmymusic:", forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a legacy of Objective-c way to call the methods (send the messages) and I know it's a little bit confusing.</p>
