<p>An Event is a pair of accessors (much like a Property), so technically you don't even have access to the delegate, let alone the method name.  If it's an auto-wrapper (most typical), you can <em>guess</em> at the delegate field name (you can run ildasm to see what it generates by default), but this is not guaranteed to work if the author of the class wrote their own add and remove handlers.  For instance, the delegate might be stored in some sort of dictionary instead of in a field.</p>

<p>If you do get access to the underlying delegate field, you can enumerate the delegate (it could have multiple subscribers) and can use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.delegate.method.aspx" rel="nofollow">Method</a> property to get the MethodInfo, which has an associated <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.memberinfo.name.aspx" rel="nofollow">Name</a>, though now you can use the MethodInfo directly to create your own delegate.</p>
