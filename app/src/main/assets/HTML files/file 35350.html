<p>There are undocumented ways to call MATLAB from Java. You can learn a lot more about them from @YairAltman 's blog <a href="http://undocumentedmatlab.com/" rel="nofollow">Undocumented MATLAB</a>. Some of these methods are captured in the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/matlabcontrol/" rel="nofollow">matlabcontrol</a> package.</p>

<p>Since the functionality is undocumented and subject to change (and since matlabcontrol is not updated frequently), you should not rely on this ability for anything critical.</p>
