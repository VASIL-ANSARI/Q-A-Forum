<p>There is no guarantee that only one <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element will be created: if the selection crosses element boundaries, several spans could be created.</p>

<p>Anyway, since the selection is preserved, you could use the <code>getNodes()</code> method of the selection range to get the spans:</p>

<pre><code>var spans = selection.getRangeAt(0).getNodes([1], function(el) {
    return el.tagName == "SPAN" &amp;&amp; el.className == "highlight";
});
</code></pre>
