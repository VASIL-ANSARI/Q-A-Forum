<p>The question isn't clear, but in a WinForm you can call  </p>

<pre><code>this.Close()  
</code></pre>

<p>on the Click event of your Close button.<br>
Every object or variable used by the form will be destroyed. Be careful! running background threads will still be alive until they terminate.</p>

<p>About saving the status of your variables it completely depends on what you need to with them after; you can either keep them in memory and pass them around like parameters or write on a disk (maybe with serialization?).<br>
We need to know more.  </p>
