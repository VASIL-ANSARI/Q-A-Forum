<p>My choice would be to put a foreign key in your User table for the possible related_to field.</p>

<p>If the requirement is that it can only be one (or none) then why not?</p>

<p>You still keep the other "user_relations" for all other types. All the time in rails, we map to the same entity in different ways.  It's not uncommon at all</p>
