<p>Unless you're doing something to make the <code>content</code> arrays contain copies of your <code>ItemInfo</code>s, they won't. The ArrayLists store references to objects, not objects directly.</p>

<p>When you insert the same object into multiple <code>ArrayList</code>s, the object isn't copied, multiple references are stored.</p>

<p>So you don't have to do anything. (Or, if you're copying/cloning your objects before storing them, you need to stop doing that.)</p>
