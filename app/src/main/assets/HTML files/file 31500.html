<p>For <code>std::unordered_set&lt;T&gt;</code> the member <code>emplace()</code> makes it unnecessary for the objects to be movable, either: you can <code>emplace()</code> non-movable objects into the container.</p>

<p>To answer the question: you can't <code>std::move()</code> elements out of a <code>std::unordered_set&lt;T&gt;</code> because the elements are all <code>const</code> and <code>const</code> objects can't be moved. When you <code>erase()</code> an <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> from an <code>std::unordered_set&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> the pointed to object will be <code>delete</code>d: there is no interface which allows you to recover the pointer while <code>erase()</code>ing the element. Nor is there a <code>splice()</code> member to stick the element into another container where it can be ignored until it is time to get rid of it.</p>
