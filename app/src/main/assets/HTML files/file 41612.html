<p>Using the <code>T</code> in <code>IObservable&lt;T&gt;</code> to encode your data seems like the correct approach, based on the short problem description that you've provided.  (<a href="http://davesexton.com/blog/post/Rx-The-Power-of-T.aspx" rel="nofollow">The Power of T</a>)</p>

<p>There can be only one call to <code>OnError</code> and then the observable is terminated, per the Rx Grammar, so that's not going to be a problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OnNext* (OnCompleted | OnError)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=205219" rel="nofollow">Rx Design Guidelines</a> for details.</p>

<p>However, you can use operators like <code>Retry</code> and <code>Catch</code> to continue the sequence with a different observable, or the original observable recursively, when an error occurs.</p>
