<p>Unfortunately, the only way I've found to do this is to set the cell's image, which means you have to handle the image files yourself instead of having UIKit load them for you. I recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/0xced/UIKit-Artwork-Extractor" rel="nofollow">UIKit Artwork Extractor</a> to get the image.</p>
