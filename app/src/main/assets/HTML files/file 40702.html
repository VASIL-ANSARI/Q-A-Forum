<p>^Z, or Ctrl-Z, means end-of file for text files (old MS-DOS). getchar() is equivalent to fgetc(stdin) and is often a macro. "fgetc returns the character read as an int or returns EOF to indicate an error or end of file."</p>

<p>See also _set_fmode, however, I am not sure if that changes the behaviour right away or whether you have to close/reopen the file. Not sure either if you can close/reopen stdin (don't do much console programming anymore).</p>
