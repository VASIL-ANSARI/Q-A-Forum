<p>Multiple ways (depends on the larger context of how you use it):</p>

<p>You can assign it to a variable:</p>

<pre><code>spinner = d3.selet(this).append("svg:image")
  .attr('class', "circle")
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>and later remove it with <code>spinner.remove()</code>. The <code>var spinner</code> will have to be declared somewhere where it's accessible to all the places in your code where you use it (i.e. towards the top of the file).</p>

<hr>

<p>You can assign it an id, using <code>.attr("id", "my_image")</code> and you can select it based on that id later using <code>d3.select("#my_image")</code>. Or you can select it by its class <code>d3.select('circle')</code>.</p>

<p>Ids won't work if you have more than one image with the same id, and with class, if there are multiple, they would all be selected unless you first <code>d3.select(...)</code> the parent of one of them.</p>
