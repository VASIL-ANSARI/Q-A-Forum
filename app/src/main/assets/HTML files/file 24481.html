<p>You posted too much stuff.</p>

<p>All you need is this: </p>

<pre><code>beans.ConnectToDB.get_user_info(ConnectToDB.java:61)
</code></pre>

<p>Open up ConnectToDB.java in a text editor, got to line 61, and inspect all the object references on that line.  One of them is null because you didn't initialize it properly or assumed that it would always be non-null when you got it.  Figure out which one and initialize it properly.  Problem solved.</p>

<p>I don't think this is a good solution.  If you have JSPs, you have a servlet/JSP engine, which should have a JNDI database connection pool and naming service.  You should set that up and externalize your database connection parameters.  They don't belong in your code.  A pool will manage connections better than you will.</p>

<p>You aren't closing your resources properly, either.  They should be closed in a finally block, in reverse order of creation, wrapped in individual try/catch blocks.  I would write a static utility method that could be called to do it.</p>

<pre><code>package persistence;

public class DatabaseUtils {
    private DatabaseUtils() {}

    // Similar for ResultSet and Connection
    public static void close(Statement st) {
        try {
            if (st != null) {
                st.close();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Log the exception
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
