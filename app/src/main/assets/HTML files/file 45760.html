<p>There is a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions162.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>substrb</code> function</a> that calculates in bytes (as well as <code>substrc</code>, <code>substr2</code>, and <code>substr4</code> to get a number of Unicode characters, UCS2, and UCS4 code points).  If your database character set is <code>AL32UTF8</code>, remember that characters may require between 1 and 4 bytes of storage-- I don't know off the top of my head what happens if you try to get 10 bytes of data from a string when that would cut off a character in the middle.</p>
