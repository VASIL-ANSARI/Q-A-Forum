<p>This is no error, it is just a warning. The static analyzer cannot deduce that your <code>EditText</code> or the result from <code>EditText.getText()</code> isn't <code>null</code>. The keyword here is 'may'.</p>

<p>Adding a (possibly unnecessary) <code>null</code>-check for both instances will make the warning disappear.</p>
