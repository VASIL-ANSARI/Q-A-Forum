<p>The name of this exception is a bit confusing, because it isn't related to multi threading. </p>

<p>What happens is that you are iterating over a collection which is being modified while you are iterating over it.</p>

<p>If performance is not your highest concern, a simple way out would be to copy the list and iterate over that copy and add items to the original list.</p>
