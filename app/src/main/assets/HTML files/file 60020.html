<p>The problem is that you are running this code too soon (in <code>viewDidLoad</code>). Your <code>cornerRadius</code> calculation depends upon <code>calculateButton.frame</code>, but its value is not known at this time. Move your code into <code>viewDidLayoutSubviews</code> and I think you will find that it works as you expect.</p>
