<p>There are a number of ways, but at you level, I think you need to concentrate on walking the characters stored in <code>strings</code>, first travelling across the rows (<code>i</code>) and then walking down each character.</p>

<p>Make a buffer that holds your "word" in the string, and concentrate on detecting if the the word is finished (a space is read) and if not, then copying the character into the buffer.  Once you do detect a finished word, now you have characters that represent (possibly) your number or your string.</p>

<p>Then it is a matter of converting the right words into the right C data types.  </p>

<p>once you have the right C data types, it should be easy enough to assign them to the right positions in the struct(s).</p>
