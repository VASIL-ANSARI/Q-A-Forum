<p>This is a more of an apples-to-apples comparison (kinda): <a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BLJGwK?editors=0110" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BLJGwK?editors=0110</a></p>

<p>On my system, I couldn't notice <strong>any</strong> difference in terms of smoothness, but I realize results may vary by system, graphics card, etc. </p>

<p>And your GSAP code could be quite a bit more concise (here's the meat:)</p>

<pre><code>var tl = new TimelineMax({repeat: -1});

tl.to('.gsap-square, .gsap-circle', 1.5, {
  x: 1500,
  ease: "quad"
}).to('.gsap-square, .gsap-circle', 1.5, {
  x:100,
  ease:"quad"
});
</code></pre>

<p>Please keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're comparing the best possible scenario for CSS, and worst possible scenario for JS because if you <strong>only</strong> animate transforms (or opacity), most modern browsers delegate that to a different thread. There are other consequences to that, however. See <a href="http://greensock.com/css-performance" rel="nofollow">http://greensock.com/css-performance</a> for a video explanation. In many other cases, GSAP was actually faster than CSS. </li>
<li>If you add even one other property to your animation (doesn't matter what, just something besides transforms or opacity), you lose that separate thread boost in Firefox (the entire thing, including transforms, goes back to the main thread...at least that's my understanding and it has to do with the synchronization issue mentioned in the article above). </li>
<li>GSAP does automatically GPU-accelerate things for you via JS. </li>
<li>You might want to try adding will-change:transform to the elements you're animating.</li>
</ul>

<p>The real benefit of GSAP over CSS (and other libraries), according to most people I talk to, has to do with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Workflow. Changes and experimentation are much easier for even moderately complex animations. Total control of every aspect. Way more easing options. Hook up scrubbers, seek(), reverse(), timeScale(), etc. </li>
<li>Compatibility. GSAP works around a ton of browser bugs and inconsistencies that'll bite you if you try animating with CSS.</li>
<li>Capabilities. GSAP can do far, far more than CSS. Won't bore you with a list here, but it's extensive. Partial list is at <a href="http://greensock.com/why-gsap/" rel="nofollow">http://greensock.com/why-gsap/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And yeah, GSAP is <strong>hyper</strong> optimized for performance. It's pretty widely seen as the gold standard in that regard. I'm not aware of anything faster, though CSS animations of transforms do have an advantage in this one scenario. But frankly I doubt it'd even be noticeable in most real-world scenarios. I always encourage folks to do their own tests.</p>

<p>Sorry if that sounded like a sales pitch. Didn't mean it that way - I just wanted to set the context properly. Sometimes I see people get hyper-focused on one particular scenario or use case and they miss some very important factors that might be worth considering.</p>
