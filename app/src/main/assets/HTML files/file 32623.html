<p>I had a similar issue. Tests worked on FF but timed out on PhantomJs, as you describe.  The pages I was testing used a lot of social media plugins which I think were using XHR.  Removing most of the security restrictions on PhantomJs fixed it for me (see below).</p>

<pre><code>service.IgnoreSslErrors = true;
service.WebSecurity = false; 
service.LocalToRemoteUrlAccess = true; 
service.DiskCache = true; // Dunno what this does but I thought it might help.
PhantomJSDriver driver = new PhantomJSDriver(service);
</code></pre>
