<p>How about letting a <code>verticalSpeed</code> variable decide?</p>

<p>With a value of <code>0</code> the <code>DiveOperation</code> represents a flatdive, and with a positive or negative value it represents a ascent or descent respectively?</p>

<p>If you have other properties than just ascent / descent speed, you probably want to turn the <code>DiveOperation</code> into an abstract class, and create three subclases <code>AscentOperation</code>, <code>DescentOperation</code> and <code>FlatDiveOperation</code>. If I understand you correctly however, you have troubles with for instance iteration, since you don't know the actual type of a <code>DiveOperation</code>. This can be solved either using lots of <code>instanceof</code> checks (ugly!) or using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern" rel="nofollow">visitor pattern</a> (much better imo). You could in this case perhaps have something like a <code>DecompressionCalculatorVisitor</code> that visits each <code>DiveOperation</code> in turn.</p>

<p>Have a look at my answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3930808/is-there-a-better-option-for-this-code/3930863#3930863">over here</a> for a detailed example of the visitor pattern.</p>
