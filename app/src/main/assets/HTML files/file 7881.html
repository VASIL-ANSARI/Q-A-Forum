<p>If you have the facet values a priori, you could do this with facet queries, i.e. something like <code>facet.query=category:web AND date:[2011-06-14T00:00:00Z TO 2011-06-14T23:59:59Z]&amp;facet.query=category:web AND date:[2011-06-13T00:00:00Z TO 2011-06-13T23:59:59Z]&amp;...</code> so you would do the cartesian product of facet values * dates.</p>

<p>Otherwise, to do this inside Solr I think you'd have to write some custom Java faceting code. Or do it client-side, with multiple queries as you mentioned.</p>
