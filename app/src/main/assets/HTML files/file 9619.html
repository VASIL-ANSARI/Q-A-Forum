<p>putting the parantheses actually runs the function.  Without them, the function is just defined.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  I didn't notice the "new" keyword you used.  Your function is called in either case.  You don't generally need the new keyword here though.  In the example you've given, they are essentially the same, the parentheses at the end are redundant.</p>

<p>See this jsfiddle for what I mean ( <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Gs2jH/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/Gs2jH/</a> ).</p>

<p>If you run it, you'll see that only the 2nd item is called.</p>
