<p>It's hard to provide an example on something like jsfiddle where we can't specify resources by file path, but I think the problem is with the module id in your javascript. In your <code>dojoConfig</code>, the <code>location</code> property defines the path to the <em>directory</em> where modules in that package can be located.</p>

<p>If your <code>lod</code> module is located at in <code>/scripts/mylibs/lod.js</code>, then you'd need to require <code>lod/lod</code>:</p>

<pre><code>require(['lod/lod'], function(lod) {
    console.log("lod module:", lod);
});
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.9/dojo_config/" rel="nofollow">Here's the documentation for dojo config</a>. I would look at the "Loader Configuration" section.</p>

<p>I attempted a jsfiddle anyway, which could be useful: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tupton/ftN6h/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/tupton/ftN6h/</a></p>

<p>Note the errors in the console:</p>

<p>'lod':</p>

<pre><code>GET http://fiddle.jshell.net/scripts/mylibs/LOD.js 404 (Not Found)
</code></pre>

<p>and 'lod/lod':</p>

<pre><code>GET http://fiddle.jshell.net/scripts/mylibs/lod.js 404 (Not Found)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not familiar with the "main" property of the package config, but it looks like that's what it's using when you try to require an entire package. Maybe try changing that to "lod" so it looks for ".../lod.js"?</p>
