<p>Don't merge sibling contexts.  That is going to cause you problems.  Instances of <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> are cheap and when you are using private queue contexts they are intended to be thrown away after <strong>one</strong> use.  Use them, throw them away, create a new one for the next piece of work that needs to be done.</p>

<p>No merging of change notifications required.</p>
