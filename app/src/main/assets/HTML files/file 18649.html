<p>Variables are stored as long as the context in which they were created is valid. Essentially </p>

<pre><code>var test_var = value
</code></pre>

<p>outside of any closure is the same as </p>

<pre><code>window.test_var = value.
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>window</code> object gets destroyed after a <code>unload</code> event, so as long as you stay in the same document context your variables are stored.</p>

<p>So, yes, you can use them as <em>hidden values</em>, but you should use <code>&lt;input type="hidden"&gt;</code> for form values.</p>
