<p>Thanks To Jaromanda X - Not sure why I didn't think of logging the bgImg to see what Safari thought it was!</p>

<p>Turns out Most browsers were returning the url("http://...") string, whereas Safari was dropping the double quotes, resulting in the url being tracked as url(<a href="http://.." rel="nofollow">http://..</a>.)</p>

<p>All resolved now, Thanks Jaromanda for the pointer!</p>
