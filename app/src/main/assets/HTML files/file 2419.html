<p>I looked at the source code and found that etag was not being properly updated. So this seems to fix it:</p>

<p>After the line below (in add_feed_to_multi() of feed.rb)</p>

<pre><code>feed.update_from_feed(updated_feed) 
</code></pre>

<p>I added this line:</p>

<pre><code>feed.etag = updated_feed.etag 
</code></pre>

<p>I still have not found a way to resolve last_modified issues but for now etags are working. </p>
