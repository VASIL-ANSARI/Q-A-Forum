<p>The simple answer is, it doesn't.</p>

<p>The Anti-Forgery Tokens (One as a cookie &amp; the other as a hidden form field) are not supposed to be accessible to a malicious page/attacker due to the same origin policy. This means that an attacker cannot access content on another site.</p>

<p>If it is accessible then this totally compromises the tokens and they become redundant. What you're suggesting could potentially happen if cross-domain has been enabled. </p>

<p>I hope this answers your question Stefan.</p>
