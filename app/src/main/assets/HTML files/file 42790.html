<p>I am suggesting alternative and simple solution for your problem :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Move layout activity_make_photo_video_land to /res/layout-land/ folder and rename it as activity_make_photo_video.xml</p>
  
  <p>This way your activity_make_photo_video_land view (rename as
  activity_make_photo_video) will be inflated when orientation changes
  to LANDSCAPE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you are not required to handle these facility manually from java code.</p>

<p>Change the onCreate() to :</p>

<pre><code> @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

            setContentView(R.layout.activity_make_photo_video_land);

}
</code></pre>

<p>Your application will have single layout activity_make_photo_video in <strong>/res/layout/</strong> and <strong>/res/layout-land/</strong> both folder</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unless you specify otherwise, a configuration change (such as a change
  in screen orientation, language, input devices, etc) will cause your
  current activity to be destroyed, going through the normal activity
  lifecycle process of onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy() as
  appropriate. If the activity had been in the foreground or visible to
  the user, once onDestroy() is called in that instance then a new
  instance of the activity will be created, with whatever
  savedInstanceState the previous instance had generated from
  onSaveInstanceState(Bundle).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Override onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) and save your state here</p>

<p>I hope this will work</p>
