<p>Yes, you can do that. What you want is to create your own project template. You can then select that template from the New Project wizard. I wasn't able to location documentation on how to create a project template in Visual Studio 6, but <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms247120(VS.80).aspx" rel="nofollow">this MSDN article</a> explains the procedure for Visual Studio 2005. Hopefully you will find those instructions to sufficiently similar.</p>
