<p>First, why are you using JSON just to decode it into an array?  That is confusing.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you were trying to add a number to an existing field, you don't even need prepare().</p>

<p>You could just do</p>

<pre><code>PDO-&gt;query("update mytable set count=count+".intval($int)." where id='123'");
</code></pre>

<p>If you were doing prepare, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = PDO-&gt;prepare("update mytable set count=count+:count where id='123'");
$stmt-&gt;execute(array(':count' =&gt; 1));
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = PDO-&gt;prepare("update mytable set count=count+? where id='123'");
$stmt-&gt;execute(array(1));
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: You wouldn't be able to do it with how your function is written as you can't bind column names.  PDO will quote it as a standard string.  You would have to find a work around, possibly including the =count in the field somehow.</p>
