<p>You can set the editable field in the kendogrid object to false based on the current user.
Following is an example: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/8KwNN/5/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/8KwNN/5/</a></p>

<pre><code>$("#grid").kendoGrid({
    dataSource: ds,
    editable: false,
    columns: [{
        field: "FirstName",
        width: 90,
        title: "First Name"
    }]
});
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you'll need to ensure that your service operations (which can apply updates via AJAX calls from the client, for example) do not allow updates for the restricted user.  This is done because we never trust any client (even if it's running our javascript).</p>
