<p>I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, in my case I needed to associate the generated QR code with a Rails model using carrierwave, what I ended up doing was saving the image to a temp file, associating that file with the model and afterwards deleting the temp file, here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>def generate_qr_code!
  tmp_path = Rails.root.join('tmp', "some-filename.png")
  tmp_file = RQRCode::QRCode.new(self.hash_value).to_img.resize(200,200).save(tmp_path)

  # Stream is handed closed, we need to reopen it
  File.open(tmp_file.path) do |file|
    self.qr_code = file
  end

  File.delete(tmp_file.path)

  self.save!
end
</code></pre>
