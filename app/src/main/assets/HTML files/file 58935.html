<p>If your data isn't too huge, I would do some pre-processing and get 1 record per genre. That is, I would structure your data frame like this:</p>

<pre><code> Name    Genre
 Movie 1 Action
 Movie 1 Fantasy
 Movie 1 Horor
 ...
</code></pre>

<p>Note the names should be repeated. While this may make your data set much bigger, if your system can handle it it can make data analysis very easy.
Use the following code to do the transformation:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd

def reformat_movie_list(movies):
    name = []
    genre = []
    result = pd.DataFrame()
    for movie in movies:
        movie_name = movie["name"]
        movie_genres = movie["genre"].split(",")
        for movie_genre in movie_genres:
             name.append(movie_name.strip())
             genre.append(movie_genre.strip())
    result["name"] = name
    result["genre"] = genre
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>In this format, your 3 questions become</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do I get all the categories in this list? So I know each contains how many movies?</p>

<p>movie_df.groupby("genre").agg("count")</p></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>How do I query for a certain kind of movies, like action?</p>

<p>horror_movies = movie_df[movie_df["genre"] == "horror"]</p></li>
</ol>

<p>see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11869910/pandas-filter-rows-of-dataframe-with-operator-chaining">pandas: filter rows of DataFrame with operator chaining</a></p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Do I need to turn the genre into array?</li>
</ol>

<p>Your de-normalization of the data should take care of it.</p>
