<p>I have ran into the same issue.</p>

<p>It appears when Knockout bindings which remove video elements also break them.</p>

<p>You probably already fixed it, but for anyone else, this is fixed by making sure 'with' and 'if' bindings don't apply to a video.</p>

<p>With your code this would mean something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="assessmentIntroPanel" data-bind="with: currentStep"&gt;
  &lt;div data-bind="video: videos, playerId: 'videoPlayer'"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;video id="videoPlayer" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" width="430" height="267"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So your UI will be more complicated... but now as the video element is never removed it should work.</p>
