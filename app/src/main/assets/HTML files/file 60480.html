<p>The error is exactly what it says: i must be final (or effectively final, meaning that compiler must be able to deduce that the variable will never change.</p>

<p>In your case, <code>i</code> changes (between 0 and 10), so it's not "effectively final".</p>

<p>What you want to do is add a variable to hold the current snapshot of <code>i</code> and store it in a final variable; for example on the top of the loop add:</p>

<pre><code>final int snapshot = i;
</code></pre>

<p>If you think about it, this Java behavior is very logical - by the time any of the listeners fire, the loop in question is over, so there is no such thing as <em>current value of i</em>. Instead, there's a <em>snapshot of i value taken during the iteration when the listener was established</em>.</p>
