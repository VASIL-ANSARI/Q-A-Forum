<p>Your code looks fine, it's weird that it's not working correctly... Maybe it's because of the ButterKnife library? I don't think that's the problem, but it will be worth the shot to get views manually to see if that's the problem</p>

<p>Then, if you need the loading animation to appear/hide you can use <code>mSwipeRefreshLayout.setRefreshing(boolean);</code></p>

<p>For example in my app I attach the listener first (as you did in your example) and then I use the following code to show the loading animation while I fetch the data.</p>

<pre><code>// Show loading while fetching the first set of data
mainSwipeRefreshLayout.post(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        mainSwipeRefreshLayout.setRefreshing(true);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>In my fetchData() method I use the following line to hide the animation again when it finishes fetching the data.</p>

<pre><code>// On load complete stop refresh animation
mainSwipeRefreshLayout.setRefreshing(false);
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!
Andres.</p>
