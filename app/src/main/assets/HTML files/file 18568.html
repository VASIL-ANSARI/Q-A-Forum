<p>It doesn't look like version 0.2.4 is up-to-date with what's on github; it's missing the subclass of Rails::Engine necessary to load the helper. The key line on the edge source is here: <a href="https://github.com/topfunky/calendar_helper/blob/master/lib/calendar_helper.rb#L231" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/topfunky/calendar_helper/blob/master/lib/calendar_helper.rb#L231</a>.</p>

<p>You may be able to fix this by installing the gem from edge:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'calendar_helper', :git =&gt; 'git://github.com/topfunky/calendar_helper.git'
</code></pre>

<p>Edited:</p>

<p>If that still isn't working, you can also try this in your ApplicationHelper:</p>

<pre><code>require 'calendar_helper'

module ApplicationHelper
  include CalendarHelper
end
</code></pre>
