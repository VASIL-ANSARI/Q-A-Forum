<p>Are you using the same DataCacheFactory object for getting the cache items as the one you are using to put items in the cache ? The fact that PUT works and GET doesn't makes me think that they are different datacachefactory objects somehow.</p>

<p>also are you able to ping to FQDN AppFabricTwo.appfabric.demo from your client machine and is it resolving to correct IP address I.e. Same as appfabrictwo ? Also check telnet to port 22233 is working from your client (if put works this should work anyways though</p>
