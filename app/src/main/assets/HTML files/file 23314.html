<p>So much wrong with this.</p>

<p>1) If you have a PK you will not get duplicates so your check is pointless.</p>

<p>2) Just insert it.  If it fails, you have a duplicate or some other problem.  Checking first just narrows the opportunity but it can still go wrong in a multiuser environment.</p>

<p>3) SQL injection - read up on it, understand it at implement SQL that avoids it (parameters).</p>

<p>But to answer your question, not it has nothing to do with VARCHAR as a PK - that's fine if it makes sense.  @AlexandreLavoie's advice is not good or relevant (sorry!).</p>
