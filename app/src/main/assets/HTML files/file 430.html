<p>This is what my code looks like. It seems to work fine.
Are you using a service locator or just creating your service?</p>

<pre><code>SomeServiceLocator locator = new SomeServiceLocator();
SomeService service = null;
try
{
    service = locator.getSomeServiceImplPort();
}
catch (ServiceException e)
{
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>
