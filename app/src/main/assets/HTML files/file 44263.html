<p>This could be a DNS problem in your local network:</p>

<p>Try substituting "iMac" with the IP adress of the computer hosting the repo:</p>

<pre><code>ifconfig |grep inet
</code></pre>

<p>(in Terminal) will print out your local IP (e.g. 192.168.18.15).</p>

<p>If this doesn't help try pinging the IP / Computername (iMac) to see if you are able to connect to the computer:</p>

<pre><code>ping iMac
ping 192.168.18.15
</code></pre>

<p>I also found a good tutorial on how to setup git Mac OSX Server. <a href="http://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/how-to-set-up-a-secure-git-server-at-home-osx/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/how-to-set-up-a-secure-git-server-at-home-osx/</a></p>

<p>Pay attention to the port forwarding section, did you forward ports correctly?</p>
