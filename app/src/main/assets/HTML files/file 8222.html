<p>It seems to be a gotcha issue. Try to use check_box_tag instead. Take a look at what <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper/check_box" rel="nofollow">apidock.com</a> says about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gotcha</p>
  
  <p>The HTML specification says unchecked
  check boxes are not successful, and
  thus web browsers do not send them.
  Unfortunately this introduces a
  gotcha: if an Invoice model has a paid
  flag, and in the form that edits a
  paid invoice the user unchecks its
  check box, no paid parameter is sent.
  So, any mass-assignment idiom like</p>

<pre><code>@invoice.update_attributes(params[:invoice])
</code></pre>
  
  <p>wouldnât update the flag.</p>
  
  <p>To prevent this the helper generates
  an auxiliary hidden field before the
  very check box. The hidden field has
  the same name and its attributes mimic
  an unchecked check box.</p>
  
  <p>This way, the client either sends only
  the hidden field (representing the
  check box is unchecked), or both
  fields. Since the HTML specification
  says key/value pairs have to be sent
  in the same order they appear in the
  form, and parameters extraction gets
  the last occurrence of any repeated
  key in the query string, that works
  for ordinary forms.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately that workaround does not
  work when the check box goes within an
  array-like parameter, as in</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= fields_for "project[invoice_attributes][]",
</code></pre>
  
  <p>invoice, :index => nil do |form| %>
        &lt;%= form.check_box :paid %>
        ...
      &lt;% end %></p>
  
  <p>because parameter name repetition is
  precisely what Rails seeks to
  distinguish the elements of the array.
  For each item with a checked check box
  you get an extra ghost item with only
  that attribute, assigned to "0".</p>
  
  <p>In that case it is preferable to
  either use check_box_tag or to use
  hashes instead of arrays.</p>
