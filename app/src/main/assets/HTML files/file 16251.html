<p>The height is set by the content. To adjust the width you can override the following css class. Just be sure to put this style after the JQM stylesheet.</p>

<pre><code>.ui-dialog-contain {
    width: 92.5%; /* Change to whatever you want */
    max-width: 500px;
    margin: 10% auto 15px auto;
    padding: 0;
}
</code></pre>
