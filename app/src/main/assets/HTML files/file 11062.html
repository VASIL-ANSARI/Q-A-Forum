<p>You could process all of the button presses through the same method, where <code>(id)sender</code> is the argument value that is passed. Then you can do your button-specific processing by comparing (with a cast) the value of <code>(UIButton*)sender</code> to specific button object values. Within this single method, now you always have the value of sender, which is the last button pressed. Assign it to a varible like <code>lastButtonPressed = sender;</code></p>

<p>Update: Sorry, that should be like <code>lastButtonPressed = (UIButton*)sender;</code></p>

<p>Here are some more details:</p>

<p>If you use Interface Builder, connect each button to a button handler method in your view controller. (I don't use Interface Builder so much, but I think you want to connect the touch-up inside event to the button handler method).</p>

<p>If you don't use Interface Builder, then you can add this line where you initialize your ivars in the view controller. Assume your button handler is called <code>buttonHandler:</code> Do this for every one of your buttons:</p>

<pre><code>[oneOfYourButtons addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonHandler) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
//... include this for each button ...
[anotherOneOfYourButtons addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonHandler) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
</code></pre>

<p>In your header file, create an instance variable called <code>lastButtonPressed</code> (for example). Initialize it to nil in your implementation file where you initialized your other ivars.</p>

<p>Then add a method like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)buttonHandler:(UIButton*)sender{

    if (sender == button1) {
       //... do things for button1
       // what you do here may depend on the value of lastButtonPressed, like this, for example
        if (lastButtonPressed == someButton) {
           //... do something 
           //... you may want to reset the value of lastButtonPressed
           lastButtonPressed = nil; 

    }
    else if (sender == button2) {
       //... do things for button2
    }
    else if (sender == button3) {
       //... do things for button3
    }
    else
       //... Repeat for all the buttons you want to handle. The compiler will optimize this so don't worry about that
       //...

    // probably at the end, you want to save the current button as the last button pressed
    lastButtonPressed = sender;


}
</code></pre>
