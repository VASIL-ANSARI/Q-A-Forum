<p>You will have to write your own custom <code>Panel</code> implementation with <code>IScrollInfo</code> interface. Through this interface you can dynamically change extent size of your panel at any time using <code>ScrollOwner.InvalidateScrollInfo()</code> method. Here are some links that will get you started:</p>

<p>Your final code should contain an <code>ItemsControl</code> that is using your custom panel inside a <code>ScrollViewer</code>. As for drawing the connections between blocks, I personally would use transparent layer above your panel with <code>OnRender</code> code that draws them using <code>DrawingContext</code>.</p>
