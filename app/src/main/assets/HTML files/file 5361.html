<p>If you have jars that are used by both, the EJB archive and the WEB archive, then you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>keep all the common jars at the root
of the .ear </li>
<li>use the <code>Class-Path</code> attribute of the manifest.mf in the ejb and web archives to refer to these jar files. Remember that the location of the jars will be relative to the root of the ear file.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Even if you don't have an EJB jar, the above steps will work.</em></p>
