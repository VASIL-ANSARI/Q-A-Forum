<p>The site you're retrieving is using an encoding that you're not handling properly. Looking at the site briefly shows that it's encoded using UTF-8, so you need to account for that while reading the data. <code>InputStreamReader</code> offers an option in its constructor for this.</p>

<pre><code>BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(
                           new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream(), "UTF8"));
</code></pre>

<p>After some testing I've confirmed that <strong>on my machine</strong>, your code is actually working just fine as it is, since my default encoding is UTF-8 (and the system default charset gets used if you don't specify one). This may or may not be true for you; try printing out the encoding to see what you're reading:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()).getEncoding());
// prints "UTF8" on my machine.
</code></pre>

<p>It's always <strong>still best</strong> to specify the charset, to make your code independent of the platform defaults.</p>

<p>If the above printout shows UTF8 or you still are seeing unexpected results once you've specified the charset, your problem is probably with the editor you're using to view the output file. Make sure your text editor can handle UTF8, and you should be good to go. I'm seeing this in SublimeText 3:</p>
