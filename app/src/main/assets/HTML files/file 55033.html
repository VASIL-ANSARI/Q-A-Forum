<p>that's because your launching your activity in onNavigationItemSelected during the menu closing. I suggest you to launch your activity after the menu is closed.</p>

<pre><code>private static final int NAVDRAWER_ANIM_DURATION = 250;
public void goToActivity(Class&lt;?&gt; mClass){

    closeNavigationView(); // in this method you can close your drawer
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, mClass);
    new Handler().postDelayed(new ActivityTransitionRunnable(intent), NAVDRAWER_ANIM_DURATION);

}//goToActivity

private class ActivityTransitionRunnable implements Runnable {
    Intent mIntent;
    private ActivityTransitionRunnable(Intent intent) {
        mIntent = intent;
    }
    public void run() {
        startActivity(mIntent);
    }
}//ActivityTransitionRunnable
</code></pre>
