<p>The implementation details for creating an ORM can be quite extensive, and I lack the experience to give any meaningful recommendations beyond suggesting already existing projects, so I will suggest one instead.</p>

<p>The Data Mapper pattern is not very popular in the PHP world (in favour of Active Record, and certainly much of that favour is attributed to the fawning of Ruby on Rails in the PHP framework community), although there exists one notable project -- and it looks promising.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.outlet-orm.org/site/" rel="nofollow">Outlet ORM</a> follows the Data Mapper pattern, although I am not sure if it would be sufficient for your needs. I have so far had no problems with it.</p>
