<p>There is no way to do what you're trying to do. Once returning a String, you can cast it to whatever you like, but __toString() must return an actual string (and there's no __toInt()), per:</p>

  <p>This method must return a string, as otherwise a fatal E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR level error is emitted."</p>
