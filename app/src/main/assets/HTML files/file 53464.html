<p>If you look at the API the <code>simpleName()</code> method is annotated with <code>@Nullable</code> so you might end up with a null value returned by this method. </p>

<p>Why so ? because class tree is also used for body of anonymous classes (<code>new mypackage.MyClass() { ... }</code> constructions) in <code>NewClassTree</code> in this case, the classTree has no name (so it is null). (Another case is also for body of enum constants).</p>
