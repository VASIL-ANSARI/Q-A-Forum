<p>That is what the SecurityComponent is supposed to do.</p>

<p>It secures your application by adding 'tokens' to all of your forms to check if the form is 'valid' and has not been tampered with (e.g. Somebody added an additional field or value to the form with javascript).</p>

<p>It also checks if the posted form originates from a controller and/or action that is allowed to do so (allowedControllers)</p>

<p>If the requirements are not met, a 'blackHoleAction' is called that stops further actions.</p>

<p>Based on your usage of 'var $components', not 'public $components', it think you're running Cakephp 1.3 see the documentation for the SecurityComponent here:
<a href="http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Core-Components/Security-Component.html" rel="nofollow">http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Core-Components/Security-Component.html</a></p>

<p>Read the part on allowedControllers and allowedActions</p>

<p>It's also possible that you have an error somewhere in your script that is not visible because debugging is disabled. To enable debugging, change the debug level to 1 or 2 in your core.php config file;</p>

<p>app/Config/core.php set debug level to 2, with this line:</p>

<pre><code>Configure::write('debug', 2);
</code></pre>
