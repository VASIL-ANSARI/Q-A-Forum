<p>I'd say this is not possible because how would you resolve the dependancy?</p>

<p>If a class is asking for a delegate of type <code>Func&lt;bool&gt;</code> say, how would you distinguish between different delegates?</p>

<p>Your alternative of wrapping the delegate would be the best solution, as it allows you to name and combine delegates into functional sections.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Turns out Castle Windsor has a way of naming instances as they are registered in the IOC. So it is possible, but you still need to give some sort of name to each instance.
