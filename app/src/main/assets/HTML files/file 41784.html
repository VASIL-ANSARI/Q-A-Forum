<p>The concept you're looking for is Queuing.</p>

<p>I would suggest you use something like Beanstalkd, RabbitMQ, or any other queuing system to handle this.</p>

<p>The idea will be that you put your handling method into a Symfony command:
<a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html#creating-a-basic-command" rel="nofollow">http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html#creating-a-basic-command</a></p>

<p>In that command, you're going to read from the queue, and run the process based on the "Job" in the queue.</p>

<p>In you controller, the only thing you will do is push a new Job into that queue. The job will contain some data which you can use in your command to process.</p>

<p>To understand the concept a bit more, you can go through these slides: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cakper/2014-0821-symfony-uk-meetup-scaling-symfony2-apps-with-rabbit-mq" rel="nofollow">http://www.slideshare.net/cakper/2014-0821-symfony-uk-meetup-scaling-symfony2-apps-with-rabbit-mq</a></p>

<p>And you might want to read up some more on the concept of queuing.</p>

<p>For some reason I'm not able to find a good tutorial on Symfony2 and queuing.</p>
