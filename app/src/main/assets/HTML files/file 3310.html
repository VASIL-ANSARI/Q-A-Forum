<ul>
<li><p>The flag should be <code>public static</code> (I don't see it defined in the code you provided) - i.e.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyTest {
     public static int flag;
     // the rest of the code
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>in <code>send()</code> you can refer to it with <code>MyTest.flag_test</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note, that this is not a good way of passing data, but in your case there isn't anything better.</p>

<p>I think you are doing something that shouldn't be done at all. Here's what I propose:</p>

<ul>
<li>move the code that is changing the flag outside the test</li>
<li>include it in the test, in the appropriate place (as if it is there)</li>
<li>include it in <code>SendMail</code> as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus you won't need to invoke the test in order to obtain a flag.</p>
