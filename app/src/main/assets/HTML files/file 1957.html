<p>The assumption was wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...session data is locked to prevent
  concurrent writes only one script may
  operate on a session at any time
  <a href="http://us.php.net/session_write_close" rel="nofollow">http://us.php.net/session_write_close</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you could be running 100 AJAX requests for a user at the same time and they would each wait their turn.</p>

<p>My problem turned out to be an error in selecting the right session table column resulting in my sessions being re-created each load.</p>
