<p>You can use combination of view and list.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Emit keys like <code>["title", doc.title.toUpperCase()]</code> , <code>["status", doc.status.toUpperCase()]</code> using map fn, say <code>indexfn</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create _list fn, say <code>filter</code> that accepts query like <code>{field1:"value1", field2:"value2"...}</code> â lists can receive custom query params unlike map fns. Your filter must drop rows if they do not match. Surely to make filtering possible your _list must receive full (or somehow trimmed) set of fields from view fn.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform request like <code>/_design/ddoc/_list/filter/_view/indexfn?startkey=["field1","val1"] &amp; endkey=["field1","val1z"] &amp; filter={"field2":"val2", "field3":"val3"}</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is reasonable when your _list receives, say, not more then thousand rows from view â piping data from view through _lists fn to end user is quiet slow.</p>

<p>So if you have more or less alphbetically distributed data set with ~1M records, you can have good performance if you send startkey that is 3 or more chars long.</p>
