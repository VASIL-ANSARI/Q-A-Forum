<p>You may want to consider modelling your database as follows:</p>

<pre><code>table_photos
- photo_id
- photo_filename
- photo_date
- photo_user_id
- vote_id
- warn_id
- type
- detail_id

table_houses
- id
- name
- style

table_trees
- id
- name
- species
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, you can define your photo subject in the <code>type</code> field, such as 1 = Tree, 2 = House, etc. You will still be able to have many photos for the same subject without data duplication, but you will avoid having to build the <code>table_rel_xxx</code> tables with the repeated column schema. I prefer to avoid that when possible.</p>

<p>In this case, you would be able to build queries such as:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    table_trees.name
FROM
    table_photos
INNER JOIN
    table_trees ON 
    (table_trees.id = table_photos.detail_id AND table_photos.type = 1);
</code></pre>

<p>Or else simply query all the photos without "late binding" with the specific type:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    photo_filename
FROM
    table_photos;
</code></pre>

<p>These are techniques that attempt to implement <em>polymorphic associations</em> in a relational database, even though there is no support for this in SQL at a language level.</p>

<p>One drawback of this method is that it makes foreign key constraints quite tricky to define. You would need a foreign key constraint to have a guarantee that if <code>table_photos</code> is making a reference to a row in table_trees, that row really exists. A solution for the foreign keys problem is described, with a very good example, in the following EMC article:</p>
