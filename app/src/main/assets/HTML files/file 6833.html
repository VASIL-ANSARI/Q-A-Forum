<p>its now advisable to store 100MB files in database. I would instead store them in the filesystem, but considering transactions are active, employing Servlets seems reasonable.</p>

<ol>
<li>process http request so that file (received one) is stored in some temporal location.</li>
<li>open transaction, persist file metadata including temporal location, close transaction</li>
<li>using some external process which will monitor temporal files, transfer this file to its final destination from which it will be available to user through some Servlet.</li>
</ol>
