<p>Only thing I can think of is using <code>overflow-y: scroll;</code> for the box instead of auto. That way the content should scroll the way you desire.</p>

<p>In my understanding, auto will just do whatever the browser has decided is right, while if you specifically tell it to scroll when overflown on the y-axis, it is forced to do so in all browsers.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
