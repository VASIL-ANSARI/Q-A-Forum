<p>I'd factor this and any other shared definitions out into a types.h header which is included by each of your other headers.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could do something like</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef BOOL_DEFINED
#define BOOL_DEFINED
typedef enum bool {
    false,
    true,
} bool;
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>in both headers.</p>
