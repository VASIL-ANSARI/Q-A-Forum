<p><code>xpath</code> will return a list of the tags contained in the URL, so you're trying to extract on the list instead of any tags contained within. If you only want the first tag extracted then you probably want to put the <code>[0]</code> before the extract call, like this:</p>

<pre><code>urlInfo = htmlSource.xpath('//dd[@class="tqs"]/span/a/@href')[0].extract()
</code></pre>

<p>It's unclear which info you want, but if it's not contained in this first tag then you might want to iterate over <code>urlInfo</code> with <code>for tag in urlInfo</code>. And then <code>tag.extract()</code>.</p>
