<p>Good morning,</p>

<p>One thing to consider is that business logic tend to change very frequently. So I wouldn't split it between different assemblies if I were you because you don't necessarily want to recompile the assembly that was not intended to be recompiled after change to the BL.</p>

<p>In the ideal world your dependency would be resolved by web service of some kind (PS same thing should happen to business logic as well), but most of the times it's either impossible or takes lots of effort. In my previous project I had the dependency container (to resolve my dependencies) within services project which was referencing entities and whatnot.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,
Alex D</p>
