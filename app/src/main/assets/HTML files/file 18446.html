<p>$des was set to the next record of the array and you then while on it. This means it will always be true as the array has contents, which causes an infinite loop as you thought. The <code>$des = mysql_fetch_array($result)</code> will not get called again to move on to the next result.</p>

<p>Try removing the first <code>$des = mysql_fetch_array($result)</code> and replacing <code>while($des)</code> with:</p>

<pre><code>while($des = mysql_fetch_array($result))
</code></pre>
