<p>Yes, it is correct way of referencing the Microsoft.Web.Administration assembly.
It is only available for <code>IIS 7.0</code> and later though. Do you have IIS features installed (go to <code>Turn Windows features on or off</code> wizard in your control panel).</p>

<p>This is how I instantiate the ServerManager, had similar issues similar to yours:</p>

<pre><code>ServerManager iisManager = ServerManager.OpenRemote(Environment.MachineName.ToLower());
</code></pre>
