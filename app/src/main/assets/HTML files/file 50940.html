<p>You just need another do-while inside your current loop to repeat the question:</p>

<pre><code>do {
    ...
   do {
       System.out.println("Would you like to enter another? (yes/no)");
       answer = scan.next();
   } while (!Arrays.asList("yes", "no").contains(answer));
} while (answer.equals("yes");
</code></pre>
