<p>There are two kinds of distribution. One is Ad-hoc, the other is Enterprise Distribution. </p>

<p>Ad-hoc limits your distribution to 100 devices. It means that for your development certificate, you cannot test your app in more than 100 devices during the certificates life. Also, ad-hoc requires you to physically connect the device to the computer and build the app. This most-likely looks like the situation that you are in.</p>

<p>Enterprise Distribution (ED) is the other way. ED lets you host the app on a secure web-server. This way, you can just copy the ipa on a webserver and pass the link to your colleagues. They will be able to download the app on to their devices directly by pressing the <code>itms://</code> link (that you send them), without having to be around you. </p>

<p>If you have your options open, I would also check <a href="https://testflightapp.com/" rel="nofollow">TestFlight</a>. It is a third party app distribution system.</p>
