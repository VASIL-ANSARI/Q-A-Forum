<p>The problem is that you are loping through the records.</p>

<p>If you're on the first record (and when you retrieve a record set <strong>you aren't</strong>, until you move to the first or next record), then you are looping to the last record and only get the last display.</p>

<p>If you're on the first record (and when you retrieve a record set <strong>you aren't</strong>, until you move to the first or next record), then you stop at the first iteration, since you can't move before the first record.</p>

<p>What I would do is to rewrite your button click listeners to simply step up or down a position once you got the cursor.</p>

<p>So, let's say tou retrieve the cursor like this:</p>

<pre><code>// You have to change your dbhelper method name to match - atually there's an extra "PL_"
Cursor c = dbhelper.get_Record(Desc, sqlitedatabase);
if (c != null)
{
    c.moveToFirst(); // position on the first record, as soon as you get the cursor
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your click listeners simply do (btnNext)</p>

<pre><code>if (c != null &amp;&amp; !c.isAfterLast)
{
    c.moveToNext()
}
</code></pre>

<p>or (btnPRev)</p>

<pre><code>if (c != null &amp;&amp; !c.isBeforeFirst)
{
    c.moveToPrevious()
}
</code></pre>

<p>As adequate.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong></p>

<p>You edited your question, but I see you didn't understand my answer in full.<br>
You must get the cursor OUTSIDE the Click listener.</p>

<p>This is why you get <code>variable c is already defined in method onClick(View)</code></p>

<p>So, move this part</p>

<pre><code>dbhelper = new DbHelper(getApplicationContext());
sqlitedatabase = dbhelper.getReadableDatabase();
Cursor c = dbhelper.PL_get_Record(Desc, sqlitedatabase);
</code></pre>

<p>before the <code>onClick()</code> method.</p>

<p>Also, you can move the line</p>

<pre><code>DisplayData(c);
</code></pre>

<p>after the <code>switch()</code>, instead of repeating it in all cases.<br>
It has to be executed anyway.</p>
