<p>Hm... If you have a character array, that already decays into <code>char *</code> when passed to a function.</p>

<p>If you need only one character:</p>

<pre><code>char array[128]; // whatever - you want to extract the char from this
char s[] = { array[64], 0 };
</code></pre>

<p>then use <code>s</code> which now can decay into <code>char *</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> D'oh, I just read this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in order to print it to a file using fstream</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, then don't bother converting it to a proper C string. <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> knows its job, and it's overloaded for <code>char</code> too.</p>
