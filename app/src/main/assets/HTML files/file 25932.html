<p>Try changing it to the following</p>

<pre><code>private async Task&lt;List&lt;Route&gt;&gt; FindRoutesAsync(Destination[] Destinations){...
    Route _DestinationRoute = await FindRouteAsync(__Destination, 
                                               async d =&gt; d == __Destination);
    ...}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not near my desk so I can't test it.</p>
