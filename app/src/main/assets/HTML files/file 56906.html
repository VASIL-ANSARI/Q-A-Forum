<p>As the error says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>error: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Werror=sign-compare]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you have this code <code>for(i=0;i&lt;n;++i){</code> somewhere in your uClibc++ (namely, in <code>std::getline</code>), where <code>i</code> and <code>n</code> are of different signs (perhaps, <code>i</code> is an <code>int</code> while <code>n</code> represents some length and is a <code>size_t</code>, which is unsigned).</p>

<p>You can just turn this warning off with something like <code>-Wno-sign-compare</code>.</p>
