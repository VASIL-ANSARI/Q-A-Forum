<p>You could use a simple regular expression: <code>/x.*?x/</code>. This basically means "match any characters in between two <code>x</code> characters, <em>as few times as possible</em> (non-greedy)".</p>

<p>The matched text can be extracted with <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/String.html#method-i-5B-5D" rel="nofollow"><code>String#[regexp]</code></a></p>

<pre><code>string = 'xabcdexfghijk'
string[/x.*?x/] # =&gt; "xabcdex"
</code></pre>
