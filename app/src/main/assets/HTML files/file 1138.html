<p>Your SQL is equivilent to the following:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ea."LOC_ID", lo."DESCR", ea."PEGSTRIP", 
       ea."ENTITY_OWNER" , ea."PCT_OWNERSHIP", 
       ea."BEG_BAL", ea."ADDITIONS", ea."DISPOSITIONS" , 
       ea."EXPLANATION", ea."END_BAL", ea."NUM_SHARES", 
      ea."PAR_VALUE" , ag."DESCR", ea."EOY", ea."FAKEPEGSTRIP",
     (select sum(htb.END_FNC_CUR_US_GAAP) 
      from EQUITY_ACCOUNTS iea  
         Join HYPERION_TRIAL_BALANCE htb 
            On htb.PEGSTRIP = iea.PEGSTRIP
              and htb.LOC_ID = iea.LOC_ID 
              and htb.PRD_YY = iea.EOY
      where htb.PRD_NBR = 0 ) firstHyp 
FROM "TAXPALL"."ACCOUNT_GROUPING" ag 
    JOIN "TAXP"."EQUITY_ACCOUNTS" ea 
        ON ag."ACCT_ID"=ea."PEGSTRIP" 
            AND ag."EOY"=ea."EOY"
    JOIN "TAXP"."LOCATION" lo
        ON ea."LOC_ID"=lo."LOC_ID" 
WHERE ea."EOY"=2009
ORDER BY ea."LOC_ID", ea."PEGSTRIP"
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the subquery that generates firstHyp is not in any way dependant on the tables in the outer query... It is therefore <strong><em>not</em></strong> a <strong><em>Correllated</em></strong> SubQuery... meaning that the value it generates will NOT be different for each row in the outer query's resultset, it will be the <em>same</em> for every row.  You need to somehow put something in the subquery that makes it dependant on the value of some row in the outer query so that it will become a correllated subquery and run over and over once for each outer row.... </p>

<p>Also, you mention a <strong><em>pair</em></strong> of subselects, but I only see one. Where is the other one ?</p>
