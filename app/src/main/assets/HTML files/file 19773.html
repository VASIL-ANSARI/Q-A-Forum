<p>You can use the MySQL C Client Library and link that into your iOS app. Then your app will be able to connect to the MySQL database and issue SQL directly to it. It sounds like that is basically what your Windows app is already doing.</p>

<p>Since any C code works with Objective-C, you can use just about any plain C library in an iOS app.</p>

<p>In this case both your Windows app and your iOS will be talking directly to the database, without any kind of application layer to do validation, authentication, etc. If you wanted an server application to be responsible for those sort of things, you would have to create one and then your app would communicate with it, using JSON or XML or SOAP or whatever you like.</p>

<p>You will have to be mindful of making sure the database is secure; for example, if the iOS app connects with root DB access, a bug or a malicious user could figure out how to use it to make arbitrary changes to the database. (Since this is a time tracking app, you got your motive right there.) In summary: don't ignore security.</p>
