<p>You are almost there. Just do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>add <code>position:relative;</code> to <code>.subMenu1</code> to make it act as a reference for the position absolute of its children.</li>
<li>set <code>top: 0</code> on the absolute positioned <code>.menuLevel2</code> to make it's top line up with the top of it's parent.</li>
</ul>

<p>That should fix it. Check the updated fiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/hcKHy/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/hcKHy/1/</a></p>
