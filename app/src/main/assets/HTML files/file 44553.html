<p>At deployment the WSDL gets parsed and the system must be able to access the referenced XSD schema in order to read the types. The way it is described now, the XML schema is on your localhost. Your server must be up and listening on port 8080 and nothing should be blocking the system from accessing the address. </p>

<p>Make sure the xsd schema is available for access at :</p>

<p><a href="http://localhost:8080/Retailer/RetailerService?xsd=1" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8080/Retailer/RetailerService?xsd=1</a>. </p>

<p>If it available but it still doesn't deploy, you can try copying all the types referenced from the schema directly into the WSDL in the  section in the place of the  section. </p>
