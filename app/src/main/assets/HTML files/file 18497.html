<p>Consider breaking down the problem into simpler steps.  For example, the original problem statement that you're given, to evaluate the string</p>

<pre><code>4 5.2 + 5.7 / 6.1 5 - -
</code></pre>

<p>is much too hard to do all at once.  It is better to decompose the problem into managable pieces.  One decomposition is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Break the string into tokens.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop an interpreter that works on the tokens.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This breakdown is the standard approach for solving these kinds of problems.  A book like <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/" rel="nofollow">PLAI</a> covers how to do part 2.  Part 2 is not difficult: maintain a stack of numbers.  As you walk the tokens:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you see a number, push it onto the stack.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see an operator, pop two numbers off the stack, manipulate them with the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This process is the heart of an Reverse Polish Notation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation" rel="nofollow">RPN</a>) calculator.</p>

<p>The first problem is also not too difficult if you're willing to play with tools like regular expressions.  A regular expression can detect patterns in strings and separate strings into pieces.  For example, the following example shows how we can split a string into a sequence of words along space boundaries:</p>

<pre><code>var s = "hello this is a test";
var pieces = s.split(" ");
</code></pre>

<p>For your purposes, your string won't always be nicely spaced out, so you need to split along numeric and operator boundaries.  You need to experiment with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions" rel="nofollow">regular expression patterns</a> to make the tokenization work the way you want it to.</p>

<p>The problem you're trying to solve is actually NOT beginner material.  The problem is one given to second-semester students in computer science, folks who have already gone through something like <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/" rel="nofollow">How to Design Programs</a> or other similar curricula, with the assumption that the student already knows their favorite programming language down <strong>cold</strong>.  If you're unable to write programs without copying-and-pasting examples from others, you don't yet have the background to do the problem.  Do simpler problems first, get the language into your fingers, and then come back to this.</p>
