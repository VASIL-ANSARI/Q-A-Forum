<p>You might wanna override onSizeChanged(...) method of your listview. </p>

<p>I guess thats were it navigates to its top. </p>

<p>Try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void onSizeChanged(int w, int h, int oldw, int oldh) {
super.onSizeChanged(w, h, oldw, oldh);
setSelection(getCount()-9);
</code></pre>
