<p>are you able to configure server 2 at all? if so, can you set it to relay messages for server 1. If you can, then you just point server1 php script to use host2 rather than localhost for SMTP send.</p>

<p>if you cant configure as described above, you could build a page on server2 that server1 posts the email to be sent to, then send from server2... Sooo, on server2 you would have "relay.php" which takes in posted values representing the email to be sent (addressFrom,addressTo,subject,body).  You would use curl on server1 to issue a post request to relay.php. Its ugly, and may not perform too well, and not as good as using SMTP, but it will do what you want. ideally, look into getting server2 to accept SMTP relay from server1 - your host can help you out there maybe.</p>
