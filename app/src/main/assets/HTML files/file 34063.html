<p>This is not about Scala's NaN vs. Java's -- there is only one NaN:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; val a = Double.NaN
a: Double = NaN

scala&gt; val b = java.lang.Double.NaN
b: Double = NaN
</code></pre>

<p>Nor is it about there being two objects with the same value.  It's about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN">the definition of NaN</a>.  Two NaNs are not == because that's the way NaN is defined -- it is <em>not a number</em>, but rather a special value that means "undefined."  If you have two of those, how would you know whether they are equal?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>scala&gt; val x = 0.0 / 0.0
x: Double = NaN

scala&gt; val y = Math.sqrt(-1)
y: Double = NaN

scala&gt; x == y
res9: Boolean = false
</code></pre>

<p>Fortunately they are not ==; they are not numbers whose values you can compare.</p>

<p>As for <code>x.equals(y)</code>, well, why would you do that in Scala?  But given that you did, you are running into the bit of Java weirdness that I.K. pointed us to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29">the docs</a> for.  Let's demonstrate it:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo {
  public static void main( String[] args ) {
    double nan1 = 0.0 / 0.0;        Double box1 = nan1;
    double nan2 = Math.sqrt(-1);    Double box2 = nan2;
    System.out.println( nan1 == nan2 );         // false, as expected
    System.out.println( box1.equals(box2) );    // true -- WTF???
  }
}
</code></pre>
