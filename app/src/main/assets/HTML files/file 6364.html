<p>The align attribute is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/graphics.html#h-15.1.2" rel="nofollow">deprecated</a>, so even if I knew how to manage it, I wouldn't feel comfortable trying to negotiate it as newer browsers may have more and more trouble displaying it consistently.</p>

<p>For your case, you may want to just define classes <code>.right</code> and <code>.left</code> (to override a cascading <code>.right</code>) and tack them onto the rows, tables, or cells as you see fit.</p>
