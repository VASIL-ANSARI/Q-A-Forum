<p>Java can be used to send files via Bluetooth, and there is a tutorial on it at <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/07/27/bluetooth.html" rel="nofollow">http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2004/07/27/bluetooth.html</a></p>

<p>You could run a Java applet from the web browser that would use Bluetooth, although it would probably come up with a warning asking if you want to give the applet access to the files on your computer. JavaScript, however, would not be necessary, since an applet can run directly on a webpage.</p>
