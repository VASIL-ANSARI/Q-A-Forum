<p>reveal.js relies on <a href="http://headjs.com/">head.js</a> for dependency loading. However head.js is not included in the exported presentation from Slides since that doesn't load any dependencies.</p>

<p>To fix this you'll need to add head.js to your presentation:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headjs/0.96/head.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
