<p>The user's position can change over time.  The accuracy of the reading can change over time.  There's no single discrete point in time where the user is "found", it's just a constantly changing measurement.</p>

<p>If you are using Core Location, then the messages passed to your delegate include <code>CLLocation</code> objects which have horizontal and vertical accuracy readings.  If you want to know when the user's location can be measured within a certain degree of accuracy, you can use those.  But you should be aware that these are measurements that can move in and out of your tolerance levels without warning.  This is not a binary found/not found situation.</p>
