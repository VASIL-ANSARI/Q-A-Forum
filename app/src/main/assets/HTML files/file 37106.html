<p>To access the <code>next</code> variable in your template, you have to pass it through your <code>render</code> function. In your view, add something like:</p>

<pre><code>context = {'next': request.GET['next'] if request.GET and 'next' in request.GET else ''}
return render(request, 'login.html', context)
</code></pre>

<p>Then you <code>{{ next }}</code> will appear in your template as it does in your URL.</p>

<p><em>Also, you can remove both the <code>else: return render(request, 'login.html')</code>, as they are obsolete.</em></p>
