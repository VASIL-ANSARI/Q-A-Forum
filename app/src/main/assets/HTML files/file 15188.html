<p>If this is the only problem you are facing while editing your EditText, you can eradicate it by adding the following attribute to your Activity in the manifest. </p>

<pre><code>android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"
</code></pre>

<p>Something like this,</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;activity
            android:name=".ListEditActivity"
            android:label="@string/app_name" 
            android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"&gt;

   &lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you will not be able to face the problem of clicking your Edittext twice to Edit it. But if you are facing some problems like, getitng wrong values in your EditText while scrolling, I am actually working on it and once I get the solution for it I will update my answer here. </p>
