<p>I would probably say yes considering that the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/insert-speed.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL documentation on the speed of inserts</a> says that <code>INSERT</code> performance is affected by the number of indexes that you have. The primary keys documentation and <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-indexes.html" rel="nofollow">index documentation</a> doesn't really say much about "complex" primary keys. I would maybe do some tests on some sample data from your table with an <code>AUTO_INCREMENT</code> primary key to see if you see any differences.</p>
