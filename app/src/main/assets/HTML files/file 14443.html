<p>I think your problem is stemming from the <code>using (var mutex = new Mutex(false, "mySpecialMutex"))</code> line. When the first thread terminates, it would dispose of the mutex object which, I believe, could cause the error you're getting.</p>

<p>If possible, it would be better to declare the mutex as a (static) class variable outside of that method. Then you would manually instantiate it before starting your threads and dispose of it after they're complete.</p>
