<p>In plain C, you traditionally use <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/snprintf" rel="nofollow">snprintf()</a> to format your command line string into a buffer:</p>

<pre><code>char buf[1024];
snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "grep '%s' searchtext.txt &gt; result.txt", S);
system(buf);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, for security reasons, you should never do that if <code>S</code> comes from an external source such as a file, a database, or the user himself. That could lead to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection#Shell_injection" rel="nofollow">shell code injection</a>.</p>
