<p>So, first thing you need to do is open the file so that you can see what's in it. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow">Here is the documentation for that, with examples</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure that you can see it line by line inside of a <code>for</code> loop by using the <code>print</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>for line in file:
   print(line)
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you can see each line, one at a time, you can <code>split</code> it based on a space and take the last value:</p>

<pre><code>name = line.split()[-1]
</code></pre>

<p><code>print</code> the value again to make sure you're getting what you expect.</p>

<p>Now that you have each name, you can check to see if it starts with your desired letter:</p>

<pre><code>if name[0] in "SH":
    print(name)
</code></pre>

<p>If it does, store it in a list (rather than print it as above) and then use the file documentation link I posted to start with to see how to write back out to a file.</p>

<p>Here is a full example to get you going:</p>

<pre><code>inFile = open(r"\path\to\names.txt", 'r')

required = "HS"
valid = []

for line in inFile:
    name = line.split()[-1]

    if name[0].upper() in required:
        valid.append(line)

outFile = open(r"\path\to\validNames.txt", 'w')

for line in valid:
    outFile.write(line)
</code></pre>
