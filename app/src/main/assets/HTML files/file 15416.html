<p>The difference between the two is that being hidden using "visible" attribute leaves the element on the page, just not actually displayed.  So, it's spacing will be taken into account when the page renders the rest of the display.</p>

<p>It seems that doing it the other way actually stops the element from being put onto the page, which can change how other elements on the page are laid out.</p>

<p>usually testing the visible part is enough from my experience, but if you are wanting to be more complete, then yeah you would have to check using "&amp;&amp;" conditions on multiple attributes.
It really all depends on how clean the code you are using is, and how well tested the rest of the UI aspect of the system is.</p>

<p>The other thing to consider is what is the purpose of the test.  Are you testing code that you wrote, or how the browser is using Javascript to render the page?  You want to be testing the code that you are creating, and rely on the fact that the browser works (because if the browser stops working, then the whole thing is unreliable anyway).  So if your code tells the element to set some attribute, then checking for that attribute is all the testing you need to do.  Anything on top of that can only really be proven by testing outside of the code itself (as in manualy looking at the page and other things like that).</p>
