<p>The ANTLR lexers keep track of token positions in the source stream.</p>

<ul>
<li>Move comments and whitespace to the hidden channel</li>
<li>Set the <code>Text</code> property of identifier tokens to "V"</li>
<li>Run your rolling hash against a <code>CommonTokenStream</code>, looking at the <code>Text</code> property of each token.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the tokens intact from start to end, you'll have the mapping preserved as well.</p>
