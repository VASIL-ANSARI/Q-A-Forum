<p>Um, the picture does not show a "completely upside down" preview AFAICT. It shows what appears to be a preview rotated 90 degrees (a woman standing on the floor appears to be standing on a wall in the preview). The expression "upside down" is usually reserved for a 180-degree rotation (a woman standing on the floor appears to be standing on the ceiling in the preview).</p>

  <p>Is there a way to manually rotate the preview?</p>

<p>No.</p>

  <p>Seems its not just eStar (low-budget one), Asus MemoPad 7 as well has rotated preview</p>

<p>Please read <a href="https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-cam2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" rel="nofollow">the project's contribution guidelines</a>, then post an <a href="https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-cam2/issues" rel="nofollow">issue</a> (or two, in this case, if you prefer, one per device). Be certain to include <strong>complete steps for reproducing the issue</strong>. In this case, that would include the code necessary to reproduce the problem (if you cannot reproduce it with the project's demo apps), along with enough device identifiers that I can reliably procure this hardware. Notably, there are several devices marketed as an Asus MemoPad 7, not even including the HD variant. There also seem to be a few different tablets marketed under the eStar brand.</p>

<p>Now, I happen to be revamping the camera preview stuff right now, so there's an off chance that I'll semi-unintentionally happen to fix this problem as a part of that, but I wouldn't hold out much hope. That's why, to fix this, I need to be able to reproduce the problem here in the lab, so that I can figure out what is going on.</p>
