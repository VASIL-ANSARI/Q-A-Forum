<p>The API to read/write XML is up to the programmer/environment. Further, Apache Kafka does not enforce any particular format for event data beyond a simple key/value model. It will work equally well with XML, JSON,Avro or any other data format. It's recommended that any format, be it XML, JSON, provided it should be used in a consistent manner. if you are starting a new project with Kafka, there are things to consider like performance, ease of use, programming language support etc before selecting and use the correct serialise format etc. Avro is one of the most successful format for stream data.</p>
