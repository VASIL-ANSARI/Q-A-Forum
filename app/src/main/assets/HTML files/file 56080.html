<p>According to Samuel Benzaquen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gTest doesn't include a stack unwinder. You have to provide your own.
  You can do this in include/gtest/internal/custom/gtest.h by defining
  the GTEST_OS_STACK_TRACE_GETTER_ macro to point an implementation of
  OsStackTraceGetterInterface.</p>
