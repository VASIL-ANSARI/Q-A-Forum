<p>The three types used by an asynchronous task are the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first, Params, the type of the parameters sent to the task upon
  execution. The second, Progress, the type of the progress units
  published during the background computation. The third, Result, the
  type of the result of the background computation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need to pass additional data to your AsyncTask, simply create a method which receives that data in your AsyncTask and call it within the main UI. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public void setMyHandler(Handler h) { myhandler = h; }
</code></pre>

<p>You'll be able to find more info on the AsyncTask help page, <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
