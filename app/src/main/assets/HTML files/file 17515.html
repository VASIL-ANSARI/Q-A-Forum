<p>The rows in your <code>Person</code> and <code>Team</code> tables are being deleted, but the row from the association table is not.  This is because <code>query.delete()</code> does not handle relationship cascading.  See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9918653/pythons-sqlalchemy-doesnt-clean-out-the-secondary-many-to-many-table">Python&#39;s SQLAlchemy doesn&#39;t clean out the secondary (many-to-many) table?</a> for a detailed explanation.</p>

<p>You should be able to solve this by using <code>session.delete(obj)</code> for each object you have added. Or better yet, for unit testing with an in-memory database, just drop and re-create all of your tables during <code>tearDown</code> and <code>setUp</code>.</p>
