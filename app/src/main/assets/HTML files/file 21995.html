<p>Your Perl script is full of weirdness. I would recommend fixing these oddities before wondering if there might be an actual problem.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>use strict</code>. Seriously. This will point out many sources for bugs. And it forces you to declare your variables (with <code>my</code>). That is a good thing.</li>
<li>uncomment the <code>$foo = CGI-&gt;new</code>, because you actually <em>use</em> that object later on. But for that, the variable really should be initialized with an object. Also, rename it to something sensible, and declare the variable: <code>my $cgi = CGI-&gt;new;</code>. <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/CGI" rel="nofollow">â monumental CGI docs</a></li>
<li>You forgot a quote around <code>'mylogin</code>.</li>
<li>Oh, and while you are <code>die</code>ing: Should you die, that error message ends up in your logs. That program will produce many more errors, so you should have accumulated quite some entries. Look at them maybe, and fix the problems! Also, you might want to send errors to the browser during development. Do this with <code>use CGI::Carp qw/fatalsToBrowser/;</code>. <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/CGI%3a%3aCarp" rel="nofollow">â CGI::Carp documentation</a></li>
<li>Read the <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JSON" rel="nofollow">JSON documentation</a>. Be sure that <code>decode</code> and not <code>decode_json</code> is the thing you really want (<code>decode_json</code> assumes UTF-8). Both methods want a JSON string. The Perl string <code>my $not_json = q/CID/</code> is <em>not</em> valid JSON. That would be <code>my $json = q/"CID"/</code>. See the quotes?</li>
<li>I still assume that you want to read a parameter from the POST or GET request. Once you follow hint â 2, that should work again.</li>
<li>I don't know SQL, but I know you're doing it wrong. Never ever interpolate variables into an SQL statement, or you are <em>inviting</em> injection attacks! Use parameterized statements : <code>my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE cid = ?') or die ...</code>, then execute it with the actual variable as a parameter <code>$sth-&gt;execute($cidID) or die ...</code>.</li>
<li><code>$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</code> fetches only one row, but you selected <em>all</em> rows. Either fix your SQL so you only select the first row, or loop over all rows! <code>while (my @row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array){ do something @row }</code>. <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBI" rel="nofollow">â DBI docs</a></li>
<li>You <code>print $VCName3</code> before you printed the headers! This will likely produce many <code>500</code> errors. Don't do that.</li>
<li>You specify that your JSON is sent as <code>UTF-8</code>. Perhaps you should be using <code>encode_json</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you fixed these issues, the problem may or may not remain. If it does, please update your question and drop a comment that you did so. We'll then look how we can solve those <em>actual</em> problems.</p>
