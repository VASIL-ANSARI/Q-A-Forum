<p>I am not completely sure what you are asking, but if you are trying to sort an array of JSON objects of the following form: <code>[{},{},..,{}]</code> then you can use the <code>Array.sort</code> method build into JavaScript, and just pass in a compare function that describes how to sort the objects by date.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Say you have an object like this:</p>

<pre><code>var people = [
{
  "name": John,
  "birthday": new Date(1990, 8, 10);
},
{
  "name": Mark,
  "birthday": new Date(1991, 10, 17);
},
{
  "name": David,
  "birthday": new Date(1991, 7, 26);
}
];
</code></pre>

<p>Now to sort this array you can simply do the following:</p>

<pre><code>people.sort(function(a,b) {
  return a.birthday - b.birthday;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now the <code>people</code> array will be sorted by date.</p>
