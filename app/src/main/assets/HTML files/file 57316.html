<p>A directive can't be used on its own. What you can do is to bootstrap an Angular2 root component with a selector that matches an element inside your Polymer element.</p>

<p>I wouldn't expect this to lead to something especially useful. </p>

<p>The other way around is probably the better approach, to use Polymer elements inside Angular applications.</p>

<p>Angular is primary a web application framework that can also be used inside parts of a web application.</p>

<p>Polymer is primarily a library to build reusable components that works also quite well as an application framework.</p>
