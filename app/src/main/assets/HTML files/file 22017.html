<p>Change your .htaccess to:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^store/([0-9]+)/$ /store_selection.php?store=$1 [QSA,L]
</code></pre>

<p>This just internally rewrites the URL while the user is still shown the original. You had set it to do a 301 Redirect so the URL the user was hitting is /store_selection.php?store=id viz the reason for the infinite loop.</p>
