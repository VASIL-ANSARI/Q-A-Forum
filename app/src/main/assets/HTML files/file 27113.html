<p>I have used this plugin in my currently project intensively.  Here are few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>.swiper-container-third and .swiper-slide does not have height
specified in CSS. You must have to. Both has to have width and
height equal. </li>
<li>Did you miss CSS given by IDangerous?</li>
</ol>
