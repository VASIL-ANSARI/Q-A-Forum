<p>If I understood you correctly you want to add more text input elements into your page and be able to use this whole process of showing society on each of this elements.</p>

<p>The problem is not converting php code into a function (which would bring nothing).</p>

<p>What you want is to be able to tell showsociety() function which input element should it work on.
In the easiest case you can add additional parameter to the fucntion:</p>

<pre><code>showsociety(str, id) {...}
</code></pre>

<p>And use this ID to search for correct element on the page.</p>

<pre><code>[...]
document.getElementById(id).value = data[i].societyid;  
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id="society_name" onBlur="showsociety(this.value, this.id)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It can be done better but I think with such simple solution you should not have much problems.</p>

<p>Hope it helped.</p>
