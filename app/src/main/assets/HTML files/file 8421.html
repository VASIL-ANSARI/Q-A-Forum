<p>In fact, Wicket has a very powerful feature for this.</p>

<p>Let's say this is your localization string with the key "some.resource.key":</p>

<pre><code>This is a ${user}.
</code></pre>

<p>Then you add the following to your Wicket template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;wicket:message key="some.resource.key"&gt;
    &lt;a wicket:id="user"&gt;user&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/wicket:message&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In your Wicket page (or Panel), simply add your link as if you were adding it to the level where you put the wicket:message:</p>

<pre><code>add(new Link("user"));
</code></pre>

<p>Now the link - you can use whatever implementation of link or any other component you like - is displayed correctly embedded in your localized string.</p>
