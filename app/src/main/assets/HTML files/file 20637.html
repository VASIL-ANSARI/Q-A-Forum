<p>You should investigate the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/buffer.html" rel="nofollow">Buffer Api</a>. </p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These functions can be used by an object to expose its data in a raw, byte-oriented format. Clients of the object can use the buffer interface to access the object data directly, without needing to copy it first.</p>
  
  <p>Two examples of objects that support the buffer interface are strings and arrays. The string object exposes the character contents in the buffer interfaceâs byte-oriented form. An array can also expose its contents, but it should be noted that array elements may be multi-byte values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example (in C++):</p>

<pre><code>void* ExtractBuffer(PyObject* bufferInterfaceObject, Py_buffer&amp; bufferStruct)
{
    if (PyObject_GetBuffer(bufferInterfaceObject, &amp;bufferStruct, PyBUF_SIMPLE) == -1)
        return 0;

    return (void*)bufferStruct.buf;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Do not forget to release the bufferStruct when you no longer need it:</p>

<pre><code>PyBuffer_Release(&amp;bufferStruct);
</code></pre>
