<p>I would always favour:</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
    do_stuff
</code></pre>

<p>This is regardless of the language (i.e. I do it in C++, C and Objective-C too).</p>

<p>It seems pointless to use <code>== True</code> or <code>is True</code> as that is evaluating an expression to a boolean expression, and if <code>foo</code> is already boolean there is no point.</p>
