<p>Since you are using Json.Net.  You can use a service, such as <a href="http://json2csharp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://json2csharp.com/</a> to generate a DTO object that you can deserialize.  After doing that, you get several classes, one of them is called <code>RootObject</code>.  You can rename this to whatever you desire.  Then you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>var dtoObj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;RootObject&gt;(response);
</code></pre>

<p>Where response is you Json in string format.  This method will give you the advantages of DTO objects, instead of dealing with <code>JArray</code>.  To access your data it would be <code>dtoObj.Result.Matches</code>.</p>

<p>Your other option is to use <code>dynamic</code>.</p>

<pre><code>var dynObj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;dynamic&gt;(response);
</code></pre>

<p>The benefit of dynamic is you don't have to maintain DTO objects, however you lose some of the enforced typing and structure.  But with dynamic you would access matches by <code>dynObj.result.matches</code>.  Sometimes with <code>dynamic</code> you have to explicitly cast it to some sort of Enumerable, which is annoying, so I prefer the DTO method above.</p>
