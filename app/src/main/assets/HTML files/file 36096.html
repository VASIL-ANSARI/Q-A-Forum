<p>What do you mean by "fetched"? A fetched results controller?</p>

<p>From my perspective, the answer to your question is a general "yes". Assuming a shared parent context of some kind, two contexts will get the newest object, if one context saves with a modified object, and the other context does something to load it again, for example, uses the objectID and <code>- objectWithID:</code> on the other context, to reload it.</p>
