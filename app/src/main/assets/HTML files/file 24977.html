<pre><code>eval = new_expression.join
</code></pre>

<p>This calls <code>new_expression.join</code> and stores the result in a local variable called <code>eval</code>. Since you never use that local variable, you could as well just have written:</p>

<pre><code>new_expression.join
</code></pre>

<p>If it was your intention to call Ruby's <code>eval</code> method with the result of <code>new_expression.join</code> as its argument, you should remove the assignment operator:</p>

<pre><code>eval new_expression.join
</code></pre>

<p>That said using <code>eval</code> to evaluate the expression is only a good idea if you're only ever evaluating trusted input.</p>
