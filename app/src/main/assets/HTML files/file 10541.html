<p>In-band registration means that users that do not have an account on your server can register one using the XMPP protocol itself, so the registration stays "in band", inside the same protocol you're already using. That's opposed to doing the registration out-of-band, for example by having to go to a website to sign up and then returning to the XMPP client software. XMPP specifies the in-band method of registration in <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html">XEP-0077</a> and many XMPP clients support it.</p>
