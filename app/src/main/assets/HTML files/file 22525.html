<p>C++ Standard (n3337), 23.2.3, Sequence containers, Table 100 ('sequence container requirements) - row <code>a.erase(q1,q2)</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Effects: Erases the elements in the range <code>[q1,q2)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that <code>a.erase(q,q)</code> is safe because it does nothing.</p>

<p>Loki Astari's answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/81656">this SO question</a> has a list of drafts of the C++ standard. The official copy is not freely available unfortunately, so I am using n3337, which seems to be the closest to C++11.</p>
