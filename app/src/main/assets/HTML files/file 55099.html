<p>Are you passing the variable in the input to the JavaScript function via the on change event?</p>

<p>If you are you may need to create two listeners
1. "Change event" to capture new values that get put in the input field
2. "Document Ready event" to grab the value you are passing via PHP and use it when building the map.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is how you are going about things but hopefully it helps.  If I am off base here, can you share more of your work so I can see how your initiating the map and updating it.</p>
