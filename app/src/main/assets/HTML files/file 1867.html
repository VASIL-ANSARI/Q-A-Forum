<p>You could use a subquery:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a,b,c,d FROM
    (SELECT 
        a, b, 
        (A VERY LONG AND COMPLICATED SUBQUERY) AS c,
        (ANOTHER VERY LONG AND COMPLICATED SUBQUERY) AS d
        FROM table
    ) AS T1
WHERE c AND d
</code></pre>

<p>You could also do this with a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-with.html">CTE</a>.</p>
