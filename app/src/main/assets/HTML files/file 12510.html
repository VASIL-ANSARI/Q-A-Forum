<p>I wouldn't implement any logic to avoid reading the Xml file in certain situation. That would make your programm much easier. Just deal with the situation that your program reads the changes it has done by itself and you will decrease the possibility to miss some changes due to a kind of "magic mechanism ignoring your own changes".</p>
