<p>What I tend to do is :</p>

<ul>
<li>From the PHP code, generate the form, using <code>Zend_Form</code> and the related classes
<ul>
<li>This includes setting up the form itself,</li>
<li>But also server-side validations and all that</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once the form works fine, I add Javascript in an un-obstrusive way.
<ul>
<li>Which means my JS code is totally distinct from the PHP/Zend_Form code.</li>
<li>And also mean my form doesn't rely on Javascript being activated in the user's browser, as the form already works before.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

If you are using jQuery, you can detect when the page is loaded <a href="http://api.jquery.com/ready/" rel="nofollow"><code>$.ready</code></a>, and hook a function on that event -- function that will add some dynamic bahaviors to your form.</p>

<p><em>Of course, you can do the same sort of thing with other JS libraries -- I only took jQuery as an example because of its popularity, and the fact there are some jQuery-related components in ZendX.</em></p>
