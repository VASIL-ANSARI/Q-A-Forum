<p>You can add a folder to an Xcode project by dragging the folder from the Finder into your project. You'll see in the Project Navigator that the folder shows up in blue, and in the File Inspector, that the folder is listed as "Absolute Path" rather than "Relative to Group." When you modify this folder in the Finder, it will be updated in Xcode.</p>
