<p>how about:</p>

<pre><code>int[] arrayOfFifty = new int[50];
//populate the array with 1 to 50
for(int i = 1; i &lt; 51; i++){
    arrayOfFifty[i-1] = i;
}

//perform the factorial
long result = 1;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfFifty.length; i++){
   result = arrayOfFifty[i] * result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Did not test this.  No idea how big the number is and if it would cause error due to the size of the number. </p>

<p>Updated.  arrays use ".length" to measure the size.</p>

<p>I now updated result to long data type and it returns the following - which is obviously incorrect.  This is a massive number and I'm not sure what your professor is trying to get at.
