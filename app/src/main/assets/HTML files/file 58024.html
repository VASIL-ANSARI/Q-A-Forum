<p>Did you follow the procedures at <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html#notification" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html#notification</a> in order to enable notifications?</p>

<p>When you issue <code>readCharacteristic</code>, you are not allowed to issue a new <code>readCharacteristic</code> until you have got the <code>onCharacteristicRead</code>. Or actually you are not allowed to send ANY new request (<code>readCharacteristic</code>, <code>writeCharacteristic</code>, <code>readDescriptor</code>, <code>writeDescriptor</code>) until a previous request has completed. This is because there may only be one outstanding GATT request at a time and there is no internal queue.</p>
