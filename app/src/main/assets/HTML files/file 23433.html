<p>Events don't work like that.</p>

<p>As far as the CLR is concerned, an event is just a pair of methods named <code>add_EventName</code> and <code>remove_EventName</code>.  (these are called accessors, just like properties) </p>

<p>How to implement these methods and invoke the handlers is up to the implementing classes.</p>

<p>Typically, events are implemented by storing all handlers for each event in a multicast delegate (either in a compiler-generated backing field from an implicit event, or in something like <code>EventHandlerList</code>).</p>

<p>Invoking a multicast delegate will run each method synchronously, in insertion order.<br>
If there are no methods, it will be null.  (there is no such thing as an empty multicast delegate instance)</p>
