<p>I am not aware of any way to do this - the <code>MessageBodyMember</code> attribute has no property or means to specify that it's a required part and thus should have minOccurs=1 in the WSDL.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.messagebodymemberattribute_members.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN docs on MessageBodyMember attribute</a>.</p>

<p>If it's really a big problem, you could potentially create your own WSDL exporter class which would override the existing standard one provided by WCF, and that would add this minOccurs=1 attribute to all MessageBodyMember elements. There's quite a few sample on the web on how to modify and tweak the WCF WSDL exporting mechanism.</p>
