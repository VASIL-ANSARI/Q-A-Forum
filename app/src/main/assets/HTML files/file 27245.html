<p>The balls are moving or not?
I've used SURF (and SFIT) they work great for arrested objects. Have a look to the <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/nonfree/doc/feature_detection.html" rel="nofollow">documentation page</a> there are also two questions you should see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14025192/detect-snooker-billiard-balls-with-opencv">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8162234/detecting-billiard-balls-with-opencv">this</a>. Than if you want to calculate the trajectory I've tried <a href="http://outilsphysiques.tuxfamily.org/pmwiki.php/Oppl/Pymecavideo" rel="nofollow">Pymecavideo</a> that uses OpenCv maybe a look into the source code could be interesting for your work.</p>
