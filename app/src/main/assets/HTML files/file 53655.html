<p>In your button click you're starting activities, but in your description you indicate you make a call to a server. Which one is correct? Why would you start an activity on button click before you have validated the credentials?</p>

<p>Also, assuming your service makes an asynchronous call to validate the credentials, you don't need an async task to call into it, the service should return immediately from that "validate credentials" call from the activity and, once it has validated the credentials, it should call back into your activity via a callback method.</p>
