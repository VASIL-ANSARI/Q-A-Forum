<p><code>iterrows()</code> generates tuples of the form <code>(index, Series)</code>, where Series is the row data you're trying access.  In this case where your index isn't meaningful, you can unpack it to a dummy variable, like this.</p>

<pre><code>for (_, row) in finalTable.iterrows():
    .....
</code></pre>
