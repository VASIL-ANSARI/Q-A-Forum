<hr>

<p>indeterminate progress indicators are much more widely used on web apps (outside of file uploaders). How would you measure the percent completed? I don't know of a way.</p>

<p>Another problem with non-indeterminate progress indicators (e.g.: a progress bar): even if you can identify a way to partition your work into chunks, there is basically no way to guarantee that each chunk will take the same amount of time. How many times have you gotten pissed off at a progress bar that grinds through the first 5% and then instantly jumps to 100%?</p>

<p>I don't like saying "it's impossible" because that's a hard absolute, and I'd sure look like a goofball when the next answer posted shows that I was wrong. How about <em>I haven't yet found a way?</em></p>
