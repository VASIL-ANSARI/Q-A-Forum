<p>As the docs suggests <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManagerDelegate_Protocol/CLLocationManagerDelegate/CLLocationManagerDelegate.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007124-CH3-SW16" rel="nofollow">here</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Locations</strong></p>
  
  <p>An array of CLLocation objects containing the location data. This array always contains at least one object representing the current location. If update events were deferred or if multiple events arrived before they could be delivered, the array may contain additional entries. The objects in the array are organized in the order in which they occurred. Therefore, the most recent location update is at the end of the array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the location manager always shows some value.</p>
