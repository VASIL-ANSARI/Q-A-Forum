<p>It means "it", as in the word "it".  As in the test declaration reads like a sentence. You <code>describe</code> an object by what <code>it</code> does. Simple as that.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bowling ball is round</p>
  
  <p>Bowling ball has 3 holes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Might translate to a test hierarchy like this:</p>

<pre><code>Bowling Ball
  it is round
  it has three holes
</code></pre>

<p>Which would translate to the following testing setup:</p>

<pre><code>describe(BowlingBall, function() {
  it('is round', function() {});
  it('has three holes', function() {});
});
</code></pre>

<p>So because it reads well, it just becomes the way you separate individual test cases. It also encourages you to write your test description in a consistent manner because <code>it</code> is part of the sentence that describes the test, which makes your test suite more readable over the long term.</p>

<p>In the end BDD is <em>all</em> about readability for the test writer.  So this is simply sugar.</p>
