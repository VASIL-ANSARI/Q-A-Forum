<p>I think you need to use an alias with the <code>BENEFICIARY_CIVIL_NUMBER</code> column in your <code>WHERE</code> clause.  I will assume that this column belongs to the <code>S_S_CSPF_NRS_PERSON_V</code> table, so the query should be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT n.NAME_A, m.MOTHER_NAME_A
FROM S_S_CSPF_NRS_PERSON_V n, S_S_CSPF_NRS_MOTHER_V m
WHERE n.BENEFICIARY_CIVIL_NUMBER = 1111111
</code></pre>

<p>You are currently doing a cross join between the two tables.  If this is what you intended, then leave it as is.  If you intended an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, then why not make it explicit:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT n.NAME_A, m.MOTHER_NAME_A
FROM S_S_CSPF_NRS_PERSON_V n
INNER JOIN S_S_CSPF_NRS_MOTHER_V m
    ON n.col1 = m.col2
WHERE n.BENEFICIARY_CIVIL_NUMBER = 1111111
</code></pre>
