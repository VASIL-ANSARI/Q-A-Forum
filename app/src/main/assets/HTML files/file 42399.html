<p>Answer for future consultation: </p>

<p>What solved my issue in the end was starting from scratch and installing my dependencies via Cocoapods. It appears if you try to add a framework via a drag and drop and then later user= Cocoapods the previous framework will not be noticed by Cocoapods and Cocoapods will attempt to install that very same framework again. </p>

<p>So when using dependencies either only use drag and drop or only use Cocoapods from the get go. Do not try to mix and match.</p>
