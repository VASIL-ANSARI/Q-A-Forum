<p>If you use the rake seed task, it will only add it to the database.  However, many things, like the db:test:prepare task, will delete all the records from the database, so the seed task will not be effective.</p>

<p>Your factory approach looks good, but I suggest you put the code in a pair of braces.</p>

<pre><code>a.state { State.where(:abbreviation =&gt; "MA").first || Factory(:state, :abbreviation =&gt; "MA") }
</code></pre>

<p>This will re-run every time the factory is called, and will prevent creating duplicates in your database.</p>
