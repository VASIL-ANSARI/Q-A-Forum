<pre><code>.username {
display: block;
margin: 0 auto;
text-align: center;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>This fixes it, but it's pretty hackish. I've set the element in the span to display block, but that's not really the intention of a span element.</p>

<p>EDIT: I may have misunderstood the question. You're asking about vertical centering, rather than horizontal centering, which is what my code does. But then you go on to ask, it seems, about the z-index. Can you clarify what it is you're looking for, please?</p>
