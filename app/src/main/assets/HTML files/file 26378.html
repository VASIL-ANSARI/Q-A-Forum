  <p>Being the calculateBill is abstract and implemented in each subclass
  of order I should just be able to call it correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The method is declared as <code>public</code>, you will be able to call it on <code>Order</code> instances.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also if that is the case then shouldn't OrderManager extend Order?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ask yourself: is an OrderManager an Order? No? So don't make it extend <code>Order</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or just being in the same package would allow me to call it's methods? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the method is public, so you can call it from anywhere as long as you have an instance to call it on.</p>

<p>So in your <code>for</code> loop</p>

<pre><code>public ArrayList&lt;Order&gt; getOrdersAbove(double val) {
    for (Order o : orders) {
        double bill = o.calculateBill();
        // do logic
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When calling <code>calculateBill()</code>, Java will use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding#Late_binding_in_Java" rel="nofollow">late-binding</a> (polymorphism) to resolve the actual implementation of the method to use.</p>
