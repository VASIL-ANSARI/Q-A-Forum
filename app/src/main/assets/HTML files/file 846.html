<p>I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but you could use <code>method_missing</code> in your controllers and then lookup the alias, maybe like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyController
  def method_missing(sym, *args)
    aliased = Alias.find_by_action_name(sym)
    # sanity check here in case no alias

    self.send( aliased.real_action_name )
    # sanity check here in case the real action calls a different render explicitly
    render :action =&gt; aliased.real_action_name
  end

  def normal_action
    @thing = Things.find(params[:id])
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to optimize that, you could put a <code>define_method</code> in the <code>method_missing</code>, so it would only be 'missing' on the first invocation, and would be a normal method from then on.</p>
