<p>You possibly need to use some sort of CSS Reset style sheet if you haven't already. Try inserting one of the options from <a href="http://www.cssreset.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> into your CSS. It will most likely mess up a few things, but once you correct the issues, everything should be more or less normalised across the browsers.</p>

<p>One of the things they do is reset <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>window</code> margins/padding etc. which would possibly fix the issue you're having. </p>
