<p>No, this is normal. On Unix, a running MySQL instance will have two processes, as listed in your example.</p>

<p><code>mysqld</code> is the server binary; <code>mysqld_safe</code> is a launcher script for <code>mysqld</code> (hence it is shown as being run by <code>/bin/sh</code> in your output).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mysqld_safe is the recommended way to
  start a mysqld server on Unix and
  NetWare.  mysqld_safe adds some safety
  features such as restarting the server
  when an error occurs and logging
  runtime information to an error log
  file.</p>
