<p>I was getting same error during zip file upload on <code>S3</code> and finally this worked for me:</p>

<pre><code>zip_data = File.read(zip_file_path)
</code></pre>

<p>means, zip_data will be the object at the zip file path that is located in your tmp directory. </p>

<p>Hope, this will work for you also.</p>
