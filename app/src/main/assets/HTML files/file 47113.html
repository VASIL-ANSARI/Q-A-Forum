<p>you should read this:
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp</a>
it helps you understand how to add buttons into html and if you want to keep trace on the amount of likes that it gets just add some code and variables you can read about that here:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11753778/html-displaying-text-using-variable">HTML displaying text using variable</a>
i think that you would only need to make the button add +1 to a variable and that variable would be the one displaying the amount of likes.
hope it helps.
you should end up having something like this :  jsfiddle.net/YdhTQ/64</p>
