<p>You mention "if folder is present", so you will need to test to see if the folder is there first:</p>

<pre><code>DirectoryInfo dir = new DirectoryInfo(Server.MapPath("~/FolderName"));
if (dir.Exists)
{
    //dir.FullName will get you the path.
    //This is the same things as Server.MapPath("~/FolderName"), but that
    //will return a path even if the folder isn't there.
}
else
{
    //folder doesn't exist.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since you are trying to go outside your project, you can do something like this (depending on your solution structure):</p>

<pre><code>string path = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(Server.MapPath("~"), @"..\OtherProjectName/FolderName")); 
DirectoryInfo dir = new DirectoryInfo(path);
</code></pre>
