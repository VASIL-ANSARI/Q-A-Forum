<p>Your best choice would be to use a calculated field that will generate order id according to your rules.. I'll add an example in a moment..</p>

<pre><code>select
case
  when locationpage = "all" then 10
  when ISNULL(locationarg)  then 20
  ....
  else 50 
end as OrderID,
id, 
title, 
....

FROM ads            

ORDER BY OrderID DSEC
</code></pre>
