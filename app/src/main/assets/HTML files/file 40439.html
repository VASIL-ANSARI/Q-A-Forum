<p>In table 1, you have 2 rows with [opera, 1]. 
In table 2, you have 2 rows with [1, 1].</p>

<pre><code>2 * 2 = 4
</code></pre>

<p>So given your data, 4 is correct, just not what you want.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to find out the number of opera used at different time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That information is entirely contained in table 2.</p>

<pre><code>Select s2.time, count(s2.opera)
From s2
Group by s2.time
</code></pre>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>(If at time 2, no one use opera, it should have a 0 there.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hard. You don't have a time 2 in either table, so SQL has no way of knowing that you want it. (Think about it. If it just decided to give you [2, 0], then why wouldn't it also give you [999999999, 0].)</p>
