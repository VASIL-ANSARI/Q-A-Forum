<p>Yes. If i is declared outside of the for loop it remains in scope after the loop exits. It retains whatever value it had at the point the loop exited.</p>

<p>If you declatred I in the loop:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; 5 ; i++)
{

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then i is undefined after the loop exit.</p>
