<p>I'm certainly no game/graphics expert, so take this with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>A couple things spring to mind.</p>

<p>First, you could pre-render the entire level as one bitmap, then just paint the relevent portion into your picturebox.</p>

<p>Second, the Graphics class has a Transforms property (I may have the name wrong).  You could add a linear transformation to the graphics object so the painting coordinates of your tiles wouldnt change, but the graphics object would slide, or I think the graphics term is "translate" the output en-masse.</p>
