<p>I don't think BoxLayout makes child components fill the container.  From <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/BoxLayout.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â¦ for a vertical layout, BoxLayout attempts to make all components in the column as wide as the widest component.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your JTrees will all be the same width, but that doesn't guarantee they'll be as wide as the container.</p>

<p>Instead, I would use a GridBagLayout:</p>

<pre><code>holder.setLayout(new GridBagLayout());

// etc.

GridBagConstraints gbc = new GridBagConstraints();
gbc.gridwidth = GridBagConstraints.REMAINDER;
gbc.anchor = GridBagConstraints.FIRST_LINE_START;
gbc.fill = GridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL;
gbc.weightx = 1;
holder.add(tree, gbc);
</code></pre>

<p>That will result in the JTrees being vertically centered.  If you want them top-aligned, you should put a GridBagLayout panel inside another panel:</p>

<pre><code>holder.setLayout(new BorderLayout());

JPanel treesPanel = new JPanel(new GridBagLayout());
holder.add(treesPanel, BorderLayout.PAGE_START);

// etc.

GridBagConstraints gbc = new GridBagConstraints();
gbc.gridwidth = GridBagConstraints.REMAINDER;
gbc.anchor = GridBagConstraints.FIRST_LINE_START;
gbc.fill = GridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL;
gbc.weightx = 1;
treesPanel.add(tree, gbc);
</code></pre>
