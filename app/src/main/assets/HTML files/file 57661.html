<p>I think you are essentially on the right track.</p>

<p>Using extensible storage to store the UniqueIds is definitely the way to go, and also using the DMU dynamic model updater functionality to react to changes sounds good.</p>

<p>The one thing that seems to be unclear is the fact the Revit will automatically assign the unique ids to the elements when they are created, and there is nothing you can do to affect that. The unique id is unique and immutable, and you have no control over it.</p>

<p>Therefore, the easiest approach is probably to delete all the previous sketch elements and recreate the entire sketch and all elements defining it from scratch whenever the sketch needs to be modified in any way.</p>
