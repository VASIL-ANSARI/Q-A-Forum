<p>I dont think its a good idea to use the sessions for persistent login. For one because having a different <code>gc_maxlifetime</code> for different session wont work. As <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-maxlifetime" rel="nofollow">the manual</a> states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If different scripts have different values of session.gc_maxlifetime but share the same place for storing the session data then the script with the minimum value will be cleaning the data. In this case, use this directive together with session.save_path. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So unless you also want to change the session storage location, dont go there.</p>

<p>Besides this issue, you are not only keeping his login information alive on the server, but his entire session. If your application stores more data in sessions and you dont clean it up properly, your server ends up with big long lasting sessions that may never be used again. Although storing large amounts of data in sessions is wrong anyway, but that is another discussion.</p>
