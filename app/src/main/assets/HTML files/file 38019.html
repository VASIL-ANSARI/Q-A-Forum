<p>Maybe <code>$('.menu-mlid-487 a')</code> matches two elements? Then when you <code>$('.menu-mlid-487 a').addClass("icon-overview");</code> two elements will have the same class <code>"icon-overview"</code>.</p>

<p>use console.log to output <code>$('.menu-mlid-487 a')</code>.</p>

<p>And yes, like everyone said, you leave us with speculation and guesses because you don't provide enough information. I think if you looked for enough information to ask your question rightly, you would have found the answer yourself :)</p>
