<p>After digging through the Ruby on Rails API docs to trace the execution path for <code>has_one</code>, it's quickly become fairly clear that there is no quick and easy way to prevent the automatic de-camelCasing. With named scopes and one or two custom methods, you should be able to replicate the functionality of <code>has_one</code> fairly easily, so I would suggest foregoing the association for now, and possibly submit that as a ticket on the Rails <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/overview" rel="nofollow">Lighthouse</a>. </p>
