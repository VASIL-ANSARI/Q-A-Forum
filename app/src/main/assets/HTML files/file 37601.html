<p>EDIT: SOLVED</p>

<p>For anyone else who may come across this issue in the future, I'm afraid the best way to do this is to setup some 302 soft re-directs. I personally preferred to use a plugin for this.</p>

<p>The plugin was called "404 redirected" and does the job thus far. It's not the best solution in the world but it's the easiest to implement (should you ever have a client that requires this). </p>

<p>You can use the plugin to setup whatever kind of re-direct you want.</p>

<p>You'll find the re-direct panel in Settings>404 Redirected
Simply add your subdomain with the following extension that you want to add and people who visit that will be redirected to the regular URL</p>

<p>what.php will be re-directed to what/</p>
