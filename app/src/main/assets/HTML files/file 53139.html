<p>This can't be done using chaining, because <code>.on()</code> returns the object it was called on, and that doesn't include the selector that it delegates to.</p>

<p>Instead, you can put the event bindings in an object.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).on({
    mousedown: function() { ... },
    mouseup: function() { ... }
}, '.item');
</code></pre>
