<p>You don't provide a path to Blueprint, and SASS can't find it.</p>

<p>Compass is the tool that was created to address this issue. It provides an ecosystem of extensions that can be imported directly without providing paths.</p>

<p>You're trying to do that with plain SASS. To resolve the issue, you must make SASS familiar of where Compass extensions are stored:
</p>

<pre><code># Allowing vanilla SASS use Compass extensions
Compass.sass_engine_options[:load_paths].each do |path|
  Sass.load_paths &lt;&lt; path
end
</code></pre>
