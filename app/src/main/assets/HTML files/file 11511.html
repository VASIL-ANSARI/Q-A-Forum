<p>You can use LINQ:</p>

<pre><code>var result = input
    .Split(new[] { "\r\n" }, StringSplitOptions.None)
    .Where(x =&gt; !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x))
    .GroupAdjacent((g, x) =&gt; !char.IsDigit(x[0]))
    .Select(g =&gt; new
    {
        Title = g.First().Trim(),
        Body = string.Join(" ", g.Skip(1).Select(x =&gt; x.Trim()))
    })
    .ToArray();
</code></pre>
