<p>One simple way to solve this problem would be to enable the <code>NavigationCacheMode</code> for Page1.</p>

<p>This caches the state of page1 and shows the old state when reopening the page.
Just remember that you cannot empty the cache once the page is initialized. Also the <code>NavigationCacheMode</code> must be set in the constructor of the page.</p>

<pre><code>public Page1()
{
    this.InitializeComponent();
    NavigationCacheMode = NavigationCacheMode.Enabled; // or NavigationCacheMode.Required if you want to ignore caching limits.
    Books = BookManager.GetBooks();
    ts1 = Books.Where(p =&gt; p.bogNa == "Robert").ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>But like Inbar Barkai said, a cleaner solution would be to keep the ViewModel of page1.</p>
