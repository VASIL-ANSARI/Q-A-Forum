<p>I don't think it has anything to do with tags.</p>

<p>I subscribe to receive posts from authenticated users (object=user &amp; aspect=media), nothing hashtag related, and have a similar problem.  Some users I get every post, some users I get none of their posts.</p>

<p>Re-authenticating them doesn't help.</p>

<p>I'm working with limited data, but <em>so far</em> it seems like I'm only receiving updates from the first 10 or so users that connected.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/34931909/345599">this post</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3516614/nithinisreddy">nithinisreddy</a> mentions that the data is being "sampled".  I think this is the reason.</p>
