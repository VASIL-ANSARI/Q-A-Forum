<p>You can't cast it because it's not contravariant- you could reproject it (assuming that all keys and values are castable to <code>int</code>):</p>

<pre><code>var q = GroupedValues.SelectMany(g =&gt; g.Select (gv =&gt; new {Key = (int)g.Key, Item = (int)gv}))
                     .GroupBy (g =&gt; g.Key, g =&gt; g.Item);
</code></pre>

<p>Or change the initial query to case the key and items.</p>
