<p>I quote: <code>new RotateAnimation(0f, 360f, Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF,      0.5f, Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, 0.5f);</code></p>

<p>See the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/animation/RotateAnimation.html" rel="nofollow">docs</a>.</p>

<p>There, you'll see that's because you're trying to rotate by the same amount over more time!</p>

<p>You need to scale up the rotation amount proportionately if you want to the speed to stay the same.</p>
