<p>The top three reasons that i've seen this happen is due to the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>The TCP port is blocked on the application server due to security policy</li>
<li>The TCP port is blocked by firewall or other network device due to security policy</li>
<li>The target SMTP server requires you to "whitelist" your application server to allow the connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>All three cases happens because a company wants to prevent spammers from using their email server has spam delivery systems.</p>

<p>Talk with your support personnel.</p>

<p>hope that helps...</p>
