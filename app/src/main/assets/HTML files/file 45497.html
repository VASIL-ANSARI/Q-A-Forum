<p>To use a service in nopCommerce you have to add an attribute for _vendor service and add it to your constructor to respect dependancy register just like this : </p>

<pre><code>IVendorService _vendor;
public ProductController(IVendorService vendor)
{
    _vendor = vendor ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you can use this service in the Action that you want with _vendor attribute that you will add.</p>

<p>I hope that it help you. Best Regards.</p>
