<p>I've had just the same issue myself and not finding the right tool I've created my own. Using (guess what): Roslyn.</p>

<p>It's open source and it's here: <a href="http://nsdepcop.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow">http://nsdepcop.codeplex.com</a></p>

<p>It works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to define the allowed namespace dependencies in XML files (one file per project).</li>
<li>The tool is integrated into the MSBuild process so it runs every time you build and gives warnings/errors for each source code segment that violates the dependency rules.</li>
<li>If you install the Roslyn End User Preview (for VS2013) then it also integrates into Visual Studio and gives feedback as you type the code (no need to build to get the issues).</li>
</ul>
