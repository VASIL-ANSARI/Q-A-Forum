<p>We use a custom home grown logging util we wrote.  It requires you to implement logging on your own everywhere you need it.  But, it also allows your to capture alot more then just the exception.</p>

<p>For example our code would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Try
  Dim p as New Person()
  p.Name = "Joe"
  p.Age = 30
Catch ex as Exception
  Log.LogException(ex,"Err creating person and assigning name/age")
  Throw ex
End Try
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This way our logger will write all the info we need to a sql db.  We have email alerts set up at the db level to look for certain errors or frequently occurring errrors.  It helps us identify exactly where the errors are coming from.</p>

<p>This might not be exactly what you're looking for.  Another approach similar to using Global.asax is to us a code injection technique like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming" rel="nofollow">AOP</a> with <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/" rel="nofollow">PostSharp</a>.  This allows you to inject custom code at the beginning and end of every method or on every exception.  It' an interesting approach but I believe it may have a heavy performance overhead.</p>
