<p>Unfortunately, the range operators are a bit funny. The range of letters from A-Z is:</p>

<pre><code>AbBcCdDeE...yYzZ
</code></pre>

<p>That is, lower case characters immediately precede their upper case counterpart. This is also fun because if you want to deal with both upper and lower case characters, in a case sensitive collation, the range A-Z excludes lower case a.</p>

<hr>

<p>I should say the above, regarding how the range expands out, is based on the collations I generally work with. How the range actually expands is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms179859.aspx" rel="nofollow">collation dependent</a>. <em>If</em> you can find a collation where, for instance, all upper case characters occur before all lower case characters, then the range would work as you expect. (Possibly one of the binary collations?)</p>
