<p>Make sure that your resource(<code>xml</code> file) is present in the <code>Copy Bundle Resources</code> in <code>Build Phases</code>. If not then go ahead and add the missing resources by clicking <code>+</code> at the bottom. If that is not the problem then check your xml file if it is in proper <code>xml</code> format.</p>
