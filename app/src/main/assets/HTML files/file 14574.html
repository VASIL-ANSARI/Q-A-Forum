<p>The <code>png_info</code> struct was removed from the <code>png.h</code> in 1.5.0 and now you should use this pointer with the <code>png_get_*</code> and <code>png_set_*</code> functions.</p>

<p>As specified in <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng-manual.txt">libpng manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The png_info structure is designed to provide information about the
  PNG file.  At one time, the fields of png_info were intended to be
  directly accessible to the user.  However, this tended to cause
  problems with applications using dynamically loaded libraries, and as
  a result a set of interface functions for png_info (the png_get_*()
  and png_set_*() functions) was developed, and direct access to the
  png_info fields was deprecated..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>png_uint_32 height;
height = png_get_image_height( png_ptr,  info_ptr);
</code></pre>
