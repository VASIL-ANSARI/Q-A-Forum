<p>MySQL client mysql.exe takes SQL commands using the param <code>-e</code></p>

<p>Command should look like this</p>

<pre><code>mysql -uroot -e"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'myusername'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword' WITH GRANT OPTION"
</code></pre>

<p>Also don't forget to set a root password</p>
