<p>Most ASP.NET developers would <strong>not</strong> consider this debugging, since you were not using the Debug command <kbd>F5</kbd> to debug server-side code (usually C# or VB.NET code).

<p>What you refer to as green squiggly lines are actually warnings about your HTML. In this case the background attribute for tables is not a part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.1" rel="nofollow">official HTML specification</a> and this is what Visual Web Developer Express was warning you about. Consequently, you <strong>did not</strong> make your code <em>compatible with the ASP.NET 4.0 Framework</em>, but you <strong>did</strong> make your markup HTML-compliant.</p>
