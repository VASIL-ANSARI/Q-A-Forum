<p>Set android:layout_gravity to center_vertical on your text views.</p>

<p>Basically, since your layout_height is set to wrap content, your text views look like this:</p>

<pre><code>-------
content
-------
</code></pre>

<p>The text view aligns with its parent like so:</p>

<pre><code>-------
-------
content
-------




-------
</code></pre>

<p>Your goal is to get the view to center itself within the parent vertically. The attribute "layout_gravity" tells the view how to adjust itself within its parent. Therefore, setting layout_gravity to center_vertical will tell the view to be centered within its parent, like so:</p>

<pre><code>-------


-------
content
-------


-------
</code></pre>

<p>Another way this can be accomplished is with the "gravity" attribute. The "gravity" attribute tells a parent how to layout its content (as opposed to "layout_gravity", which defines tells the view how to sit within its parent). So another possible solution would be to tell the list view to align all of its content centered vertically. This is done by specifying android:gravity="center_vertical" on the ViewGroup (in your case the LinearLayout).</p>
