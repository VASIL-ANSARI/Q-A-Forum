<p>You may simply use LocalBroadcastManager.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Helper to register for and send broadcasts of Intents to local objects
  within your process. This is has a number of advantages over sending
  global broadcasts with sendBroadcast(Intent):</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>You know that the data you are broadcasting won't leave your app, so
  don't need to worry about leaking private data. </li>
  <li>It is not possible for
  other applications to send these broadcasts to your app, so you don't
  need to worry about having security holes they can exploit. </li>
  <li>It is more
  efficient than sending a global broadcast through the system.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(YOUR_ACTION_NAME);
intent.putExtra("PushType", "test");            
LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(context).sendBroadcast(intent);
</code></pre>

<p>Write a receiver in your activity that handles action "YOUR_ACTION_NAME"</p>

<pre><code>public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).registerReceiver(
            messageReceiver, new IntentFilter("YOUR_ACTION_NAME"));
}


private BroadcastReceiver messageReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {

    }
};
</code></pre>
