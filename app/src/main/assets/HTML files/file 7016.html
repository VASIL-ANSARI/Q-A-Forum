<p><code>ASSERT</code> and <code>ALERT</code> are NOT the same thing.</p>

<p>I don't think the <code>alert</code> call is the real issue here. <code>alert</code> only prints/displays the first value -> in your case <code>alert( multimax(3, 1,2,3) == 9, "Whatever")</code> has a first parameter of <code>multimax(3,1,2,3)==9</code>, which as we can all see is <code>true</code>. So that is why you get <code>true</code> as opposed to "3*3 == 9".</p>
