<p>No, because this isn't really anything to do with the function; the error is coming from attempting to de-reference a non-existent array key. You can change the warning level of your PHP setup to surpress these errors, but you're better off just not doing this.</p>

<p>Having said that, you <em>could</em> do something like</p>

<pre><code>function safeLookup($array, $key)
{
  if (isset($array, $key))
    return $array[$key];

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And use it in place of array key lookup</p>

<pre><code>defaultValue(safeLookup($foo, "bar"), "baz);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I need to take a shower :)</p>
