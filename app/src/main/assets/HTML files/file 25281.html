  <p>I want to know if firing and handling events could be more cache-friendly than overriding methods when working with classes in C#</p>

<p>In general, no.  Events are going to require calling out to a separate class instance, which is going to be in a separate memory location.  This is going to have the same (or likely even worse) cache issues than virtual method calls.</p>

  <p>or there is any better strategy than both approaches?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, idiomatic C# tends to be non-cache friendly.  In order to write cache friendly C# code, you typically want to use <code>struct</code> over <code>class</code>, avoid virtual methods, avoid events, avoid delegates (at least ones with closures), etc.  Rico Mariani had a nice <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ricom/archive/2006/08/31/733887.aspx" rel="nofollow">blog post on Value based programming</a> which discusses many of these issues in detail.</p>
