<p>There is no such thing as method/function overriding in javascript. Whichever function is defined last takes precedence. You could split the logic into different functions but you would need some sort of main function that decides which one to use.</p>

<p>Javascript does have <code>switch</code> statements though, so that might be a good fit for your problem. It would be a little neater than a large if/else block. Something like the following might work.</p>

<pre><code>function test(el){
  switch(el.value){
  case 1:
    alert('option 1 selected');
    break;
  case 2:
    alert('Option 2 selected');
    break;
  default:
    alert('Another option was selected');
  }
}
</code></pre>
