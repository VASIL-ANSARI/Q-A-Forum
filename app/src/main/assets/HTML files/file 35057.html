<p>It looks like you are attempting to rotate around the Y axis, which is a 3D transformation.  Unfortunately, <code>progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage</code> (And <code>progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix</code> for that matter) do not support 3D transformations.  </p>

<p>Your code should work in IE 10 and above, but you may need to add an additional css line in your step function for "<code>-ms-transform</code>".</p>

<p>I wish I could link to documentation regarding 3D transformations in IE but I have found very little of it myself.</p>
