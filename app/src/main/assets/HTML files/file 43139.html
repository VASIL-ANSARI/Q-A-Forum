<p>Try this, May be it would help, let me know, if it does. </p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.updated, COUNT( * ) count
FROM v2_subscription a 
inner join v2_subscription b 
on a.ss_id = max(b.ss_id)
GROUP BY b.uid, b.card_id
</code></pre>

<p>Or perhaps this</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.updated, COUNT( * ) count
    FROM v2_subscription a 
    inner join v2_subscription b 
    on a.ss_id = (SELECT MAX(b.ss_id) b.ss_id FROM v2_subscription b GROUP BY b.uid, b.card_id)
</code></pre>
