<p>The second parameter in the substring method isn't the number of characters you want it is the index you want to go to. So right now you are going from substring(3-2, 2), index 2 to index 2, which gives you no characters.</p>

<p>Change it to:</p>

<pre><code>timeString.substring(timeString.length-2, timeString.length)
</code></pre>
