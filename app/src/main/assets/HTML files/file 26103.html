<p>There is a popular gem called <a href="https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf" rel="nofollow">WickedPDF</a> which internally uses shell utility <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf" rel="nofollow">WkHtmlToPDF</a>. </p>

<p>If you refer to the wiki, while rendering PDF, if you specify</p>

<pre><code>   :disable_javascript=&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>that should help you out. Let us know, if it helped you or you need something else. Btw, are you using some charts/graphs in your PDF?</p>
