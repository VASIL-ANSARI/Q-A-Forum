<p>My approach to this would be to have the all the models that you want to use with this helper implement an interface that defines their common properties.  The ViewData property on the HtmlHelper object has a Model property (of type <code>object</code>).  Inside your helper, you can cast this as the interface type.  Assuming that it is non-null at that point, i.e., actually not null and of the correct type, you can then use the common properties.</p>

<pre><code>public static string CustomerHelper( this HtmlHelper helper, ... )
{
    var model = helper.ViewData.Model as ISessionModel;

    var sessionKey = model.SessionKey;

    ...
}
</code></pre>
