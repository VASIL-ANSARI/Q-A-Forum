<p>Use Counter from "collections". It works with any iterable, not just lists.</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Counter

pixels = pixels_g(img)
c = Counter(pixels)

print c[4]
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to reuse the contents of 'pixels' generator instance after running it through Counter, use 'tee' from itertools:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Counter
from itertools import tee

(pixels, hist) = tee(pixels_g(img))
c = Counter(pixels)
# can use hist for something else
</code></pre>
