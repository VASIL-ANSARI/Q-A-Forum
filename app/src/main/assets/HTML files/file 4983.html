<p>I think you've implemented a <strong><em>cloning smart pointer</em></strong> on top of <code>std::auto_ptr</code>. I'm not sure this is worth the hassle, as you're not very far from implementing one on top of a dumb pointer. </p>

<p>But as far as I see there's no error in this. (Of course, saying so will make someone point out an obvious flaw 5mins after I post this...) </p>
