<p>If safety of your persistent objects is of high importance in your project, using <code>shelve</code> is not a good idea. Neither is pickling objects and manually writing them into files.</p>

<p>Consider that real databases invest huge resources (brainpower and code) to be safe in case of failures. So keep your data in a real DB. The simplest would be <code>sqlite</code>, as it comes bundled with Python. <code>sqlite</code> is quite safe and has a lot of smarts in it about keeping your data in some valid state even in case of system failures (like when someone trips on your PC's power cable).</p>
