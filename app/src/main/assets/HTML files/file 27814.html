<p>The GPS is per default unfortunately not very reliable, but should be accurate down to 5-10 meters in outdoor environments; it's even worse indoors as you probably imagine. A lot of people have reported, that they are not even able to receive coordinates in indoor environments.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the GPS accuracy furthermore depends on both the smartphone at hand and weather conditions, so there is really no specific way of determining the exact accuracy.</p>

<p>So my best guess is, that it is simply not possible to obtain better results than you currently receive. </p>

<p>Sorry (I guess)</p>
