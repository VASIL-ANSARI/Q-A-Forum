<p>If you comment the line, <code>Object o1 = ois.readObject();</code>, and you execute your program, <code>n2</code> is not reading an <code>int</code>, instead it's reading 4 characters from the Serialized Object. Yes, you can get a negative value, depending on how the object were serialized (e.g. the endianness of the object stored, which, if memory serves me correctly, are stored in Big-Endian).</p>
