<p>this is because libraries are not in the correct place...please check in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file of the principal jar file and see where are pointing the dependences jar files ..
normally i see that is pointing to the same place of the jar file so copy all dependents jar in same place of main jar file and try </p>

<p>hope this helps </p>
