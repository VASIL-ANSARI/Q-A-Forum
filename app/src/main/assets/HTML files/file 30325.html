<p>I just tested and the value of <code>result</code> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{"Forename":"forename","Surname":"surname","Guid":"abcdefghijk","Id":0}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which will naturally fail against your expected string of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"{{\"Forename\":\"forename\",\"Surname\":\"surname\",\"Guid\":\"abcdefghijk\"}}"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using double curly braces is an escape sequence only for format strings used in the <code>String.Format</code> method so that you may include a <em>single</em> brace. From  the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/txafckwd%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Composite Formatting MSDN page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opening and closing braces are interpreted as starting and ending a
  format item. Consequently, you must use an escape sequence to display
  a literal opening brace or closing brace. Specify two opening braces
  ("{{") in the fixed text to display one opening brace ("{"), or two
  closing braces ("}}") to display one closing brace ("}").</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you aren't using <code>String.Format</code>, then the double brace will be interpreted literally as two braces as per the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa691090%28v=vs.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">C# Specification 2.4.4.5</a> since it is not an escape character for string literals.</p>

<p>The resultant error message is confusing. I'm not sure if this is because how the debugger is reporting it to the GUI, or an error with how they are formatting their error message (perhaps they are overly aggressive escaping braces for output), or what.</p>

<p>If you change your test to be:</p>

<pre><code>result.Should().Be(
        "{\"Forename\":\"forename\",\"Surname\":\"surname\",\"Guid\":\"abcdefghijk\"}"
        );
</code></pre>

<p>Then it will pass I suspect. This is backed up by your additional test using the <code>String.Format</code> call which changes your double braces to single braces. Now, if you intended to have double wrapping braces around your JSON, that's another issue entirely, but I suspect that that isn't your intent.</p>
