<p>Do you have the home controller setup in your main application? The reason lies in the <strong>_header.html.erb</strong> file where you are using the link to index action of home controller.</p>

<p>I guess you are using the main application's layout/template to render the engine's view. And the <strong>_header.html.erb</strong> is also part of the template that is rendering the engine's view.</p>

<p>The mountable Engines in rails work in a way that if you want to access the route of main application's controller/action you need to call in on <strong>main_app</strong>. So you can change the <strong>link_to</strong> line to look something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= link_to "Knowledge Thief", main_app.home_path %&gt; 
</code></pre>
