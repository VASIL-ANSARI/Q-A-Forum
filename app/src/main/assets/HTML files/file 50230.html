<p>First of all, you are misusing <code>playerhand</code> inside the loop.  Given the loop expression <code>for i in playerhand</code>, <code>i</code> represents a single element of the list.  So inside the loop, you should be using <code>i</code> instead of <code>playerhand</code> to refer to the current element.  <code>playerhand</code> still refers to the entire list.</p>

<p>With that change, the solution you have of calling <code>int()</code> may work fine.  A better overall solution would be using a dictionary as already suggested in a comment, but given that this is a lab assignment, it may be intended for you to use only certain data structures.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to have a list that contains all the possible strings, and a second list of the same length that contains the corresponding scores.  Find a given string in the first list, then find the element of the second list at the same position, and that is the score.</p>
