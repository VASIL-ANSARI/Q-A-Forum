<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; (float &amp;)a &lt;&lt;endl;
cout &lt;&lt; (int &amp;)a &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p>The first one treats the bits in a like it's a float.  The second one treats the bits in a like it's an int.  The bits for float 1.0 just happen to be the bits for integer 1065353216.</p>

<p>It's basically the equivalent of:</p>

<pre><code>float a = 1.0;
int* b = (int*) &amp;a;
cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; *b &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p><code>(int &amp;) a</code> casts a to a reference to an integer.  In other words, an integer reference to a.  (Which, as I said, treats the contents of a as an integer.)</p>

<p>Edit: I'm looking around now to see if this is valid.  I suspect that it's not.  It's depends on the type being less than or equal to the actual size. </p>
