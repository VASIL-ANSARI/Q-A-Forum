<p><strong>Can I use IBOutlet and IBAction in the same tableViewCell?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can use.</p>

<p><strong>Is it good practice to have IBOutlet and IBAction of the same button in a tableviewcell?</strong></p>

<p>According to my opinion if you use IBAction in <code>UIViewController</code> that would be better as compare to <code>UITableViewCell</code> because if you want to perform something on event on data (that defined in <code>ViewController</code>) in that case you can perform easly don't need to manage it globally that data, but if you want perform something on event in cell in that case you need to manage that data either globally or with delegate. </p>
