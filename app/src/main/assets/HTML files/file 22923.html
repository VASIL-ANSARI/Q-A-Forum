<p>I think I found the reason that cause that multiple class. When I use RadGrid, what it does is</p>

<ul>
<li>It calls all of the data to display field</li>
<li>It calls it again to find out paging counts then</li>
<li>It calls it again for filtering and such</li>
</ul>

<p>on the other hand, when I use GridView and pass the datasource I can make one call to DB to get the same result.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
