<p>As far as Im aware there is no reason you cannot , If there is a css/js file that is auto generated and I am not using it then i delete it. Sometimes I get files like this generated folders.css.scss, dont use it so i get rid of it.</p>

<p>As for the helper files then again, if you don't use then you can remove.</p>

<p>This is all in my opinion and experience and of course if anyone has a different view then please share</p>
