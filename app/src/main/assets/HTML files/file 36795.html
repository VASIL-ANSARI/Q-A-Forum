<p>There's a way, indeed, and it involves calling <code>toString</code> on a function:</p>

<pre><code>var source = eatItems.toString();
// =&gt; "function eatItems(cherry, apple) { }"
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to parse the string you've got to get the names of the arguments:</p>

<pre><code>var args = source.substring(source.indexOf("(") + 1, source.indexOf(")")),
    argNames = /\S/.test(args) ? args.split(/\s*,\s*/) : [];
</code></pre>

<p>A few caveats:</p>

<ol>
<li>This solution has been kept quite simple. It doesn't handle comments in the function definition.</li>
<li>Not every browser can correctly convert a function to a string (the PS3 browser comes to my mind), but they're a really small minority anyway.</li>
<li>I haven't tested it, but there may be some performance issues on slower machines and/or older browsers with large functions.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, overall, this solution is more like an exercise. I wouldn't recommend taking this pattern in Javascript. Don't forget that some functions handle a variable number of arguments, and you won't find them listed in their definition. Rethink your code, and find a better way.</p>
