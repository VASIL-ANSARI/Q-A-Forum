<p>WCF REST caching is done by ASP.NET caching module which is registered to handle <code>HttpApplication.ResolveRequestCache</code> and <code>HttpApplication.UpdateRequestCache</code> event. You just need to handle event before <code>ResolveRequestCache</code> (most suitable would be <code>BeginRequest</code>) and access request directly in <code>HttpContext.Current.Request</code> (you can use <code>InputStream</code> property to read pure HTTP request). These events are typically handled in Global.asax file.</p>

<p>Be aware that caching can happen on multiple levels - client can have data in its own cache, proxy server can cache data, etc. so not necessarily all request which use cached response will hit your server. You can control where the data can be cached by setting <code>Location</code> in cache profile.</p>
