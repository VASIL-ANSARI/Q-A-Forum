<p>If it is about how you can prepare array in required format before passing it to <code>treeOut()</code> function then try adding these line before calling <code>treeOut()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$tree = array();

$sql = "SELECT * FROM tbl_name ORDER BY companyName ASC, projectName ASC, phaseName ASC";
$result = mysql_query($connection, $sql);

while($data = mysql_fetch_array($result)){
    $tree[ $data['companyName'] ][ $data['projectName'] ][] = $data['phaseName'];
}

echo treeOut($tree);
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this is what you're looking for and will help.</p>
