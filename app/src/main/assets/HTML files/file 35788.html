<p>First of all- this view can be achieved not only on iphone- but on desktop too if you resize browser window to size that small enough.<br>
If you'll look at you page's source code in menu sections - you'll notice something like this:<br></p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class="sf-menu sf-vertical"&gt;...&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;script&gt;    
  jQuery(function(){
    jQuery('.sf-menu').mobileMenu({
    defaultText: 'Navigate to...',
    className: 'select-menu',
    subMenuClass: 'sub-menu'
    });
  })
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This code is under EVERY menu (you have two) - so basically script here is looking for element with <strong>sf-menu</strong> class and make moile select menu from it.<br>
Simple maths - you have two menus, and in <strong>every</strong> menu you have this code - so code looks <strong>twice</strong>  through your code instead of single one.<br>
Solution: <br>
1. You need to override Joomla superfish menu module code, with your own - just delete from there ..., good article <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/How_to_override_the_output_from_the_Joomla!_core" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>
2. You need to add code from previous step ... to either your template file or in the end of your template JS file.</p>
