<p>The <code>obstacle</code> variable does not hold an object of type <code>Obstacle</code>. Instead it holds an object of type <code>CCNode</code>. <code>CCNode</code> does not have a method named <code>-setUpRandomPosition</code>, so you get a runtime error. In Objective-C, casting is a no-op. It doesn't do anything except helping the reader of your code see the intent of the person who wrote the code.</p>

<p>In this regard Objective-C differs from languages like C++ or Java. Objective-C has an object system that is similar to the programming language "Smalltalk".</p>
