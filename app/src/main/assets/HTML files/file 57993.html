<p><strong>The purpose of this answer is not to provide a ready chunk of code but rather the instructions for you to create the script that you need.</strong></p>

<p>What you could do is:</p>

<p>Loop through the string using the <code>charAt(int index)</code> function until you find the space <strong><code>*</code></strong> . When you do, you can use the <code>substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)</code> function to get the first word and then the <code>substring(int beginIndex)</code> function to get the second word. If you do not want to use <code>substring()</code> then you could just add each character as you go through the loop.</p>

<p>When you get both strings you just need to set the <code>String output</code> to the second <code>String</code>, add a space and then add the first <code>String</code>.</p>

<p><strong><code>*</code></strong>
The ascii value for space is 32, you do not need to know this but it is better practice in my opinion to have a field called space instead of using <code>" "</code> all the time.</p>
