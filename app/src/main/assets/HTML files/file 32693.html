<p>Yes.</p>

<p>You can use Bloom filters (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter</a>) or create a tree-based index for the keys of your Array, such as a Trie (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie</a>)</p>

<p>Basically you'd need a data structure to look for the values, and not for the keys. It would not cost much space or speed since you could re-use the references of the value objects on both data structures (yours and the one you elect)</p>
