<p>When your are dropping the files manually in xcode the files are not copied to Bundle. So "SKStoreProductViewController.m" was the file not copied in the bundle so the error occurred. To resolve the error. Drag the files only .m files to <code>Copy Bundle Resource</code>as shown in the image<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/EnJS9.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
