<p><a href="http://php.net/ob_flush" rel="nofollow"><code>ob_flush</code></a> stands in your way, see the linked description on the manual page, it is pretty clear about that: It flushes the buffer so outputs it.</p>

<p>You do not want that. Remove the calls to it and you should be fine.</p>

<pre><code>ob_start();

... your script without "ob_flush()" ...

$buffer = ob_get_clean();  # finally get the output buffer as string
echo $buffer;              # pass output along for cron
cronMail('Cron', $buffer); # send your mail
</code></pre>

<p>This variant ensures that you get your own email but also the output is passed along to cron. This can be useful if you do some error reporting in the <code>cronMail</code> function, so that at least there is some way to further debug that.</p>

<p>Another alternative is to register an output handling function that stores the output on the go. But that is less trivial so I keep it out.</p>
