<p>EDIT: Hmm, after i posted saw the error was not what I beleived it was, guess I'm wrong then.</p>

<p>I may be completely wrong due to the formatting of the iframe but from looking at it for a minute or two it appears you are missing a &amp;quot.
 Here is the line in question, i cut alot of it off to be easier to read</p>

<pre><code>var widgetReplace = "&lt;iframe src=&amp;quothttp://localhost:5000/app/#/widget" + id + "?height="
</code></pre>

<p>After the id or ? I believe should be the end quote to complete the src. E.G.</p>

<pre><code>"&lt;iframe src=&amp;quothttp://localhost:5000/app/#/widget" + id + "?&amp;quotheight="
</code></pre>

<p>Of course depending on the fromatting the &amp;quot could be in a different place, I have no way to know.</p>
