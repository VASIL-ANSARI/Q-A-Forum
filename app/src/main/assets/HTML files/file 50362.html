<p>The difference is that without <code>:</code> you a <em>name</em>, whereas with <code>:</code>, a path is used. The same applies to tasks, so please have a look <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/more_about_tasks.html#N10C50" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>When you refer to projects/tasks on the first level there's no difference if you use <code>:</code> or not. But if you need to invoke - from root of the project - a task that is defined several levels lower you need to provide the full path. That's all.</p>
