<p>You should not rely on webdrivers <code>getPageSource()</code> method.</p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>getPageSource</p>
  
  <p>java.lang.String getPageSource()</p>
  
  <p>Get the source of the last loaded page. If the page has been modified
  after loading (for example, by Javascript) there is no guarantee that
  the returned text is that of the modified page. Please consult the
  documentation of the particular driver being used to determine whether
  the returned text reflects the current state of the page or the text
  last sent by the web server. The page source returned is a
  representation of the underlying DOM: do not expect it to be formatted
  or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server.
  Think of it as an artist's impression.</p>
  
  <p>Returns: The source of the current page</p>
