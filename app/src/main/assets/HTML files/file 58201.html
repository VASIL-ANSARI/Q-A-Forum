<p><em>To achieve this I would suggest you to re-structure your database. Avoid too much nesting and post the chat rooms/chat requests like this:</em>  </p>

<p>So here you see two chat rooms under unique ids generated by <strong>.push()</strong> at the time of posting request. With one unique identifier for request with key <strong>uniqueCharacter</strong>. </p>

<pre><code>{
      "-HFSSFG5647DDHD" : {
        "name" : "Some Name",
        "someOtherinfo" : "test",
        "timestamp" : 12443567,
        "uniqueCharacter" : "Request2"
      },
      "-YYTH6637FRFSHt5" : {
        "name" : "Some other name",
        "someOtherinfo" : "test",
        "timestamp" : 12443567,
        "uniqueCharacter" : "Request3"
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now the other user sees both these requests and once he clicks on some <strong><em>you get the unique id generated at the time of pushing and create a separate chat room for that particular push id using filters like this:</em></strong></p>

<p>If user selected <strong><em>request3</em></strong> then your database ref will be:</p>

<pre><code>databaseRef.orderByChild("uniqueCharacter").equalTo("Request3");
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>This will give you access to that particular push id which you can share among all those who chose this and create a common chat room with same id for all of them.</em></strong></p>

<p>Hope you get the basic idea here on achieving what you want. </p>

<p><em>This is not a production example but just a basic one to give you an idea about better way of achieving your goal.</em></p>
