<p>Your problem is the use of <code>contain</code> in your background definition. This keeps the size of the image as big as the body, and the body is staying at full size.</p>

<p>Try using repeat-x instead of no-repeat, and set width part of the background-size to the same value as the width the header element has.</p>

<p>That should make it scale to match, unless I'm missing something.</p>
