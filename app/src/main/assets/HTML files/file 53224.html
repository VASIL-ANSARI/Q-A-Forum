<pre><code>proc_open( 'less huge-file.txt', array( STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR), $pipes);
</code></pre>

<p>This calls the command and passes all controls etc. through, so that there is no distinction to a normal <code>less huge-file.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Still a bit clunky but a lot shorter compared to other examples I could find. </p>
