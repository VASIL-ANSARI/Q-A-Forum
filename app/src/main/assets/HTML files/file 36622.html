<p>SWIG-python isn't going to work - it generates CPython extensions, and IronPython doesn't support those.</p>

<p>Ultimately you'll need to wrap the C++ so that it's accessible from .NET. I think you can use SWIG to generate C# wrappers, which you could then import into IronPython. Otherwise, you might be able to compile with the C++/CLI compiler to generate a .NET assembly directly, which can also be used from IronPython.</p>
