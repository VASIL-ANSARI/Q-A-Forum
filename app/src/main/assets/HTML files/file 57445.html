<p>Official docs: "The exception that is thrown when a call is made to the Abort method." If you are completely sure there are no calls to Thread.Abort then you might as well erase those catch blocks.</p>

<p>EDIT: Be mindful that your code may be running in the context of an external app that may call Thread.Abort on your threads.</p>

<p>Not that it matters anyway as a ThreadAbortException can't really be handled as the CLR itself will rethrow it to actually kill the thread ASAP.</p>

<p>"Actually yes, a ThreadAbortException is special. Even if you handle it, it will be automatically re-thrown by the CLR at the end of the try/catch/finally. (As noted in the comments, it can be suppressed with ResetAbort but by that point the code smells like rotten fish.)"
