<p>If the structure of the Javascript is extremely predictable (which I assume because it is possible for you to use string concatenation), you might be able to use a text templating language such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=nvelocity" rel="nofollow">NVelocity</a> or <a href="http://www.dotliquidmarkup.org/" rel="nofollow">DotLiquid</a>.  If it is completely unpredictable, you might need to generate a full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" rel="nofollow">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, and generate the code from that.</p>
