<p>This behaviour could come if you use implicit injection, instead of explicit declaring your dependencies. In my experience I faced this kind of problem with particular kind of Angular.js services that return instantiable class (for example to create abstract controller Classes or some other particular cases).</p>

<p>For example: <a href="https://github.com/williamverdolini/discitur-web/blob/master/app/modules/main/DisciturBaseCtrl.js#L53" rel="nofollow">AbstractBaseControllerClass</a></p>

<p>During minification I had the same problem. I solved using internal declaration of dependency injection.
Hope this helps</p>
