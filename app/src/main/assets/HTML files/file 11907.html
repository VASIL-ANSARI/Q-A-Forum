<p>I typically would not respond to such a poor question but I assume you are looking to access multiple variables from the same table based on a URL ID. Your code above technically could work though very bad practice. You would also need to actually execute the sql statements you have created. You are creating variables from within statements, not the results of those statements.</p>

<p>First off, you open yourself up to SQL Injection directly. I would recommend learning about SQL Injection as well as PHP Data Objects.</p>

<p>You may not have an understanding of PHP or MySQL at all based on the way this question is worded and code is shown so starting at step one is best here I think.</p>
