<li><p>It is a "runtime exception" in the (fatuous) sense that it is an exception that occurs at runtime.  But that is true for <em>all</em> Java exceptions ... apart from bugs in the compiler, etcetera.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not a subclass of <code>RuntimeException</code>.  You have declared it as a subclass of <code>Exception</code> and <code>Exception</code> is not a subclass of <code>RuntimeException</code>.  (In fact, the reverse is true:  <code>RuntimeException</code> is a subclass of <code>Exception</code>!)</p></li>
<li><p>It is a <em>checked</em> exception because it is not a subclass of <code>RuntimeException</code> (or <code>Error</code>).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Since it is a checked exception, the Java rules about checked exceptions apply.  For example, any method that throws or propagates<sup>1</sup> your exception must declare that it <code>throws</code> this exception, or an exception that is a superclass of this exception.</p>

<p><sup>1 - Technically, the JLS describes this as an <em>abnormal termination</em> of the method body with this exception as the abnormal termination <em>reason</em>.</sup></p>
