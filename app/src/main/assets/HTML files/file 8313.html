<p>the short answer: no. A tad longer answer: no unless you change code in the framework. The autotest is an Ant task that sets the server and triggers the testing, but it's not using the  ant task, so it won't detect (by default) your 'normal' unit tests.</p>

<p>You have two options: either you add an extra task to the Ant file of Play to run unit tests via the  task (you will need to include the relevant jars too) or you edit the code used to launch the Play test environment. </p>

<p>Both imply changing the framework to a certain level. Although giving that you are using Play, I wonder why you should not have all your tests follow the Play pattern...</p>
