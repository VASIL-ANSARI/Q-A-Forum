<p>In your implementation of <code>ListCellRenderer</code> you're relying on the <code>getGraphics()</code> of the label. Sometimes, <code>getGraphics()</code> is <code>null</code> which is OK, but you're not entering the <code>if(this.getGraphics() != null)</code> condition and simply returning the unmodified string. That is why you get inconsistent results. Commenting out this condition solved the problem in the posted code. You should not rely on <code>getGraphics()</code> its value is out of your control.  </p>
