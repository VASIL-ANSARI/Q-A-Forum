<p>You have a problem because <code>NULL</code>s do not match by default.  But, you can make them match.  Let me assume the first is <code>t1</code> and the second <code>t2</code></p>

<pre><code>select t2.type, t1.count, t2.count
from t2 left join
     t1
     on t2.type = t1.type or (t2.type is null and t1.type is null);
</code></pre>
