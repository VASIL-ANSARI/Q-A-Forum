<p>No not really, you need to include the @login_required decorator on the views that you want the user to be authenticated, for eg.</p>

<pre><code># views.py

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.http import HttpResponse

@login_required
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse('Only registers will see this page')

# now you can add the stuff that you would want only the registered users to view, 
# so basically if a new visitors tries to visit your site say at www.abc.com, he will first be redirected to the www.abc.com/login/ where he needs to create an account, once authenticated, he will then be redirected to the index page
</code></pre>
