<p>Your FROM clause is somehow pretty mangled up:</p>

<pre><code>FROM (M_USER_LEAVES UL 
       INNER JOIN M_LEADERLED MLL ON MLL.LED_ID = MUD.PK_ID 
       WHERE MLL.LEADER_ID = 'XXXX" 
       LEFT JOIN M_USER_DETAILS UD ON UD.PK_ID = UL.FK_LEAVE_REQUESTER) 
</code></pre>

<p>You have an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, then a <code>WHERE</code> clause, followed by a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> .... this seems pretty odd..... what exactly are you trying to do here?? Why do you need to put this into a subquery - can't you just <code>INNER JOIN</code> and <code>LEFT JOIN</code> those tables into a single statement and define the necessary <code>WHERE</code> constraints?</p>

<p>Also, your <code>WHERE</code> clause in here gets an opening single quote and a closing double quote - that won't work ......</p>

<pre><code>WHERE MLL.LEADER_ID = 'XXXX" 
                     ***   ***
</code></pre>

<p>You need to get your SQL query working in SQL Server Management Studio first - then transfer it into your C# code. </p>
