<p>I managed to solve my business need on this, but not in the fashion I described above. Instead of accessing the list of objects, I now pass my DAO object into the Converter (by passing it into the ConversionService and passing it as a constructor argument to to the Converter itself), and use the DAO to retrieve the object from the database.</p>

<p>This is not an ideal solution, as it hit the D/B more often than I'd like, but it works.</p>
