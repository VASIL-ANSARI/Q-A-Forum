<p>If you intend to remove the elements that statisfy the predicate, then erase-remove idiom is the simplest solution.</p>

<p>If you intend to copy such elements, then <code>std::copy_if</code> is the simplest solution.</p>

<p>If you intend to end up with two partitions of the container i.e. one container has the good ones and another the bad ones, then <code>std::partition_copy</code> is a good choice.</p>

<p>For generally allowing the iteration of such elements, an efficient solution is returning a range of such iterators that will check the predicate while iterating. I don't think there are such iterators in the standard library, so you'll need to implement them yourself. Luckily boost already has done that for you: <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/iterator/doc/filter_iterator.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/iterator/doc/filter_iterator.html</a></p>
