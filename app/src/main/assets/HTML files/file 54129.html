<p>With a regular Cordova workflow you shouldn't be making any changes within the platforms directory. The platforms and plugins folders should be considered build artifacts and not checked in to source control. Cordova will automatically recreate them when needed.</p>

<p>When you run <code>cordova prepare</code> it will install all of the plugins you have listed in config.xml and copy the content of your root www folder to the platform www folder.</p>
