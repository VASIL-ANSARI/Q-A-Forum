<p>I don't think there is an official list for these terms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the newer versions of the Android market client don't set this referrer string anymore. They do still set any specific user-generated string (market://details?id=PKGNAME&amp;referrer=my_referrer), but none of the 'organic' search or browse strings anymore.
I hope this is a bug, as it was very valuable information for developers on how people discover your app, but only people from Google know whether this is the case.</p>

<p>EDIT: I filed an issue at the Android bugtracker for this: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=24119" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=24119</a>
Star that issue if you want to keep up to date whether this feature will be brought back.</p>
