<p>You seem to use Priority backwards. Lower numbers actually have higher priority. So it looks okay to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default all jobs are scheduled with
  priority = 0, which is top priority.
  You can change this by setting
  Delayed::Worker.default_priority to
  something else. Lower numbers have
  higher priority.</p>
