<p><code>extern</code> is exactly what you want in the header file, but it needs to be lowercase E. Your terminology isn't quite right - your header file needs a <em>declaration</em> whilst exactly one (thanks to the "One definition rule") .cpp file wants a <em>definition</em>.</p>

<p>E.g. in the header file:</p>

<pre><code>//globals.h
extern cGameState *currentState; // declare currentState
</code></pre>

<p>and in the .cpp file:</p>

<pre><code>// this makes the compiler check the types match
#include "globals.h" 
//globals.cpp
//Game state object
cGameState *currentState = NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>Personally though I'd look to avoid having lots of global state in your application.</p>
