<p>It would help to see how your class looks, but if it has methods from <code>multiprocessing</code> you may have issues just pickling it by default. Multiprocessing objects can use locks as well, and these are (obviously) unpickle-able.</p>

<p>You can customize pickling with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/pickle.html?highlight=pickle#object.__getstate__" rel="nofollow"><code>__getstate__</code></a> method, or <code>__reduce__</code> (documented in the same place).</p>
