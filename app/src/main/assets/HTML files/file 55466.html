<p>You have got to completely redo your layout approach. A quick fix for a site that is completely build the way you describe is to add a viewport with a fixed width to remove 'responsiveness':</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=1200"&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>PS. You can replace 1200 with any width at which things still look OK.</p>
