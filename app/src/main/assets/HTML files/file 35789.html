<p>Problem is you use one dropdown mechanism in another dropdown mechanism (that works the same way).<br>
You need to get your hands dirty to make this work.<br>
First of all you submenu is showing on hover (which is not good as you know) instead of opening on click (delete CSS rule(s) which responsible for that).<br>
If menu still dont work well, then write use jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/click/" rel="nofollow">click method</a> for <strong>.dropdown-submenu .dropdown-toggle</strong> class. Inside method type something like this:</p>

<pre><code>e.preventDefault();
$(this).closest('.dropdown-submenu').children('.dropdown-menu').toggleClass('opened');
</code></pre>

<p>add to CSS something like this:</p>

<pre><code>.dropdown-menu.opened {display: block;}
</code></pre>
