<p>Well it looks like the php router solution is the best.  Thanks to @prodigitalson for the heads up.</p>

<p>Here is the simplified .htaccess I am now using</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On

# Disable rewriting for existing files or directories
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# redirect all other requests to index.php
RewriteRule ^.*$ index.php [PT,L]

RewriteRule ^$ index.php [PT,L]
</code></pre>

<p>And this "magic" line of code does all the heavy lifting that the .htaccess was doing before:</p>

<pre><code>$url = explode('/', trim($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], '/'));
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can assign my module, class, event, and parameter values from the $url array.  It also solves a problem I had where I may need more than one parameter to an event.  I didn't want to have to keep adding rules to the .htaccess file for each level.  Now I can supply an arbitrary number of parameters and deal with the routing logic in code.</p>
