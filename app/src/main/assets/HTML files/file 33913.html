<p>You can retrieve a url using the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">requests library</a>.</p>

<p>To get the URL from the user, you can use a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/" rel="nofollow">form</a>.</p>

<p>Then, in the view, you can do something like</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'POST': # If the form has been submitted...

    form = URLForm(request.POST) # A form bound to the POST data
    if form.is_valid(): # All validation rules pass
        response = requests.get(form.entered_url,stream=True)
        with open('save_file','w') as f:
            for chunk in response.iter_content():
                f.write(chunk)
        return HttpResponseRedirect('/thanks/') # Redirect after POST
</code></pre>
