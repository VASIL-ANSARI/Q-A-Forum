<p>it's set internally based on the achitecture type.</p>

<p>from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.bitconverter.islittleendian.aspx" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>

<p>"Different computer architectures store data using different byte orders. "Big-endian" means the most significant byte is on the left end of a word. "Little-endian" means the most significant byte is on the right end of a word."</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>This was a design decision made by the c# team.  The function is capable of converting from both types because it can be used on both types of systems.  it is up to you as the developer to convert it otherwise.</p>

<p>"...All methods of BitConverter accept or return byte arrays in SYSTEM endian order..."</p>

<pre><code>int i = BitConverter.ToInt32(byte[] inputdata);
(manipulate i)
return BitConverter.GetBytes(i);
</code></pre>

<p>"In the case where the data never leaves the confines of your application, this actually works fine."</p>
