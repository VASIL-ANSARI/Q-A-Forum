<p>You have used join, which will get some time to fetch results.But you have used some extra tables, which are not used in search.For example, </p>

<ol>
<li>category</li>
<li>profile_category</li>
<li>profile</li>
<li>profile_type</li>
</ol>

<p>May be you have change the search criteria (in WHERE) but forget to remove extra tables.Further at local server you have a few test account users.So it will load faster.But at live website,you have definably more users and it will slow your page.</p>
