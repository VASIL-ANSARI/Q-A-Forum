<p>PHP files are supposed to be served up by the server, as such if you want to see the interpreted result of your work you need to access the file as the server outputs the file.</p>

<pre><code>localhost/folder/file.php
</code></pre>

<p>If you are double clicking the file name and a browser is opening up, then you should configure your file editor to open up so that you can work on the php file.</p>
