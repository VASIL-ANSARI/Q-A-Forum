<p>You want to add "one or more", you're currently checking for a letter followed by a number.</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/
</code></pre>

<p><code>+</code> means 'one or more'</p>

<p>I also joined the ranges.</p>

<p>Note: I don't understand why you'd want to limit the password to such a small range though,  having a wide character range will make your passwords <em>stronger</em>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/fsEv8/">Here is a fiddle demonstrating the correct behavior</a></h3>

<p>If you just want to validate that the password has at least one letter and at least one number, you can check like this:</p>

<pre><code>function checkPasswordComplexity(pwd) {
    var letter = /[a-zA-Z]/; 
    var number = /[0-9]/;
    var valid = number.test(pwd) &amp;&amp; letter.test(pwd); //match a letter _and_ a number
    return valid;
}
</code></pre>
