<p>Yes we can load Json objects, As I did in one of my JSP project. here is the code so that you can easily understand.It is calling a servlet which prepare JSON file from the DB.</p>

<pre>

        $('document').ready(function(){
            $.ajax({
                type: 'POST', 
                url: 'getCities',
                success: function(data) {
                    var response = JSON.parse(data);
                    var products = response['city'];
                    var product_html = '';
                    $(products).each(function(index, value){
                        product_html += ""+value['name']+"";
                    });
                    product_html += "";
                    $("#citylist").html(product_html);
                }
            }); 
        }); 

</pre>

<p>here 'getCities' is a servlet which prepare JSON file from Data fetched from Database. It is  actually populating the dropdownlist related to particular counties.</p>

<p>One more thing I believe the json file is incorrect. Please check the format with some json validator. </p>
