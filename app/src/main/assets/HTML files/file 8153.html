<p>I've been looking for the same thing.  The closest thing I've found so far is a helper in a Visual Studio extension library called DXCore (DXCore is a library in CodeRush: <a href="http://www.skorkin.com/2011/05/dxcore-components-smarttagprovider/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skorkin.com/2011/05/dxcore-components-smarttagprovider/</a> )</p>

<p>You have to pay for coderush, but DXCore is a free library.  I found this thread on how to get it: <a href="http://community.devexpress.com/forums/p/76328/261446.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://community.devexpress.com/forums/p/76328/261446.aspx</a> (you install the trial edition of CodeRush, and that includes the free dxcore library).</p>
