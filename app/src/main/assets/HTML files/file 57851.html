<p>I came across the same problem on a Samsung Galaxy S6, running Android 6.0.1</p>

<p>The Problem was caused by calling</p>

<pre><code>fingerprintManager.hasEnrolledFingerprints()
</code></pre>

<p>I fixed it by adding a call to check for hardware before:</p>

<pre><code>fingerprintManager.isHardwareDetected()
    &amp;&amp; mFingerprintManager.hasEnrolledFingerprints()
</code></pre>

<p>Checking for fingerprints without the hardware available seems to cause this exception on some devices.</p>
