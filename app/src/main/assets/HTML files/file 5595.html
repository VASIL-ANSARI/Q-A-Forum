<p>There are other options for redirecting in HTML (like using <code>META</code> or JavaScript). But itâs not a proper HTTP redirection.</p>

<p>So instead of looking for an alternative you should better get the HTTP variant working. In this case you can only modify the HTTP header if it hasnât been sent already. And that happens whenever you do some output (either explicitly or implicitly). You can prevent that by buffering the output calling the output controlâs <a href="http://php.net/ob_start" rel="nofollow"><code>ob_start</code></a> <em>before</em> any output had happened, possibly directly at the start of the script file you have requested:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
ob_start();

// rest of the file
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that there is nothing before the opening PHP tag <code>&lt;?php</code> like blank lines or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow">UTF BOM</a>.</p>
