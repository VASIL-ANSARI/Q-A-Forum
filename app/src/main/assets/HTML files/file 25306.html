<p>You may want to do two things here.  The first is adding the prefix <code>r</code> before your string.  The other thing you would probably want to do is use triple quotes i.e <code>"""</code>.  The use of the prefix will make it so that escape sequences in strings are "interpreted according to rules similar to those used by Standard C".  The second is to take care of any extra quotes/apostrophes that would otherwise make your string quit early.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>string = r"""this %is m%y crazy s"\tri""'""ng\s\n%\d\\r''\'"""
print string
</code></pre>

<p>This may not work if there are also triple quotes in the string you are feeding thou; I'm not sure how one goes about dealing with that. </p>
