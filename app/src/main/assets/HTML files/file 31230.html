<p>As you say in the comments, the problem is with <code>chrome</code> as far as I know the <strong>Inspect Web</strong> code is different from the <strong>View Source</strong> code, a blog's <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201009/inspect_element_is_not_the_same_as_view_source/" rel="nofollow">post</a> about this, maybe this can happen because a <strong>chrome's bug</strong> or I do not know if <strong>Jquery</strong> makes and inject or something like this, I do not think that this is a django's bug. So i think that you do not have to worry of all about this.</p>
