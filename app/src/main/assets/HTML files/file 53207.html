<p>Here's one way.  The elapsed time is in milliseconds, as that is what you have when you subtract a start System.currentTimeMillis() from a finish System.currentTimeMillis().</p>

<pre><code>public String formatElapsedTime(long elapsedTime) {
    int centiseconds = (int) (((elapsedTime % 1000L) + 5L) / 10L);
    centiseconds %= 10;
    int seconds = (int) (elapsedTime / 1000L);
    int minutes = seconds / 60;
    seconds -= minutes * 60;
    int hours = minutes / 60;
    minutes -= hours * 60;

    if (hours &gt; 0) {
        return String.format("%2d:%02d:%02d.%02d", hours, minutes, seconds,
                centiseconds);
    } else if (minutes &gt; 0) {
        return String.format("%2d:%02d.%02d", minutes, seconds,
                centiseconds);
    } else {
        return String.format("%2d.%02d", seconds, centiseconds);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You probably donât need to display centiseconds when youâre measuring elapsed time in hours.</p>

<p>Because my format strings start with â%2dâ, seconds, minutes, and hours less than 10 have a space as the first character of the string. I find this keeps the display from jumping so much. If you donât want the leading space, change the format String to â%1dâ.</p>

<p>You can calculate days as well, for really long elapsed times. You would probably want a format like â3 days, 6 hours, 25 minutes, and 13 secondsâ. Or not.</p>
