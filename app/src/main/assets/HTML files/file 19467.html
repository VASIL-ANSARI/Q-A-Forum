<p>For IPhone/IPad development you will need a Mac regardless you are using mono or not.</p>

<p>I am .Net developer and I found it was a short curve developing for Cocoa and Android. </p>

<p>I'm sure mono does its work, but I don't like the idea of adding a new layer on my development learning process just because I am more used to one specific language.</p>

<p>Getting used to Android having a .net background goes really smooth if you used to C#. </p>

<p>Eclipse IDE using java fairly close to Visual Studio and .net. Just try to get a real Android device for debugging once the Android Simulator that comes with the SDK is unbelievable slow regardless you are using Windows, OSX, Linux based OS</p>

<p>IOS development was more painful mainly because we are, from .net, very spoiled from the rich Visual Studio comparing to XCode from Apple.</p>

<p>Objective-c can be very hard to figure sometimes for C#/VB.net developers, but I do believe searching among the thousands of answered questions from Stackoverflow will help you out, punctually speaking, the same way it did for me.</p>
