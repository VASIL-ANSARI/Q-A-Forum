<p>This will not be passed as arguments to the program, but it will be piped into <code>stdin</code> of the <code>./ScorecommandLine</code> program - you will be able to read it through <code>scanf</code> and similar functions, but not as command line arguments.</p>

<p>You need to create new script which will read file (or <code>stdin</code>) and it will execute another program passing it as executable arguments.</p>

<p>After examing your program, I can suggest removing <code>if (argc!=15)</code>, since you are reading <code>stdin</code> with <code>scanf</code>, and not parsing command line arguments anywhere.</p>
