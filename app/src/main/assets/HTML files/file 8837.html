<p>Read one of the many blog posts on setting up Vim as a Python IDE. <a href="http://blog.dispatched.ch/2009/05/24/vim-as-python-ide/" rel="nofollow">Here's one</a> to get you started.  In particular, you are interested in the OmniComplete function.</p>

<p>This is bound by default to the keystroke <kbd>Ctrl-x</kbd><kbd>Ctrl-o</kbd> but you can rebind it to the tab key.</p>

<p>Note that it is not sensitive to the type of a variable.  It can complete for you if you type:</p>

<pre><code>string.&lt;ctl-x&gt;&lt;ctl-o&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you'll get a list of the string object methods.  But if you do as you described in your question something like:</p>

<pre><code>x = "a string"

x.&lt;ctl-x&gt;&lt;ctl-o&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>vim will not know that the variable <code>x</code> holds a string, and will not be able to  supply a list of methods.</p>

<p>For information on omnicomplete:</p>

<pre><code>:help omnifunc
</code></pre>
