<p>if you are on windows, edit the \windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file and add a line like this:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1  username.mysite.com
</code></pre>

<p>then when the server is running, you could open the browser and type:</p>

<pre><code>http://username.mysite.com
http://username.mysite.com:8080
</code></pre>

<p>or whatever and see the website.</p>

<p>you will need admistrator privileges for this.</p>

<p>if you are on linux, you will need to edit /etc/hosts, and do the same thing.</p>

<p>however, when you are deploying, it is more about configuring the webserver and the dns server.  so if you want to get the full experience, you should install a dns server locally and use that as your networks nameserver.  this is a more complicated task, and the instructions depend on whether you are on linux or windows, and which webserver you are using.</p>

<p>then you have to write a bit of code in your application to check the server variables to find out which subdomain was used and do the processing based on that.</p>
