<p>I don't believe you can do this.</p>

<p>Firstly because you cannot uninstall applications that are pre-installed on the device firmware &mdash; they exist on the <code>/system</code> partition which is a read-only filesystem.</p>

<p>Secondly, as you note, your application <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1989931/android-delete-app-associated-files-from-external-storage-on-uninstall/1989980#1989980">receives no notification that it is being uninstalled</a>.</p>

<p>If users may not want to use your application, won't they just ignore the application icon, much like I do for a couple of pre-installed apps on my phone?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
If you are going to pre-install apps (but not on the firmware as commonsware.com notes), you could pre-install <em>two</em> APKs.  One of which has no launcher and consists only of a broadcast receiver which handles the <code>ACTION_PACKAGE_REMOVED</code> event and calls <code>UNINSTALL_SHORTCUT</code>.</p>

<p>I don't believe there is any explicit permission checks that require a shortcut to be removed by the same app that added it, but you could get around that anyway by using a <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html#uid" rel="nofollow"><code>sharedUserId</code></a> for both APKs.</p>
