<p>That method converges very quickly. You'll get more accuracy if you start with the smallest numbers first. Since 5^23 > 2^53 (the number of bits in the mantissa of a double), probably the maximum number of iterations is 12 (13 won't make any difference). You'll get more accuracy starting with the smaller numbers. The changed lines have comments:</p>

<pre><code>double arctan_series(int x, double y)
{
    double pi = y;
    double temp_Pi;
    for (int i = 1, j = x*2-1; i &lt; x; i++, j -= 2) // changed this line
    {
        temp_Pi = pow(y, j) / j;
        if ((j &amp; 2) != 0)    // changed this line
        {
            pi -= temp_Pi;
        }
        else
        {
            pi += temp_Pi;
        }
    }
    pi = pi * 4;
    return pi;
}

<p>For doubles, there is no point in setting precision > 18.</p>

<p>If you want an alternative formula that takes more iterations to converge, use pi/4 = arc-tan(1/2) + arc-tan(1/3), which will take about 24 iterations.</p>
