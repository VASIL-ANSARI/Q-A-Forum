<p>Don't start a different process using the process builder; if you need A and B's <code>main</code> methods to run concurrently, you can use Threads.</p>

<pre><code>public class A {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread bThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                B.main(args);
            }
        });
        bThread.start();
        // Doing something for A
    }
}

public class B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Doing something for B
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Starting separate processes for Java is generally a bad idea as you can run everything in the same process. There are limited use-cases where it is still applicable but since you haven't provided a rationale for starting a process, I think you didn't know about being able to use Threads.</p>
