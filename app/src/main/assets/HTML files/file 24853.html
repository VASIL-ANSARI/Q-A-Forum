<p>The <code>Pointer::Pointer(...)</code> line in your constructors is NOT a constructor delegation, it's the declaration of a temporary object. You're basically telling the compiler to throw away everything but parameter <code>a</code>. The syntax you want - which VC11 does not support - is:</p>

<pre><code>Pointer(T a, T b, T c) : Pointer(a, b) {
  params.push_back(c);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Honestly, this class seems poorly conceived to begin with. I think we could help you more if you ask about what goal you are trying to achieve with this class than how to implement it.</p>
