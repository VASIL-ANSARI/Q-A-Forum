<p>You can use general object fallback detection. The way this works is that anything the browser doesn't know how to render in the object tag, it will fall through to the content inside.</p>

<p>A clipped version of your code would look similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;object id="my-flash" src="movie.swf" width="800" height="600"&gt;
    &lt;img src="fallback_image.jpg" width="800" height="600" /&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you would need to wrap your actual Flash embed HTML around the image, but that's the idea.</p>
