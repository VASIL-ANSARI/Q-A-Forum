<p>Yes, this is possible. You can use the variable COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS (see SCons' MAN page), which usually contains the targets as specified on the command-line (but not via the Default() option). Just check for zero targets like this:</p>

<pre><code>if not COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
    print_available_targets()
    sys.exit(0)
</code></pre>
