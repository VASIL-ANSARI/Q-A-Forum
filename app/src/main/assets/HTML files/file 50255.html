<p>When you have</p>

<pre><code>with q(a,b) as (select x, y from ...
</code></pre>

<p>a and b provides aliases for x and y.</p>

<p>I must assume that one of your with clauses are like:</p>

<pre><code>with q(a,b) as ( select x from ...
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>with q(a,b) as ( select x, y, z from...
</code></pre>

<p>such that the number of colums actually selected do not match the number of aliases.</p>
