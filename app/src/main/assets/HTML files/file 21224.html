<p>Do you only provide a mdpi version of the image?</p>

<p>Android scales all images that aren't available in the correct pixel density. This happens before the image is scaled via 9patch.</p>

<p>This would mean that your image gets scaled up to fit hdpi and then scaled to fit the content.</p>

<p>To fix this, you have to provide hdpi and xhdpi versions of your image. 9patch isn't supposed to target different pixel densities and rather different content/screen sizes.</p>
