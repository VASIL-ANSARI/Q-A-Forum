<p>The reason is that <code>Db1.find</code> method always returns new instance od Db1 class. Two instances might be bound to the same db record, however on the programming level they are different objects. It is pretty much the same as:</p>

<pre><code>class A
  attr_accessor :a
end

obj = A.new
obj.a = 4
obj.a #=&gt; 4

A.new.a #=&gt; nil, not 4
</code></pre>
