<p>I'm not sure I completely understand you question, but if you want to know how to test when a subscription's active period ends and the user opts to not renew it, then you could either create mock purchases (make your app think that a subscription is active and then cancelled) or you could use Google's test subscriptions (<a href="http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html#test-purchases" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html#test-purchases</a>). They last for 24 hours, so you could "buy" a test subscription, cancel it and wait 24 hours for the end of its active. It's not very productive, but if you're not willing to create a mock of google's api, then that's what you'd have to do.</p>

<p>Just remember that when a user cancels a subscription it will still be active until the end of its period (they did pay for the whole period after all). Only if a subscription is revoked does it end immediately.</p>
