<p>I think you want a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY name
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY amount
</code></pre>

<p>That is, you don't need a WHERE clause if you want all of the rows. And the ORDER BY clause can do the sorting for you.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>: Are you sure that you <strong>need</strong> to pull all the data into an array -- especially if the database can do the sorting that you need? One alternative would be to open a cursor, and then do whatever processing you need one row at a time.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Another example (based on your comment; I have not tested this):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, SUM(amount) FROM table GROUP BY name ORDER BY name
</code></pre>

<p>will give you one row for each unique name in the database, with the sum of each amount associated with that user. For the example you posted above, this would result in the following rows:</p>

<pre><code>name1 60  // The sum of the two rows that have name="name1"
name2 25
name3 60
</code></pre>
