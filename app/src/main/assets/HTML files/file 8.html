<p>In my opinion it is more a question of personal preference.  nAnt is a great framework and MSBuild is almost as capable.  With the ability to easily develop custom tasks (in both frameworks) you can accomplish almost anything that you need to do.</p>

<p>I cannot answer the "still supported" portion of your questions, but I would say if you are already comfortable with nAnt then it's probably viable.  If you (or someone in your group) is familiar with MSBuild then that is a fine way to go as well.</p>
