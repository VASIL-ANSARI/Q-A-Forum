<p><code>background-size: cover;</code> will achive what you are looking for. This stretches the bg image to the size of the viewport cropping the edges rather that squashing it.</p>

<pre><code>@media all and (max-width: 699px) { /* max-width would be the breakpoint for when this style kicks in */
  body {
    background-size: cover; /* stretches to size of viewport */
    background-position: center; /* center the bg image */
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use percentage, pixel and em values for the <code>background-size</code> property. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size" rel="nofollow">MDN</a></p>
