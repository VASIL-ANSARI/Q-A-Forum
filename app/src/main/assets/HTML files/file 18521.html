<p>To get the First Date from Last Date in Excel try this formula where Last Date is in B2</p>

<p><code>=EDATE(B2,-18)+1</code></p>

<p>That works for your 6 listed examples and also works to return 1st March 2011 from 28/29/30/31 August 2012</p>

<p>EDATE function, as you might guess, can be used to add or subtract a number of months from a date, if the day doesn't exist within that month, like 30th Feb, then it defaults to the last day of that month</p>
