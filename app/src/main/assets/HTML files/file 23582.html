<p>No, it won't but you need to keep track of what the last type you put into the union was. If I were to reverse the order of your <code>int</code> and <code>char</code> assignments it would be a very different story:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

union { int i; char c; } u;

int main()
{
    int  *ip = &amp;u.i;
    char *ic = &amp;u.c;

    *ic = 'a';
    *ip = 123456;

    printf("%c\n", u.c); /* trying to print a char even though 
                            it's currently storing an int,
                            in this case it prints '@' on my machine */

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: 
Some explanation on why it may have printed 64 ('@').</p>

<p>The binary representation of 123456 is 0001 1110 0010 0100 0000.</p>

<p>For 64 it is 0100 0000.</p>

<p>You can see that the first 8 bits are identical and since <code>printf</code> is instructed to read the first 8 bits, it prints only as much.</p>
