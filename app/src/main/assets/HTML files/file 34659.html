<p>Well, to run the rules composer you need to have the biztalk engine installed, you can't separate them, in such a case you will end up to pay for the license of biztalk to have the rules engine composer.</p>

<p>Why not to use another product? I think there is some products concerned for business rules engines that you can use and for workflow as well. If you want a free one you can have Worlflow 4.0 for microsoft (doesn't include business rules engine but you can implement one using the specification pattern - by code). Other paid products such as K2 blackpearl might help as well check them out.</p>
