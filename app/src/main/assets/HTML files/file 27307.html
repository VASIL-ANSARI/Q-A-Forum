<p>That first line you posted should do it. My guess would be that it's not finding the file. Not specifying an absolute path, the app will look in the current directory which is probably NOT where the file is. </p>

<p>If the file is a resource that is compiled into your app bundle, you can use the following code to obtain the path to it:</p>

<pre><code>NSString* path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource: @"relevantFile" ofType: @"rtf"]
NSArray* data = [[NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:path encoding:4 error:nil] componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet: [NSCharacterSet newlineCharacterSet]];
</code></pre>
