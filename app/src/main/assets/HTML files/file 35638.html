<p>You can place this .htaccess in your document root:</p>

<pre><code>DirectoryIndex index.html index.php /listing.php
</code></pre>

<p>This will search for a index.html or index.php in the accessed folder. If both aren't existing it calls listing php from the document root (note the <code>/</code> in front) as fallback. Use this file to code the directory listing on your own. This way you have fully customized index pages.</p>
