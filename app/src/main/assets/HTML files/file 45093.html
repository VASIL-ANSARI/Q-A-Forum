<p>A code that doesn't parse the whole xml twice would be like:</p>

<pre><code>XDocument doc = XDocument.Load("request.xml");

string year = null;
string id = null;
bool yearFound = false, idFound = false;

foreach (XElement ele in doc.Descendants())
{
    if (!yearFound &amp;&amp; ele.Name == "year")
    {
        year = (string)ele;
        yearFound = true;
    }
    else if (!idFound &amp;&amp; ele.Name == "id")
    {
        id = (string)ele;
        idFound = true;
    }

    if (yearFound &amp;&amp; idFound)
    {
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see you are trading lines of code for speed :-) I do feel the code is still quite readable.</p>

<p>if you really need to optimize up to the last line of code, you could put the names of the elements in two variables (because otherwise there will be many temporary <code>XName</code> creation)</p>

<pre><code>// before the foreach
XName yearName = "year";
XName idName = "id";
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>if (!yearFound &amp;&amp; ele.Name == yearName)
...
if (!idFound &amp;&amp; ele.Name == idName)
</code></pre>
