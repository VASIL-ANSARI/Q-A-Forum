<p>Your question is a bit unclear.  I am interpreting it as "get all customers that haven't had a communication in the past 60 days".  The logic for this is to aggregate by the customer and look at the <em>maximum</em> communication date:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT customer
from customer_communication
group by customer
having max(datetime) &lt; DATE_SUB(DATE(now()), INTERVAL 60 DAY)
order by max(datetime) DESC;
</code></pre>
