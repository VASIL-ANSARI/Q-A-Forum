<p>If you use container managed <code>EntityManager</code> then you're using JTA transactions. Hence, you don't need to (more precisely - you can not) interfere with <code>EntityManager</code>'s transactions fetched using <code>entityManager.getTransaction()</code>. The JTA starts and commits your transaction.</p>

<p>If you use application managed <code>EntityManager</code> and you don't want to be in part of JTA transaction, then you need to manage them for yourself (it's called a resource-local entity manager).</p>

<p>Most typically, application managed <code>EntityManager</code> which works with <code>EntityManager.getTransaction()</code> is used in Java SE environment.</p>
