<p>What happens with the next type of users - add another table? Better not.</p>

<p>You could add a new column called <code>type</code> or something like that. One way would be it containing a number indicating the type like</p>

<pre><code>1 = normal user
2 = admin
3 = banned
</code></pre>

<p>or you could even add another table called <code>user_types</code> that refer to it, but that would only be necessary if you have the types changing over time.</p>

<p>If you need to combine types - users having multiple types at once, then you could make the column a bit field.</p>

<h3>When do you need seperate tables?</h3>

<p>When these different users would have different attributes and the tables for each type of users would differ.</p>
