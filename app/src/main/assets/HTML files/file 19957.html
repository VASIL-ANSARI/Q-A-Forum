<p>It's seems like Apple bug. </p>

<p>Comment from Apple engineers in source code launchd_core_logic (http://opensource.apple.com/source/launchd/launchd-392.36/launchd/src/launchd_core_logic.c):</p>

<pre><code>            /* We have to work around one of two kernel bugs here. ptrace(3) may
         * have abducted the child away from us and reparented it to the tracing
         * process. If the process then exits, we still get NOTE_EXIT, but we
         * cannot reap it because the kernel may not have restored the true
         * parent/child relationship in time.
         *
         * See &lt;rdar://problem/5020256&gt;.
         *
         * The other bug is if the shutdown monitor has suspended a task and not
         * resumed it before exiting. In this case, the kernel will not clean up
         * after the shutdown monitor. It will, instead, leave the task
         * task suspended and not process any pending signals on the event loop
         * for the task.
         *
         * There are a variety of other kernel bugs that could prevent a process
         * from exiting, usually having to do with faulty hardware or talking to
         * misbehaving drivers that mark a thread as uninterruptible and
         * deadlock/hang before unmarking it as such. So we have to work around
         * that too.
         *
         * See &lt;rdar://problem/9284889&amp;9359725&gt;.
