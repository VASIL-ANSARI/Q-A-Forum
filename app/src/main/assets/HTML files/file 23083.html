  <p>We are porting an app from 10.6 to 10.8.

<p><strong>It is expected.</strong> 
<BR />Starting with OSX 10.8, Garbage collection is deprecated. So CG is unable to suspend the threads to perform its duty. As a result you get all the issues you are facing.</p>

<p>If you want to develop for 10.8, you need to convert to ARC (best) or move back to manual reference counting. If you wish to move to arc, see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011226" rel="nofollow">Transitioning to ARC Release Notes</a></p>

<p><BR />
From Apple documentation about 10.8:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important: Beginning in OS X v10.8, garbage collection is deprecated</strong>.
  Use ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) instead. To learn more about
  ARC, see Transitioning to ARC Release Notes.</p>

<p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Is their a way to tell garbage collector not to try and suspend the thread?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>No. That's how it works.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Or to increase reference count of thread? Or anything I can do to stop garbage collector not to interfere with my dylib code.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>No. Since GC is deprecated under 10.8, sou have to get rid of it if you wish to support 10.8.</p>

<p>GC has been a really short-lived technology on the MAC platform. And replaced by ARC for various reasons.</p>
