<p>There is no magic here, <code>Constructor</code> (big C) as a property has no special meaning.  THis is merely convention.</p>

<p>Basically they are using a class like structure to define the functionality</p>

<pre><code>var Alert = function() {};
Alert.prototype.foo = function() {};
</code></pre>

<p>and exposing it through a non-class like interface.</p>

<pre><code>$('#blurf').alert();
</code></pre>

<p>So this is simply a useful plugin convention.  Each jQuery plugin defines itself primary method on the <code>$.fn</code> object, which has access to the constructors it needs via the closure.  But the constructor itself is private to that closure.  Assign it to <code>$.fn.myplugin.Constructor</code> simply makes that constructor accessible to other code, allowing you to have advanced control if necesary</p>

<pre><code>var myAlert = new $.fn.alert.Constructor('Hello World'); // or something
</code></pre>

<p>Now you could something like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.alert.Alert = Alert;
</code></pre>

<p>This is, subjectively, ugly and redundant. And now you would have to translate or guess the property name that leads to the constructor.  If you say each plugin is implemented with a single class, and each class constructor can be found at <code>$.fn.myplugin.Constructor</code> then you have a consistent interface for accessing the classes behind each plugin.</p>

<p>So again, this is merely convention, nothing too special about it.</p>
