<p>No pre-coded solution in this answer.  The feature you request is not available out of the box with JavaFX 8.</p>

<p>Some approaches you could consider:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>See: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12874664/javafx-entirely-customized-windows">JavaFX entirely customized windows?</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/in-sideFX/Undecorator" rel="nofollow">Undecorator project</a>.  Potentially you could use something like Undecorator in conjunction with resources from <a href="http://aquafx-project.com" rel="nofollow">AquaFX</a> to achieve what you want. </p>

<p>OR  </p></li>
<li>Another way is to use two stages layered on top of each other, the top stage being transparent and overlaying the icon on the lower stage - you would need to keep them in sync for location, size, visibility and iconification states.</li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2007/tn2196.html#WINDOWS" rel="nofollow">Swing stage and application</a> which implements the icon and place the JavaFX content inside the Swing stage using a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/embed/swing/JFXPanel.html" rel="nofollow">JFXPanel</a>.</li>
</ol>
