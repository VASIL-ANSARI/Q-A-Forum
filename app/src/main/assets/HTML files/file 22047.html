<p>I haven't tried running your code, but I suspect the reason you get this:</p>

<pre><code>0x27f4c18f5c27f6
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>0x28f5c28f5c28f6
</code></pre>

<p>is because your have a "negative number" in the cell previous to it. Are your 8-bit byte array a signed or unsigned value? I expect it will work better if you make it unsigned. [Or move your cast so that it's before the shift operations].</p>
