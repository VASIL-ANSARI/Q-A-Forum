<p>I've found a nice tutorial here: <a href="http://www.41post.com/4776/programming/unity-making-a-simple-audio-visualization" rel="nofollow">http://www.41post.com/4776/programming/unity-making-a-simple-audio-visualization</a>.

<p>Try them out and let us know what you thought of them and if they helped! Good luck.</p>
