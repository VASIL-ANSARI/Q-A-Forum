<p>You simply messed up the string creation, and you don't read the <code>bos</code> but the <code>buf</code>.  </p>

<pre><code>            for(byte b : &gt;&gt;buf&lt;&lt;) {
                // for debugging
                s.append(b).append(",");
                System.out.print(b +",");
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise I am not convinced that it will work or it is a good solution. Why can't you just store it simply in the database?</p>
