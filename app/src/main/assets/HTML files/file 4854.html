<p>Either call <code>finish()</code> on each activity after firing the intent for the next activity (assuming you never want to let the user go backwards), or use <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/activity_task_design.html" rel="nofollow">Intent task flags</a> when launching your take-a-new-photo or main-menu Intent. Here,  FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP passed to your main menu/snap-new-photo intent will clear out the tasks in the middle so the user can't back into them.</p>
