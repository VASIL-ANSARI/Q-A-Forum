<p><em>mysqli</em> extension is not loaded. Apparently, you have a compiled version of PHP (as opposed to a pre-compiled binary). You will need to recompile with mysqli support:</p>

<pre><code>./configure --with-mysqli=/path/to/mysql_config ...
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.installation.php" rel="nofollow">this manual page</a> for more information.</p>
