<p>This may be the same issue I had awhile back: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7005052/trouble-getting-unobtrusive-validation-working-with-mvc-3-on-jquery-ajax-post/7019587#7019587">Trouble getting unobtrusive validation working with mvc 3 on jquery ajax post</a></p>

<p>You may have to rebuild the validators since you added controls dynamically:</p>

<pre><code>$.validator.unobtrusive.parse($('form'))
</code></pre>
