<p>The problem is that the number you are looking for is not a number in the JSON, it's a String. So try this:</p>

<pre><code>let genreId = (item["id"] as String).toInt() // This casts the String to an Integer
                                             // Note that this is not Int but Int?
</code></pre>

<p>Here you see thats a string:</p>
