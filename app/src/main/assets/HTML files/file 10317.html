<p>Well, I would use an external make file and compile your application with the static gcc flag. The problem when compiling your libraries as static is that you end up with a big executable file. This is acceptable for small applications that don't use too many libraries.
I'm using CMake and I think the learning curve is quite fast, comparing to using make tools directly.</p>
