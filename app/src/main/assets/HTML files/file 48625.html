<p>Yes. See the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/machine-id.html" rel="nofollow">Documentation</a>. Its a text file so byteorder is not relevant here.
Also see the code that handles/generates it:
The <code>make_v4_uuid</code> function and the place where it is called from at line 221 in
<a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/src/libsystemd/sd-id128/sd-id128.c" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/src/libsystemd/sd-id128/sd-id128.c</a></p>

<p>Although personally I would make it:</p>

<pre><code>from uuid import uuid4
with open("machine-id", "w") as f:
    f.write(uuid4().hex + "\n")
</code></pre>
