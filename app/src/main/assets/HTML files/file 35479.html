<p>Since your authentication method is asynchronous, you can't prevent the UI from showing. I would implement a Router/Splashscreen <code>Activity</code> that checks the authentication status and then starts either the Login <code>Activity</code> or actual <code>Activity</code> the user sees if he's logged in. Make sure you set your Router <code>Activity</code> to <code>nohistory</code> in your manifest.</p>

<p>If you want to keep it in a single <code>Activity</code>, you should have a full-screen loading indicator in your layout that lays on top of the UI and fades out once you have figured out which layout to show.</p>
