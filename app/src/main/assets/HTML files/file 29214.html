<p>I know this is already working, but wanted to share some sample code I use myself. (disclosure: I'm a SendGrid employee)</p>

<p>Very similar to your own code, but the RAW_POST_DATA global makes it pretty easy to fetch all POST data in one shot.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$fh = fopen("/tmp/sg_event.log", 'a+');
if ($fh) {
    fwrite($fh, print_r($HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA, true));
    fclose($fh);
}
?&gt; ok
</code></pre>
