<p>To get client-side sorting to work, I needed to call <code>reloadGrid</code> after the grid was loaded:</p>

<pre><code>loadComplete: function() {
    jQuery("#myGridID").trigger("reloadGrid"); // Call to fix client-side sorting
}
</code></pre>

<p>I did not have to do this on another grid in my application because it was configured to use data retrieved via another AJAX call, instead of data retrieved directly by the grid:</p>

<pre><code>editurl: "clientArray"
datatype: "local"
</code></pre>
