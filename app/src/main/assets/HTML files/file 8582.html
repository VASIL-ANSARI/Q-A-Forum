<p>You are missinterpreting PHP. You <strong>can't stop the script</strong> until the form is submited, since the whole script is run and the result is sent to the users browser. So, you need some mechanism to run only <strong>certain parts</strong> of the script.</p>

<p>In the form, insert a hidden field:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="submited" value="true" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in your php code, before you try to get the values of the form and save it to the database, check:</p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_REQUEST['submited'])) {

    // your save code goes here

}
</code></pre>
