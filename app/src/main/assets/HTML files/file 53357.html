<p>The <code>value</code> method is writing a <em>constant pool default value</em> for a field what is  only possible in Java for <code>static</code> fields. Byte Buddy should throw an exception in this scenario and not suppress the error silently. I will change this behavior for the next version and update the <em>javadoc</em> to be more clear about what the <code>value</code> method is doing.</p>

<p>If you want to set a field value, you need to intercept any constructor to set the field value. You can do this in different ways such as using a <code>MethodDelegation</code> in combination with a <code>@FieldProxy</code> annotation. The documentation shows examples of how this can be done.</p>
