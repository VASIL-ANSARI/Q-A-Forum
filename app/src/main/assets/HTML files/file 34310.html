<p>You can overlay a <code>TextBlock</code> over the image if you put them both in a single panel like a <code>Grid</code>. If you want to actually combine the image and the watermark into a single image - it becomes a bit more challenging and you have multiple options.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are targeting Windows 8.1 - you get the <code>RenderTargetBitmap.Render()</code> option where you can render the visual tree that has the image and the watermark to a bitmap you can then save. It's the easiest way, but I'm not sure if you can get the resolution you might want out of that.</li>
<li>If your watermark can be an image as well you can combine your image with the watermark by combining all the pixels manually using the <code>WriteableBitmap.PixelBuffer.AsStream()</code> API. I think the open source library - "WriteableBitmapEx" has some nice extension methods to make that easy (probably named with something about "blit").</li>
<li>The quickest way might be doing that with Direct2D/DirectWrite, but that could be yet a bit more work. SharpDX is your friend there though so you don't necessarily have to use C++ for that.</li>
</ol>
