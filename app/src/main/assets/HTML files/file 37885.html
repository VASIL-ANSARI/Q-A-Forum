<p>Nope. <code>async_accept</code> is going to fire off an asynchronous call and return right away -- <code>do_accept</code> therefore returns right after calling it.</p>

<p>Later on, the asynchronous call will finish, and <code>do_accept</code> will be called to fire off another asynchronous call. No recursion is involved.</p>
