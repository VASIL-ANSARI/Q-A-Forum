<p>I'm not exactly sure what you want to do, but if you want to change from one screen to the other within the same app you should use the ViewFlipper.</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ViewFlipper.html" rel="nofollow">View Flipper on Android Developer site</a></p>

<p>This will allow to smoothly change from one screen to the other (much like the iPhone way).</p>

<p>If it is about the actual Android background i can't help you. Sorry.</p>
