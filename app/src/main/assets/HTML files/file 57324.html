<p>I think your <code>loop do</code> is creating an infinite loop. I don't see any reason to add a loop here. Also, I think you need to call <code>chomp</code> on your <code>word</code> variable to remove the trailing newline character.</p>

<p>i.e. </p>

<pre><code>def compare(input)
  File.readlines('test.txt').each do |word|
    word = word.chomp # removes training '\n' character
    if word == input
      puts "Found a match! #{word} == #{input}"
    else
      puts "Comparing #{input} to #{word}"
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In your code, you say that <code>puts "Comparing #{input} to #{word}"</code> will overwrite the current compared word with the new compared word, but this isn't true. You're not assigning  variables or changing application state here at all  - just logging something to console. Unless I'm unaware of some approach you're taking with <code>$stdout.flush</code>, I think it's unnecessary. </p>

<p>If all else, fails, a good way to debug is to install either <code>pry</code> or <code>byebug</code> and place a breakpoint in your code. Then you can inspect the values of your variables at runtime.  </p>
