<p>You can't use new version of websphere without updating these libraries. The best for you is to let Maven to do it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maven is a powerful, extendable, open source project builder. The configuration is contained in the XML files, so it's easily accessible by the any text editor. If you want to share the configuration what you will do is just post the <code>pom.xml</code>. Many IDEs have converters of the project configuration to Eclipse and from Eclipse but this configuration is local and used internally by the development environment. Developers even not save such configuration in the VCS. Checking out such configuration has no sense. But maven is independent because it relies on external repositories that keep track of every library and version used by the project. Many IDEs including Eclipse have Maven support via plugins. That can keep intact both configurations. </p>

  <p>The <code>pom.xml</code> for core struts2 application requires only</p>

<pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.struts&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;struts2-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;X.X.X.X&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>and it will download all other dependencies. Integrating with other
  frameworks use plugins and don't mess up dependencies that are
  duplicated.</p>
