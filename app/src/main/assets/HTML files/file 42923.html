<p><code>var newPropertyCell: FavoritesPropertyViewCell = FavoritesPropertyViewCell()</code></p>

<p>None of the outlets are being set because no communication with storyboard(xib) is happening here, you just instantiate the type. Therefore all of them are nil.  </p>

<p>The right approach is to use <code>tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier</code>, which will load UI from storyboard (registered xib) for you.</p>
