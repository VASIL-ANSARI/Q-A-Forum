<p>No, it's undefined behaviour - a compiler could plausibly do something different, and as the C++ FAQ entry that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/70880/deleting-a-buffer-through-a-different-type-of-pointer#70905">thudbang</a>  linked to says, <code>operator delete[]</code> might be overloaded to do something different to <code>operator delete</code>. You can sometimes get away with it, but it's also good practice to get into the habit of matching delete[] with new[] for the cases where you can't.</p>
