<p>I would guess that you forgot to specify the packaging as "kjar". If that is the case, the plugin won't be executed during the Maven build. Simply add <code>&lt;packaging&gt;kjar&lt;/packaging&gt;</code> into you pom.xml.</p>

<p>Please see the example usage of the kie-maven-plugin: <a href="https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools/blob/master/kie-maven-plugin-example/pom.xml" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools/blob/master/kie-maven-plugin-example/pom.xml</a></p>

<p>To best of my knowledge the kie-maven-plugin only verifies that the resources can be compiled. Running Drools verifier is not part of the execution.</p>

<p>If you are already using the "kjar" packaging, please post the entire pom.xml, otherwise it is hard to guess what is actually causing the described behavior.</p>
