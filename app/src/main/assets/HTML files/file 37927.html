<p>Pass a callback block into the presented view controller. This way the presented view controller doesn't know anything about the view controller presenting it. Much more flexible because now <em>anybody</em> can present your view controller, they just pass it a block!</p>

<h1>PresentingViewController</h1>

<pre><code>PresentedViewController *vc = [[PresentedViewController alloc] init]; //or get your existing one
vc.selectionCallback = ^(id selectedItem) {
    //update selected items here
};
//present vc here
</code></pre>

<h1>PresentedViewController</h1>

<pre><code>typedef void(^CallbackBlock)(id value);

@property (nonatomic, copy) CallbackBlock selectionCallback;

- (void)somethingWasSelected:(id)selectedItem {
    CallbackBlock selectionCallback = self.selectionCallback;
    if (selectionCallback) selectionCallback(selectedItem);
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Beware of retain cycles</em>. This block is being retained by the presented view controller so references to the presented view controller in the block without weakifying it first will create a leak.
