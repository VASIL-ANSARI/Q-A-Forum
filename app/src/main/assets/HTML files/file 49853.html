<p>This is best to do with CSS3, which has media queries to apply styling only if the viewport it's being seen has certain properties.</p>

<h2>Desktop-only css</h2>

<p>So, if we want to create an element that's only visible on phones, and our css was desktop only, we'd probably create something like this:</p>

<pre><code>/* This example will not work correctly, look below for the full code! */
.phone-only {
    display: none;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Media Query</h2>

<p>To make that style only apply to larger screens, we'll use a <code>@media</code> query. We need to apply styles to only smartphones, or devices with a screen width of less then <code>769px</code>. In CSS, we write that as <code>min-width: 769px</code>, and then wrap it with a media query like this: <code>@media (min-width: 769px)</code>. </p>

<p>When we wrap the style we made earlier inside of our <code>@media</code> query, we get a css rule that hides an element on phones.</p>

<pre><code>@media (min-width: 769px) {
   .phone-only {
       display: none;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and use <code>class="phone-only"</code>.</p>
