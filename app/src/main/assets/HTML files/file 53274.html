<p>You say you can't remove the empty strings without messing up indices. One approach you could take is to store the offset along with each value, so the indices are preserved. For example:</p>

<pre><code>def get_Rightdiagonally_discs(Li,ir,ic):
    # Get the unstripped diagonal
    L = get_Rightdiagonally_adjacent(Li, ir, ic)
    # Return pairs of the offset from ir/ic and value for locations with discs only
    return [(i, disc) for i, disc in enumerate(L) if disc != '.']
</code></pre>

<p>So for the original code with a right diagonal beginning at <code>(3,3)</code> with value <code>['.', 'W', 'W', '.']</code> this pairs with offsets, then strips <code>'.'</code>s, returning <code>[(1, 'W'), (2, 'W')]</code> which limits you to elements with discs and identifies their offsets so you have complete information on where they fall along the diagonal. Will that work?</p>
