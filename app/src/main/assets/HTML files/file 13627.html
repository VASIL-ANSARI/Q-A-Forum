  <p>I'm a bit confused when to take the long way around and use prepare and bind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's the robust, hard to screw up, easy to read, easy to maintain approach. Don't think of it as "the long way around".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the code below, should I use prepare instead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Always use something that allows bound arguments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If i use this code, will the $name be escaped, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code in the question, as written, will not escape <code>$query</code>. You are just mashing together strings. There is no way for the database code to know what is SQL you have written and what is unsafe external data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or do I need to use mysql_real_escape_string?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to use something that allows bound arguments.</p>
