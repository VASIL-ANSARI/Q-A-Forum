<p>Create a div with <code>100% width and height</code>.<br>
make it <code>absolutely positioned relative to body/html</code>.
put your slider inside this div. 
you can hide it by using <code>display none</code> in <code>css</code> and when the user clicks your trigger, display it block or you can use 
<code>.show() in jquery</code> on button click. 
the idea is there. </p>

<p>All you need to do is to implement your slider</p>
