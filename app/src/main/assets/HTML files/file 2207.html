<p>To store files, you should check out Filestream from SQL Server 2008: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc716724.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc716724.aspx</a></p>

<p>Other traditional platforms have similar support (with binary or image data types). </p>

<p>An alternative is you can store the file in a shared filesystem, and only store the path to the file in the SQL table. </p>
