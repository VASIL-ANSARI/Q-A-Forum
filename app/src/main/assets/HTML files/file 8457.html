<p>You probably want:</p>

<pre><code>fread(ptr, sizeof(uint8), 2, file)
</code></pre>

<p>Seems OK to me, <code>fread(ptr, 1, 2, file)</code> is even better. Or <code>fread(ptr, sizeof(uint16_t), 1, file)</code>.</p>

<p>I assume that <code>ptr</code> is a pointer pointing to the location where you want to store your data, not the variable itself (if so - use <code>&amp;ptr</code>).</p>

<p>Reading two bytes at a time though may become a performance issue, consider reading into a memory buffer, and then parsing it.</p>
