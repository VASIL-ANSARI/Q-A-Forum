<p>jQuery evaluates the current inner height, in pixels, of the selected DOM element (in your case <code>".mobile_swap"</code>). This is never a percentage.</p>

<p>Percentages can only be used when defining CSS styles, after which the browser evaluates the percentage and sets the element to that height (in px) on page load.</p>

<p>If you absolutely needed to evaluate it based on percentage, you'd need to retrieve the parent element's height (or width) and perform some basic calculations based on the height (or width) of the child element.</p>
