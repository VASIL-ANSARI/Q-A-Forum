<p>Doing this in a JSP is actually very painless!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ page language ="java"%&gt;

&lt;%
boolean b = true;
if(b){
    %&gt;
    &lt;a href="link"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;%
else{
    %&gt;
    &lt;a href="other link"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;%
}
%&gt;

OTHER HTML HERE
</code></pre>

<p>JSPs really are pretty magic, you can mix Java and HTML as you need, just keep &lt;% %> tags around the java code.</p>

<p>And remember that JSPs are all generated server-side, so you can't do any real-time client handling logic. It is all executed before the user ever sees the page, and he just receives the static HTML output of the java.</p>
