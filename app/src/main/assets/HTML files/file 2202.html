<p>You'll need somewhere to put that picture, like a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.picturebox.aspx" rel="nofollow">PictureBox</a> control. You can one to your form from Visual Studio's ToolBox. When you add one, it is named <code>PictureBox1</code> by default. So, in your form load event, you'd have:</p>

<pre><code>PictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile("@ C:\Users\cAndyb0eMeh\Documents\Downloads\images.jpeg");
</code></pre>

<p>The way you're doing it now, the image doesn't go anywhere.</p>
