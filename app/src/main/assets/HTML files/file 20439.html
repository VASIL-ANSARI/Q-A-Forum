<p>this works for me, with no pause.</p>

<p>you are changing just the position, no size, so may be better to change the center instead of the frame</p>

<pre><code>float originalX = image1.center.x;
[UIView animateWithDuration: 2.0f delay: 0.0f options: UIViewAnimationCurveLinear | UIViewAnimationOptionRepeat  | UIViewAnimationOptionAllowUserInteraction                         
          animations:^{ image1.center = CGPointMake(originalX + 320, image1.center.y);}
                         completion:^(BOOL finished){}];
</code></pre>

<p>you don't really need to set the original position in completion block, the "repeat" option does that for you</p>
