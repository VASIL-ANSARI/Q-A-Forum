<p>I am assuming instead of q.accept = 1 it should be q.accept = 0 (accept = 1 (answered) and accept = 0 (unanswered))</p>

<p>You can get through non existence by using this query</p>

<pre><code>select * from questions where accept = 0 and NOT EXISTS (Select id from answers where user_id = 2 and id IN (select question_id from questions))
</code></pre>
