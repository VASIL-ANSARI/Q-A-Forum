<p>Personally, I think it's because the designers of the framework have missed the point with nullable data!</p>

<p>It would appear that they have assumed that if a field isn't nullable, it must be required.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as you're presumably discovering, this isn't always the case.</p>

<p>The most common instance of this I can think of is a text field which is provided by a user that could be blank, but you want to keep it as NULL until the user has provided a value.  In this case you get three valid cases: 'Not Set' (NULL), 'Empty' (not NULL) or an actual value.</p>

<p>So - to answer your question, no - I can't explain it.  Perhaps it's a mistake?</p>
