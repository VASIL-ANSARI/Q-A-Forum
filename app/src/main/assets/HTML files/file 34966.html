<p>To go along with my comment about a possibility of a bad setting in php.ini, <a href="http://www.bradino.com/php/empty-post-array/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> (linked through <a href="http://getluky.net/2009/02/24/php-_post-array-empty-although-phpinput-and-raw-post-data-is-available/" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, from my comment) also offered this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the Content-Type is empty or not recognized in the HTTP message then the PHP $_POST array is empty. Not sure if this is a bug or is by designâ¦</p>

<p>The symptoms being the same, (empty <code>$_POST</code> but data available through <code>php://input</code>), this brings up the number of possible reasons this error is occurring to two:</p>

<ol>
<li>Syntax error in php.ini <code>post_max_size</code> setting</li>
<li>Bad value or empty Content-Type header being sent from the front-end</li>
</ol>

<p>If your setting for <code>post_max_size</code> is correct, then it could be that angular is removing the <code>Content-Type</code> header for the post. According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16201929/angular-content-type-is-not-being-generated-correctly-when-using-resource">this question</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16194442/angular-content-type-is-not-being-sent-with-http">this question</a>, angular will remove the Content-Type header if there is no payload or an empty payload going along with any request, which I believe is your issue.</p>

<p>Try adding this in your <code>SearchCtrl</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function SearchCtrl($scope, $http) {
    $scope.url = 'search.php'; // The url of our search
    $scope.test = {test:'test'}; // Add me
    // ...
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect your <code>$_POST</code> array will become filled, since there will now be a Content-Type header being sent along with the request, and actual request data being sent. If that works, it means that your <code>test</code> input isn't binding correctly to the scope, or you're submitting empty data.  Try adding a guard clause before the HTTP Request:</p>

<pre><code>if($scope.test) {
    $http.post($scope.url, { "data" : $scope.test})
    // ...
</code></pre>
