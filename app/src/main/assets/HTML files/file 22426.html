<p>The C standard is written in the way it is, to allow the C language to implemented on a wide range of machines, with a wide range of hardware. By limiting the actual representation REQUIRED, there are more possible machines that can use C "without breaking the rules". </p>

<p>There are floating point processors (and in particular, there WERE) that doesn't necessarily use IEEE-754. </p>

<p>Further, I think your 10^(-63) .. 10^(+63) is a misunderstanding. A 32-bit float has a range of 2^(+/-127), which means about 10^(+/-37) (2^127 ~= 10^37).</p>
