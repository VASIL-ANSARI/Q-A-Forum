<p>ID_CAP_MEDIALIB indicates that you're accessing the media library somewhere, but I've seen this reported incorrectly a lot. ID_CAP_NETWORKING means you're accessing a data connection at some point, ID_CAP_PHONEDIALER means that you're making a phone call, ID_CAP_WEBBROWSERCOMPONENT means that you've go the <code>WebBrowser</code> control on at least one page. I don't think I've ever seen these reported in error. ID_CAP_IDENTITY_USER means that you're using the anonymous Windows Live ID for user identification, which is typically the case when you're using a third party analytics solution such as mtiks or Flurry.</p>

<p>There's a list of the various capabilities on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff769509%28VS.92%29.aspx#BKMK_Capabilities" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a>. Generally speaking, if you don't think you're using a particular capability, take it out, and then check that your application still runs as expected.</p>
