<p>The first thing to do is to make sure that the views work properly without any Activity transition. That is, when your return from Activity with the ViewPager, the RecyclerView Activity should be showing the View that the ViewPage was showing. When you call the ViewPager activity, use startActivityForResult and use the result to scroll the RecyclerView to the correct position.</p>

<p>Once that is working, the Activity Transition can be made to work. I know that you've given each View in your RecyclerView a different transitionName, right? When you bind the View, call setTransitionName and give it a repeatable name. Typically this is the image URL or cursor row ID or at worst some munged index like "image_" + index.</p>

<p>The next thing you need to do is set the SharedElementCallback for both the calling Activity (exit) and called activity (enter). In each, you're going to need to override the onMapSharedElements callback to remap the shared element.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onMapSharedElements(List&lt;String&gt; names, Map&lt;String, View&gt; sharedElements) {
    // assuming just one shared element, excuse the ugly code
    sharedElements.put(names.get(0), mSharedElement);        
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, mSharedElement has been set in the onActivityReenter in the calling (RecyclerView) activity and in onCreate and prior to finishAfterTransition (onBackPressed?) in the called (ViewPager) activity.</p>

<p>The onActivityReenter gives new functionality specifically for this case. You can look at the results there before the called Activity completes.</p>
