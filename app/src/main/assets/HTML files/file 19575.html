<p>I can't see any background images, but as far as I can tell, the 2nd <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> wouldn't align between the 1st and 3rd <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, because you used <code>display:inline-block;</code> instead of <code>display:inline;</code>.</p>

<p>I honestly can't tell what this does to your background image's position, because you didn't set the full url to the image.<br>
I will look into that as soon as you change the url's.</p>
