<p>The problem with Silverlight, is that there's still a lot of people who don't have it installed.  Also, I"m not sure how well your existing .Net developers will be able to leverage their existing skills if they are only familiar with more traditional server-side .Net coding. </p>

<p>What are your reasons for pushing Silverlight over Flex? If you have to ask the SOFlow community for reasons, it seems odd that you would be so willing to push it.</p>
