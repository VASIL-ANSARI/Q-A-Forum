<p>The XML header lines should be removed when you are embedding an SVG in an HTML page or another SVG.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Just to clarify:</p>

<p>Well-formed XML documents contain only one prolog.  So they should be removed if you are embedding one SVG inside another.  See: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#dt-wellformed" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#dt-wellformed</a></p>

<p>When embedding an SVG inside an HTML file, you could keep the prolog lines.  The HTML parser in the browser will ignore them.  But given they serve no purpose, it is my advice that you "should" remove them to make your document smaller - and more readable. :)</p>
