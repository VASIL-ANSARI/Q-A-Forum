<p>Actually, you want to be careful here. Because, the reason why this is happening is because your imports in your test are with respect to: <code>/path/to/MyApp</code>.</p>

<p>So, when you run your tests from that working directory, your unit test files are all importing with respect to that directory being the project source. If you change directories and run from another location, that now becomes your root, and your imports will surely fail. </p>

<p>This could bring different opinions, but I usually make sure my sources are all referenced from the same project root. So if we are here: </p>

<pre><code>MyApp/
    foo/
        __init__.py
        tests.py
        bar/
            __init__.py
            tests.py
    run_unit_tests.py
</code></pre>

<p>I would run everything from within <code>MyApp</code></p>

<p>Furthemore, I would consider creating a <code>tests</code> directory and putting all your tests in that directory, making your imports easier to manage and better segregating your code. However, this is just an opinion, please don't feel like this is a necessity. Whatever works for you, go with it. </p>

<p>Hope this helps. </p>
