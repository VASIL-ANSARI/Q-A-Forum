<p>To solve your issue, click on the <em>WSBandKit</em> framework icon on top left section(adjacent to iPad2 simulator icon); and select <code>editScheme</code> option from drop down. You will be presented with a new screen with some option. Go to Build option and tick the option of <code>Run</code> for your test target. Close the screen and Build the framework for Device.
Check the image for reference. Initially the <code>Run</code> option will be unchecked for test target that you have to check. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/78mEc.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/78mEc.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
