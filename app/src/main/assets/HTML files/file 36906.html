<p>I think it's not possible to get the max value directly from the datastore with a GQL query in python or java. To do that you can compare your old max value with a potential new one and save the result in a table or use <strong>Google Cloud SQL</strong> and use the SQL statement <code>SELECT MAX(article) AS article FROM shop;</code></p>
