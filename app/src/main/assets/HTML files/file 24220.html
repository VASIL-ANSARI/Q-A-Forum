<p>since you already have the two halves you can just select everything from your query and sort accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM
(
(SELECT * FROM `matches`,`teams`,`outcomes` 
WHERE `home_team_id`=11 AND `matches`.away_team_id=`teams`.team_id  
AND `matches`.score_id=`outcomes`.outcome_id 
ORDER BY `against`,`date` DESC LIMIT 0,20)
UNION
(SELECT * FROM `matches`,`teams`,`outcomes` 
WHERE `away_team_id`=11 AND `matches`.home_team_id=`teams`.team_id  
AND `matches`.score_id=`outcomes`.outcome_id 
ORDER BY `for`,`date` DESC LIMIT 0,20)
) as results order by results.conceeded asc
</code></pre>
