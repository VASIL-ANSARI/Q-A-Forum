<p>The having keyword works in most database engines.</p>

<pre><code>select field1, count(*) records
from somewhere
where something
group by field1
having count(*) &lt; 200
</code></pre>

<p>In at least one database engine (redbrick) you can use the word when instead of having.  Also, in at least one database engine (redbrick) you can use the alias in the having clause.</p>

<p>Another way is like this:</p>

<pre><code>select *
from (
select field1, count(*) records
from somewhere
where something
group by field1
) derivedtable
where records &lt; 200  
</code></pre>
