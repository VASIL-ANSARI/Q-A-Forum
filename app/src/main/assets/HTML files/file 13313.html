<p>I have answered some similar questions regarding socket.io, trying to avoid copying and pasting the same stuff :) - cf <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7069202/info-unhandled-socket-io-url/8593409#8593409">info - unhandled socket.io url</a></p>

<p>Essentially there has been a minor change in API, try changing <code>socket.on('connection'</code> to <code>socket.sockets.on('connection'</code></p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
