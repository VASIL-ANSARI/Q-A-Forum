<p>You can turn on back-face culling by calling:</p>

<pre><code>glFrontFace(GL_CCW); // &lt;- says faces are defined in counter-clockwise order. Change if yours are in clockwise order
glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
glCullFace(GL_BACK);
</code></pre>

<p>As for your textures, it looks like you've defined texture coordinates for 11 cube faces, but you you have 36 triangles you're drawing. 36 triangles would be 18 quads, so I think you need more texture coordinates.</p>
