<p>There's a couple of ways you could do this.</p>

<p>This could be a part of your view:</p>

<pre><code>if request.method == 'POST':

    if 'Add School' in request.POST.values():
        return HttpResponseRedirect('/add_school/')
</code></pre>

<p>Then this could be part of another view, corresponding with the <code>/add_school/</code> url:</p>

<pre><code>def add_school(request):        
        if request.method=='POST':
        form = EducationForm(data=request.POST, request=request) # passing request to form to do validation based on request.user
        if form.is_valid():
            new_education = form.save(commit=False)
            new_education.user = profile
            new_education.save()
            return redirect('edit_education')
</code></pre>
