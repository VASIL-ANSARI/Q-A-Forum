<p>PHP runs on the server. JavaScript runs in the browser. You need to use Ajax (something like <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get" rel="nofollow"><code>$.get()</code></a> to perform an HTTP get on a resource on your server. This will return (probably) HTML or plain text that you can pass into your <code>.text()</code> call.</p>

<h3>Basic skellington</h3>

<pre><code>success: function (html) {
    $.get('url/to/page.php', function (data) {
        msg_each.nextAll('.msg_box:first').text(data).fadeIn(200);  
    });              
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since you're already making an Ajax call, however, you might just be able to modify the server-side page you're querying to include the additional HTML (generated by the <code>comments_popup_link()</code> call) so you don't have to make an additional XHR.</p>
