<p>You can use PHPWord for this. <a href="http://phpword.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://phpword.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<p>It allows you to open the doc/docx file and edit it, although for .doc files you need some compatibility pack (hopefully you can get docx files which are just zips of XML files)</p>

<p>If you can, I would recommend you using their template system, since that would greatly facilitate your life.</p>

<p>All you need: instead of doing this:</p>

<pre><code>Dear %%FIRST_NAME%%, I still listen to your music, man!
</code></pre>

<p>Do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Dear ${FirstName}, I still listen to your music, man!
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your PHP code you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
require_once('PHPWord.php');

$phpWord = new PHPWord();
$doc = $phpWord-&gt;loadTemplate("yourdoc.docx");
$document-&gt;setValue("FirstName", "John Lennon");
$document-&gt;save("yourdoc_modified.docx");
</code></pre>

<p>An extra I forgot to say: You don't require running the PHP server on Windows for using this. As long as you have the zip and XML libraries installed, you're all fine.</p>
