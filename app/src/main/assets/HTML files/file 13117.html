<p>Your question is confusing. When a user makes a call the phone's own call app makes the call, not your own application. While the call is placed the back button IS enabled - as you ask "I need to enable the back button during the call" so I suspect this is not your question?</p>

<p>If you are trying to get the user back to your app after the call is made, you could setup a broadcast receiver to listen for when the call ends and then go to a specific activity. Perhaps a bit more information about the overall work flow may help.</p>
