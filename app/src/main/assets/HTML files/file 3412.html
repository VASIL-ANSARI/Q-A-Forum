<p>Absolutely - create an appropriate <code>ClassLoader</code> instance, e.g. using <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/URLClassLoader.html" rel="nofollow">URLClassLoader</a>. You can then ask that classloader to load classes etc.</p>

<p>If you can give more information about exactly what you're trying to do, we can possibly help to provide more details or sample code.</p>
