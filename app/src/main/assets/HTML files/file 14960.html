<p>Presumably the value of <code>periodic</code> is null. That's the default for static/instance fields. You need to assign a non-null reference to it before you can call a method via it. We don't have enough information about what the value of <code>periodic</code> <em>should</em> be - whether you ought to be creating a new instance somewhere, or using an existing one - but calling a method on a null reference will give a <code>NullPointerException</code>...</p>

<p>If you tell us more about which instance you <em>expected</em> the method to be called on, we may be able to help further.</p>

<p>Note that the fact that <code>Y</code> extends <code>X</code> is irrelevant here.</p>
