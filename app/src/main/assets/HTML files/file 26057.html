<p>When you create an application within a website in IIS, the sub-application inherits the  existing configuration (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178685%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET Configuration File Hierarchy and Inheritance</a> for details). Any modules or handlers loaded in the root will be inherited and attempt to run in your newly created application, and this is why you are seeing the <code>UrlRewritingNet.UrlRewriter</code> error.</p>

<p>Not only that, but apparently the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2027ewzw%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Global.asax</a> runs for any application requests, even requests to sub-applications. So any sub-applications within Umbraco are going to have issues, because certain assemblies are expected to be loaded.</p>

<p>It's probably best to just merge the configuration settings and run the WCF service from within the root application. You can still put the <code>.svc</code> file in a sub directory, but it won't work as a sub application.</p>
