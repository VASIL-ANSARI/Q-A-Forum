<p>This typically happens when the column (or columns) designated as primary key have no unique values in the view. In your case, <code>ArchiveID</code> is probably repeated in a large number of view rows (which is also indicated by your <code>where</code> clause). You will have to find (or add to the view) a combination of columns that uniquely identify a view row and mark those as primary key in the EF model.</p>

<p>Note that the data returned by the generated SQL query may contain rows with different values (but the same <code>ArchiveID</code>), but EF just materializes entity objects for each <code>ArchiveID</code> with the first result it can find for that id.</p>
