<p>Based on the <a href="https://github.com/nippur72/RiotTS/blob/master/riot-ts.js" rel="nofollow">source</a>, riot observables do not take advantage of prototypical inheritance. They work as mixins instead. The typescript wrapper class just calls the original riot mixin. To overwrite a function, you have to assign it to the instance:</p>

<pre><code>class Store extends Riot.Observable {
    constructor() {
        this.trigger = function() {
            console.log("My trigger");
        };
    }
}

let store = new Store();
store.trigger();
</code></pre>
