<p>Your problem sounds very similar to the one that happened here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6257363/android-opengl-doesnt-display-w-emulator/6314796#6314796">Android -- OpenGL doesn&#39;t display w/ emulator?</a></p>

<p>If I were you I would complete the two tutorials that he did to make sure that you are not missing anything that is required for OpenGL development and to make sure that you emulator is working like it should. Here are the tutorials for your convenience:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.droidnova.com/android-3d-game-tutorial-part-i,312.html" rel="nofollow">Tutorial 1 - Is OpenGL working on my Emulator</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.droidnova.com/android-3d-game-tutorial-part-ii,328.html" rel="nofollow">Tutorial 2 - Am I drawing objects to my screen correctly</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know if that works for you in the comments.</p>
