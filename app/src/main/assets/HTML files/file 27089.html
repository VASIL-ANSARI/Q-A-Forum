<p>Because <code>map::operator[]</code> creates a key-value pair with default-constructed value if the key passed to it does not yet exist.</p>

<p>If you don't want that, either use <code>map::at</code> (which will throw an exception if the key does not exist, so you would have to handle that) or <code>map::find</code> (which returns an iterator to the element with that key, or <code>map::end</code> if there is no such element).</p>
