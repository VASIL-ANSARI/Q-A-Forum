<p>First of all you need to define what article similarity means.<br />
For example you can associate some meta information with articles, like tags.<br />
To be able to find similar articles you need to extract some features from them, for example you can build full text index.</p>

<p>You can take advantage of full text search capability of MSSQL 2005</p>

<pre><code>-- Assuming @Title contains title of current articles you can find related articles runnig this query  
SELECT * FROM Acticles WHERE CONTAINS(ArticleTitle, @Title)
</code></pre>
