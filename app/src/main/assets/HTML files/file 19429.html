<p>So, generally speaking, encryption/decryption doesn't <em>care</em> about the underlying data - that is to say, that <strong>any</strong> data can be encrypted, and <strong>any</strong> data can be decrypted.</p>

<p>That said, it looks like you have a confusion about the output format. It isn't a String as such, but binary data encoded into ascii as hex. If you tamper with it without understanding it, you will just end up with an encoding that doesn't make sense. In this case, the tampered hex-string is no longer a hex-string and cannot be decoded back into a byte stream for decryption. A valid hex-string can only contain the characters <strong>[0-9a-f]</strong></p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>You mention that you are trying to prevent against request forgery. It sounds like you're going about it in a fairly long-winded way, I might be wrong, but if you could explain your scenario and what you're trying to achieve, we might be able to come up with a simpler solution.</p>
