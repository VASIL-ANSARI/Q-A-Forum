<p>The class <code>asio::io_service</code> derives from noncopyable, which means the copy constructor has been intentionally made inaccessible. This statement won't work for the same reason: </p>

<pre><code>boost::asio::io_service io = boost::asio::io_service{};
</code></pre>

<p>In this instance, the problem is not because of the <code>auto</code> keyword, but lack of access to the required constructor. The tutorial code uses the normal constructor, which is public, and so compiles fine.</p>
