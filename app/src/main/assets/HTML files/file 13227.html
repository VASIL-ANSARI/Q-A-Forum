<p>This is actually a little tricky, since I assume you're asking for the scroll view to <em>only</em> include that portion of the web view, correct? If you just want to <em>start</em> at that place, then look at <code>webview.scrollview.contentOffset</code>.</p>

<p>To do what you're talking about, you'd have to take a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5469093/how-to-create-uiimage-from-uiwebview">picture of the webview</a>, and display that. Of course this would invalidate any links, javascript, or other interactive features.</p>

<p>If you needed those things back, you could handle touch events and forward them to the real webview, as long as the page isn't too dynamic.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd probably modify the HTML itself to display the content you want to display rather than trying to snip out a portion of it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: As I think about it, setting <code>webView.scrollView.contentOffset</code> actually might give you exactly what you want, if you also disable scrolling using <code>webView.scrollview.scrollEnabled = NO</code>.</p>
