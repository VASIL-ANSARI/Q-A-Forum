<p>Instead of repeating <code>mysql_query()</code>, use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepared-statements.php" rel="nofollow">prepared statements</a>. They are a much more efficient way of repeating the same query many times with different values.</p>

<p>Also, I would look into those queries that are appearing in the slow log. Use <code>EXPLAIN (&lt;query&gt;)</code> to check that indexes are being used.</p>
