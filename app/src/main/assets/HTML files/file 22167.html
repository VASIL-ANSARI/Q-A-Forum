<p>Create a <code>ResourceManager</code>, give him in the ctor the 'base name'- name of your resources file (an assembly can contain many resources sets), and the assembly where to look for resources.</p>

<pre><code>ResourceManager resMan= new ResourceManager("MainWindowResources",asm);
Stream imageStream= resMan.GetStream("Image1");
</code></pre>
