<p>It is the page_init event where themes applied to the controls</p>

<p>Each control is first created with the attributes set in the .aspx markup and then assigned the settings stored in the theme file. In this way, theme settings override corresponding markup settings. Unthemed properties retain the original value set in the .aspx file.</p>

<p>So If you don't assign theme in Page_Init they will not get precedence and will not override the existing control attributes.</p>
