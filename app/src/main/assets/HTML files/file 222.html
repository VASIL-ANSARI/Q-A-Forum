<p>You are using the wrong SMTP-server. If you you are only going to send emails to your gmail-account, have a look at my answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29988/how-to-send-email-from-a-program-without-using-a-preexisting-account#30001" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you also need to send email to other accounts, ask you ISP for your SMTP-details.</p>

<p>EDIT: I think it is always better to use the ISP SMTP-server as they (should) have people monitoring the mail-queues, checking for exploits and updating the mail-software. If you business is developing web-applications it is almost always best to stick with what you do, and let other people do their stuff (eg running mailservers).</p>

<p>If you still for some reason want to use you local SMTP server, the first thing would be to rule out the php-part. Try folowing <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/153119" rel="nofollow">KB153119</a> and then check you SMTPServer IISlog for errors.</p>

<p>EDIT2:
That KB-article says it is for exchange, but the same commands are used for other SMTP-servers (including IIS) as well, so please try and see if you can send mails using the examples from the article.</p>
