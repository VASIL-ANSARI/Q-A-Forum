<p>In WinForms, you can add fixed-size <code>Label</code> controls to a <code>FlowLayoutPanel</code> at runtime.</p>

<p>Note that this will not scale well; do not make thousands of Label controls.<br>
If you want large numbers of characters, you can make a single screenfull of labels, then add a ScrollBar control and handle the Scroll event to change the label captions.</p>
