<p>It is not the parameters that are causing the problem. It is nothing related to HTTP at all :-)</p>

<p>The problem is that after you start your async task, you are finishing your activity with a <code>finish()</code> call.</p>

<p>This is causing the Async task <code>progressDialog.show()</code> call to fail since there is no Activity for it to display the dialog on! </p>

<p>If you must finish your activity after the Async task, then do it in the onPostExecute() method of the Async task after you have dismissed your dialog. This will ensure that there are no Window leak errors like the ones you are getting now.</p>
