<p>I posted an answer a while back to a question about Delphi. I explained that I didn't have a background in Delphi but I described at a high level what I did in C# to build a component that uses InterProcess Communication (IPC) with .NET remoting to not only activate a running instance, but also forward the command line parameters from the second instance into the first instance. I linked to a pretty simple to use component that wraps all this functionality up. It may be useful to you.</p>

<p>Hers's my answer from the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1991255/explorer-integration-in-the-context-menu-but-using-the-already-running-instance/1991359#1991359">other question</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best way to do this is actually in
  the the startup code of your exe. In
  other words, let Explorer launch a
  second copy of the exe which then
  proceeds to detect that it is already
  running and have it send a message to
  the running instance.</p>
  
  <p>Personally, I have practically no
  experience with Delphi, but the way I
  did this in a .NET application was
  using a mutex and an interprocess
  communication channel.</p>
  
  <p>The general idea was that the first
  instance of the application would
  start, and begin listening on an IPC
  channel. It would also create a named
  interprocess mutex. When the second
  instance launched, it would be unable
  to create the mutex of the same name
  which meant that a previous instance
  was running and listening for calls on
  the IPC channel. The second instance
  then sent the command line arguments
  to the first instance over IPC and the
  first instance took action on them.
  The second instance then exits without
  showing any UI.</p>
  
  <p>I've uploaded the code for this
  component (C#) and the link is below.
  I don't believe it has any external
  dependencies and I don't know what the
  equivalent communication mechanism in
  Delphi would be - but hopefully this
  gives you some ideas.</p>
