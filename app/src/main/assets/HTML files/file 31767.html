<p>I was working the other day with a one to many relation, and settled to this solution (I modified a bit the names from my source to yours just for understanding).
I haven't tested YOUR example, but it should work with small modifications (if needed), remember that formsets work only on ForeignKeys, If the bellow does not work, try also model = Recipe.fruits.through or Recipe.vegetables.through.
The bellow is for only one inline formset, but you could add additional formsets with the same way:</p>

<pre><code>    # forms.py

class RecipeForm(forms.ModelForm):
    ...
    class Meta:
        model = Recipe
        ....

class FruitForm(forms.ModelForm):
    ...
    class Meta:
        model = RecipeFruit
    ...


RecipeFormSet = inlineformset_factory(Recipe, RecipeFruit, form=FruitForm, extra=1)


# views.py

class RecipeCreateView(CreateView):
    form_class = RecipeForm
    template_name = "recipes/recipe_add.html"
    success_url = reverse_lazy('recipe-lists')

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Handles GET requests and instantiates blank versions of the form
        and its inline formsets.
        """
        self.object = None
        form_class = self.get_form_class()
        form = self.get_form(form_class)
        recipe_formset = RecipeFormSet()
        return self.render_to_response(
            self.get_context_data(form=form,recipe_formset=recipe_formset))

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Handles POST requests, instantiating a form instance and its inline
        formsets with the passed POST variables and then checking them for
        validity.
        """
        self.object = None
        form_class = self.get_form_class()
        form = self.get_form(form_class)
        recipe_formset = RecipeFormSet(request.POST)
        if (form.is_valid() and recipe_formset.is_valid()):
            return self.form_valid(form, recipe_formset)
        else:
            return self.form_invalid(form, recipe_formset)

    def form_valid(self, form, recipe_formset):
        """
        Called if all forms are valid. Creates a Recipe instance along with
        associated Ingredients and Instructions and then redirects to a
        success page.
        """
        self.object = form.save()
        recipe_formset.instance = self.object
        recipe_formset.save()
        return super(RecipeCreateView, self).form_valid(form)

    def form_invalid(self, form, recipe_formset):
        """
        Called if a form is invalid. Re-renders the context data with the
        data-filled forms and errors.
        """
        return self.render_to_response(
            self.get_context_data(form=form,recipe_formset=recipe_formset))
