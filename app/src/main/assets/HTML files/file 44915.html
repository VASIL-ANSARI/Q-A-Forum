<p>This question was already asked (by yourself) and answered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29454946/sending-multiple-goutte-requests-asynchronously">here</a>.  To send multiple requests asynchronously you must use <a href="http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/clients.html#sending-requests-with-a-pool" rel="nofollow">GuzzleHttp\Pool</a></p>

<p>Your call to <code>GuzzleHttp\Client-&gt;send()</code> is incorrect.  You are actually feeding it an array of ResponseInterfaces (not what is intended).
The <code>GuzzleHttp\Client-&gt;get()</code> will internally call <code>$this-&gt;sent($this-&gt;createRequest('GET', $url, $options))</code>which means that it will actually perform the http request and return an instance of <code>GuzzleHttp\Message\ResponseInterface</code>.  </p>
