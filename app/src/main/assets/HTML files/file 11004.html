<p>You need to do a partial using $set, not a full update.
With current statement you would be losing all the other fields.</p>

<pre><code>BasicDBObject updateObj = new BasicDBObject();
updateObj.put("$set", new BasicDBObject("processed", false));
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that you should turn on safe writes (using WriteConcern.SAFE) so that your app gets notified of any error from server.</p>
