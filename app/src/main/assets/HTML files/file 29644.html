<p>Apparently it was browser issue with Firefox because it <strong>works</strong> with <em>Google Chrome</em>.</p>

<p>I thought about a cache problem immediatly when I saw it, even before trying Google Chrome, and I indeed deleted the cache of the browser, however the problem wasn't fixed.</p>

<p>There's really no other option except that <strong>it's a Firefox issue</strong>.</p>
