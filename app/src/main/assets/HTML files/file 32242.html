<p>I want to say at one point in time in the past, the Entity Framework team took ownership of certain .NET assemblies that THEY now ship vs. waiting for each new .NET version to ship new features. Try upgrading your Entity Framework version or install it through NuGet to see if that fixes your issue.</p>
