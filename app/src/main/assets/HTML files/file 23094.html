<p>I am having this problem as well.  My first inclination is to think it is a timing issue of the script loaded by WebResource.axd that contains the WebForm_PostBackOptions function is not fully loaded when they first hit the logon button.  I suspect this is happening with a browser plugin or other tool of convenience such as LastPass that autofills and submits the login form very quickly, as soon as the form is visible but perhaps before all resources are loaded.</p>

<p>I am attempting to address this by putting the login form inside a hidden div and then showing the div in a jquery $(document).ready(function ().  We'll see how that works out. </p>
