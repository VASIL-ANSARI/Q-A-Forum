<p>You don't, this will run the battery down very fast and there for Apple does not wan't you to do this. Apple is against a PULL request to a server every so often. There is also no need.</p>

<p>As you have summed up, there not one of the background categories that you app falls in to.</p>

<p>You should only update the apps data when ever the user decides to open your app, only then would it be a good moment to update the data.</p>

<p>If there is a really need to inform the user of new data, you should implement push notification. This is the way to inform the user that the app wants there attention. If the opens you app via the notification you can update the data and even present the user with the select notification data.</p>

<p>Just imagine that the user opens your app once, then never looks at it again, you app will still be updating. Use battery and bandwidth which it should be using.</p>
