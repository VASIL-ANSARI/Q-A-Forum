<p><code>x.src =</code> is a sort of shorthand for <code>x.setAttribute('src', ...</code>, and setting attributes does not trigger <code>Object.observe</code>--this is the DOM world, not the JS object world. Attributes on HTMLElements are <strong>not</strong> JS object properties (although sometimes they pretend to be; actually they lurk within the <code>attributes</code> property as a <code>NamedNodeMap</code>), and JS object properties are what  <code>Object.observe</code> observes. You can verify this by setting a non-attribute property on your image, and see the observer function firing.</p>

<p>Setting <code>src</code> on <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> works because <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is just a plain old JS object and <code>src</code> is just a plain old property on it.</p>

<p>If you want to observe attribute changes, you can use mutation observers.</p>
