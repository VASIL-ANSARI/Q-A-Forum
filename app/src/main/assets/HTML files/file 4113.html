<p>According to <a href="http://www.collation-charts.org/mssql/mssql.0419.1251.Cyrillic_General_CI_AS.html" rel="nofollow">this character table</a> Cyrillic_General_CI_AS doesn't contain the <code>Ã¦</code> chacter.  This would explain why you see a <code>?</code> in it's place if you are truly using the defaults instead of what you have in your select statements.</p>
