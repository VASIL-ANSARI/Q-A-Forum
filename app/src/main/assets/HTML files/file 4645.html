<p>Working with the code which you provided, and assuming that you want the values to be printed out:</p>

<pre><code>
a = [1, 2, 3]
def b(a)
  a.each { |i| puts i }
end
b(a)
</code></pre>

<p>(There are much better ways, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/182590/mark-thomas">Mark Thomas</a> pointed out) </p>
