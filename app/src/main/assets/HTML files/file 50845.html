<p>I believe that the issue I was experiencing is specific to using AWS S3.  </p>

<p>Previously, this is how I would try to parse the data:</p>

<p>s3 = AWS::S3.new(:access_key_id => ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'], :secret_access_key => ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY'])
    key = "logs/" + self.id.to_s + ".json"
    project_json = []</p>

<pre><code>obj = s3.buckets[ENV['AWS_BUCKET']].objects[key]
if obj.exists?
  # get the current log file if it exists and append to it
  obj.read do |data|
    project_json = data
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I got rid of the error by removing the do code for obj.read:</p>

<pre><code>if obj.exists?
  # get the current log file if it exists and append to it
  project_json = JSON.parse(obj.read)
end
</code></pre>
