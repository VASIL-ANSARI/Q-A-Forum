<p><code>self.user.enabled = false</code> should work. As you are doing a network call its very likely you are not executing this code from main thread (UIKit is not thread safe and should be updated only from main thread). Try the following code:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
    self.user.enabled = false
});
</code></pre>

<p>This way the code will be dispatched to be executed on main thread.</p>
