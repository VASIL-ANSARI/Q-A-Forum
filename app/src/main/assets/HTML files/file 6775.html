<p>The problem is that your XML is using the default namespace, but the XSD specifies a target namespace. If you specify <code>&lt;BadManifest xmlns="http://www.engagesoftware.com/Schemas/EngageManifest"&gt;</code> in your XML, you should find that the validator reports errors as expected. Otherwise, since it doesn't recognise the namespace of the XML, it just ignores it.</p>
