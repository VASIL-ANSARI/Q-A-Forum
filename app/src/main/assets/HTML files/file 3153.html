<p>The problem comes from <code>mysqli_prepare()</code>, which in your case returns <code>false</code>, hence the 'boolean given' error. As your query seems ok, the error must be in <code>$connection</code>. Are you sure that the connection works and is defined?</p>

<p>The connection should be defined as something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$connection = mysqli_connect("localhost", "my_user", "my_password", "world");
</code></pre>

<p>If the connection is properly defined, you can use <code>echo mysqli_connect_error()</code> to see if something went wrong. You said that the code works on another site, so perhaps you forgot to change the credentials or host?</p>
