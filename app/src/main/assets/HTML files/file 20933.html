<p>Apparently, your <code>LocationSearchForPeople</code> activity is shutting down, but <code>ProgressDialog</code> is still active. That's why Android complains about leaked window.
You need to dismiss active dialog before leaving the activity which started the <code>ProgressDialog</code>.</p>

<p>You can override the <code>onDestroy</code> method in your <code>LocationSearchForPeople</code>activity and call <code>dialog.dismiss()</code> there</p>
