<p>I don't know specifically about biometric applications, but in general when security is important Java can be a stumbling block.  Depending on how the security requirements are written, they can cover things that one must do manually in C++, but which are done automatically by Java.  This poses a problem because one would need to demonstrate that Java properly (and in a timely manner!) satisfies the requirement.  It is a lot easier to show that these requirements are met in C++ code, because the code the meets the requirement is part of the program in question.</p>

<p>If the security person/requirements/customer make it clear that relying on Java for some security features is acceptable, then this is no big deal.  We could go round-and-round about whether or not it is reasonable to rely on/trust Java to satisfy security requirements, it really just depends on the specific security needs.</p>
