<p>The error occurs because <code>Foo</code> class doesn't exists in this context, you've probably forgotten to include this file <code>Somewhere/Foo.php</code> to autoload.</p>

<p>In your sample this should work!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php // file tests/Test.php

namespace tests;

include 'Somewhere/Foo.php';

//...
</code></pre>

<p>Some editors as PHPStorm are able to auto-import the <code>Foo</code> class if it's in the same directory without show any error.</p>
