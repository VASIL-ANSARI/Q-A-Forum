<p>One way would be to split the string into single words, and iterate through it, first searching for the first word, while adding every word to a new string until you found it and the searching for the second word and after you found that just add the remaining words.</p>

<p>This could look like this in code:</p>

<pre><code>    NSString *myString = @"I need help finding a string";

    NSString *firstWord = @"need";

    NSString *secondWord = @"a";

    NSMutableString *newString = [NSMutableString stringWithString:@""];

    int index = 0;

    for (NSString *word in [myString componentsSeparatedByString:@" "]) {
        if(index == 0) {
            if([word isEqualToString:firstWord])
                index = 1;
            [newString appendFormat:@"%@ ", word];
        }
        else if(index == 1) {
            if([word isEqualToString:secondWord])
                index = 2;
        }
        else
            [newString appendFormat:@"%@ ", word];

     }
</code></pre>
