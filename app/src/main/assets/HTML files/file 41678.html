<p>The ranging on beacons is designed to be low power, but only used when in the foreground. When an app is closed or backgrounded it's only meant to handle the didEnterRegion and didExitRegion. Ranging itself isn't too power intensive, so I would say your culprit is locationManager.startUpdatingLocation. It will be firing up the GPS hardware and constantly getting your location, even though you're not using it. </p>

<p>Is your use case similar to that of the post you link to?</p>
