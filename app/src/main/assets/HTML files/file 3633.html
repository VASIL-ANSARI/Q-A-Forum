<p><strong>Popup:</strong> Anything that pops up from your browser. They tend to annoy users, and therefore they are often blocked by the browsers.</p>

<p><strong>Chromeless Window:</strong> Just another kind of popup window that doesn't show the browser menu or toolbar.</p>

<p><strong>Modal Window:</strong> The JavaScript <code>alert()</code> method is an example of a modal dialog. The users must acknowledge the popup before they can return to operate the parent application.</p>

<p><strong>Lightbox:</strong>  A modal-dialog JavaScript implementation normally used to display images. Requires JavaScipt and it isn't blocked by browsers unless JavaScript has been disabled.</p>

<p><strong>Hover Ad:</strong> These are implemented in JavaScript similarly to Lightbox, but are not modal so the users may continue using the parent application. They are used for online advertising solutions and most implementations do not scroll with the web page, and therefore may obscure some of the content. While there is a big chance that Hover Ads may annoy users, they are quite difficult to block.</p>
