<p>I think the problem is that u use the raw version of the indexed string</p>

<pre><code>city.raw
</code></pre>

<p>You don't have any analyzed version of your filed ?
It should be great if you also put the mapping of the field in the example.</p>

<p>Update: U should use a custom analyzer for what you need. The tokenizer should be keyword and the filter lowercase. Then index your data with this analyzer. Then should work.</p>

<pre><code>            "analyzer": {
                "my_analyzer": {
                    "type":         "custom",                       
                    "tokenizer":    "keyword",
                    "filter":       "lowercase"
                }   
            }
</code></pre>
