<p>I would say that the problem is likely to be one of these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You're not running the updated version of the iPhone app (so you're using the original code).</p></li>
<li><p>The iPhone app is not sending updated data to the web service.</p></li>
<li><p>The server app is not actually updating the record at all.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To identify the area of the problem, you could add extra logging or use a packet sniffer.</p>
