<p>So you want to be able to add or update multiple rows to a database when the user types it but when they click refresh, the data should revert back again?</p>

<p>The big question is, why update the database in the first place? It doesn't seem to achieve much and is just adding to the complexity of the application. If the altered rows are never to be written to the database then there is no point in using</p>

<p>If you <strong>really</strong> what to use a database table for storing temporary data then create a holding table which new/updated rows go into and only commit that data when navigating away.</p>
