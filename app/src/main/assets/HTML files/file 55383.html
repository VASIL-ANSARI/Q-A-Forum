<p>From the documentation for <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/application/Application.html#launch-java.lang.String...-" rel="nofollow"><code>Application</code></a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The launch method does not return until the application has exited, either via a call to Platform.exit or all of the application windows have been closed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means the second line in your <code>main</code> method only gets called after the JavaFX thread exits, so you cannot create any more stages. </p>

<p>You could create and show your second stage inside the <code>start</code> method. If that's not a valid option please try to explain what you are trying to achieve. </p>
