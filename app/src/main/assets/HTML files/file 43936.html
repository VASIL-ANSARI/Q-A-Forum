<p>I think this is what you're looking for:</p>

<pre><code>$("#page").find('br:nth-child(5n)').replaceWith('&lt;p&gt; test &lt;/p&gt;');
</code></pre>

<p>This will replace every fifth <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag with <code>&lt;p&gt; test &lt;/p&gt;</code>. The code that you wrote originally was modifying the innerHTML of the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag, which isn't something you can do. It would have resulted in something like <code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; test &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code> if <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags weren't self-closing.</p>
