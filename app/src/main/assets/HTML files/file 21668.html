<p>In general, wrapping a C header in <code>extern "C"</code> is not a good idea. The header might include other files that break when you do this. A C header that is <strong>designed</strong> to be used in C++ will handle <code>extern "C"</code> appropriately, without you having to do anything. Typical code:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef MY_HEADER_INCLUDE_GUARD
#define MY_HEADER_INCLUDE_GUARD

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

/* C callable stuff goes here */

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

#endif /* MY_HEADER_INCLUDE_GUARD */
</code></pre>
