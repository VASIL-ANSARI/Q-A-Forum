<p>First, read up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort" rel="nofollow">insertion sort</a>.</p>

<p>The innermost loop performs part of an insertion sort, inserting the element into the (presumably) sorted subarray "to the left" of the starting point, but considering only the elements a multiple of <code>interval</code> away. The second loop (<code>for(i=...</code>) performs the other half of the insertion sort, advancing through the array; when this loop is finished, the entire array is sorted, but only in the sense that there are no elements out of order separated by a multiple of <code>interval</code>. That is, there are no <code>i</code> and <code>k</code> such that array[i] > array[i+k*interval].</p>

<p>The outermost loop iterates through smaller and smaller intervals, until it does a "full" insertion sort of the whole array.</p>

<p>I suppose the idea of starting with large intervals is to speed up the whole sort by allowing elements that are very big or very small to "leapfrog" large sections of the array rather than creep through every position; how well this works is not immediately obvious...</p>
