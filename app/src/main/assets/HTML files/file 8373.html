<p>In the typical case it's okay to have such services, so called "Application Services", <strong>but</strong> if you have a lot of logic that lies on the boundary between domain logic and persistence logic that is forcing you to write tons of the almost copy-paste Services that just don't do this. You shouldn't follow any "best practices" if they gives nothing to you.</p>

<p>This is an interesting topic and is very dependent on the particular case, could you please share some code in order to solve concrete problems?</p>
