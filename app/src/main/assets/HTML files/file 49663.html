<p>The test is successful because of improper exception handling. In the inner <code>try-catch</code>:</p>

<pre><code>try {
  FileSet.save(invalidFullPathToFileSet, fs);
  fail("Save name is invalid, should refuse save");
} catch (IOException e) {
  assert(true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The line <code>FileSet.save(invalidFullPathToFileSet, fs);</code> throws an exception and for this reason the next line, which should fail the test, is not executed and the execution flow is redirected to the <code>catch</code> block where you simply <code>assert(true)</code> (which is a completely useless statement in a unit test) and then exit the inner and then the outer <code>try-catch</code> blocks, leading to successful execution.</p>

<p>What you should do is something like:</p>

<pre><code>try {
  FileSet.save(invalidFullPathToFileSet, fs);
} catch (IOException e) {
  e.printStackTrace();
  fail("Save name is invalid, should refuse save");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will fail the test whenever an exception is thrown.</p>
