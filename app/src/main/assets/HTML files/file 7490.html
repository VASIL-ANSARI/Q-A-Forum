<p>Here is a solution for you.</p>

<h3>Set the session like this:</h3>



<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>if(!isset($_SESSION['speelid'])){
   $id_query = mysql_query ("SELECT * FROM Tour11_deelnemers WHERE fb_id = '$user'");
        while ($record = mysql_fetch_assoc ($id_query)){
            $id = $record['deelnemer_id'];
        }
    if($id &gt; 0){
        $_SESSION['speelid'] = $id;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Check if a session is set like this:</h3>



<pre class="lang-php prettyprint-override"><code>if(isset($_SESSION['speelid'])){
    echo "Ingelogd";
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>It seems like the issue is related to >= IE6 refusing to accept the session cookie generated by the php, when a <code>.php</code> file is referred from an <code>.html</code> file on a different server.</p>

<h3>.HTML to .PHP session IE issue</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>When using session
  variables in a .php file referred by a
  frame (.html, or other file type) at a
  different server than the one serving
  the .php:</p>
  
  <p>Under these conditions IE6 or later
  silently refuses the session cookie
  that is attempted to create (either
  implicitly or explicitly by invoquing
  session_start()).</p>
  
  <p>As a consequence, your session
  variable will return an empty value.</p>
  
  <p>According to MS kb, the workaround is
  to add a header that says your remote
  .php page will not abuse from the fact
  that permission has been granted.</p>
  
  <p>Place this header on the .php file
  that will create/update the session
  variables you want:</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>The solution is to add this at the very top of the page which will SET the session.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php header('P3P: CP="CAO PSA OUR"'); ?&gt;
</code></pre>
