<p>Definitely store the photos in a local file system or data storage solution. Otherwise, the photos will be shared/deleted without your knowledge or even the users knowledge of how they are important. This is also better because you wan't to give the user the ability to store them in their gallery only if they specify it.</p>

<p>With any app, you wan't ultimate control of what happens so that you can guide the user along a certain path. By storing the photos yourself, you get control of the data and can give control to the user as you see fit.</p>

<p>Never believe that the user is going to do what you expect. Or as my favorite saying goes, "always design for the dumbest user and you will have designed for all".</p>
