<p>You have included only <code>pluggable.php</code> file, it is not sufficient for WordPress functions to work. You must have to include <code>wp-load.php</code> to all the functions work for WordPress. Make sure to use proper path for <code>wp-load.php</code> file if you are using somewhere out side of the WordPress.</p>

<p>Try to change your code like :</p>

<pre><code>require_once '../wp-load.php'; //Make sure to use correct path of this file
$user_ID = get_current_user_id();
$query = "SELECT * FROM wp_users WHERE ID=".$user_ID;
$result = mysql_query($query);
$data = mysql_fetch_object($result);
$query2 = 'UPDATE booking SET source=destination WHERE status=0 AND userid=$data-&gt;ID ';
$result = mysql_query($query2);
</code></pre>
