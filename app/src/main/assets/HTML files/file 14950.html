<p>Yes, creating a temp folder for temp files is good choice and i see no harm in doing it. You can build a auto-delete routine in your library to delete temp files which are older than x amount of days or hours and you can make this time configurable for user to specify this time and create a default value.</p>

<p>I have seen this approach in DataSynapse server as well. </p>
