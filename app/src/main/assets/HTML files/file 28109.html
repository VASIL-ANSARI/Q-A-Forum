<p>In your manifest you have assigned package: com.example.gpstracking. When u then define .BootUpReceiver. The system should expect to locate the class at com.example.gpstracking.BootUpReceiver. </p>

<p>Please try and change the package .BootUpReceiver to the full path com.seven.ex.helper.BootUpReceiver. The same goes for AndroidGPSTrackingActivity as this should be com.seven.ex.AndroidGPSTrackingActivity as far as I can tell.</p>
