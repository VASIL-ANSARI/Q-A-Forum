<p>You cannot set secondary caching settings at property level (as far as I know), but you can individually tune cache settings for each entity directly in their XML files.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;

&lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns="urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2"&gt;  

&lt;class name="ClassName" table="Table"&gt;
   &lt;cache usage="nonstrict-read-write" /&gt;

    &lt;id name="Id" type="Int64" ...
</code></pre>

<p>Where the cache "usage" property can be any of the following values:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>read-write</strong>: assures read committed isolation, makes sure data is consistent but doesn't reduce DB access as much as the other modes,</li>
<li><strong>nonstrict-read-write</strong>: objects with rare writes, slight chance of inconsistency between DB and cache,</li>
<li><strong>read-only</strong>: for data objects that never change, no chance of inconsistency.</li>
</ul>
