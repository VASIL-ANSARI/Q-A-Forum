<p>As seen in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5770341/i-do-not-want-to-inherit-the-child-opacity-from-the-parent-in-css">this SO question</a>, you have to use <code>rgba</code> opacity. If you want the text in the parent div to have opacity, then you would have to set the opacity of the text with a span</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opacity is not actually inherited in CSS. It's a post-rendering group transform. In other words, if a  has opacity set you render the div and all its kids into a temporary buffer, and then composite that whole buffer into the page with the given opacity setting.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>.navbac {
    background:rgba(255,255,255,0.7);
    position:relative;
    bottom:0px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, your HTML has multiple errors which I fixed in my jsFiddle</p>
