<p><code>lineDrawer</code> is created but not added anywhere. Just creating a view is not enough, you need to add it to the current displayed views to be taken into account and drawn. You have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add it to your XML layout. You will have to add the following constructor to your custom view.</p>

<p><code>public LineDrawer(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
    super(context, attrs);
}</code></p></li>
<li>Use addView(). Anyway, given how simple is your example, I'll use first (common) method.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an additional comment, the <code>Paint paint</code> object should be created on view initialization, as is a costly operation. See in the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/custom-views/custom-drawing.html#createobject" rel="nofollow">original documentation</a> for more information about this.</p>
