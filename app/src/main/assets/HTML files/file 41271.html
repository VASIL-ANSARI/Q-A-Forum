<p>it depends on the scope where you call <code>login</code> function.</p>

<p>Check where you have something like </p>

<pre><code>function login(){
   //some code
}
</code></pre>

<p>and be sure that the region of code where you are calling the function can see it.</p>

<p>Have a read <a href="http://ryanmorr.com/understanding-scope-and-context-in-javascript/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p><strong>update</strong> </p>

<p>looking at your code I can see that you haven't a <code>login</code> function but you are just submitting the form because login input is of type "submit".</p>

<p>try just </p>

<pre><code>$("#idOfTheForm").submit();
</code></pre>

<p>assuming that</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="#" id="idOfTheForm"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>update 2</strong></p>

<p>I think that some information are missing about your code. As you are saying it's impossible that something happens if you have no handlers. If you don't have a <code>login</code> function neither an action for your form it's impossible that something happens. Maybe you have some other code in others files.</p>

<p><strong>update 3</strong></p>

<p>I think that the only problem in your <code>login</code> function is that it has 1 parameter input and as first line of code you use it (the error breaks the execution).</p>

<p>try in this way</p>

<pre><code>function login(event) {

 if (event != null)   
     event.preventDefault();

//other code

}
</code></pre>

<p>and then call it simply with <code>login();</code></p>
