<p>The basic answer is that if you have an empty box item in HTML, then the width and height of the element displayed on the page will be 0, making the item invisible. This makes sense: if there is nothing inside it, and the size is 0, well who wants to see it!?</p>

<p>What you're doing with padding is making it be 100% of the parent box's value for padding. Because padding effects the inside of the block (and margin the outside) the overall width and height of the box is changed. This makes the box be drawn on screen, and creates the blue box you saw in jsFiddle. </p>

<p>The reason your box doesn't show up when you remove it is the attribute <code>overflow: hidden</code>. When you say that, you clip out any extra content from the box, if the content inside were to overflow the box's size. If you remove <code>overflow: hidden</code> and <code>padding 100%</code> then you'll end up with some small white text. </p>

<p>EDIT: a few other things that are going on: Youre also using <code>position: absolute</code> which removes a box item from the regular flow of the page. That, and the four following <code>top, left, bottom, right</code> tags make the box have a predefined location. Removing the <code>position: absolute</code> brings the div back into view as a blue box around the white text</p>

<p>This is an opinion: CSS is a nightmare. This is not an opinion: a great way to learn CSS would be to singly add or subtract CSS lines to see what they individually do. W3 Schools thankfully also contains a huge list of every attribute in CSS and HTML, which means that you can usually find out howsoemthing in those languages are supposed to work by search for "W3 mythingyhere"</p>
