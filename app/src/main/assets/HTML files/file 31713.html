<p>This sounds like the perfect set of requirements for using an API.  Just set up your <code>blog</code> controllers to respond to json and then you can make API calls from <code>X</code> to <code>blog</code> to get the information you need.</p>

<p>There are quite a few resources out there for creating an API within your controllers.  For Rails 3, I'd recommend Rails 3 In Action by Ryan Bigg and Yehuda Katz: <a href="http://manning.com/katz/" rel="nofollow">http://manning.com/katz/</a>.  There are also numerous blogs, tutorials, etc if you search around.</p>
