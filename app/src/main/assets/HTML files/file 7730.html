<p>Upon looking at your code, here's a quick summary of what I would do:</p>

<p><strong>Remove <code>ProgressChanged</code> handler.</strong> It is intended for reporting current status to user, which you don't do. Instead, call <code>Items.Add</code> in <code>DoWork</code> handler.</p>

<p><strong>Create <code>EventLog</code> once.</strong> This just seems nicer and saves you from potentially creating it in a loop if you aren't careful.</p>

<p><strong>Instead of parsing text with regex, create a special class.</strong> This is <strong>really</strong> important and will save you a lot of pain when you need more accurate behavior or don't wish to display index at all. Regular expressions are slow, and <strong>data intended for display to user must never be parsed. You must use classes.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Use meaningful names.</strong> I know that you didn't clean up the code, but if you want someone to help you over the internet, you really should.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, get item by index.</strong> If you looked into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventlogentrycollection.aspx" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>, you would have <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventlogentrycollection.item.aspx" rel="nofollow">noticed</a> there's an indexer property that gets item directly by its index.</p>

<pre><code>class EntryItem {
    public EntryItem (EventLogEntry entry) 
    {
        EntryIndex = entry.Index;
        ItemText = string.Format ("{0} - {1} - {2}     - {3}",
            entry.Index,
            entry.EntryType,
            entry.TimeWritten,
            entry.Source);
    }

    public string ItemText { get; private set; }
    public int EntryIndex { get; private set; }

    public override string ToString ()
    {
        return ItemText;
    }
}

private EventLog log = new EventLog {
    Log = "System"
};

private void eventLoader_DoWork (object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
    foreach (EventLogEntry entry in this.log.Entries)
        this.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke (() =&gt; eventListBox.Items.Add (new EntryItem (entry)));
}

private void eventListBox_SelectionChanged (object sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
    EntryItem item = eventListBox.SelectedItem as EntryItem;
    if (item == null)
        return;

    var entry = log.Entries [item.EntryIndex];
    currentEntryLabel.Content = entry.Message;
}
</code></pre>
