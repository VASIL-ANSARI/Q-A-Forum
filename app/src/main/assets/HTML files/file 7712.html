<p>In this case a global variable would make sense. Another possibility is to attach the value to the DOM element:</p>

<pre><code>element.onmousedown = function() {
    // 'this' should point to the element being mouse downed
    this.data = precalculate(); 
};

element.onmouseup = function() {
    // 'this' should point to the element being mouse upped
    var data = this.data;
    dosomething(data);
};
</code></pre>
