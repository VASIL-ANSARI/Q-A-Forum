<p>The date you parse is implicitly midnight of that date.  The one you construct will be the current time of day.</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>Calendar todayPlus30 = new GregorianCalendar() {{
  add(Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR, 30);
  set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0);
  set(Calendar.MINUTE, 0);
  set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);
  set(Calendar.MILLISECOND, 0);
}};
</code></pre>

<p><em>I might have a couple of those constants wrong, and you can do this with Calendar.newInstance() if you like, though the syntax is a little different.</em></p>
