<p>I beg to differ. Those IDEs are, in fact, <em>way</em> better at <em>anything</em> regarding HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/index2?src=hpb" rel="nofollow">Zend Studio</a> ($299) or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project.php?id=tools.pdt" rel="nofollow">Eclipse PDT</a> (free). <a href="http://netbeans.org/" rel="nofollow">NetBeans</a> is supposed to be an excellent IDE as well (just that I'm not familiar with it).</p>

<p>Also, I use <a href="http://getfirebug.com" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a> to debug my JavaScripts. It's amazing.  Actually, many modern browsers come equipped with JavaScript debugging tools, surprisingly including Internet Explorer (I think only version 8 and above but IE7 might have it too...I don't remember).</p>
