<p>You would need to do your join like this : </p>

<pre><code>Inner join guest on guest.event_id = submissions_id
where guest.event_id = 1
</code></pre>

<p>When you join you need to join on two columns from different table (most of the time id columns)
You can read the <a href="http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-inner-join.aspx" rel="nofollow">MySQL example</a> for more explanation. And here is the link to the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/join.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL reference manual</a></p>
