<p>You just need to join on Product instead of ProductID:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  [ProductID],[Product]
FROM   [table] as t1 
where ProductID=0 
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM [table] AS t2 
  where  t1.Product=t2.Product 
  AND t2.ProductID&lt;&gt;0
)
</code></pre>

<p>This translates to "where there exists no other row where the product has the same name, with an ID other than 0".</p>
