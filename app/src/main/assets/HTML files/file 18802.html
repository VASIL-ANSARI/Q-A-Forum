<p>Wrap your code in an aliasing closure:</p>

<pre><code>(function ($) {
    ...all your code here...
}(jQuery));
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow you to use <code>$</code> within the closure as a reference to the <code>jQuery</code> factory function.</p>

<p>If you're not willing to wrap everything in a closure (you'd have to watch out for <code>var</code> statements for example, as they might need to belong to a different context), you'd need to change <em>every</em> usage of <code>$</code> to <code>jQuery</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, you're using <code>$(window).load</code>, which is usually unnecessary (unless you actually need images to have loaded). Instead you should be listening to the <code>document.ready</code> event. The long form is:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {
    ...code...
});
</code></pre>

<p>But it's typically used in the aliasing shorthand form of:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function ($) {
   ...code...
});
</code></pre>
