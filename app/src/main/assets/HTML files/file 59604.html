<p>As pointed out in the comments, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how JavaScript works.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a <em>scripting</em> language, in the purest sense of that term, i.e. it is meant to script a <em>host environment</em>. It is meant to be embedded in a larger system (in this case, a web browser written in C/C++) to manipulate that system in a limited way.</p>

<p>Some other examples would be bash as the scripting language of unix, python as the scripting language of the sublime text editor, elisp as the scripting language of emacs, lua as the scripting language for World of Warcraft, etc.</p>

<p>When we say a function is 'built-in', we mean it is actually a function of the hosting environment (e.g. web-browser), not a function of the scripting language (JavaScript).</p>

<p>Although the JavaScript standard mandates certain built in functions, all that means is that a conforming host environment needs to expose that functionality, regardless of what language the underlying implementation is in.</p>
