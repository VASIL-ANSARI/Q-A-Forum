<p>You probably printed your number with <code>System.out.println(d)</code>. It will internally call <code>Double.toString(double)</code>, whose specification states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a? There must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part, and beyond that as many, but only as many, more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type double. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is because the <code>double</code> number has no notion of "decimal precision". It is a <em>binary</em> number with fixed <em>binary</em> precision (number of binary digits after the binary point).</p>
