<p>As an aside: you're probably better off doing what you're doing already for the owner of the room in a <code>before_create</code> rather than a <code>before_save</code> so that it's only done on the initial creation of the room (not on any subsequent updating).</p>

<p>Now to your question...</p>

<p>The action of joining the room will be a click by the user on some link (probably a POST form/link).  You should map that to an action in your controller which does something like this (I assume they're logged in, and that you have <code>current_user</code> available):</p>

<pre><code>def join_room
  @room = Room.find params[:id]
  current_user.join_room @room
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the <code>User#join_room</code> method you'd have it create whatever record(s) you need.</p>
