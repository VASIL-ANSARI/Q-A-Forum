<p>In production you probably want to tell the user <em>something</em> when your site crashes, and <a href="http://ca2.php.net/set_error_handler" rel="nofollow"><code>set_error_handler</code></a> provides a way of rendering pretty error messages while preventing the user from seeing ugly things like code and line numbers. It catches any runtime errors that the regular PHP error handler catches.</p>

<p>There is no reason to avoid using <code>set_error_handler</code>, and it's certainly preferable to simply displaying <em>nothing</em> when an error occurs.</p>
