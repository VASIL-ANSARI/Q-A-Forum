<p>well crystal report can take many things  as " DataSource"  ranging from object, datatable, dataset etc etc.   without looking at the code it is hard to figure out where you are having issue.   </p>

<p>basic syntax for crystalreport load datasource is  </p>

<pre><code>CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument reportDoc = new CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument();
        reportDoc.Load("your RPT file");

reportDoc.SetDataSource(object)
</code></pre>

<p>here  instead of object you can use dataset, datatable etc.\</p>

<p>Is this what you were looking for ?</p>

<p>Added </p>

<pre><code>reportDoc.SetDataSource(ds.Tables["YourTableName"])
</code></pre>

<p>Also one more thing to note is if you report requires lets say 20 fields they all must be preset in the datatable. or else it will not work.  if it has any extra fields in dataset it will just ignore those </p>
