<p>One possible solution (in bash). </p>

<pre><code>BACKUP_SERVER_PATH=remote_user@remote_server:/remote/backup/path/
SITE_ROOT=/path/to/your/site/

cd "$SITE_ROOT"
now=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)
tar -cvzf /tmp/yoursite.$now.tar.gz .
scp /tmp/yoursite.$now.tar.gz "$BACKUP_SERVER_PATH"
</code></pre>

<p>Some extra stuff to take into account for permission (read access to docroot) and ssh access to the remote server (for scp).</p>

<p>Note that there are really many ways to do this. Another one, if you don't mind storing an uncompressed version of your site is to use rsync.</p>
