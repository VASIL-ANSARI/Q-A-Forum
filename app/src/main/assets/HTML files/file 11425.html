<p>Don't prefix your numbers with <code>0</code>, unless you want them treated as octal, which clearly you don't.  So just use <code>8</code> instead of <code>08</code>.</p>

<p>If you're insistent on keeping everything properly aligned, even with single-digit numbers, just use spaces instead of zeros.</p>
