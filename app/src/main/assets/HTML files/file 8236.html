<p>Drawing generally proceeds back-to-front because what a view draws might need to be composited with what is drawn behind it. An exception might be made for opaque views (those that respond to <code>-isOpaque</code> with <code>YES</code>), which by definition do not depend on the content drawn behind them.</p>

<p>If drawing is taking a considerable amount of time, you should consider drawing to a buffer outside the main thread and then updating the content of the view with that pre-composited image. You would then replace your custom view with a wrapper around a <code>UIImageView</code>, which takes as long as it takes to draw to an image and then updates the image displayed by the image view. (This is basically manual double-buffering.)</p>
