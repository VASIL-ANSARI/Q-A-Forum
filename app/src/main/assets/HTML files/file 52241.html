<p>Because the parent never waits for the child to finish (see <code>man waitpid</code>).</p>

<p>As a result, the parent could terminate before the child even starts to execute, in which case the child will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_process" rel="nofollow">reparented</a>.</p>

<p>The possibly interesting feature of the experiment is that the pid of the new parent is 919, and not 1 as would be expected. (As explained in the Wikipedia article, child processes without parents are given to the <code>init</code> process, which is pid 1.) However, Linux has a facility which allows a process to become a "reaper" of descendant processes, and Ubuntu enables this feature to give each user their own <code>init</code> process. See the "User Session Mode" section in <code>man 5 init</code>, if you are running a system with <code>upstart</code>.</p>
