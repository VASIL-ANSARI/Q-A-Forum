<p>There are definite shortcomings of Flex's ability to act as a pure RESTful client.</p>

<p>The comments below are from this <a href="http://fantastic.wordpress.com/2007/12/26/flex-is-not-friendly-to-rest/#comments">blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem is HTTPService class has
  several major limitations:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Only GET and POST methods are supported out of the box (unless you
  use FDS and set useProxy attribute to
  true)</li>
  <li>Not able to set request headers and there is no access to response
  headers. Therefore I am not able to
  access the response body in the case
  of an error.</li>
  <li>It HTTPService gets a status code anything other 200, it consider
  an error. (event 201, ouch!!). The
  FaultEvent doesnât provide information
  about the status code any response
  body. The Flex client will have no
  idea what went wrong.</li>
  </ol>

<p><a href="http://raibledesigns.com">Matt Raible</a> also gave a <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/oscon_2008_web_frameworks_of">nice presentation on REST with Rails, Grails, GWT and Flex</a> that have some good references linked from it.</p>

<p>Whether it's feasible or not really depends on how much your willing to work around by proxying, etc.</p>
