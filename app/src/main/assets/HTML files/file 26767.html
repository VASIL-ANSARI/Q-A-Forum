<p>As people said in comments: a little vague, but I'll assume you need to create a calendar and do your things with it.</p>

<p>Yes you can use Carbon to help you manage date and time, but you better not start this from scratch, you can do it by using (and helping to grow, if possible) a Laravel 4 Calendar Package :)</p>
