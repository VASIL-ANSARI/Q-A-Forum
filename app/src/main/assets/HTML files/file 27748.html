<p>Unfortunately Malcom only saves that information so far. There's no way to send push notifications given an email. </p>

<p>Anyway you could send pushes straight to an unique device thanks to Malcom Identifier. Look into <a href="https://github.com/MyMalcom/MalcomAPI" rel="nofollow">Malcom API documentation</a> to see <code>UDIDS</code> field in the body of a push request.</p>
