<p>If you don't want to use that jquery snippet, and you can't add a class. The only option I can think of is by overriding the styling for <code>:focus</code>.</p>

<pre><code>.btn-default:focus {
    background-color: #fff;
    border-color: #ccc;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally you would want to use your own class, but that depends on if you are able to add a class to the <code>asp:Button</code>.</p>
