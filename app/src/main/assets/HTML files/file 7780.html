<p>looks like you're going to have some fun here. But it will be satisfying once you're done :-)</p>

<p>I'm not sure the code you posted is the bit you need to be worrying about. Defining what you see in your table (primarily) are methods like heightForRowAtIndexPath, numberOfSectionsInTableView and numberOfRowsInSection. If you get those right you will get the display you want. So when you tap a cell you will be modifying your underlying data structures, then calling reloadData - causing the table view to call those methods all over again. </p>

<p>Regarding laying out those cells I don't see you using the cell's contentView at all. Have you taken a look at the Cocoa With Love blog, specifically <a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/04/easy-custom-uitableview-drawing.html" rel="nofollow">Easy custom UITableView drawing</a> and <a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/2010/12/uitableview-construction-drawing-and.html" rel="nofollow">UITableView construction, drawing and management (revisited)</a>? I have also used the xib method of defining table view cells as described in the Apple docs, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TableView_iPhone/TableViewCells/TableViewCells.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007451-CH7-SW18" rel="nofollow">Table View Programming Guide for iOS</a> and given the way Xcode just keeps improving interface builder's interaction with code would probably continue to do so. I was very much against IB but now see the value in using it since Xcode 4 took away the pain of switching apps to use it, there are a lot fewer opportunities to make mistakes.</p>

<p>What I'm thinking is that when you "add a view" to a cell you should just switch to another cell that you have defined and load the cell, after reloadData, as required. When you want to add cells you change your underlying data structures and let the table display itself.</p>

<p>On the question of cell identifiers - you can either use one cell identifier and save only the cost of creating a cell, factoring out everything common that you do to all your cells, OR you can create cells with a unique identifier per type of cell and reuse cell variant TK421 when your section/row indicates a TK421 is required. I tend to do the second. I don't actually know which one performs better, but I'm sure that either is better than no reuse at all.</p>
