<p>Your field is required, so say it to Angular!</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/TQ59f/10/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/TQ59f/10/</a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="number" ng-model="someValue" required="true" placeholder="Enter a number"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that setting <code>undefined</code> as your number's value won't clear the number input. However, setting a non-numeric string as a value (like <code>hello world</code>) will clear the field, as it isn't numeric.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: directive way found by poster mister_rampage seems to be the AngularJS way to solve the problem without "required".</p>
