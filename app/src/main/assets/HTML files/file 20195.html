<p>When using the builtin procedure editor, MySQL Workbench adds a few extra commands:</p>

<pre><code>USE `test`; // &lt;----------
DROP procedure IF EXISTS `p2`;  // &lt;----------

DELIMITER $$
USE `test`$$ // &lt;----------
CREATE PROCEDURE test.`p2` ()
LANGUAGE SQL
DETERMINISTIC
COMMENT 'Adds "nson" to first and last names in the record.'
BEGIN
SELECT 'Hello World';
END $$

DELIMITER ; // &lt;----------
</code></pre>

<p>Those commands are not strictly related to the stored procedures syntax, they're merely a commodityâother MySQL clients (such as HeidiSQL or the official command line utility) will not add them. The last delimiter change is probably a reset to avoid problems in future statements on the same connection.</p>

<p>You need to change the delimiter in order to instruct the client about where the procedure code starts and end. The problem is that the procedure body is normally a collection of SQL statements so omitting the delimiter change would make MySQL think that you are attempting to run a series of statements, the first of which would be this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE test.`p2` ()
LANGUAGE SQL
DETERMINISTIC
COMMENT 'Adds "nson" to first and last names in the record.'
BEGIN
SELECT 'Hello World';
</code></pre>

<p>With <code>DELIMITER $$</code> you are telling MySQL that your full statement goes from <code>CREATE</code> to <code>END</code>. It's just syntactic sugar: <code>DELIMITER</code> is not even a SQL keyword. HeidiSQL, for instance, provides a GUI with a text box where you write the procedure body, thus you don't need the DELIMITER workaround.</p>
