<p>I've finally found out when I compared working and not working chart. I had initialization like this</p>

<pre><code>  google.charts.load('current', {'packages': ['corechart', 'bar', 'line']});
</code></pre>

<p>I removed bar and line, and now it works. Strange is, that before it worked without problem. So I replaced with this</p>

<pre><code>google.charts.load('current', {'packages': ['corechart']});
</code></pre>
