<p>Other than by consuming the entire stream and counting the bytes, you can't (there's no API for it).</p>

<p>There's the <code>available()</code> method, but it quite explicitly doesn't do what you're asking:</p>

  <p>Note that while some implementations of InputStream will return the total number of bytes in the stream, <strong>many will not</strong>.</p>

<p>If the <code>InputStream</code> is associated with a file (and not, say, a socket), perhaps you could use a different API to get its size?</p>
