<p>Yes, it means ARRAY_SIZE must be greater than zero.
At this level you should probably leave the optimization to the compiler. 
But if the ARRAY_SIZE is a defined constant, you can optimize by an array which its elements are the same size as your CPU registers. your array size should be an integer multiple of the size of your registers.
for more optimization you should dig into assembler outputs.</p>
