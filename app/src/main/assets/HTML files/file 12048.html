<p>If you want the platform to pickup the relevant drawables depending on the locale, they have to be put in the appropriate locale folder - which is <strong>drawable-da</strong> and <strong>drawable-sv</strong> in your case.</p>

<p>You can use the Locale class and pick up drawables at runtime programmatically too.</p>
