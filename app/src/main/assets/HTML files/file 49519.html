<p>For these sort of iteration tasks you're better off using the <code>for</code> loop since you already know <em>the boundaries</em> you're working with, also Python makes creating <code>for</code> loops especially easy. </p>

<p>With <code>while</code> loops you have to check that you are in range using conditionals while also explicitly incrementing your counters making mistakes all the more likely.</p>

<p>Since you know you need multiplication tables for values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> ranging from <code>1-10</code> you can, to get you familiar with loops, create two <code>for</code> loops:</p>

<pre><code>def tablesOneToTen():  # a function that will print out multiplication tables from 1-10
    # This will iterate with values for x in the range [1-10]
    for x in range(1, 11):
        # Print the value of x for reference
        print("Table for {} * (1 - 10)".format(x))
        # iterate for values of y in a range [1-10]
        for y in range(1, 11):                
            # Print the result of the multiplication
            print(x * y, end=" ")            
        # Print a new Line.
        print()
</code></pre>

<p>Running this will give you the tables you need:</p>

<pre><code>Table for 1 * (1 - 10)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
Table for 2 * (1 - 10)
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 
Table for 3 * (1 - 10)
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>With a <code>while</code> loop, the logic is similar but of course just more verbose than it need to since you must initialize, evaluate the condition and increment. </p>

<p>As a testament to its uglyness, the <code>while</code> loop would look something like this: </p>

<pre><code>def tablesOneToTen():
    # initialize x counter
    x = 1

    # first condition
    while x &lt;= 10:
        # print reference message
        print("Table for {} * [1-10]".format(x))
        # initialize y counter
        y = 1
        # second condition
        while y &lt;=10:
            # print values
            print(x*y, end=" ")
            # increment y
            y += 1
        # print a new line
        print(" ")
        # increment x
        x += 1
</code></pre>
