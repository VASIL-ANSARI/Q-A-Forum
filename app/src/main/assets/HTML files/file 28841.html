<p>Nothing of the code you posted does anything with OpenGL-ES. The typical method to implement color space conversion with OpenGL(-ES) is to load the image into a <em>texture</em>, load a <em>fragment shader</em> performing the color conversion and <em>draw</em> a (full viewport) <em>textured quad</em> (that's what glDrawArrays will do, if a quad's geometry has been loaded into the vertex arrays before).</p>
