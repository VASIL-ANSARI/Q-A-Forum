<p>Doubles are not exact representations of decimal numbers, they're represented with a binary base. They don't convert exactly to decimal numbers, so you have no guarantee that 5 * 2.52 / 2.52 will equal 5.0. I suggest using the C# type Decimal instead.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/803225/when-should-i-use-double-instead-of-decimal">this question</a> for more information about the C# Decimal type</p>
