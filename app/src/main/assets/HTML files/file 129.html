<p>Executive summary:  Yes, if your database has a message queue service.</p>

<p>You can push a message onto a queue and the queue processor will consume it asynchronously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle: queues</li>
<li>Sql Server: service broker</li>
<li>DB2: event broker</li>
</ul>

<p>For "pure" stored procedure languages (PL/Sql or T-Sql) the answer is no, since it works against the fundamental transaction model most databases have.</p>

<p>However, if your database has a queuing mechanism, you can use that to get the same result.</p>
