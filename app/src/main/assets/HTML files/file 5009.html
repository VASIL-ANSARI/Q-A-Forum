<p>I think you should genralize the collection as, say, a '<code>BaseList</code>' which would house the common properties for both OrganizationalUnit.Children and Group.Members.</p>

<p>Then the Children and Member classes could extend that base class and add other custom functionality that needs to occur when you accept changes.</p>

<p>So in summary:</p>

<pre><code>public class BaseList
{
 public virtual void Persist(...);
 // Common stuff
}

public class Children
{
 public override void Persist(...)
 {
   // do custom stuff
 }
}

public class Members
{
 public override void Persist(...)
 {
   // do custom stuff
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can loop through a collection of '<code>BaseList</code>' and call each individual persist method.</p>
