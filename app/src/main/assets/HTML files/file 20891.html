<p>I strongly suspect you're basically being bounded by the built-in connection pool, which will limit the number of requests a single process (or possibly AppDomain) makes to a given host. If you want to change the number of concurrent requests you can make to a single host, use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fb6y0fyc.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;connectionManagement&gt;</code></a> element in your app.config.</p>

<p>As an aside, you should have a <code>using</code> statement when you use the response, otherwise you're not disposing of it properly... which can cause horrible problems with the connection pool in itself.</p>
