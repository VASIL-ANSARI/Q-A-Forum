<p><code>%@\n Selection is %@ \n %d for %.2lf = %.2lf</code> is definitely <em>not</em> in any plist format. If you want to retain the plist format, use <code>+[NSPropertyListSerialization dataFromPropertyList:...]</code> to convert the string into data as a plist, then save the data.</p>

<p>And I don't see a reason to use plist if you're only storing 1 string. You can simply save as a .txt and load it using <code>+[NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:...]</code>.</p>
