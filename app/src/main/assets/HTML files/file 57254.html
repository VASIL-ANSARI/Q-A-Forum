<blockquote>
  <p>Code=134100  The managed object model version used to open the
  persistent store is incompatible with the one that was used to create
  the persistent store</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your app is not published on the AppStore, you can simply remove app from the device (or simulator), Clean project and do Build&amp;Run.</p>

<p>Whenever you make changes to Core Data definition you should delete the app and rebuild.</p>

<p>If your app is on AppStore, you should perform Core Data migration, you can find a lot of information on the Internet. </p>

<p>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreDataVersioning/Articles/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">Core Data Model Versioning and Data Migration</a>, explains how to perform Automatic Lightweight Migration :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You request automatic lightweight migration using the options
  dictionary you pass in
  addPersistentStoreWithType:configuration:URL:options:error:, by
  setting values corresponding to both the
  NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption and the
  NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption keys to YES:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means that you can pass following options to your persistent coordinator : </p>

<pre><code>let options = [NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption: true, NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption: true]

coordinator.addPersistentStoreWithType(NSSQLiteStoreType,configuration: nil,URL : storeURL, options as! [NSObject : AnyObject])
</code></pre>
