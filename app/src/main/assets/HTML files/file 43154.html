<p>You need to cast the object first <code>paintings.add((Painting)myObject);</code>, the generic <code>ArrayList&lt;Painting&gt;</code> is forbidding you to add it, since it expects an inheritance of the class Painting and is throwing a compiler error, since the generell class Object doesnÂ´t fulfill this condition</p>
