<p>If my answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4383913/using-simpleadapter-with-spinner/4384000#4384000">here</a> (including the follow-up comments) is correct, then you may need to add a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SimpleCursorAdapter.ViewBinder.html" rel="nofollow">ViewBinder</a> to the <code>SimpleAdapter</code>. You can google for examples of <code>ViewBinder</code> implementations -- it doesn't seem to be very complicated.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: You do need the ViewBinder, at least for some earlier versions of AndroidOS (I found it's not needed for 2.2). See the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4383913/using-simpleadapter-with-spinner/4384000#4384000">other answer</a>, and perhaps also my <a href="http://www.outofwhatbox.com/blog/2010/12/android-spinners-simpleadapter-and-maybe-viewbinder/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> about this.</p>
