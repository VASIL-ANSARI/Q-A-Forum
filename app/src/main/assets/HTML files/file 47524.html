<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT A.ID, A.JOB, A.STATUS, B.START_DATE, CASE WHEN A.STATUS = 'done' THEN C.END_DATE ELSE NULL AS END_DATE
FROM &lt;JOBS_TABLE&gt; A
JOIN (SELECT ID, JOB, MIN(DATE) AS START_DATE FROM &lt;JOBS_TABLE&gt; GROUP BY ID, JOB) B
ON A.ID = B.ID
AND A.JOB = B.JOB
JOIN (SELECT ID, JOB, MAX(DATE) AS END_DATE FROM &lt;JOBS_TABLE GROUP BY ID, JOB) C
ON A.ID= C.ID
AND A.JOB = C.JOB
AND A.DATE = C.END_DATE
</code></pre>

<p>You'll need to replace &lt; JOBS_TABLE > with whatever your table name is. Ideally, this should combine the data from the  first and last rows for each distinct set of ID and JOB values. If the job is not finished, it will not show an END_DATE.</p>
