<p>The problem is that your <code>renderScene</code> method needs to know which component to render but you are always sending it the LoginScreen component. Do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>renderScene: (route, navigator) {
  Component = route.component
  &lt;Component navigator={navigator} route={route} /&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means that you move to a new scene by passing a component key to the navigator.</p>

<pre><code>this.props.navigator.replace({
  component: MainScreen
});
</code></pre>
