<p>I dont <em>believe</em> that there is. I had a similar problem on a recent project.</p>

<p>What we did was ensure that every property on the target was specified in the mapping configuration in alphabetical order. Even if it was being ignored.</p>

<p>When errors occured it was possible to do a "visual" check of the target to see if any properties had been added / missed.</p>
