<p>You want to create a CrossTab query. Here's the SQL that you can use.</p>

<pre><code>TRANSFORM SUM(YourTable.DaysWorked) AS DaysWorked
SELECT YourTable.Team
FROM YourTable
GROUP BY YourTable.Team
PIVOT YourTable.Employee
</code></pre>

<p>Of course the output is slightly different in that the columns are in alphabetical order.</p>

<pre><code>Team   James  John  Mark
Sales  5      23    3
</code></pre>
