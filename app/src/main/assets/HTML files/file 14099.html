<p>First, let me correct some of your terminology:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>db.databaseName.insert({</code> is incorrect. After you've connected to the database, you insert documents into <em>collections</em>. The line should be written as <code>db.articles.insert({</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum document size is <em>16MB</em> at the moment.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I probably would do in this case, is to store all the articles in an <em>articles</em> collection, where one of the fields would be <em>author name</em> (or <em>author nick</em>). The reason for this is mostly because you mentioned that this is a query that you will be running a lot on the homepage. You can then store additional author information in documents in the <em>authors</em> collection. The _id field of each author could be just the <em>author name</em> (or <em>author nick</em>)-it doesn't need to be of the type "ObjectId" at all, as long as it's a scalar value (and not an array).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could just store all the articles by an author as a nested array in the <em>articles</em> collection, something like you show in your first example. A 16MB document limitation might sound like a little, but it's more than you think. For example, the 477 articles on my blog only take up 2.4MB.</p>
