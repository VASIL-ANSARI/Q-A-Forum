<p>When I think of smartphones I think of the ones you have listed in your tags, iPhone and android. </p>

<p>Since these are the two you listed I would suggest <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> which is HTML5. </p>

<p>Webkit is optimized for HTML5 and is the HTML renderer for Android and iOs devices.</p>
