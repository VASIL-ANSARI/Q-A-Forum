<p>Edited my answer now that the question has been revised.</p>

<p>A quick trace shows the following:</p>

<pre><code>Entering SuperiorFoo.Bar()
Entering AdvancedFoo.Bar()
Entering Foo.Bar()
Leaving Foo.Bar()
Leaving AdvancedFoo.Bar()
Leaving SuperiorFoo.Bar()
</code></pre>

<p>Lets talk through what happens:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>SuperiorFoo.Bar() calls its base method. Since SF.Bar() inherits
from AdvancedFoo, its base method is AdvancedFoo.Bar().</p></li>
<li><p>AdvancedFoo.Bar() then calls its base, which is Foo.Bar() since
AdvancedFoo inherits from Foo().</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The process flow does NOT jump from SF.Bar() to Foo.Bar() because you could potentially want behaviour from the intermediate class.</p>

<p>If we remove the method from AdvancedFoo, the traversal is slightly different. SuperFoo.Bar() will still call its base method, but since AdvancedFoo doesn't hide the Foo.Bar() method anymore, the logic will jump to the Foo.Bar() method.</p>
