<p>To use CSS within the SAPUI5 environment you should link your controls to a specific CSS class. You can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>var myButton = new sap.m.Button();
myButton.addStyleClass("myButtonStyle");
</code></pre>

<p>And your CSS could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>@CHARSET "ISO-8859-1";

.myButtonStyle {
    color:#FFCCDD;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that you load the CSS file into your application, for example like this in your html file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you can use this for your whole page as well. For your needs you could also take a look at the <a href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/api/symbols/sap.m.App.html" rel="nofollow">App</a> control which provides some utilities for background images if youÂ´re using mobile controls.</p>
