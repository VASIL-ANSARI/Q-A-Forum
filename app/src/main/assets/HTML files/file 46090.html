<p>If the loop never executes, <code>x_index</code> is undefined.  Neither is <code>y_index</code>; its value is only ever seen briefly since it isn't defined outside of the <code>elif</code> it's seen in.</p>

<p>You might have intended to move the printing inside of the loop, as the values for <code>x_index</code> and <code>y_index</code> only exist for one iteration.  Otherwise, printing it or using the value would only net you the last calculated value(s).  You would then want to declare them <em>inside</em> of the loop, or we'd run into the same issue when we go to print it out.  This also prevents unnecessary repeated printing of either value when we don't really expect it to be printed out.</p>

<pre><code>def scatter_x_y(self,filtered_data,x_parameter,y_parameter):
    for i in range(len(filtered_data)):
        x_index, y_index = None, None
        if filtered_data[i].name==x_parameter:
            x=filtered_data[i]
            x_index=list(x.keys())
        elif filtered_data[i].name==y_parameter:
            y=filtered_data[i]
            y_index=list(y.keys())
        if x_index:
            print "x_index={}".format(x_index)
        if y_index:
            print "y_index={}".format(y_index)
