<p>You can't do it directly. One thing you can do is have the method be concrete, but invoke an abstract method:</p>

<pre><code>public synchronized final void foo() {
    doFoo();
}
protected abstract void doFoo();
</code></pre>

<p>That way, doFoo() will always* be invoked under the synchronization established by foo().</p>

<p>* unless someone invokes it directly, so you should name and document it to make it clear that they shouldn't.</p>
