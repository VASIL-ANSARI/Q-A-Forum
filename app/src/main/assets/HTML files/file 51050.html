<p>I sadly don't have the code on me currently, but this is how you can solve this (and there might very well be a solution out there already).</p>

<p>You can create a new appender that logs asynchronously to your file/console whatever.</p>

<p>In the appender, you can implement aggregation yourself. Whenever an logevent comes in, instead of writing it out immediately, check if you've seen the message before. If you did, instead of logging it, increment your counter. </p>

<p>Eventually, transform those aggregated log events to an aggregated message and process that one instead of your thousand log events. </p>

<p>This could be solved (for example) with a second worker on your asynchronous appender base. Usually (I am looking at lockback, but I assume it will be fairly similar for you), the asynchronous appenders end up adding events to a queue which will be processed by a different thread that works off that queue. </p>

<p>You can have a different queue for your aggregated messages, and a worker that runs say every 5 seconds. If in those 5 seconds the same message has been seen multiple times, your worker can aggregate that message and put it on the queue to be processed so it eventually ends up in the logs. </p>

<p>I hope that helps,</p>

<p>P.S.: With regards to your config, simply replace the Console appender with your custom aggregating appender. If you want console, simply extend that appender and make it do what you want it to do :) </p>
