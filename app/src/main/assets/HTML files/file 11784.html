<p>You rarely implement a constructor on an Android component, such as an <code>Activity</code> or <code>Application</code>. Inside of <code>onCreate()</code>, after you have called <code>super.onCreate()</code>, you can safely use most superclass methods. Hence, the typical pattern is to initialize anything complex in <code>onCreate()</code>.</p>
