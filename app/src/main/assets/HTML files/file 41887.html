<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>

<p>The idea of using multiple inheritance is perfectly valid here:  </p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>Camera</code> <strong>is-a</strong> node, and at the same time <strong>is-a</strong> plugin object which implements the <code>CameraInterface</code>.   </li>
<li>The difficulty that you experience with accessor and bidirectional link from <code>Camera</code> to <code>CameraInterface</code> (to syncrhonize at least the lifetime) and from <code>CameraInterface</code> to <code>Camera</code> (to allow plugin to manipulate the real object) confirms that inheritance is structurally more adapted here than composition.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Virtual inheritance needs to be assessed carefully: </p>

<ul>
<li>at first sight, it seems not necessary: your example seems to accredit the hypotheses that only the final graphic elements inherit from plugin hierarchy, i.e. the note and the plugin inheritance hierarchies are not interleaved.   </li>
<li>it could however be required if the reality is more complex, and escpecially if all graphic elements could inherit from plugin elements at any levels.  In this case without virtuality, you'd have several instances of plugin in the same object, which doesn't seem to make sense.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Virtual inheritance would make it slightly more complex, as you have alwys to initailise explicitely the common virtual bases.  </p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong>:  </p>

<p>With multiple inheritance, you'll have several <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/multiple-inheritance-considered-useful/184402074" rel="nofollow">vtables</a> for accessing virtual functions (one for each inheritance hierarchy).  However, for a given pointer type, the implementation will only <strong>access a single vtable</strong> with a single offset.  Thus performance will not be more degraded than single inheritance with virtual functions.  </p>

<p>In addition you can compare with the single inheritance alternative that you have explored.  You'll notice that navigation between objects and their adpaters will need a lot of pointer dereferencing, which might balance out the vtable indirection (and only if you would'nt make use of virtual functions).   </p>
