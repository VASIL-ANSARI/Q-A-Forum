<p>There's not much details to go on in your question but I'll wager a guess.
The error is pretty self-explanatory. You can't <code>add_axes</code> to <code>pyplot_2</code> because <code>pyplot_2</code> is a <code>matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot</code> object and they don't have an <code>add_axes</code> method defined. </p>

<p>Only <code>matplotlib.figure.Figure</code> objects have <code>add_axes</code> method defined on them.</p>

<p>From what I got from a short browse through the WCSAxes official documentation their recommended approach would be:</p>

<pre><code>wcs = astropy.wcs.WCS(....)
fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure()
pyplot_2 = fig.add_subplot(gridspec_layout[2], projection=wcs)
</code></pre>
