<p>I did some more research. Apparently, there is not really a good solution for this, other than getting a GPS device that reports it's location every time the direction of the device changes, as well as every 30 seconds (some hardware does this), and then draw straight lines between the markers.</p>

<p>Hopefully, with more powerfull google servers in the future, the Directions API will be able to support more than 8 (23) markers.</p>
