<p>I'm afraid that this can't be done in that easy way (just enable or disable some magic feature). For some simple requirement, you can use <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/UIImagePickerController/UIImagePickerController.html">cameraOverlayView</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/UIImagePickerController/UIImagePickerController.html">showsCameraControls</a> to make the implementation.</p>

<p>If you want to switch between photo/video mode, i think you can check this demo: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/AVCam/Introduction/Intro.html">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/AVCam/Introduction/Intro.html</a></p>
