<p>This is one of the thing you could do.</p>

<pre><code>[[4,5,6], [10,25,16]].transpose.map {|x| x.reduce(:+)}
</code></pre>

<p>Even <code>inject</code> would also do the same.</p>

<pre><code>[[10,20,30],[24,52,62]].transpose.map {|a| a.inject(:+)}
</code></pre>

<p>and to have more understanding. Please have a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2682411/ruby-sum-corresponding-members-of-two-arrays">ruby: sum corresponding members of two or more arrays</a></p>
