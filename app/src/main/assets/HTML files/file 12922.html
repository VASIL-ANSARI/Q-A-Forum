<p>It's an RTF file, not a plain text file. Its contents are encoded according to how RTF files are encoded, which involves escaping non-ASCII characters.</p>

<p>Because there's no native RTF support on iOS (there is on Mac OS X with <code>NSAttributedString</code>), you would have to roll your own RTF parser in order to read this file. I wouldn't recommend it. If the RTF file is actually being used to store attributes (such as <em>italic</em> or <strong>bold</strong> text), you'll have to go the parser route to convert it to an <code>NSAttributedString</code> or some other format.</p>

<p>If it's just plain text (and can therefore be fully represented by a Unicode string) then you should recreate the file as a TXT file using a known encoding (such as UTF-8) and <em>then</em> use <code>-[NSString initWithContentsOfFile:encoding:]</code> to read it.</p>
