<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html#module-copy" rel="nofollow"><code>copy</code></a> module:</p>

<pre><code>import copy

def __init__(self, point0, point1):

        self.point0 = copy.copy(point0)
        self.point1 = copy.copy(point1)
</code></pre>

<p>This is required if your point objects are mutable, such as a lists or dictionaries. If you are using immutable types, such as a <code>tuple</code>, then it would not be required to make a copy.</p>

<p>If your points are represented as lists, you can also make a copy of the list using this syntax:</p>

<pre><code>self.point0 = point0[:]
self.point1 = point1[:]
</code></pre>

<p>I could advise you with more certainty if you provided the definition of your point class.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong> after OP has posted <code>Point</code> class definition:</p>

<p>If <code>copy.copy()</code> is undesirable (why?) you can manually copy the attributes to the new <code>Point</code> instances:</p>

<pre><code>class Line(object):
    def __init__(self, point0, point1):
        self.point0 = Point(point0.x, point0.y)
        self.point1 = Point(point1.x, point1.y)
</code></pre>
