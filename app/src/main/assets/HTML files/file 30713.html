<p>You can just append extra bytes (payload) at the end of the file.
For example you can append a ZIP file with the dependencies.
You have a tiny tutorial <a href="http://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.1249" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Then you have to code the extraction however you want. Let's call loader the part of your program that has to extract and install the dependencies and then run the original main function. If you can't run the exe without the dependencies already installed then you need to create an external loader with no dependencies and add the main exe as a dependency (inside the zip).</p>

<p>If the file is signed you might find helpful this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5795446/appending-data-to-an-exe">question</a>.</p>
