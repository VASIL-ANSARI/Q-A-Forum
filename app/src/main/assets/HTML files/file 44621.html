<p>You're currently looking for a start date that is older than 24 hours and newer than 30 minutes. Which is impossible, and not what you stated you needed, so that isn't what you mean really. Looks like you just have your <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> comparisons the wrong way around:</p>

<pre><code>...
and WF.START_DATE &gt; SYSDATE - numtodsinterval ( LAST_OLDER_VAL, LAST_OLDER_VAL_UNIT )
and WF.START_DATE &lt; SYSDATE - numtodsinterval ( WF_WORKFLOW_ROW.KPI_FREQUENCY, WF_WORKFLOW_ROW.KPI_FREQ_TIME_UNIT );
</code></pre>

<p>Not directly relevant, but I'm not sure why you're using a loop for this, rather than a single <code>insert ... select</code> which joins <code>WF_WORKFLOW_CUR</code> and <code>WF_WORKFLOW@FONIC_RETAIL</code>. Or really why you'd use a stored procedure at all.</p>
