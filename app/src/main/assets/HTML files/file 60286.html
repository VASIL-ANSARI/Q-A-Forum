<p>You've given the ActionListener <em>behavior</em> -- it has an actionPerformed method, but you've yet to give it <em>state</em> -- fields that allow it to remember where it is and what it's done. A boolean field or two is likely all you need here. Either that or a JButton field where you place the last button pressed -- all depending on what you want to do with this information.</p>

<p>For instance, if you were coding a memory game, then you could have a JButton field that holds the last button pressed. If the field is null on actionPerformed, you know that the user is pressing the first button, and so you assign it to the field. If the field holds a button when actionPerformed is pressed, then you know the 2nd button is pressed. If it's not the same as the first, you compare image icons and behave accordingly, and then set the JButton field to null.</p>
