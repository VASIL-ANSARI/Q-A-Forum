<p>If requests are the same than results should be the same. Most likely you are not making exact copy of first request when composing fake one. Note that in case of tempData your composed request will work (get tempData) only if it is the first request with this data - so you have to make "copy" of request that is not yet send by application, you can't replay ones that rely on tempData.</p>

<p>The temp data be stored in the session state and wiped out after first request, so as result it will be invalid/missing if you are not correctly sending it information hand/via Fiddler composer OR (as in your case) making second request with the same information to the same controller.</p>
