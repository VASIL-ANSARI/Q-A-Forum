<p>Opcode caching only speeds up the loading of the original classes. When much of the time the code loops through a database result, creating complex objects, APC alone won't help.</p>

<p>Doctrine has support for caching Queries and results, however, caching in APC needs to be configured. See this URL: <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/doctrine/en/latest/en/manual/caching.html" rel="nofollow">http://readthedocs.org/docs/doctrine/en/latest/en/manual/caching.html</a> </p>

<p>Maybe you can use <code>apc_add</code> to cache the forms after they are created. This has the risk of presenting stale data to the user, but maybe it's worth it.</p>
