<p>To refresh part of a page you will need to use ajax to replace only the needed content. You will also need to use JavaScript to re-render the HTML contained in the partial. MVC comes with some ajax helpers or you can do it yourself with jquery. At the moment the action result is returning the partial as requested but the browser is being told it is receiving a whole new page and is displaying as such.</p>

<p>I would use jquery and do this yourself. Also try to remember that mvc is a server side framework to help you return http messages to the browser. You are trying to manipulate things client side. Live client side updates always need ajax to get data. Replacing items in the DOM needs some form of JavaScript. Libraries like jquery make this a lot easier. Have a look at jquery ajax <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
