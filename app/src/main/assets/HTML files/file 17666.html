<p>The code sample you pointed to uses input type="file". This input is presented as a "Browse" button in browsers. So this code does exactly what it should.</p>

<p>The event does not fire in jQuery because you never tell it to run. You should have something like</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {...}
</code></pre>

<p>to tell jQuery to execute when the page loads.</p>
