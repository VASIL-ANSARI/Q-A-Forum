<p>I suppose your problem is in the line:</p>

<pre><code>SKShapeNode *circ = (SKShapeNode *)[self childNodeWithName:@"/c"];
</code></pre>

<p>that could be:</p>

<pre><code>SKShapeNode *circ = (SKShapeNode *)[self childNodeWithName:@"//c"];
</code></pre>

<p>Differences according to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/sknode#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013023-CH1-SW74" rel="nofollow">API</a> reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When placed at the start of the search string, this indicates that
  the search should be performed on the treeâs root node. When placed
  anywhere but the start of the search string, this indicates that the
  search should move to the nodeâs children. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When placed at the start
  of the search string, this specifies that the search should begin at
  the root node and be performed recursively across the entire node
  tree. Otherwise, it performs a recursive search from its current
  position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could try to put also a breakpoint to the line below and check to the debug console the circ properties with <code>po circ.debugDescription</code> :</p>

<p>(breakpoint to the line:)
-> <code>circ.fillColor = [SKColor redColor];</code></p>

<p>You could try also to use a <code>customActionWithDuration</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SKAction* circleColor = [SKAction customActionWithDuration:0.5f actionBlock:^(SKNode *node, CGFloat elapsedTime)
{
    circ.fillColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:1.0f green:0.0f blue:0.0f alpha:1.0f];
    NSLog(@"changed to red");
}];
[circ runAction:circleColor];
</code></pre>
