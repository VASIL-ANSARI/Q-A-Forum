<p>That's an issue due to the installation of java on your machine.</p>

<p>/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/security/cacerts is a symlink to /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts</p>

<p>That file is generated by a post install script. IIRC the package is openjdk-7-jre-headless but I may be wrong.</p>

<p>Btw the script runs
sudo update-ca-certificates
and that generates the cacerts file.</p>

<p>So long story short, run sudo update-ca-certificates to generate the file and then you will manage to sync the grandle files with the project.</p>
