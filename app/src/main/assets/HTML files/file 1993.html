<p>I don't usually like to just code an entire answer to a question like this.  But also I just woke up, and I thought maybe your question would get me in a good mood to go program for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>I didn't try to run this, but it should work or at least get you 90% of the way there.</p>

<pre><code>function truncate( $string, $chars = 50, $terminate = ' ...' )
{
    $chars -= mb_strlen($terminate);
    if ( $chars &lt;= 0 )
        return $terminate;

    $string = mb_substr($string, 0, $chars);
    $space = mb_strrpos($string, ' ');

    if ($space &lt; mb_strlen($string) / 2)
        return $string . $terminate;
    else
        return mb_substr($string, 0, $space) . $terminate;
}
</code></pre>
