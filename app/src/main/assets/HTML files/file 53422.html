<p>There are several levels of caching involved. The first one is in the library itself. You mitigate it using <code>fflush</code>. The second one is in the operating system, called page cache. And there is the third one - hardware cache in the disk drive itself. </p>

<p>To avoid caching effects there can be several strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use files much larger then the amount of RAM available. This way the whole file cannot be cached in RAM.</p></li>
<li><p>Use special calls to make a direct disk access (look it up in the OS documentation), or flush OS cache as well like you do with library cache. For example with POSIX's <code>fsync</code> call.</p></li>
<li><p>You are most likely interested in the random access time. So create a big file (>RAM) and then read/write at random positions. </p></li>
</ul>
