<p>I would need to see the DOM code, but essentially if the element is added to the DOM (via PHP or AJAX) within the  tag and is syntactically valid then it will appear in the POST headers at time of submission. You could manually add a checkbox using dev tools in your browser of choice and the value would still post as the server has no prior knowledge of the page DOM submitting the request. The server is trusting that the browser is sending relevant information that is valid. If you post the DOM (Document Object Model - raw source HTML of the page after it is loaded and all values are added) then I might be able to help more.</p>
