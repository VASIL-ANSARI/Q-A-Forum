<p>Unfortunately there isn't an universal way for browsers to zoom everything. At least not without a whole lot of scripting. </p>

<p>In my opinion it's also pretty weird to design a website and force browsers to 90%. </p>

<p>Zooming isn't what people do a lot (on desktop). Why not design a page at 100%?</p>
