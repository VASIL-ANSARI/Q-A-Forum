<p>In section A, the "partTimeApproved" and in Section B, the "nowIsPartTimeApproved" is referring to same cell value. So it will only satisfy one of the if conditions. So if section A is executed, it will not execute Section B.</p>

<p>You have to either change the cell value(row[0]) to 'Y' in Section A or set the value for variable "nowIsPartTimeApproved" to 'Y' in Section A itself.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
