<p>What do you mean by not yet created? If you haven't created the ViewController or any sort of view in your storyboard, then no you cannot segue to a view that does not exist.  If you have created it then you can just call:</p>

<pre><code>UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:storyboardName bundle:nil];
UIViewController *homeView = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"HomeView"];
[self presentViewController:vc animated:YES(or NO) completion:nil];
</code></pre>
