<p>A good method for doing this is to store an updated_at  timestamp value on the row, and then retrieve that when you select the record for editing.</p>

<p>When you update, make it conditional on the updated_at matching.  If no rows are changed, return an error to the client that the record has been changed and give them the option to compare changes.  Try to avoid throwing all their changes away, that will drive your users crazy.</p>
