<p>You'll need to do a lot of calculations based on each image and whether it's position is either <strong>negative</strong> (meaning top of the parent scrollable div), or the same # as the <strong>height of your scrollable div</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>â$('.parent').scroll(function () {            
    console.log($('img').position().top);

    // if ( negative top position || same#asDivheight) { fadeIn / out, etc }
});â
</code></pre>

<p>Play around with that, but that's basically the jist of it.</p>
