<p><code>\Users\XXX\Documents\signature.png</code> is not a valid <em>URL</em>. If anything you have to use <code>file:///Users/...</code>. But you do know that only you will be able to see this signature and nobody you send the email to will, unless they happen to have the same file in the same directory, right?</p>
