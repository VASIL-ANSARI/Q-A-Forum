<p>The .NET stack size is fixed, and 1 MB by default. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to have such a well designed program (in terms of small reusable methods) that is becomes necessary to increase the stack size and hence use more resources?</p>

<p>It will not be in the decomposition of your logic into methods. </p>

<p>The only way you'll encounter a Stack Overflow that is not a direct bug is with recursion. And when that happens (threatens), don't increase the stack but rewrite the code to use a different way to store data (like a <code>Stack&lt;T&gt;</code>). </p>
