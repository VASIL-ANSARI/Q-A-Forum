<p>C++03 [$14.7.3/18] says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an explicit specialization declaration for a member of a class template or a member template that appears in namespace scope, the member template and some of its enclosing class templates may remain unspecialized, <strong>except that the declaration shall not explicitly specialize a class member template if its enclosing class templates  are  not  explicitly  specialized  as  well</strong>.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you need to specialize the enclosing class too. </p>

<p>Something like this would work.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;&gt;
template &lt;&gt;
void MyClass&lt;E_1&gt;::myMethod&lt;int&gt;(int value)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; '\n';
}
</code></pre>
