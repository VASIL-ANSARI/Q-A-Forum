<p>ContentControl is actually inherited from Control class. So the issue does not appear due to that. Property Changed mechanism will work, when a property value really changed. If the new value and old value are equal, there is no need to update the ViewModel.</p>

<p>Apart from that, Control class is the base class for most of the UI Elements in WPF. It holds the properties like Background, Foreground, Font, etc.</p>

<p>ContentControl is a class which represents an element, that can accept single item as child. For example, ListBoxItem, ComboBoxItem, etc are ContentControls.</p>
