<p>OK this is 3 months ago but still a relevant unanswered question. We had this problem and found that it's documented <a href="http://www.pantheios.org/doc/html/group__group____backend____stock__backends____file____flags.html" rel="nofollow">here for Windows</a>:</p>

<p>You need to set the PANTHEIOS_BE_FILE_F_SHARE_ON_WINDOWS flag so that the share mode parameter passed to CreateFile() in the be_file_Context::Open() method (pantheios bec.file.cpp) includes FILE_SHARE_WRITE.</p>

<p>For example, your pantheios_be_file_setFilePath() call could be:</p>

<pre><code>pantheios_be_file_setFilePath(your_path_name.c_str(),
  PANTHEIOS_BE_FILE_F_SHARE_ON_WINDOWS,
  PANTHEIOS_BE_FILE_F_SHARE_ON_WINDOWS,
  PANTHEIOS_BEID_ALL);
</code></pre>
