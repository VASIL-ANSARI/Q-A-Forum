<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/37738978/2069064">I mentioned</a> on your previous question, the underlying array for an <code>initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</code> is composed on <code>const</code> objects. Modifying objects declared <code>const</code> is <strong>undefined behavior</strong>. From [dcl.type.cv]:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except that any class member declared mutable (7.1.1) can be modified, any attempt to modify a const
  object during its lifetime (3.8) results in undefined behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One possible instantiation of undefined behavior is SIGSEV, which is what you see from gcc. Another possible instantiation is the code working, which is what you see in VC. Just don't do it. </p>
