<p>The background of a tab is actually a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/NinePatch.html" rel="nofollow">NinePatch</a> image, set into a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/StateListDrawable.html" rel="nofollow">StateListDrawable</a>. When you call <code>setBackgroundColor()</code>, you're replacing the set StateListDrawable with a simple color, so the entire tab turns into that color. What you'll need to do is actually modify (or draw your own) NinePatch tab images that are the color and style that you want for each state (e.g. focused, pressed, etc.). </p>

<p>Alternately, in code you could set a ColorFilter as described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1521640/standard-android-button-with-a-different-color/3485854#3485854">here</a> (<code>getBackground()</code> will work for a TabWidget as well as a button) but I'd recommend going the NinePatch route personally.</p>
