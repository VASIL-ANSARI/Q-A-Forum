<p>Looks like the problem is actually the:</p>

<pre><code>GROUP_CONCAT( DISTINCT Answer ORDER BY Answer SEPARATOR ',' ) AS Answer
</code></pre>

<p>part of the query.  Without seeing actual table structure and data it's very hard to form a mental image of what's going on.  "Answer" may be an ambiguous column and thus cause unpredictable results.</p>

<p>You might consider writing a subquery or creating a view for this.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT sa.StudentID, q.QuestionId, sa.Student_Answers
FROM (
     SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT a.Answer SEPERATOR ',') as Question_Answers
     FROM Student_Answer a
     GROUP BY a.QuestionID
) AS sa
INNER JOIN Question q ON (sa.QuestionId = q.QuestionId)
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at your code, there doesn't seem to be a need to join the Students table as the ID already exists in their answers.  Though I'm sure at some point you will associate names with ID's.</p>
