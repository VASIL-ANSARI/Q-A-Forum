<p>DOM events are not triggered by changing element's properties via javascript. Typically you would rely on a callback handler provided by the actual library to check when the field has changed, but it doesn't look like this particular library has a callback option. I would suggest using <strong>jQuery UI Datepicker</strong>, which does have this option.</p>
