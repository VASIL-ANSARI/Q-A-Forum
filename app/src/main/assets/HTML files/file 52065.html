<p>It is the way you are initializing the array. You currently have <code>private String[] nameArray = {};</code> which creates a new <code>String[]</code> with length 0 and explains the <code>IndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</p>

<p>What you want instead is <code>private String[] nameArray = new String[2];</code> which initializes a <code>String[]</code> that will hold two strings.</p>
