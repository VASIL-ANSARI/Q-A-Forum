<p>Yes, your understanding is correct. In either case you have to clearly define your API. If using Messenger, it is just async, custom messages so if you need your service to send data back you would need some type of similar mechanism on the client side as well. Using AIDL and binders is more in-line with what you describe you'd like to do.</p>
