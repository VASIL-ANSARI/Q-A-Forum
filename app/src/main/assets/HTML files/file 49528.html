<p>Sidekiq and rails run in separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_%28computing%29" rel="nofollow">processes</a>, so they can't share memory. If you can't share memory, you have other options:</p>

<ol>
<li>filesystem</li>
<li>object storage service (e.g. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" rel="nofollow">S3</a>)</li>
<li>database (e.g. redis)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal" rel="nofollow">signals</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The database is the most common choice, but a filesystem or object storage is more appropriate for many tasks, like image processing. Signals have limited functionality and I only list them here for completeness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simple Rails.cache.write('result') in sidekiq job and Rails.cache.read('result') in some_action don't work.</p>

<p>Maybe you are using <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#activesupport-cache-memorystore" rel="nofollow">ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore</a>, which wouldn't work across processes, because processes don't share memory. There are other cache stores, but be aware of the trade-offs before switching.</p>
