<p>Since the button click event handler is just a method, you could just do:</p>

<pre><code>private void Form1_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) {
    if (e.KeyData == Keys.A) {
        button1_Click(this, e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, it's often a better idea to move the <em>logic</em> into a separate method, and call it from both locations.  By refactoring the logic within <code>button1_Click</code> into it's own method, you make it clear that you're calling that logic from either set of event handlers.</p>
