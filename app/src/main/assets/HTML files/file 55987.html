  <p>My Question is Since the approach is based on thread how the return statement is not executed till all the API threads get completed...</p>

<p>Read the JavaDoc on <code>Future#get()</code>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means the loop is blocked until the current iteration's future get its result, i.e. when the loop is finished you know that all threads have finished.</p>

  <p>Any chance of return statement will return empty list?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, e.g. if <code>IDS</code> is empty or if all the threads fail with an exception. </p>
