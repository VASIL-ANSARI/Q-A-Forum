<p>No it's not. You could use <code>fwrite(&amp;a, sizeof(int), 2, fo)</code>, but you shouldn't either. Just strolling over raw memory is seldom a good idea when it comes to safety, because you should not rely on specific memory layouts. Someone could introduce another variable <code>c</code> between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, without noticing that he's breaking your code. If you want to access your variables, do that explicitly. Don't just access the memory where you <em>think</em> the variables are or where they once were the last time you checked.</p>
