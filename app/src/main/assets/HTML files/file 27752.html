<p>You're right, there isn't a space formatting option for handling the increment/decrement operators in Visual Studio 2012, or any version as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Like the commenters pointed out, it seems as it's almost universally practiced that the <code>++</code>  and <code>--</code> operators come immediately before or after the variable it's operating on. I understand your position on preference for code formatting, so here's a few suggestions if resolving this issue has that much impact on your daily coding life:</p>

<p>Check out ReSharper, a productivity tool for Visual Studio that has the capability to extend auto formatting. In fact, they have a whole section dealing with spacing around operators:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7DQgF.jpg" alt="operator spacing"> </p>

<p>Though not on the list, you could suggest a possible implementation of the <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> operators to the devs, since a vast majority of the other operators are accounted for. I suppose this is something you could suggest to the Visual Studio team as well, but I'm not sure how much success you'd have.</p>

<p>Extending the above, you could opt instead to use the <code>+=</code> or <code>-=</code> operators, which have auto spacing capability. Rather than: </p>

<pre><code>int i = 0; i ++;
</code></pre>

<p>You would have:</p>

<pre><code>int i = 0; i += 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Which is functionally equivalent and no less right or wrong than using the increment/decrement operator to begin with. I'm not sure if Visual Studio has this functionality out of the box, but if you're willing to ditch the ++/-- it may be worth a look.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
