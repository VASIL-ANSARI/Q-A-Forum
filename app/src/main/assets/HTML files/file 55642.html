<p>Ok I found the problem, and a solution.</p>

<p>The Problem was that my CustomPermissionEvaluator depended on a method within the StakeholderService. Even though that method was not secured this resulted in the Spring not being able to proxy the object, therefore preventing any security checks. </p>

<p>Even though it is a bad idea to use a service layer object in the PermissionEvaluator, perhaps someone could elaborate on the exact implications, as i am definately not an expert in spring sercurity</p>
