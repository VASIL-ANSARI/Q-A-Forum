<h1>Part 1: <code>=</code> vs <code>==</code></h1>

<p>Note that:</p>

<pre><code>if(timeLeavingTP=1.00)
</code></pre>

<p>Does not do what you expect. It assigns timeLeavingTP with 1.00.</p>

<p>You probably want:</p>

<pre><code>if(timeLeavingTP==1.00)
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, note that this error occurs 6 times in your program.</p>

<h1>Part 2: comparing floating point numbers</h1>

<p>Your code might work in this case, but I'm not 100% sure if it will or not. It's often difficult to directly compare 2 floating point numbers, because of the inaccuracy of storing them (for example, 0.1 is usually not representable in floating point).</p>

<p>Most people solve this problem in one of a few ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Test a range around the number.</li>
<li>Convert to some fixes width format. Perhaps you could store the number as an integer, knowing that it's representation is actually 0.01 * the stored number.</li>
<li>In this case, you could actually just store the information as strings, and compare those.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Part 3: conditionals</h1>

<p>To write a proper conditional, it should look like:</p>

<pre><code>if (condition) {
    ...
} else if (condition) {
    ...
} else if (condition) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can certainly nest conditionals as well:</p>

<pre><code>if (condition) {
    if (condition) {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }
} else if (condition) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your code, for example, messes this up when you do:</p>

<pre><code>    } 
    else(transitNumber=8);
    {
        transitTime=1.39;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the else statement does not accept a conditional after it.</p>

<h1>Part 4: excessive semicolons</h1>

<p>Additionally, note that after the else and if statements there are no semicolons. The semicolons only appear within the braces. So this statement:</p>

<pre><code>if(timeLeavingTP=6.30);
</code></pre>

<p>While semantically valid, does not do what you expect. You actually want to remove that semicolon.</p>
