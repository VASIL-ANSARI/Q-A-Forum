<p>Not sure how you are instantiating ResourceManager, but when you call ResourceManager.GetString(), you can specify CultureInfo, which helps you fetch the string in correct locale. So you can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>var string = ResourceManager.GetString("ResourceKey", new CUltureInfo("en-GB"));
</code></pre>

<p>This will make sure that the string key is from the en-GB specific Resource file.</p>
