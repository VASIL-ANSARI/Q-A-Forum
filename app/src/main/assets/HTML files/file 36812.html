<p>The ASCII code represents a standard character value, ASCII also needs to represent A-Z, symbols etc.
So the ASCII for 2 (as a character is 38).
This 2 is non numerical and simply represents a symbol humans identify as 2.</p>

<p>An actual numerical value of 2 only needs 2 bits, where ASCII requires many for the range of symbols it represents.</p>
