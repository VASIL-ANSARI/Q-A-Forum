<p>There may be two reasons;</p>

<ol>
<li>There may be a syntax mistake in the SQL Query.</li>
<li>There may be duplicate entries for the primary key.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you are reading the data from a text file, I suggest you to use the <code>Load Data Local InFile</code> Query in SQL.
This would resolve both of the above issues and all your genuine entries would be uploaded into the database.</p>

<p>If this doesn't help, kindly add the queries to your question and the stacktrace would be helpful to answer.
