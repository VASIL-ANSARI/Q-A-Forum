<p><code>x++ &gt; 5</code> means check the value of <code>x</code> against <code>5</code> <em>then</em> increment it. Which means your <code>break</code> is not reached until <code>x == 7</code>.</p>

<p>The result would be 6 if you used <code>++x</code>, i.e. increment x <em>and then</em> test it against 5.</p>
