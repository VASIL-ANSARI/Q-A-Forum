<p>In short, you can't.</p>

<p>At least, not reliably and not in any sane way.   Nor, frankly, should bother;   that level of defensive programming is utterly futile in the face of a C based language.</p>

<p>At the least, you would need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>validate that the pointer is pointing to accessible memory</li>
<li>pointing to a current allocation</li>
<li>the first address sized chunk points to an Objective-C class (including derived classes, possibly)</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, any code that makes heavy use of <code>isKindOfClass:</code> and <code>respondsToSelector:</code> (outside of the delegation pattern) is quite atypical to the norms of Objective-C design patterns.  </p>

<p>Or, to put it another way, you have a static type checking compiler that is quite good at checking lots of validity parameters at compile time.  Use it.</p>
