<p>If you add this meta array:</p>

<h3>In your PHP code:</h3>

<pre><code>array(
    "fieldname" =&gt; "cancel",
    "fieldid" =&gt; "form-cancel-button"
);
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use Javascript to handle this buttons' actions. Since you've already included jQuery for use with ValidForm Builder, you can do something similar like this:</p>

<h3>In your Javascript code:</h3>

<pre><code>$("#form-cancel-button")
    .off("click") // remove ValidForm's default handlers
    .on("click", function () {
        window.history.go(-1);
        return false;
    });
</code></pre>

<p>That should do the trick. But in my opinion, a cancel button shouldn't 'go back'. A cancel button should just clear the form and stay on the current page.</p>

<h3>ValidForm Builder syntax</h3>

<p>By the way, I see you're using $_POST to fetch data from your posted form. That's a big no-go. ValidForm Builder enables you to validate and sanitize user input before using it in the rest of your application (like SQL queries). The syntax to extract a value from ValidForm Builder (when submitted and validated) is this:</p>

<pre><code>$strFieldValue = $objForm-&gt;getValidField("fieldname")-&gt;getValue();
</code></pre>

<p>Thisway, you know the user input has been validated by ValidForm Builder and is safe to use.</p>
