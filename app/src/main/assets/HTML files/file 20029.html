<p>You have to use a bigger image href in the anchor tag, it isnt automatic. You link to a bigger version of the picture and instead of the browser taking you there it shows it in a fancybox. But you still have to supply the image.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="images/here_big.jpg" rel="lightbox[gallery]"&gt;&lt;img src="images/here.jpg" alt="FAST Festival Image Gallery"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
