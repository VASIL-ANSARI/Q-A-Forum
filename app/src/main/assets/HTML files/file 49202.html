<p>First, you are using the incorrect cheerio function. You need <code>.map</code> not <code>.each</code>. <code>Each</code> just iterates without returning anything useful based on the code in the iterator function, whereas <code>map</code> collects everything returned by the iterator function into an array. So switch to <code>.map</code> and you should end up with an array of strings (assuming your selectors and HTML parsing is otherwise correct). You'll have <code>["Name 1", "Name 2", "Name 3"]</code>.</p>

<p>Then you need to convert that to your desired format which is an array of objects so you need another call to <code>.map</code> here.</p>

<pre><code>res.json(classes.map(function (name) {return {name: name}}));
</code></pre>
