<p>I think you can replace the code of Intent and message with this:</p>

<pre><code>Bundle bundle = getIntent().getExtras();
String message = "";
try{
    message = bundle.getString("rss-url"");
}catch(nullpointerException e){
    //System.out.println("No String Extra");
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, i think the following code is useless. It's should be removed instead.</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = getIntent();
String message = intent.getStringExtra("rss-url");
</code></pre>

<p>If it doesn't work, make sure that the id "webView1" is included in the layout "activity_website_open.xml".</p>
