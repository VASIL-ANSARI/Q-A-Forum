  <p>where am I wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You are wrong trying to reopen your app once it's been destroyed</strong>. This is a hacky behavior...</p>

<p>Never then less you can achieve your goal by using <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/es/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html" rel="nofollow">alarm manager</a> and set an alarm for every second or so, to check if your app is alive, if its not you can bring it back.</p>

<p>Also pay atention:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beginning with API 19 (KITKAT) alarm delivery is inexact: the OS
  will shift alarms in order to minimize wakeups and battery use. There
  are new APIs to support applications which need strict delivery
  guarantees; see setWindow(int, long, long, PendingIntent) and
  setExact(int, long, PendingIntent). Applications whose
  targetSdkVersion is earlier than API 19 will continue to see the
  previous behavior in which all alarms are delivered exactly when
  requested.</p>
