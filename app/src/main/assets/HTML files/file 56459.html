<p>I describes the initial velocity in Y-direction. The unit is <em>pixels/second</em>. So the higher (positive) the number is the faster you scroll to the top. The lower (negative) it is the faster you scroll to the bottom.</p>

<p>It's described in the documentation of <code>android.widget.OverScroller</code></p>
