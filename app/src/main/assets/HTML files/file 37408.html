<p>This will first collect the selected Items from FlowerlistBox, then add them to the Total1istBox, then remove them from FlowerlistBox and finally clear the list.</p>

<p>Note that your code has different spelling for FlowerlistBox and probably ought to spell TotalListBox.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;object&gt; theItems = new List&lt;object&gt;();
foreach (object item in FlowerlistBox.SelectedItems) theItems.Add(item);
foreach (object item in theItems) Total1istBox.Items.Add(item);
foreach (object item in theItems) FlowerlistBox.Items.Remove(item);
theItems.Clear();
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for first collecting the items is that when we finally want to remove them we can't modify the collection we would need to iterate.</p>
