<p>From the manual: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.include.php" rel="nofollow">include function</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a file is included, the code it contains inherits the variable scope of the line on which the include occurs. Any variables available at that line in the calling file will be available within the called file, from that point forward. However, all functions and classes defined in the included file have the global scope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you should rename your classes, since the scope is global.</p>
