<p>Your CPU will be higher for reads because TokuDB data needs to be decompressed to be used. Also, if this slave is processing any activity from the master than it's also doing compression for the insert/update/delete activity.</p>

<p>Couple of ideas.
1. Reduce the value of tokudb_block_size. While 4MB is great for compression it means that your point queries need to decompress a lot more data than they have to. Try using 256KB and see how CPU and performance changes. You might have to rebuild your slave to accomplish this easily (I'm now over a year away from working at TokuDB).
2. Look at your tokudb_cache_size. It defaults to 50% of RAM, but if nothing else is on this server you should up it to somewhere between 75% and 80%. This will mean less reads and decompression since more data will be in your cache.</p>
