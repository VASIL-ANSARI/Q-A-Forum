<p>You can't hide it if it is extended, but you can override.</p>

<p>if you want your API user to not use the method I suggest a override and just throw this exception:</p>

<pre><code>UnsupportedOperationException
</code></pre>

<p>but looking from what you write, you should consider making Date a field in your class, not extend the class.</p>
