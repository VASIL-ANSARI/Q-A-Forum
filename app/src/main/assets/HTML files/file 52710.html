<p>The reason is quite simple, you need to garante that some values you use are not going to explote your app because are not initialized Exception.</p>

<h1>HOW?</h1>

<p>like this:</p>

<p>when you do this:</p>

<pre><code> System.out.printf("Top two students:\n%s's score is %3.1f\n%s's score is %3.1f\n", topStudent1, highScore, topStudent2, nextHighScore);
</code></pre>

<p>then you are using the variables and passing those as parameters, but they are not initialized, so the method printf, has no idea about what is goint to print at compiling time, therefore they must be initialized to something (in this case null can be accepted too).</p>
