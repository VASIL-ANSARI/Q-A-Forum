<p>I had a similar <code>WARN: Unresolved specs during Gem::Specification.reset:</code> message when I did <code>middleman build</code> I'm on a Mac using rvm with <code>ruby 2.0.0p247 (2013-06-27 revision 41674) [x86_64-darwin12.3.0]</code>. I found an <a href="https://github.com/mpapis/rubygems-bundler/issues/48" rel="nofollow">issue post</a> on GitHub with a similar WARN and the fix was to run <code>gem regenerate_binstubs</code>. It cleared the WARN for me. I'm not sure exactly what that does but it clears up a few issues with rubygems-bundler.</p>
