<p>The compiler treats List as List (without type information) so there is no way to get the generic type via reflection.</p>

<p>What you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>scan each element of the list and find the most specific common super class</li>
<li>scan each element of the list and find all common interfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>Both approaches would iterate over the list elements and then reflectively scan the class hierarchy.</p>
