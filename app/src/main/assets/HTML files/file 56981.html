<p>I can think of two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>a command line interface to your mock classes (like <code>input</code>)</li>
<li>a service you can invoke from command line (using <code>service call SERVICE CODE [i32 INT | s16 STR] ...</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can provide a more detailed example perhaps other options would come to mind.</p>
