<p>The <em>only</em> condition that can change the base constructor used is the actual constructor that is called - find another approach to the problem :)</p>

<p>A factory method is one way, as noted. Also, I believe <a href="http://www.ninject.org/" rel="nofollow">Ninject</a> (and possibly other DI frameworks) allows choosing different constructors dynamically based upon argument <em>values</em>. Sadly, I do not have enough DI experience ..</p>

<p>Another possibility in this case is to take in <code>int?</code> which, while it does change the interface, would allow <code>null</code> to be easily coalesced to the default value.</p>
