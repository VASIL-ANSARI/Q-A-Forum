<li><code>dealloc</code> will be automatically sent to an object that has no more owners (i.e. every object  that retained it, <code>release</code>d it)</li>
<li><code>[super dealloc]</code> invokes the dealloc method of the superclass (the parent class for the current object). Since almost every class in the Cocoa framework is subclassed at least from <code>NSObject</code>, this line is necessary for proper memory release.</li>
</ul>
