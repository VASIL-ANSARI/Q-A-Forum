<p>There's a very simple answer that might work, depending on the complexity of your strings. (And me understanding you correctly, i.e. you just want to get the <em>cleaned up</em> strings, not actually extract the tags.) Just remove all tags. Replace</p>

<pre><code>\[.*?]
</code></pre>

<p>with nothing. <a href="https://regex101.com/r/cI2hF0/1" rel="nofollow">Example here</a></p>

<p>Now, if your string should be able to contain tag-like objects this might not work.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
