<p>Sounds like you need to schedule a job with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" rel="nofollow">cron</a>. cron will just run a script/program, so the implementation of that will be distinct from the scheduling itself. </p>

<p>Cron will just fire/forget, so you can invoke processes of any duration from it (I'm looking at your execution time comment below - please amend if I've misunderstood)</p>
