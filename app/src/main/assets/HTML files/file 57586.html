<p>First you have the key "Question" two times. Because of this the second value overwrites the first. Fix that by calling the first "QuestionId" or calling the sub-object after the id.
example: </p>

<pre><code>var json = '[
    1:{"Question":"Question Number 1","Answer":"Answer1","NextQuestion":3},
    2:{"Question":"Question Number 2","Answer":"Answer2","NextQuestion":5},
    3:{"Question":"Question Number 3","Answer":"Answer3","NextQuestion":7},
  ]';
</code></pre>

<p>Also it is only logical to use a json syntax, if you get the data from a ajax request or similar. Otherwise you should use the normal Object initialization.</p>

<p>At the moment you are running through all key val pairs. Add a new Field "NextQuestion", which contains the next question id, if the answer is correct. Then you want a logic like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask question (display it)</li>
<li>Check the answer (in event listener of "ok" button)</li>
<li>if it is correct start again with the question with the id in "NextQuestion" and if it is wrong start again with the next question</li>
</ol>

<p>this can be realized by recursion or a loop. </p>
