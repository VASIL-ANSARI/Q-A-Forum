<p>I believe the content assist is working fine but you are getting different experience because of the inner class.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> : <code>new RecordClickHandler() {......}</code> block is an inline implementation of the <code>RecordClickHandler</code> and it doesn't have same same level of visibility of the outer class attributes/methods.</p>
