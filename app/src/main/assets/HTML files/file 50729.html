<p>You need to increment the time in your loop and recalculate the TotalAmount on the basis of the new time.</p>

<p>You do not need to use the count variable.</p>

<pre><code>        int time = 1;//1 means 1 year

        int num = 0;

        Console.WriteLine("Enter current balance:");
        double Bal = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        Console.WriteLine("Enter required balance:");
        double required = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        Console.WriteLine("Enter interest rate: %");
        double IR = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        double TotalAmount = Bal * IR / 100 * time + Bal;//math to work out interest gained

        Console.WriteLine("Your balance at the end of year 1 is {0:C}", TotalAmount);//this shows the interest gained over 1 year

        //do
        //{
        // Console.WriteLine(Bal);
        // Bal++;
        // } while (Bal &lt; required);

        //I need the code to keep looping until the bal is the same as required
        do
        {
            time++;
            TotalAmount = Bal * IR / 100 * time + Bal;//math to work out interest gained

        } while (TotalAmount &lt; required);
        Console.WriteLine("It took {0} years to get to {1:C}", time, required);
</code></pre>
