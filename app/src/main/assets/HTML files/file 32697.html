<p>Here is one approach.  However, instead of producing three columns, it puts the results in a single column with the values concatenated:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT s.* , round( coalesce( avg( n.note ) , 0 ) , 1 ) AS average, g.genres
FROM serie s LEFT JOIN
     note n
     ON s.id_serie = n.id_serie LEFT JOIN
     (select substring_index(group_concat(distinct g.genre order by random()), ',', 3) as genres
      from genre g
      group by g.id_serie
    ) g
    on g.id_serie = s.id_serie
GROUP BY s.id_serie
ORDER BY average DESC
</code></pre>
