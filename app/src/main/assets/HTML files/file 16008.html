<p>In SmartMS, regular expressions are implemented in the w3regex unit so you start by adding <code>w3regex</code> to the <code>uses</code> list.</p>

<p>'Short' form (such as <code>var re = /\w+\s/g;</code> from the question) is not supported. To create a regular expression object, you have to use a constructor.</p>

<pre><code>re := TW3RegEx.Create('\w+\s', 'g');
</code></pre>

<p>Built-in string object does not support regex matching. To simplify usage, the <code>w3regex</code> unit implements string helpers which introduce Match, Replace, Search and Split methods to the string object. </p>

<p>A direct translation of your code would be</p>

<pre><code>var re := TW3Regex.Create('\w+\s', 'g');
var str := 'fee fi fo fum';
var myArray := str.Match(re);
</code></pre>

<p>(As for logging, I don't know at the moment how to nicely write a string array to a console but that was not part of the question.)</p>

<p>w3regex implements few overloads for the Match method which will create regex object on the fly for you. As you can also apply helper methods to a string literal, you can shorten the code to:</p>

<pre><code>var myArray: TStrArray = ('fee fi fo fum').Match('\w+\s', 'g');
</code></pre>

<p>Parenthesis around the string literal are required in this case.</p>

<p>Many ways of using the regex in SmartMS are documented in the RegExDemo program which is part of the installation.</p>
