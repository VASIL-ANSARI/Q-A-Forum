<p>I have not personally tested SQLite vs MySQL, but it is easy to find examples on the web that say the opposite (<a href="http://zenadmin.org/en/blog/post720.html" rel="nofollow">for instance</a>).  You do ask a question that is not quite so religious:  is that argument valid?</p>

<p>First, the essence of the argument is somewhat specious.  A Unix socket would be used to communicate to a database server.  A "file database" seems to refer to the fact that communication is through a compiled-in interface.  In the terminology of SQLite, it is <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/serverless.html" rel="nofollow">server-less</a>.  Most databases store data in files, so the terminology "file database" is a little misleading.</p>

<p>Performance of a database involves multiple factors, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication of query to the database.</li>
<li>Speed of compilation (ability to store pre-compiled queries is a plus here).</li>
<li>Speed of processing.</li>
<li>Ability to handle complex processing.</li>
<li>Compiler optimizations and execution engine algorithms.</li>
<li>Communication of results back to the application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having the interface be compiled-in affects the first and last of these.  There is nothing that prevents a server-less database from excelling at the rest.  However, database servers are typically millions of lines of code -- much larger than SQLite.  A lot of this supports extra functionality.  Some of it supports improved optimizations and better algorithms.</p>

<p>As with most performance questions, the answer is to test the systems yourself on your data in your environment.  Being server-less is not an automatic performance gain.  Having a server doesn't make a database "better".  They are different applications designed for different optimization points.</p>
