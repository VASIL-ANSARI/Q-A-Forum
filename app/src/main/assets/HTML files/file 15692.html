<p>You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd383571.aspx">Directory.EnumerateFiles</a> instead of <code>GetFiles</code>.  This has the advantage of returning the files as an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code>, which allows you to begin your processing of the result set immediately (instead of waiting for the entire list to be returned).</p>

<p>If you're merely counting the number of files or listing all files, it may not help.  If, however, you can do your processing and/or filtering of the results, and especially if you can do any of it in other threads, it can be significantly faster.</p>

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The EnumerateFiles and GetFiles methods differ as follows: When you use EnumerateFiles, you can start enumerating the collection of names before the whole collection is returned; when you use GetFiles, you must wait for the whole array of names to be returned before you can access the array. Therefore, when you are working with many files and directories, EnumerateFiles can be more efficient.</p>
