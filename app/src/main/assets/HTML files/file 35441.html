<p>My recommendation would be to loop over the panels in the winform.  For each panel, get the usercontrol.  Then, loop over each control in the usercontrol.  If the control is a RadioButton, then check it against the database.  I'm not sure how you are matching the radio buttons to the database, but perhaps the Text attribute of the RadioButton matches up.</p>

<pre><code>foreach Control panel in winform.Controls:
    // Type check
    if panel is Panel:
        // Get the user control from the panel
        UserControl usrCtrl = panel.usercontrol as UserControl
        foreach Control control in usrCtrl.Controls:
            // Type check
            if control is RadioButton:
                // do database stuff
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I would suggest setting the Tag attribute of your RadioButtons when assigning values from the database.  The Tag attribute can hold anything you want it to.  For example, you might set Tag to <code>YourTableName.YourColumnName</code>.  This way you can keep track of what field the RadioButton corresponds to.</p>
