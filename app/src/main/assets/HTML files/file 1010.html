<p>The destructor will be called when the all references are freed, or when the script terminates.  I assume this means when the script terminates properly.  I would say that critical exceptions would not guarantee the destructor to be called.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://au2.php.net/__construct">PHP documentation</a> is a little bit thin, but it does say that Exceptions in the destructor will cause issues.</p>
