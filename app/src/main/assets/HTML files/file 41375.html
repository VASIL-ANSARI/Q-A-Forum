<p>HTML was developed on UNIX systems which were not limited to three letter extensions. The <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" rel="nofollow">first website</a> used <code>.html</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>l</code> was dropped when people wrote HTML on DOS/Windows machines that predated Windows 95.</p>

<p>When people stopped using those systems, they stopped dropping the <code>l</code>.</p>
