<p>Nothing is being rotated, because OpenGL does not "store" objects.</p>

<p>glRotatef, like glMultMatrixf, is used to modify the currently selected transformation matrix. This has an effect on how things are drawn subsequently. One sets the matrices (and other stuff!) how one wants, and then one draws one's objects.</p>

<p>For more information, see the OpenGL redbook, and google around for the difference between "retained mode" and "immediate mode".</p>
