<p>REST mostly just refers to using the HTTP protocol the way it was intended. Use the <code>GET</code> HTTP method on a URL to retrieve information, possibly in different formats based on HTTP <code>Accept</code> headers. Use the <code>POST</code> HTTP method to create new items on the server, <code>PUT</code> to edit existing items, <code>DELETE</code> to delete them. Make the API idempotent, i.e. repeating the same query with the same information should yield the same result. Structure your URLs in a hierarchical manner etc.</p>

<p>REST just is a guiding principle how to use URLs and the HTTP protocol to structure an API. It says nothing about return formats, which may just as well be JSON.</p>

<p>That is opposed to, for example, APIs that send binary or XML messages to a designated port, not using differences in HTTP methods or URLs at all.</p>
