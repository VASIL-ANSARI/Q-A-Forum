<p>I think it should hydrate with the query result by default, unless you have changed <code>Doctrine_Core::ATTR_HYDRATE_OVERWRITE</code>.  You can check the value with:</p>

<pre><code>$doctrineManager = Doctrine_Manager::getInstance();
$val = $doctrineManager-&gt;getAttribute(Doctrine::ATTR_HYDRATE_OVERWRITE); 
</code></pre>

<p>When you call refresh(), it forces this value to true, and does the query again, and then restores the setting.  If yours happens to be false, you can change it with <code>$doctrineManager-&gt;setAttribute</code></p>
