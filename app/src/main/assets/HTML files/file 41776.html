<p><code>GET /proView.MHL H.jpg HTTP/1.0</code> is not a valid request line, which is what your PHP is generating, and is why you're getting a <code>400 Bad Request</code> error.</p>

<p>The solution is to appropriately encode the file, although the simplest way may just be to handle the case of spaces (<code>str_replace(' ','%20',$productdetails['img'][0])</code>) as this is the only real problem-causer.</p>
