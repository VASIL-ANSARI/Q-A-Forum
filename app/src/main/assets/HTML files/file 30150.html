<p>In addition to continuous monitoring, you can also invoke inspections on demand with Cmd-Option-Shift-I, and enforce inspections prior to VCS commits(although it does not prevent you from committing your code with command line). You can also create specific inspection profiles, one for the university submissions, and another for your side projects, for example.</p>
