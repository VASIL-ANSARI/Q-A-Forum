<p>I'll put this here as comments aren't a suitable for the formatting.</p>

<p>As to your "translucent" methods, they seem fine to me.  The only change I might make is create a compatible buffered image instead.  This will (amongst other things) ensure that the colour model is the same and make it faster to render...</p>

<pre><code>protected BufferedImage createCompatibleImage(int width, int height, int transparency) {
    GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
    GraphicsDevice gs = ge.getDefaultScreenDevice();
    GraphicsConfiguration gc = gs.getDefaultConfiguration();
    return gc.createCompatibleImage(width, height, transparency);
}

private BufferedImage getTranslucentImage(BufferedImage oldImg, float alpha) {
    int w = oldImg.getWidth();
    int h = oldImg.getHeight();
    BufferedImage newImg = createCompatibleImage(w, h, Transparency.TRANSLUCENT);
    Graphics2D g2d = newImg.createGraphics();
    g2d.setComposite(AlphaComposite.getInstance(AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER, alpha));
    g2d.drawImage(oldImg, null, 0, 0);
    g2d.dispose();
    return newImg;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATED with extended answer</strong></p>

<p>I order to achieve what you want, you would need a clean version of the parent component.  That is a copy without any children.  You would then need size and paint this copy to a off screen buffer (like a buffered image) and then extract the portion of the image you want (or paint the sub image based on your requirements).</p>

<p>To be frank. What you are doing is simply easier...</p>
