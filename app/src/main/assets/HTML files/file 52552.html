<p><code>frame</code> only has context from within your <code>static</code> method <code>gui</code>. Start by getting rid of the <code>static</code> declaration and make <code>frame</code> an instance field of the class</p>

<pre><code>public class lGui
{
    private JFrame frame;
    private JTextField field;
    private JLabel l;
    private JPasswordField p;
    private JButton login, cancel;
    private JCheckBox check;

    public void gui()
    {
        //...
</code></pre>

<p>You also won't need the <code>static</code> declarations on the inner classes...</p>

<pre><code>protected class cancelAction implements ActionListener
{
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
    {
        frame.dispose();            
    }
}

protected class loginAction implements ActionListener
{
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
    {

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You might find it easier to make initialise the UI from within the classes constructor instead of the <code>gui</code> method, leaving it to show the window</p>

<p>You should also avoid using <code>null</code> layouts, pixel perfect layouts are an illusion within modern ui design.  There are too many factors which affect the individual size of components, none of which you can control. Swing was designed to work with layout managers at the core, discarding these will lead to no end of issues and problems that you will spend more and more time trying to rectify</p>

<p>Instead, have a look at <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/index.html" rel="nofollow">Laying Out Components Within a Container</a> for some more ideas</p>
