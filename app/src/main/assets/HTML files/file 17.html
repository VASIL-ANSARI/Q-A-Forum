<p>You can use <code>the Row_Number()</code> function.
Its used as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Row_Number() OVER(ORDER BY UserName) As RowID, UserFirstName, UserLastName
FROM Users
</code></pre>

<p>From which it will yield a result set with a <code>RowID</code> field which you can use to page between.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM 
    ( SELECT Row_Number() OVER(ORDER BY UserName) As RowID, UserFirstName, UserLastName
      FROM Users 
    ) As RowResults
WHERE RowID Between 5 AND 10
</code></pre>

<p>etc</p>
