  <p>what is the most easy and secure protocol to use to perform api requests from UWP to an ASP Core server?</p>

<p>I'd like to say this is a open question and I will give some suggestions and hope it can help you. Basic authentication and digest authentication you mentioned are defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt" rel="nofollow">rfc2617</a>. Since you don't want to use them, besides HTTP Basic/Digest you may have other choices like OAuth, HMAC and Azure API Management.</p>

<ol>
<li>Since you don't want the user to input username and password, to request an access token for authentication may meet your requirements. So I recommend you to use OAuth authentication which is popular. More details about OAuth2.0 please reference <a href="https://oauth.net/2/" rel="nofollow">this</a>. But it requires OAuth server, it may not be a easiest way.</li>
<li><p>Another way you can apply HMAC authentication to secure Web Api. HMAC authentication uses a secret key for each consumer. For more details about HMAC authentication please reference <a href="http://%20http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11775594/how-to-secure-an-asp-net-web-api" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.  For more details about HMAC in uwp please reference <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/macs-hashes-and-signatures" rel="nofollow">MACs, hashes, and signatures</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>You can also use third party tools from Azure. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/" rel="nofollow">Azure API management</a> can help secure and optimize your APIs.
