<p>After looking up for hours, it seems that time.h for some apparent reason has been used in ffmpeg 1.2.1 (this is what I tested). This caused conflict with the OS's own file of the same name.</p>

<p>While I cannot code in PHP (and can barely read PHP code), I have found a git repo maintained by <a href="https://github.com/tony2001" rel="nofollow">tony2001</a> who has made changes to the original project and using his repo has helped me install it successfully on CentOS-6.2, CentOS-6.3 and CentOS-6.4 (Sorry I haven't tested these on any other flavour but I guess if it works on CentOS-6.4, it should work on RHEL 5.x and 6.x too)</p>

<p>You can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/tony2001/ffmpeg-php" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you in the future (and maybe someone else who lands up here eventually)</p>

<p>PS: Incidentally, at the time of writing this answer ffmpeg 2.0 has been released but I haven't got a chance to test it yet</p>
