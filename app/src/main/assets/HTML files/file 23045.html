<p>I have the same problem on Max OS X too. It's definitely a server configuration issue as exactly the same code works perfectly well on Windows and multiple Linux environments.</p>

<p>My Apache/PHP was installed on the Mac through XAMPP. Others who are suffering from the same issue, please let me know in the comments if you too are using XAMPP. I want to track down the exact server config that is causing this problem.</p>

<p>For now, I have a hacky workaround:</p>

<p>In <strong>fuel/core/bootstrap.php</strong>, add this to the top of your <code>register_shutdown_function</code></p>

<pre><code>$last_error = error_get_last();
if (is_array($last_error) &amp;&amp; \Fuel::$env == \Fuel::DEVELOPMENT &amp;&amp; in_array($last_error['type'], array(4, 1, 256, 64))) {
    exit();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Weird thing is though, it's hit and miss as to whether it catches the error. So I sometimes have to refresh a few times.</p>

<p>Oh and you must set the environment to DEVELOPMENT. This is to stop leaking errors in production deployed sites.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>: It seems that MAMP (latest version 2.1.2 at time of writing) does not suffer from this issue. Neither does XAMPP 1.8.1-beta1. So you could also try using those.</p>
