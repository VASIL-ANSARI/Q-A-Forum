<p>The most important thing is that you do what feels right and that you're consistent with it. If something seems like it would be better in a method, use a method. </p>

<p>As of Rails 3, named scopes and class methods <em>can</em> function almost identically. However, the only "rules" I tend to follow when deciding on one or the other:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use named scopes when an argument is NOT required</li>
<li>Use class methods when an argument is required</li>
</ul>

<p>I also tend to use named scopes when I plan on chaining them together, as they tend to be short with minimal logic.</p>
