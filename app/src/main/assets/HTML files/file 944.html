<p>== is the identity test. It will return true if the two objects being tested are in fact the same object. <code>Equals()</code> performs an equality test, and will return true if the two objects consider themselves equal.</p>

<p>Identity testing is faster, so you can use it when there's no need for more expensive equality tests. For example, comparing against <code>null</code> or the empty string.</p>

<p>It's possible to overload either of these to provide different behavior -- like identity testing for <code>Equals()</code> --, but for the sake of anybody reading your code, please don't.</p>

<hr>

<p>Pointed out below: some types like <code>String</code> or <code>DateTime</code> provide overloads for the <code>==</code> operator that give it equality semantics. So the exact behavior will depend on the types of the objects you are comparing.</p>
