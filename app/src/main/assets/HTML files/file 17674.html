<p>I received a very similar message just the other day when I tried running my app on my iPad after several successful attempts on the simulator. I found out that under the build settings I had to make "build active architecture only" to yes. Then my app would compile on my device. Hope this helps.  Make sure when you select build settings you select "all" to show everything.  </p>
