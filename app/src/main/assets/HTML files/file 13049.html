<p>You should <strong>never</strong> do something like this. ApplicationHelper is not supposed to be included in a model. Best solution would be:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    INDUSTRIES = ['Agriculture','Food']
    validates_inclusion_of :industries, :in =&gt; INDUSTRIES
end

module ApplicationHelper
    def industries
        User::INDUSTRIES
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And now you have it done in a simple and nice way.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Anywhere you need to access industries you should use:</p>

<pre><code>User::INDUSTRIES
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it.</p>
