<blockquote>
  <p>A Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>First, make sure you have a database-independent model. Whether or not you should build a fully-fledged domain model or just use a simple property bag model is another question, but irrelevant here.</li>
<li>Build a repository that accepts your model objects for create and update operations, and returns model objects from read operations. <strong>The DAOs are now an internal concept of the repository and not visible to the rest of the application.</strong></li>
<li>Now the repository is responsible for mapping DAOs to model objects and vice-versa. If you can implement the mapping in a generic way, extract it from the repository into a dedicated mapper and use the mapper from the repository to adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" rel="nofollow">Single Responsibility Principle</a>.</li>
</ul>
