<p><code>AggregateCatalog</code> in MEF basically allows you to collect multiple extension catalogs. When you call <code>new AggregateCatalog()</code>, you are basically instantiating a new catalog collection (not necessarily populated) that can contain multiple instances of ComposablePartCatalog, which can contain multiple parts.</p>

<p>Consider it a class that helps you collect parts from multiple sets.</p>

<p>Assemblies are just a way to push parts to the calling application. You can pass parts directly from inside the existing assembly.</p>

<p>For more information about catalogs, I would recommend reading <a href="http://mef.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Using%20Catalogs">this</a>.</p>
