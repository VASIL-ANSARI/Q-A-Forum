<p>Your<code>manage.py</code> is referencing an application (<code>notifications</code>). This forces Django to complain about DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE being set because the Django environment hasn't been set up yet.</p>

<p>Incidentally, you can force the enviroment setup manually, but honestly I wouldn't do this in manage.py.  That's not really a good practice in my opinion.</p>

<p>Here is how you can manually setup the Django environment from within any app (or program for that matter):</p>

<pre><code># set up the environment using the settings module
from django.core.management import setup_environ
from myapp import settings
setup_environ(settings)
</code></pre>
