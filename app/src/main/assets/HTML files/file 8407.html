<p>While this question is poorly worded, I think I understand what you are asking for. Here's what you should do. I am not all that fluent in php so please make sure that you look over the code snippets that I write instead of copy/pasting them.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the maximum X and Y values. <br /></li>
<li>Instantiate and initialize a 2D array based on those values divided by 50.</li>
</ol>

<p>For instance if you wanted <code>Array[X][Y]</code> you would do:</p>

<pre><code>$myArray = array();
for ($x = 0; $x &lt; $maxX / 50; $x++) {
    $myArray[] = array();
    for ($y = 0; $y &lt; $maxY / 50; $y++) {
        $myArray[$x][] = 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This should instantiate and initialize a 2D array to all 0's just like you need</p>

<p>3) Iterate through your array and for each entry, increment the value of <code>$myArray[$curX/50][$curY/50]</code> by 1:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($inputArray as $curRow) $myArray[$curRow[b]/50][$curRow[a]/50] += 1;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, I'm no pro at php and have really just started working with it, but this should be a good start.</p>
