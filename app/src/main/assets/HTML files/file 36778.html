<p>You're getting an StringIndexOutOfBoundsException because you increment <code>i</code> inside the loop at a too early and wrong stage.</p>

<p>Checking for \0 is a C++ thing. Strings in java are not \0 terminated.</p>

<p>What you're writing is already done in the String class. There are several methods available.</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("hello".indexOf("llo"));
</code></pre>

<p>will print 2 because it's been found and starts at index 2. Feel free to add 1 if you dislike the starting at 0 for some reason.</p>

<p>You also ask "that means I'm handling the exception, no?". No, it doesn't. Exceptions are handled with a special syntax called try-catch statements. And example:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    // possibly more lines of code here
    do_something_that_might_cause_exception();
    // possibly more lines of code here
} catch (Exception e) {
    // something did indeed cause an exception, and the variable e holds information about. We can do "exceptional" handling here, but for now we print some information.
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>
