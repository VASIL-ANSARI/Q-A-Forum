<p>If by <em>...reordering column...</em> you meant</p>

<pre><code> ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY ...
</code></pre>

<p>then for InnoDB table that has a <code>PRIMARY</code> or <code>UNIQUE KEY</code> it doesn't work. It's by design:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/alter-table.html" rel="nofollow">ALTER TABLE</a></strong><br>
  ORDER BY <strong>does not make sense for InnoDB</strong> tables that contain a
  user-defined clustered index (PRIMARY KEY or NOT NULL UNIQUE index).
  InnoDB always orders table rows according to such an index if one is
  present.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand if you don't have <code>PRIMARY</code> or <code>UNIQUE KEY</code> in your table, which is highly unlikely, then MySQL will allow you to change the order.</p>

<p>Here is <strong><a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/bbc28/1" rel="nofollow">SQLFiddle</a></strong> demo that demonstrates that behavior.</p>
