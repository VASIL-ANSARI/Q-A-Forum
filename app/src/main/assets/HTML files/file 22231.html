<p>After posted images on server and assigned appropriate URL Address to pinit button, then it worked for me.
I post my answers <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14652079/how-to-post-image-on-pinterest">here</a>for those who will be most likely to post local images from app on pinterest.</p>

<p>Hope it will be helpful for all.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
