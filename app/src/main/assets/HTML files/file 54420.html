<p>This query will find ONLY duplicate values and select only the smallest value:</p>

<pre><code>var duplicateMin = (yourTable.GroupBy(x=&gt;x).Where(g=&gt;g.Count()&gt;1).Select(y=&gt;y.DuplicateValue)).Min();
</code></pre>

<p>The variable naming in your code looks terrible, it's just about close to impossible to read after you. Please consider renaming your variables. I mean just look at your names: <code>ttUD04_R</code>, <code>ttUD04</code>, <code>ttUD04_Recss</code>, <code>Number05</code>, <code>Number03</code>. This makes no sense at all and I can guarantee you that anyone else that will try to read after you will have absolutely no idea what you're doing. And it seems like you don't either.</p>

<p>I'd suggest renaming them to something more sensible like <code>stockItems</code>, <code>updatedStock</code>, <code>itemStock</code>.</p>
