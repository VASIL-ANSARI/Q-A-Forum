<p>Most likely your server has slower access to the database it is using.  e.g. if you were to run the database on the same machine it can be a lot faster than across a network. I would look at the time it takes to perform some simple hibernate operations locally and on your server.  If performance is a concern I suggest looking at removing hibernate or even your database and your program can run 10x - 100x faster.</p>
