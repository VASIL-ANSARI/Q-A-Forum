<p>Defining a member inside the constructor (such as: <code>this.name</code>) gives only that instance of the object access to that member.</p>

<p>Defining a member inside the prototype allows all instances to "share" that property.</p>

<p>A way that helped me understand this was to define an array (or any other member that is not a method) inside the prototype, like so:</p>

<pre><code>function Animal() {}

Animal.prototype = {
    kids: [],
    giveBirth: function() {
        for(var i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
            this.kids.push(arguments[0]);
        }
    }
}

var cat = new Animal();
var giraffe = new Animal();

cat.giveBirth('kitten','another kitten','yet another kitten');

// cat.kids === ['kitten','another kitten','yet another kitten'];
// giraffe.kids === ['kitten','another kitten','yet another kitten'];
</code></pre>

<p>If you notice, the giraffe's kids were set (as kittens).  Why is this?  Because in this case, <code>.giveBirth()</code> accesses the <strong>prototype's</strong> <code>kids</code> array, which is shared by all instances.</p>

<p>What if we don't want to share the members, because the members are unique?  You can do like so:</p>

<pre><code>function Animal() {
    this.kids = [];
}

Animal.prototype = {
    giveBirth: function() {
        for(var i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
            this.kids.push(arguments[0]);
        }
    }
}

var cat = new Animal();
var giraffe = new Animal();

cat.giveBirth('kitten');

// cat.kids === ['kitten']
// giraffe.kids == undefined

giraffe.giveBirth('baby giraffe');

// cat.kids === ['kitten']
// giraffe.kids === ['baby giraffe']
</code></pre>

<p>As you pointed out in the comments, part of how you decide to define the properties plays into memory usage; another part plays into what members you want to be "shared" across all instances.</p>

<p>To get a little more insight into prototypes (through understanding how <code>new</code> works), see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1646698/what-is-the-new-keyword-in-javascript">What is the 'new' keyword in JavaScript?</a>, on StackOverflow.</p>

<p>Here's a quote from there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a lot of searching, I have finally found out exactly what the
  new keyword does, and it is 4 things:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>It creates a new object. The type of this object, is simply object.</li>
  <li>It sets this new object's internal, inaccessible, [[prototype]] property to be the constructor function's external, accessible,
  prototype object.</li>
  <li>It executes the constructor function, using the newly created object whenever this is mentioned.</li>
  <li>It returns the newly created object, unless the constructor function returns a non-primitive value. In this case, that
  non-primitive value will be returned.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
