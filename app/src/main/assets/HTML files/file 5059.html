<p>If you're creating a SOAP service (which it sounds like you are, and I feel sorry for you ;)), try starting by looking at PHP's SOAP extension:</p>

<p>If you can create something more RESTful, Ruby on Rails does a good job at allowing you to throw together a quick and dirty web service without too many headaches, but even in PHP you can create RESTful APIs pretty easily.</p>

<p>You can read the HTTP request body via e.g. <code>fgets(STDIN)</code> if your requests will accept XML as a POST/PUT format.</p>

<p>But yes, your question is too broad to provide anything more than nudges towards the tools you might choose to use.</p>
