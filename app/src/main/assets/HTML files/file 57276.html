<p>A possible way (similar) but not exactly like in your sample is based on group_concat and concat</p>

<pre><code>    SELECT device.serial_number AS device,
    location.name AS location,
    group_concat(concat('start : ',alerting.start,'end : ',alerting.end))
    FROM alerting
    JOIN device ON alerting.device_id = device.id
    JOIN device_location ON device_location.device_id = device.id    
    JOIN location ON device_location.location_id = location.id
    GROUP BY device.serial_number, location.name
    ORDER BY location.name, device.serial_number;
</code></pre>
