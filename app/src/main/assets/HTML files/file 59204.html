<p>In the line:</p>

<pre><code>int num = rand() % size + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>You are saying to select a random number between 0 and 9 then add 1. </p>

<p>If the random number is 9 the + 1 will make it 10. This means that you are trying to access a value in the array <code>Words</code> and <code>Hints</code> at index 10. Since arrays are 0 indexed and it's size is 10 that means you only have elements at 0 - 9.</p>

<p>You also will never get the first string in the arrays.</p>
