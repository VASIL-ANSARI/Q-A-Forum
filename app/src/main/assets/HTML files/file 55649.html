<p>The problem is that 5495 will have a type of int and you are trying to cast it to a long. You can get round this in several ways, here is one of them;</p>

<p>Replace this;</p>

<pre><code>(long) args[0]
</code></pre>

<p>with this;</p>

<pre><code>(long) (int) args[0]
</code></pre>

<p>This wouldn't be a very useful solution however since you could never actually pass your method a long value, instead you can do this;</p>

<pre><code>args.Add((long) 5495);
</code></pre>
