<p>The memory construct that .NET uses to hold value types is indeed called 'the stack', but it doesn't mean that each and every variable is held in a LIFO structure, where you can only access the last one.</p>

<p>So to answer your question - when you need to access the variable <code>a</code> - CLR does that exactly (i.e. accesses it directly), there's no need to pop anything here.</p>
