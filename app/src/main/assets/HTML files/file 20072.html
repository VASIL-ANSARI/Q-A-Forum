<p>You do query <code>id = '10'</code>, the id is an int. Each time the query is runned the ids will be converted to varchar, and the indez will not be user. So it will be much faster to do:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE id = 10
</code></pre>

<p>Now the index will be user, I'm not sure it will fix your 30 second problem.</p>
