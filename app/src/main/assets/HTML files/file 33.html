<p>That's one of the sad reasons i'm still targeting .net 2.0 whenever possible :/</p>

<p>But people don't neccessarily need the full 200 MB Package. There is a 3 MB Bootstrapper which will only download the required components:</p>

<p>However, the worst case scenario is still a pretty hefty download. Also, see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2008/01/10/7067719.aspx">this article</a> for a more detailed explanation on the size and an alternative workaround to the size problem.</p>

<p>Addition: Since answering this question, Scott Hanselman created <a href="http://www.smallestdotnet.com">SmallestDotNet.com</a>, which will determine the smallest required download. Doesn't change the worst case scenario, but is still useful to know.</p>
