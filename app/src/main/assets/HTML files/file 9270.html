<p>I believe your code is telling Rails that the id <em>is</em> the user, which of course doesn't make sense. That's creating a path like /users/@user, for which no route exists. As you probably know, you want a path like /users/1.</p>

<p>So I think you code should look like</p>

<pre><code>get :show, :id =&gt; @user.id
</code></pre>

<p>or possibly</p>

<pre><code>get :show, @user
</code></pre>
