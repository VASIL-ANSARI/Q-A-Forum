<p>Well, I didn't get what I need. I will think about how to solve my problem in another way.</p>

<p>Unfortunatelly, I can't use <code>FORCE INDEX</code> in my Framework. But I need to get all Objects even if they all don't have Reports. </p>

<p>I just wanted to optimize my SQL queries. Doing it within a single query is an unsuccessful attempt :)</p>
