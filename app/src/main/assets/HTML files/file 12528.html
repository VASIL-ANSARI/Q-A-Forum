<p>Looks to me as though you had this over a light background, and that the halo parts you're seeing are opaque. I'd load this into GIMP and use Colour to Alpha to make sure those parts don't affect the image.</p>

<p>Also, you said png, but if you are using a gif (which I suspect) that only supports one transparent colour, what you're seeing looks exactly like issues you get when you have a hard sprite with a solid back ground colour (which is the transparent entry in the palette) and then you resize the image. Most graphics applications smooth the scaled image and this means that the pixels around the fringe are no longer using the transparent palette entry.</p>
