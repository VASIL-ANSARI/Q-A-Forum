<p>The <code>Graphics</code> object has not been instantiated resulting in the <code>NPE</code> being thrown. </p>

<p>This approach is just plain wrong. Don't call <code>paint</code> directly. Also don't do  any custom painting on a <code>JFrame</code>, instead add a sub-class of <code>JComponent</code> and override <code>paintComponent</code>. Here you will have a readily instantiated <code>Graphics</code> object.</p>
