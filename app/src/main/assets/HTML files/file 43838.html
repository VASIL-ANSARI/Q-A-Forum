<p>If identify is a field on your model then it does not need to be called with () as it's not a function. </p>

<p>This is wrong:</p>

<pre><code>identity = qry.identity()
</code></pre>

<p>this is right:</p>

<pre><code>identity = qry.identity
</code></pre>

<p>But that won't work because you have a query object, not a model. Take another look at the documentation</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queryclass" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queryclass</a></p>

<pre><code>q = db.Query(Song)
for song in q:
  print song.title
</code></pre>

<p>Not that <code>song.title</code> is not expressed as <code>song.title()</code></p>

<p>You can only write to the response once so you need something like:</p>

<pre><code>q = db.Query(Song)
data = []
for song in q:
  data.append(song.title)
self.response.out.write(','.join(data))
</code></pre>

<p>That'll just stick together the list of titles into a single string separated by commas. </p>

<p>Take another look at the documentation. Your problem is practically the same as their example. </p>
