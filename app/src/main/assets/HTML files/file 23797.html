  <p>Why am I unable to see the stack trace in Eclipse's console when an unchecked Exception is thrown from a thread different from the main thread?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it is unchecked.  By default there is nothing that prints the exceptions thrown by thread-pool threads.</p>

<p>If you want to see the exception then you need to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>Future future = scheduledExecutor.submit(...);
...
try {
   // wait for the run() method to finish normally or with a throw
   future.get();
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
   // the cause of this exception is the one that is thrown by the run()
   Throwable cause = e.getCause();
   cause.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

  <p>EDIT: Follow-up question: What would be the easiest way to print the exceptions thrown by thread-pool threads? Adding try-catch to every single Runnable is of course really ugly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don't need to add the try/catch to the <code>Runnable</code>, you add it to the guy who starts the pool.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to write a little <code>RunnableWrapper</code> which prints out exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>public void RunnableWrapper implements Runnable {
     private Runnable delegate;
     public RunnableWrapper(Runnable delegate) {
       this.delegate = delegate;
     }
     public void run() {
         try {
            delegate.run();
         } catch (Throwable t) {
             t.printStackTrace();
         }
     }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can do:</p>

<pre><code> scheduledExecutor.submit(new RunnableWrapper(myTask));
</code></pre>

<p>But the <code>future.get();</code> is the typical way of solving this.</p>
