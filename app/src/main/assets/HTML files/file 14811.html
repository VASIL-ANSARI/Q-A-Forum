<p>If you want to put it into your seed.rb, you create them like you would elsewhere, e.g. </p>

<pre><code>[ "Adventure Sports", "Arts and Crafts"].each do |interest|
  Interest.create!({:name =&gt; interest})
end
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could store them in your Model as a constant and use that in your form.</p>

<pre><code>class Interest &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  INTERESTS = [ "Adventure Sports", "Arts and Crafts" ]
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then in your form e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>f.select Interest::INTERESTS
</code></pre>
