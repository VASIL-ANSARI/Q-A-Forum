<p>The IndexOutOfBounds is probably a direct result of a situation where the iterating thread will intially see the List at size N and starting iterating from 0 to N.  Thread-2 Comes in and removes from the list making it effectively N-1, so if Thread-1 attempts to read at list.get(N) you get your exception.</p>

<p>If the depth of the list isn't very large and you are not removing and adding a whole lost swap the List implementation with <code>CopyOnWriteArrayList</code>.  Otherwise you will need to <code>synchronize</code> on all actions of the list including the iterating for example</p>

<pre><code>public void render(){
  synchronized(list){
    for(int i =0; i &lt;list.size();i++){
      //....
    }
  }
}
public void update(Object element){
 synchronized(list){
  list.remove(element);  
 }
}
</code></pre>
