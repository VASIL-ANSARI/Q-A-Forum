<p>The string should be defined outside the try/catch statement:</p>

<pre><code>while(condition){
    String twoStr = null;

    try {
        twoStr= JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter two words sep by a space.");
     } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Sorry your words are terrible.");
     }

     //do stuff with twoStr
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, both the try/catch statement, as well as the code outside it, will see the variable.  You should read up on <a href="http://java.about.com/od/s/g/Scope.htm" rel="nofollow">scopes</a> to get a better understanding of this.</p>
