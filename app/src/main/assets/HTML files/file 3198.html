<p>I've looked around a lot for the same thing, and I haven't had a lot of luck. <code>UIWebView</code> is not descended from <code>UIScrollView</code>, so that type of manipulation is out. By the way, you probably don't mean to be asking about MobileSafari, since as a developer you don't have access to that programmatically. MobileSafari uses a UIWebView, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Good luck on figuring this one out! If you do, be sure to post the answer here. :)</p>
