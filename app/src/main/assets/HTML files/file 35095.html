<p>Yes, my teammate had this issue on linux box. He had to completely wipe ALL rails installations. Re-download/install rails installer (<a href="http://railsinstaller.org/en" rel="nofollow">http://railsinstaller.org/en</a>) for whatever OS you are using. I dont know what IDE you use... but in our case we use Eclipse with aptana. Reinstall that too then link everything back together. Then in your IDE you should have option to make a default project by calling <code>rails new blog(replace blog with whatever your project name would be)</code> After which you should have fresh project to work with. Don't forget to do <code>bundle install</code></p>
