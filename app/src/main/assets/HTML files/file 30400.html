<p>I think the simplest case may just be to wrap the calls, assuming you need to be able to switch between normal and non-normal arbitrarily at runtime:</p>

<pre><code>void call_it(bool normal)
{
    if(normal)
    {
        f1();
        f2();
    }
    else
    {
        f2();
        f1();
    }
}
</code></pre>
