<p>Your code is working, but those for loops loop very fast, so you don't see the changes to the text field as it occurs. Whatever you do, don't use <code>Thread.sleep(...)</code> to try to solve this, but instead consider using a Swing Timer in place of those for loops so you can see the interim results.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>
It looks like this loop will never end:</p>

<pre><code>while (a &lt;= value1)
</code></pre>

<p>When will a ever be > value1 inside of the loop?</p>

<p>Same possible issue for the next while loop.</p>
