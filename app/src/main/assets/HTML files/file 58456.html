<p>@chinu You are actually assigning or changing the local variables where scope is limited within for loop only so in this case, we should use pass by reference.</p>

<p>See the following code, it will work:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($data['values'] as &amp;$products) {
    foreach ($products['product_attributes'] as &amp;$product_choices) {        
        if (!empty($product_choices['conditionalLogic2']) &amp;&amp; $product_choices['conditionalLogic'] == '') {
            $product_choices['conditionalLogic'] = $product_choices['conditionalLogic
</code></pre>
