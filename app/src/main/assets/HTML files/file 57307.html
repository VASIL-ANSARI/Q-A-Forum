<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIAlertController_class/" rel="nofollow">UIAlertController</a> has a different interface than UIAlertView. You must use a different constructor that takes in just the title, message, and preferred style.</p>

<p>Then you can add actions to the UIAlertController once defined. Click on the hyper link which will take you to Apple's documentation where they also provide an example of how to use a UIAlertController.</p>
