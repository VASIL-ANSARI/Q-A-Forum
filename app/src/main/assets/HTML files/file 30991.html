<p><strong>ExecuteScalar()</strong> only returns the value from the first column of the first row of your query.<br>
<strong>ExecuteReader()</strong> returns an object that can iterate over the entire result set.<br>
<strong>ExecuteNonQuery()</strong> does not return data at all: only the number of rows affected by an insert, update, or delete.  </p>

<p>Additionally, this seems like a good time for you to get familiar with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms123401.aspx">MSDN</a>. This is what documentation is made for: you have the method names. Go look them up.</p>
