<p>From what you're trying to achieve it seems to me that "right" and "up" should not depend on the incoming ray's direction but just form an orthonormal basis with the normal. So you would choose <code>up = cross(right, intersectionNormal)</code>.</p>

<p>But instead of rolling you own, I'd suggest to just go with one of the standard reflection models like Blinn / Phong, where the exponent does pretty much what you want your reflectivity parameter to do.</p>
