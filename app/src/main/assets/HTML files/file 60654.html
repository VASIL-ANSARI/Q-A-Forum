<p>Yes, a number of ways.  With vanilla JS, you would do something like:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('myButtonId').addEventListener('click', function () {
    document.getElementById('bottomContainer').style.display = "none";
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is just one of a few ways.  You could also make a css rule for a <code>.hide</code> class that has the <code>display: none</code> rule, or do this with jQuery's <code>.hide()</code> method, or any number of framework-based means.</p>
