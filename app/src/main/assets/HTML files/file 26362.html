<p>First a bit of vocabulary: You don't want to store classes in the array (actually, vector), you want to store objects. Objects are instances of classes.</p>

<p>Second, you've got the syntax of the <code>while</code> loop wrong. Look it up in a C++ book. Better use a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>Third, always write MyClass the same way. Don't change lower-/upper case.</p>

<p>And finally, learn about the difference between pointer to objects and objects. The element type you specify when you declare the vector doesn't match the things you put into it.</p>
