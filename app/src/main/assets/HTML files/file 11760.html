<p>As far as CSS, you're basically asking for an "ancestor selector." There's no such thing up through at least CSS3. The very rough explanation is that CSS generally looks "in" and not out. I recall reading somewhere that allowing selectors to look at parents/ancestors would also have a significant performance impact, but can't provide a citation at the moment.</p>

<p>With jQuery, you'd <a href="http://api.jquery.com/has/" rel="nofollow">use .has() to achieve this</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$('.visitor_message').has('.deletedmessage')
</code></pre>

<p>(Note I'm showing you the selection bit <em>only</em> there.)</p>
