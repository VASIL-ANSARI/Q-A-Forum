<p>You can use Wininet's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>HttpSendRequest</code></a> to accomplish the POST while keeping the URL short with as little GET/query data as possible. You'll also be using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384233%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>HttpOpenRequest</code></a>. Some sample c++ code is available from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3362983/why-might-httpopenrequest-fail-with-error-122/">another</a> stackoverflow post. You can change the <code>dataPayload</code> to suit your needs.</p>
