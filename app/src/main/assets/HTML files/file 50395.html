<p>I am assuming that you have to different instances of project A and B running. If so, you have plenty of options and this really depends on your requirements. </p>

<p>You can implement a TCP Server in project A and in the other project you implement a TCP Client which will invoke some initialization (see <a href="https://systembash.com/a-simple-java-tcp-server-and-tcp-client/" rel="nofollow">this example</a>). A more high level programming approach is the usage of Java <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/overview.html" rel="nofollow">Remote Message Invocation</a> but this requires a third project. </p>
