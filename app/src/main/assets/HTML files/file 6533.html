<p>Use JavaScript. I suggest you read <code>www.w3schools.com</code>, specifcally <em><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_checkbox_checked.asp" rel="nofollow">Checkbox checked Property</a></em>.</p>

<p>The main thing you want to do is get the "id" of all your check boxes and cycle through them.</p>
