<p><strong>HTTP POST:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>It is one of the <code>HTTP</code> method to send your data to your respective
script path.  </li>
<li>This is the secure method where data is not being shown
in the URL as <code>HTTP GET</code> method.</li>
<li>The data will be send to the desired script via
the headers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SUBMIT BUTTON CLICK :</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>It is one of the event of web form through which the data into the
form inputs will get posted to the script path present in the
<code>action</code> attribute of form.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now what will happen if the form has the two submit buttons?</p>

<p>First thing is that this is the rare case when we need two submit buttons because we can click one button at a time only. </p>

<p>Lets say we have following two buttons in some demo form as follow</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name="profileForm" action="saveprofile.php" method = "POST"&gt;
          // Your input fields go here 
 &lt;button class = "any_button_name" type= "submit " name ="save_profile" value ="save_profile" &gt;Save Profile &lt;/button&gt;

 &lt;button class = "any_button_name" type= "submit " value="preview_profile"  name ="preview_profile" &gt;Preview Profile &lt;/button&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here in code <code>value</code> attribute has been added to know which button has been clicked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now at PHP Side you can checked the which button has been clicked.</p>

<pre><code>// code from saveprofile.php
if('save_profile' == $_POST['save_profile']) {
    // save profile code
}

if('preview_profile' == $_POST['preview_profile']) {
    // save profile code
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this may help to clear your doubts.</p>
