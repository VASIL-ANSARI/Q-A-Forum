<p>In RDP you normally don't have GPU acceleration. I suggest you get yourself a Windows build of the MesaGL software rasterizer and depending on if you're on a RDP connection set the PATH environment variable to make it find that alternative opengl32.dll so that you have a nice software renderer.</p>
