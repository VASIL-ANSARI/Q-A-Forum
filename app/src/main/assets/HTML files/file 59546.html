<p>It seems I've figured out a solution.<br>
Use at export <code>mysql40</code> compatibility mode, replace <code>utf8mb4</code> with <code>utf8</code> and change the character set of tables from phpmyadmin to <code>utf8_unicode_ci</code>.<br>
Hope this will save some time from a fellow in future.</p>
