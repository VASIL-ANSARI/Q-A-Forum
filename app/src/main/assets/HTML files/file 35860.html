<p>Well, this code works fine. Tested for both iPhone 4 and 5, (baseSDK 7.1, under ARC). </p>

<p>Few things you have to consider.</p>

<p>1) be sure you set rearFacingDeviceInput properly,</p>

<pre><code>AVCaptureDevice *device = [AVCaptureDevice defaultDeviceWithMediaType:AVMediaTypeVideo];
[self setRearFacingDeviceInput:[AVCaptureDeviceInput deviceInputWithDevice:device error:nil]];
</code></pre>

<p>2) as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1644934/vincent">Vincent</a> mentioned, there will be an error, try to log both an error and imageSampleBuffer</p>

<p>3) session's -startRunning and -stopRunning operations takes long time to complete (seconds, even 5-6s), those methods doesn't return until they are done all the work, to avoid blocked UI you shouldn't call these methods on main thread, one way is using GCD</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_queue_t serialQueue = dispatch_queue_create("queue", NULL);
dispatch_async(serialQueue, ^{
    [self.captureSession startRunning];
});
</code></pre>

<p>If still captureStillImageAsynchronously doesn't complete (to ensure that, add breakpoint in block, and log everything) you should check your device's camera. I believe your code works on all iPhone 5 devices. Hope this helps, good luck.</p>
