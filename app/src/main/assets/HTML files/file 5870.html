<p>No worries people I fixed it.</p>

<p>It turns out that when I first installed PHPUnit I installed with APT I ran </p>

<p><code>apt-get remove phpunit</code></p>

<p>then re installed</p>

<p><code>apt-get install phpunit</code></p>

<p>Got me the latest version and all works fine. Hope this helps other people with a similar problem.</p>
