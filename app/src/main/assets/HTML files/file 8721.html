<p>You may want to try this:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    moveTaskToBack(true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will move not only the current activity but all activities in your task (which would be your app) to the back of the activity stack. It should then return you to wherever you were before your MyMain activity started.</p>
