<p>If your using the hosted Sentry service, you might benefit by switching to the <code>threaded+http</code> transport, which Raven fully supports. Have a look at <a href="http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config/#the-sentry-dsn" rel="nofollow">Raven's documentation</a> on how to properly configure the transport in the service name. </p>

<p>You might also want to try switching to some other specialized concurrency transport or the UDP protocol. While you can't compare ICMP request latency to TCP, yes the added overhead is simply horrible and can be worked around with, so fear not!</p>
