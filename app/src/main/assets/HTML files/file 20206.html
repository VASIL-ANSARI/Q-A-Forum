<p>You better put lock on <code>authenticatedUser.getUserName ().intern ()</code> because it is guaranteed that once two strings are identical by contents, <code>intern ()</code> will return the same object for them.</p>

<p>Also, if it is guaranteed in your system, that there is only one instance of <code>AuthenticatedUser</code> class with particular user name, then you can lock directly on <code>authenticatedUser</code>.</p>
