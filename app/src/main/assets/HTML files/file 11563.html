<p>Assuming you're running an applet, not Java in a CLI environment on the server?  If so, then your Java runtime is running on the client computer, not the server.</p>

<p>Java also has a better way to handle multiple commands than your semicolon.  Instead of using the signature:</p>

<pre><code>Runtime.exec(String)
</code></pre>

<p>try using this for each of your commands:</p>

<pre><code>Runtime.exec(String[])
</code></pre>

<p>and make each argument of your command an element in the String array.</p>
