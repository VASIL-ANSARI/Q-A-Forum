<p>If <code>x.memb</code> is already defined and isn't <code>0</code>, then it increments it. In other cases, it sets its value to <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>It's basically just an increment taking care of the case where <code>x.memb</code> isn't defined.</p>

<p>You could also have written it as</p>

<pre><code>x.memb = (x.memb||0) +1;
</code></pre>

<p>which might be more idiomatic as <code>value||defaultValue</code> is an usual construct in javascript.</p>
