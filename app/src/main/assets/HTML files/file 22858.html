<p>You use __autoload (or better: spl_autoload_register; or even better: some autoloader written by someone else) if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have many classes that are being used in different order in different files;</li>
<li>classes are spread across many files;</li>
<li>there is a strict way to tell which class is in which file.</li>
</ul>

<p>In your case: just use require_once (or refactor, but I would not bother).</p>
