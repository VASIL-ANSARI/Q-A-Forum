<p>In this case, Article is an ActiveRecord object. This means it inherits certain actions (abilities). In this case, when the submitted title does not meet the 'validates' line in the code part 1, it adds an errors action to the Article.</p>

<p>After, in part 2 of your code, the 'full_messages' action is being called on the errors I already mentioned. That is where the message you're asking about comes from. Try it in the rails console and try to save an object that doesn't pass validations. Then call the @article.errors.full_messages action on it and take a look.</p>

<p>To expand a bit more, the 'errors' here would be ActiveRecord error objects. The full_messages is pretty much an array which contains the text of each error (e.g. "Title is too short."</p>
