<p>Firstly, you're using a <em>really</em> old version of <code>TCPDF</code>. You should use the latest version from <a href="https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, it looks like you're asking <code>TCPDF</code> to include an image using a URL but you are providing a URL that would probably only work locally on a browser. The wrapper that the error is talking about is related to streams. See <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/intro.stream.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/intro.stream.php</a> Basically, "chrome-extension" is not a valid stream. Examples of valid types of streams can be found here: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php</a> I'm surprised this URL worked locally, but I guess it's because you have Chrome installed locally so your operating system is being nice and allowing PHP to access the file referred to by that URL.</p>

<p>To resolve your issue on the server you will need to grab a copy of the file that you want to include in the PDF file, put it somewhere on the server in a directory that the web server user can access and provide <em>that</em> file name to TCPDF.</p>
