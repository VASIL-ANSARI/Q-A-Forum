<p>From Gdrive,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GMail Drive is a Shell Namespace
  Extension that creates a virtual
  filesystem around your Google GMail
  account, allowing you to use GMail as
  a storage medium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so this is simply a virtual drive. There is a way to access virtual drives from c#, using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.isolatedstorage%28v=VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.IO.IsolatedStorage</a>.</p>

<p>And check out this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8dzkff1s%28v=VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Performing Isolated Storage Tasks </a> for How to use isolated storage from your application.</p>

<p>Note: I dont have any experience with gdrive before. So it may or maynot work.</p>
