<p>Java SE 6 already includes metro. It includes jax-ws 2.0, so you can remove those jars completely.</p>

<p>Only if you have specific need to use jax-ws 2.1 together with java SE 6, you can follow the instructions here -> <a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/faq/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/faq/index.html</a></p>

<p>EDIT: You are right about your last comment. Code placed in the endorsed folder is loaded with the endorsed class loader, so it can't find classes that are located in the plugins. I suggest that you put the all the metro jars in the endorsed dir. This way they'll be available not only for your plug-in, but for the entire VM.</p>
