<p>Definitely keep the file under WEB-INF/ folder if that's where it is supposed to live. </p>

<p>For your test classes that are being executed from the command line. Your can use getClassLoader().getResource() on a file that you know is in the root of your classpath (e.g. application.properties file). From there you know the structure of your project and where to find WEB-INF/ relative to the properties file. Since it returns a URL you can use it to figure out a path to the XML files you're looking for.</p>

<pre><code>URL url = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource("application.properties");
System.out.println(url.getPath());

File file = new File(url.getFile());
System.out.println(file);

// now use the Files' path to obtain references to your WEB-INF folder
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully you find this useful. I have had to make assumptions about how your test classes are runing etc.</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/File.html">File Class</a> and it's getPath(), getAbsolutePath(), and getParent() methods that could be of use to you.</p>
