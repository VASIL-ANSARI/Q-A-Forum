<p>Generally speaking, you should probably keep the ID on the server-side in a <code>$_SESSION</code> variable and never let it get anywhere near the client.  Alternatively, the form might contain sufficiently identifiable information to be able to determine the relevant record on the basis of some <code>UNIQUE</code> index.</p>

<p>However, if you prefer, you could also add some cryptographic authentication to prove that the ID has not been altered by the user.  For example, in addition to the ID itself, return to the client a secure hash of the ID concatenated with some secret; when the client posts back to your server both the ID and that hash, you can compare against a recalculated version of the hash to check that only someone who knew the secret (i.e. you) could have provided the client with that ID.</p>

<p>In order to defeat more sophisticated attacks, you might want to add some salt:</p>

<pre><code>$salt = some_random_string();
$hash = md5( md5($secret) . md5($id) . md5($salt) )
</code></pre>

<p>Then send to the client the hash, the ID <em>and</em> the salt; all three of which it will return to you for validation.</p>
