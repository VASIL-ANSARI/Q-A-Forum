<pre><code>DataFormatString = "{0:C0}"
</code></pre>

<p>That will format as a currency with 0 decimal places.</p>

<pre><code>DataFormatString = "{0:N0}"
</code></pre>

<p>This will format as a number such as 1,000. If you want decimal places then replace the second 0 with however many numbers you want after the decimal.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>DataFormatString = "{0:N4}"
</code></pre>

<p>Would format like 1,000.0000</p>
