<p>It depends. Let me explain :</p>

<ul>
<li>first storing data in "app external" is a good practice when this data is really private and you don't want other apps to access it,</li>
<li>"app external" is not recommended in some cases : </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>As such, you should not use these directories for media that ultimately belongs to the user, such as photos captured or edited with your app, or music the user has purchased with your appâthose files should be saved in the public directories(<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#AccessingExtFiles" rel="nofollow">docs</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>you shouldn't go for "public external" if your app is very dependent on the data you're storing (it could be missing, not mounted etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't really know your use case but in general i will probably go for a mix.</p>
