<p>You can use <code>boolean indexing</code>, either with conditions for the endpoints of your interval</p>

<pre><code>df[(df.A &gt; 3) &amp; (df.A &lt; 6)]
</code></pre>

<p>or the convenience method <code>.between()</code>, which behind the scenes translates to the above (and hence is a very very tiny bit slower) where you need to take care that limits are inclusive by default:</p>

<pre><code>df[df.A.between(4, 5)] # uses inclusive limits
</code></pre>

<p>to get:</p>

<pre><code>   A  B
3  4  0
4  5  1
</code></pre>
