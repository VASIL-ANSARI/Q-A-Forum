<p>It sounds like you would need to transpose your current table to achieve this. As far as I know, there is no way to transpose a MySQL table without specifying the exact columns to be transposed. So I would say that the best way would be to retrieve a row (or rows, depending on your needs) with SELECT * FROM table and then calculate the average using the whatever scripting / programming language you are using.</p>
