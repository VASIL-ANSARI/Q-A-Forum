<p>First question would be whether there is any reason to do a long-running task syncronously, i.e. lock up a thread that should be serving web requests for something that could be done in the background, while the browser sits and waits for a response that its probably not going to get. I'd look into running this asynchronously unless there's a very deliberate reason not to.</p>

<p>Secondly have you looked into creating some kind of locking mechanism such that the process can't be started more than once? I have processes where I add a token to the application cache (and remove it when I'm done) so that if the token exists the process won't run again (the call to the asynch task isn't made), and that does the job. That way it doesn't matter how many clients call your code, you prevent things happening more than they should.</p>
