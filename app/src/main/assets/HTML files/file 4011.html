<p>This is not possible while your application is suspended.  From the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH5-SW10" rel="nofollow">iOS Application Programming Guide</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cancel any Bonjour-related services before being suspended.</strong> When your
  application moves to the background,
  and before it is suspended, it should
  unregister from Bonjour and close
  listening sockets associated with any
  network services. A suspended
  application cannot respond to incoming
  service requests anyway. Closing out
  those services prevents them from
  appearing to be available when they
  actually are not. If you do not close
  out Bonjour services yourself, the
  system closes out those services
  automatically when your application is
  suspended.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Be prepared to handle connection failures in your network-based
  sockets.</strong> The system may tear down
  socket connections while your
  application is suspended for any
  number of reasons. As long as your
  socket-based code is prepared for
  other types of network failures, such
  as a lost signal or network
  transition, this should not lead to
  any unusual problems. When your
  application resumes, if it encounters
  a failure upon using a socket, simply
  reestablish the connection.</p>

<p>However, if your application is streaming audio, it would be necessary for it to maintain network connections, so you should be able to do Bonjour discovery while in the background for an application continuously playing audio.  Make sure you don't abuse this by playing a silent audio clip in a loop just so that you can stay in the background, or your application will be rejected.</p>
