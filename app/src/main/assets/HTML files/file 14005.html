<p>What is this doing?:</p>

<pre><code>objWebClient.OpenRead("D:\confirm.aspx")
</code></pre>

<p>Is <code>D:\</code> a reference to a web address?  It looks like you're just calling the file itself, which isn't going to have the effect you're looking for.  (Ignoring for a moment the file residing in the root of a drive...)</p>

<p>ASPX pages aren't executable in and of themselves.  A web server (IIS, usually) has to handle the requests for them and pass those requests through the .NET runtime, etc., in order to handle the server-side processing.  The file itself is just text, it has no internal means to interpret server-side code.  That's what a web server is for.</p>

<p>In order to make a web request to a web resource (a page, or any other web resource), you need to use a web URL.  Something like: <code>http://localhost/confirm.aspx</code>  So that page will need to be served somewhere by a web server.</p>

<p><strong>More to the point, however</strong>, is the fact that you <em>shouldn't</em> have to do this.  If code needs to be shared by two pages, that code should be extracted into a shared component.  A "page" should never have to "call another page" (unless they're on completely separate servers and you're going for more of a SOA approach).  Both pages should call a single shared component (a class, usually, maybe in its own assembly or just in the web project that has the pages).</p>

<p>Business logic doesn't go in pages.  Only UI goes in pages.  Shared business logic goes in business classes.</p>
