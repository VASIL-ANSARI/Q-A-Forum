<p>There exist some toolkits, such <a href="https://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">MVVM Light</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/" rel="nofollow">Caliburn Micro</a>, that ease the implementation of MVVM pattern. I personally use <a href="https://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">MVVM Light Toolkit</a>, which uses the Locator approach. Using this toolkit, ViewModels are loaded when needed by default, but you can set it to load a specific ViewModel at launch, which can be useful in some scenarios.</p>
