<p>I wanted our app to don't play sounds when the iPhone is muted.
After hours of searching I decided to try with the following parameter and works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>myMedia.play({ playAudioWhenScreenIsLocked : false });
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.6.0/cordova_media_media.md.html#media.play_ios_quirk" rel="nofollow">documentation doesn't say</a> anything that this parameter will make the sound to not play when the iPhone is muted, but it behaves like that.</p>

<p>I'm using PhoneGap 2.6.0 and the docs says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pass in this option to the play method to specify whether you want to
  play the audio of the media file when the screen is locked (this
  defaults to true if not set). If this is set to true, it will ignore
  the state of the hardware mute button.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad documented?</p>
