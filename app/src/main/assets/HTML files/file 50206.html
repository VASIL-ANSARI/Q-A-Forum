<p>PostgreSQL (used on Heroku) is case sensitive by default. If you want to search with case insensitivity, use the <code>ILIKE</code> operator (instead of <code>LIKE</code>) - <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-matching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-matching.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key word ILIKE can be used instead of LIKE to make the match case-insensitive according to the active locale. This is not in the SQL standard but is a PostgreSQL extension.</p>

<p>But as Max said in the comments, the best thing to do is use the same database in development as production - this way, bugs like this are caught before they make it into production.</p>
