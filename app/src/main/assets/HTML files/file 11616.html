<p>The proper syntax for passing 2 variables to a function in PHP looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//Needs two variables stated
listDebug($var1, $var2);
</code></pre>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>Judging by the comments, it looks like <code>listDebug()</code> is a library function that only accepts one argument and that you cannot edit. It logs information to a database and its single argument represents the string to be logged. In this case, you want to log the value of 2 separate values. The most straight forward approach would be simply concatenate them together like so:</p>

<pre><code>listDebug($var1 . ' ' . $var2);
</code></pre>
