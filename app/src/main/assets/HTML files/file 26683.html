<h2>Redraw a region of original image</h2>

<p>You can simply draw back the image with the specified rectangular region you want to "reveal":</p>

<pre><code> /// reset global alpha and then
 context.globalAlpha = 1;

 context.drawImage(image, rx, ry, rw, rh,
                          rx, ry, rw, rh)
</code></pre>

<p>Here you pick first the source rectangle (first line), then the destination rectangle. If width and height (<code>rw</code> and <code>rh</code>) are different the source region is scaled to fit the destination region. If the image size is 1:1 both source and destination would be the same (as in this example).</p>

<h2>Clipping</h2>

<p>As an alternative you can use clipping instead:</p>

<pre><code>/// to remove clipping properly save current state
context.save();

/// define region you want to clip
context.beginPath();
context.rect(rx, ry, rw, rh);

/// set clip
context.clip();

/// draw the image as the original
context.drawImage(image, x, y);

/// remove clipping
context.restore();
</code></pre>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>Composite modes (<code>globalCompositeOperation</code>) allow clipping as well but would not be useful here as you would still need to draw with a region of the original image and therefor you can just draw it directly (as in first example).</p>

<p>Another way could be to use two canvases where you draw the image on the bottom canvas and the mask on the top canvas. Then punch a hole in the top canvas. If you want to animate/move around the mask this can be a good solution.</p>
