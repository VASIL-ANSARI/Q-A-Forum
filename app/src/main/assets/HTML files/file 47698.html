<p>From <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/direct_messages" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can request up to 200 direct messages per call, and only the most recent 200 DMs will be available using this endpoint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really, the best you can do is take the 200 most recent messages sent to your user.  Then, you can <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/direct_messages/sent" rel="nofollow">grab up to 800 messages sent by the user</a>.</p>

<p>You'll have to thread them yourself based on their timestamp.</p>

<p>There's no other way to do this at the moment.</p>
