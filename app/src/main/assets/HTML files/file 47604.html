<p>Go a third route:  create a <code>volatile boolean</code> yourself.  Why?</p>

<ul>
<li>Semantics of <code>volatile</code> are well defined, and you guarantee that the read/written value is synchronized across all threads that request it</li>
<li>Very minimal code to write for a huge gain</li>
<li>It's not entirely overkill like a <code>ReadWriteLock</code> would be, since you don't have to guarantee but one field as opposed to an entire object</li>
</ul>

<p><code>AtomicBoolean</code> acts as <a href="http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/6-b14/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicBoolean.java#AtomicBoolean.get%28%29" rel="nofollow">a thin veneer</a> over a <code>volatile int</code>, which is checked as a boolean value.  If you want to guarantee correctness in all cases though (i.e. compare and swap), you should go with that.</p>
