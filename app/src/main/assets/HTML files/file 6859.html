<p>Does .Net have an attribute for setting a namespace on the AccountEnquiryResponse object?  That will solve both your problems.</p>

<p>If you're the server, what did the client use to generate their stubs?  Did you give them a wsdl? or point them to your running server?  If you gave them a wsdl, did you use that same wsdl to generate <em>your</em> service interface?</p>

<p>This looks <em>realy</em> like two sides not using the same interface.  XML is really rather picky about fully qualified names.</p>
