<p>Your rule already allows certain non-alphabetic characters. It allows a whitespace character (space character), a hyphen (dash character) and an apostrophe (single quote character).  All you'll have to do is add to the list :</p>

<pre><code>'alpha' =&gt; array(
    'rule' =&gt; '/^[a-z\s\-\'\.,:;]+$/i',
    'message' =&gt; 'Please limit to alphabetical and non-alphabetical characters.'
);
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to escape the characters with special meanings such as the period character <code>.</code>.</p>

<p>Be aware that this rule is quite relaxed. It will allow all sorts of non regular inputs such as - </p>

<ul>
<li><code>;;;;;;;;</code></li>
<li><code>--;;--::</code></li>
<li><code>''.  .''</code></li>
</ul>
