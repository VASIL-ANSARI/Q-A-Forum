<p>Entities are not managed nor created by the service container. Doctrine is responsible for translating database results into entities. </p>

<p>If you want to inject search service to your Article entity you have to do it manually. As it's rather an optional dependency (you inject it with a setter) you should also check if it's not null in your (post|pre)Persist hook.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>$article = $em-&gt;getRepository('MyNewsBundle:Article')
    -&gt;findOneBy(array('feed'=&gt;$this-&gt;getId(), 'link'=&gt;$item-&gt;link()));

if (!$article) {
    $article = new \My\NewsBundle\Entity\Article();
}

$article-&gt;setSearch($this-&gt;get('search'));
</code></pre>
