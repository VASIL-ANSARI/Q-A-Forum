<p>No need to write client-server communication code separate for container app and its extension.</p>

<p>Apple recommends embedded frameworks for the same. You create an embedded framework which can be used across both targets. Place code that will need to be used by both the container app and extension in the framework to avoid code repetition.</p>

<p>And for sharing data between container app and extension, you can use NSUserDefaults through AppGroup.</p>
