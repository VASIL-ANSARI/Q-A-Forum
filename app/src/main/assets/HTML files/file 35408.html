<p>I am not sure what your entities are trying to do, but to me (a native English speaker), an "event" is very different from a "venue".  An "event" is something that takes place at a particular point in time and place.  "Participants" can sign up for an "event".  A "venue" is a particular place.  These are very different entities.</p>

<p>There is a relationship between them.  As Alvaro points out in his comment, <code>venue_name</code> is not an appropriate attribute for <code>event</code>.  <code>venue_id</code> is the appropriate attribute, creating a link between the tables.</p>

<p>The answer to your question is that you could put descriptions into a single table, but it typically doesn't make sense (in most cases) to mix descriptions of different entities in a single table.  Normally, you would just add a <code>description</code> column to the tables where you want that attribute.</p>

<p>There are some circumstances where a single such table might be desirable.  If you are creating a multi-lingual database application and <code>description</code> is something that could be shown to users, then you might want to store all such strings in a single table to facilitate translation.</p>
