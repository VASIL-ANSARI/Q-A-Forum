<p>I think what you are trying to do is pass the variable <code>$points</code> from one file to another? You are correct in using <code>$_POST</code> and <code>$_GET</code> to pass these variables but there are other issues that I should point out. First let me answer your question. </p>

<p><code>$_POST</code> and <code>$_GET</code> are simply arrays of information. <code>$_POST</code> is data that is set in the headers of the request and passed without changing the URL of the page. <code>$_GET</code> are parameters in the URL (usually you see them as <strong>www.url.com?data=value&amp;otherdata=value</strong>). </p>

<p>The values are store in the array with a key. This is simply a text string, in your example this text string would be 'points'. You can pass points to the new file by simply adding it to the URL: </p>

<p><strong>www.url.com/?question2.php?points=1</strong></p>

<p>You can retrieve the vaules in the new file with:</p>

<pre><code>$points = $_GET['points'];
</code></pre>

<p>and that will give you what you want.</p>

<p><strong>Now for the issues...</strong> </p>

<p>Since you would be passing them in <code>$_GET</code>, anyone can just change the value and set new points. This can also be done, with slightly more difficulty with <code>$_POST</code> but essentially it is the same problem. A better way would be to use <a href="http://www.thesitewizard.com/php/sessions.shtml" rel="nofollow">PHP sessions</a>, but this depends on how worried you are about people changing the data. If it is not crucial that people are unable to change the data, you could always just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_%28software%29" rel="nofollow">obfuscate it</a> or <a href="http://naveensnayak.wordpress.com/2013/03/12/simple-php-encrypt-and-decrypt/" rel="nofollow">encrypt it</a>.</p>

<p>You are also using multiple files. Now, without seeing the files I can't say that this is a bad methodology, but I can say that you may want to, instead, create a single file that can handle all the questions (aka, a handler). You can pass the values in the same way, and just make your form actionless (so that it submits to itself). This will give you the <code>$_POST</code> and <code>$_GET</code> data you want, without the need for multiple files.</p>

<p>I know this might give you more questions than answers, but it should at least get you pointed in the right direction!</p>
