<p>Don't use a 0-1 counter; that's called a Boolean flag.  When you find the vowel, just continue to the next step.</p>

<pre><code>vowel_list = 'aeiou'
sentence = "hello world"

# split the sentence into a list of words.
word_list = sentence.split()
for word in word_list:
    # Find the minimal pronounceable prefix and print it 3 times
    # Find the first vowel
    for i in range(len(word)):
        if word[i] in vowel_list:
            # Grab the consonants and vowel, and stop
            syllable = word[:i+1]
            break
    # Report the syllable in triplicate
    print syllable*3
</code></pre>

<p>The output from this is </p>

<pre><code>hehehe
wowowo
</code></pre>

<p>That should get you through the immediate questions.  You still get to cobble this into a function the way you described, and then put the individual baby words into a baby sentence.  I'll also leave it to you to handle problem cases, such as</p>

<pre><code>each
school
rhythm
</code></pre>

<p>If this doesn't solve <em>anything</em> for you, then please edit the question with a clearer description.</p>
