<p>The <code>SQLiteQueryBuilder</code> helps to construct queries that are more complex than those supported by the <code>SQLiteDatabase</code> functions (for example, subqueries).</p>

<p>If your particular query does not need any of those complex features, you do not need to use <code>SQLiteQueryBuilder</code>.
(But it might make sense if your code happens to be organized so that it's easier if all queries use <code>SQLiteQueryBuilder</code>.)</p>
