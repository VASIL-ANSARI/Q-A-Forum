<p>hr tag doesn't have those properties, so it's throwing an error saying it's self closing, as it's literally just <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> when rendered. So it's self closing and hence takes no actions/properties, content as jade calls it. Like <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags but without the closing slash.</p>

<p>If you wish to assign those properties either make a custom Hr by using a span and a line in css. </p>

<p>Or if it's just the padding then add a div with padding top 50px.</p>
