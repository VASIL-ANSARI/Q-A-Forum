<p>"Undefined behaviour" means the C resp. C++ standards don't define the behaviour of your program. If your program contains inline assembly, it should be pretty clear that its behaviour won't normally be described by either the C or the C++ standard. Some other standard might even define the behaviour, but that still doesn't mean "defined behaviour" in the context of the C or C++ standard.</p>

<p>That said, the C standard does require documentation of supported extensions. If the behaviour of your program can be inferred from your implementation's documentation, and your implementation makes your program behave differently, that is a failure of your implementation to conform to the standard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>4. Conformance</strong></p>
  
  <p>8 An implementation shall be accompanied by a document that defines all implementation-defined and locale-specific characteristics and all extensions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For C++, this requirement has been weakened:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1.4 Implementation compliance [intro.compliance]</strong></p>
  
  <p>9 Each implementation shall include documentation that identifies all conditionally-supported constructs that it does not support and defines all locale-specific characteristics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1.9 Program execution [intro.execution]</strong></p>
  
  <p>2 Certain aspects and operations of the abstract machine are described in this International Standard as implementation-defined [...] Each implementation shall include documentation describing its characteristics and behavior in these respects. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm unable to find a requirement for extensions to be documented, and if documented, to be documented correctly. This would suggest that in C++, even if your implementation defines the behaviour of your program as an extension, if it turns out the documentation is wrong, that's just too bad.</p>

<p>For the C++ semi-standard <code>asm</code> statement (as mentioned in the comments, "The <code>asm</code> declaration is conditionally-supported; its meaning is implementation-defined."), if your implementation supports it it needs to be documented, but of course it's common practice for implementations to support inline assembly in a different manner than hinted by the C++ standard, so this doesn't give you much extra.</p>
