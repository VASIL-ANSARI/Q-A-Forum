<p>Just realised all I needed to do was </p>

<p><code>::-webkit-scrollbar { 
    display: auto; }</code></p>

<p>thanks to @Daniel A. White. </p>

<p>Would anyone be willing to post a brief installation guide in lionbar.js so that it covers the whole page and replaces the current scrollbar?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
