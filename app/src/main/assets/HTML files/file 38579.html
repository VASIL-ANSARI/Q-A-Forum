<p>The proper way of doing this is making the Foo model abstract by adding abstract = True in the Meta. In your case, some_field is in the app_foo table and the join is needed in order to create the Bar object completely. If you don't need some_field, you can always drop to raw SQL. But in order to retrieve it, you must join app_bar and app_foo tables.</p>
