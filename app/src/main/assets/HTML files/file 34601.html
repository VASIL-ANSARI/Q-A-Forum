<p>It seems I was looking at an older language spec. The <a href="http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/" rel="nofollow">ECMAScript Language Specification, 5.1 Edition (HTML version)</a></p>

<p>Defines an ArrayLiteral as:</p>

<pre><code>ArrayLiteral :
    [ Elision opt ]
    [ ElementList ]
    [ ElementList , Elisionopt ]

Elision :
    ,
    Elision ,
</code></pre>

<p>The Elision rule seems to define this case</p>

<p>It <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_variables,_and_literals#Extra_commas_in_array_literals" rel="nofollow">allows</a> for array element "placeholders" in some sense.</p>

<p>I ran into this issue when dealing with leading commas:</p>

<pre><code>var x = [
  , something
  , somethingElse
  , 2
] 
</code></pre>

<p>I was wondering why I was getting an <code>undefined</code> for the first element.</p>
