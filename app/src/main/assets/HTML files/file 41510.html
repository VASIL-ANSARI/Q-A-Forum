<p>This is moot question. Turns out you cannot have a referenced twice (as a project and nuget reference). 
Visual studio blocks you if you try to add a project reference if it already exists as a nuget reference and if you add a nuget reference when you already have a project reference of the same name then it gets overriden (your project reference goes away and is replaced by nuget reference)</p>
