<p>Add these lines before loading HTML content to your WebView.</p>

<pre><code>wv.setWebChromeClient(new WebChromeClient() {
});
</code></pre>

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to support inline HTML5 video in your application, you need to have hardware acceleration turned on, <strong>and set a WebChromeClient</strong>. For full screen support, implementations of onShowCustomView(View, WebChromeClient.CustomViewCallback) and onHideCustomView() are required, getVideoLoadingProgressView() is optional.</p>
