<p>Simplifying a bit:</p>

<p>In .NET, and in COM, you don't normally create instance by directly calling the constructor of a class. In fact, most services don't even expose the actual class. Instead, they expose an interfaceâthat is, an abstract type which is a supertype of the actual class, and just defines the public methods they want you to haveâand then either (a) a factory function that generates an instance of some concrete subclass of that interface, or (b) a concrete class that COM can use in "automatic factory" functions like <code>CreateObject</code>.</p>

<p>That's what the docs mean when they say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use CreateObject, GetObject, New, or similar functions to obtain the ISldWorks object from a Dispatch application (Visual Basic or C++ Dispatch). Standalone .exe C++ COM applications can use CoCreateInstance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>CreateObject</code> takes a "ProgID", a string representing a concrete type name, and does all the magic needed to get a concrete type from that name, pass it through .NET/COM interop, ask the service to create an object of that concrete type, verify that it matches the appropriate interface, and wrap it up. If there's an example of using SolidWorks from VB.NET, it will probably use <code>CreateObject</code>, and you can do the same thing from IronPython.</p>

<p>However, really, at some point you're going to need to read some documentation on .NET and understand what all of it means.</p>
