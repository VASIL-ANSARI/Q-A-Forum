<p>Yes, I would test "everything", however, user interface testing is generally complicated and brittle to test, in the interests of pragmatism, I'd keep your UI code as small as possible, and just Be Careful.</p>

<p>Definetly test all "business code".</p>

<p>Speaking from experience, it was difficult to learn how to unit test effectively, but once I began applying dependency injection patterns more often, it became much easier to test.</p>

<p>Try to test only ONE thing at a time - testing a "system" tends to make the system test complicated and brittle.</p>

<p>When I say "brittle", I mean "A simple change in one part of the system just meant that you have to rewrite half your tests".  What you want is to have a change impact only a few of the tests that actually test that code.</p>
