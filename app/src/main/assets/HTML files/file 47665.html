<p>I just want to share one way to overcome this problem if you can't install Java 8 on your machine.</p>

<p>Since this occurs only because SSL certificate are switched to TLS1.1 you could still use Java 7, just one file should be copied from Java 8.</p>

<p>Replace the default trusted keystore file - cacerts, with the one from java 8. This is how it can be done:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locate file named "cacerts" inside Java 7 lib directory,</li>
<li>Rename it ( for a backup ),</li>
<li>find the file with the same name used by Java 8,</li>
<li>copy the file found in Java 8 to Java 7</li>
</ol>

<p>This method doesn't necessarily mean you need to install Java 8. You just need to find the file cacerts which can be copied from a machine that has it installed, or you can unpack the downloaded archive. It is the fastest way to solve this issue. I have just tested this and it works.</p>
