<p>You've omitted part of your source, but what you have looks fine if I fill in the blanks:</p>

<pre><code>function object1(){

  function func(){...}

  exports.func=func; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Something needs to call <code>object1</code> at some point, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>object1();
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>new object1();
</code></pre>

<p>...in order for the <code>exports.func = func;</code> line to run, but that's fine provided you do it.</p>

<p>Or did you mean this doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>function object1(){

  function func(){...}

}

exports.func=func; 
</code></pre>

<p>If so, of course not, there's no <code>func</code> symbol defined in the scope where you're using it. You'd have to do something like the first code block above.</p>
