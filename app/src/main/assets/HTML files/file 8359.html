<p>From <a href="http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2007/04/29/sql-server-random-number-generator-script-sql-query/">SQL SERVER â Random Number Generator Script</a>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT randomNumber, COUNT(1) countOfRandomNumber
FROM (SELECT ABS(CAST(NEWID() AS binary(6)) % 1000) + 1 randomNumber
      FROM sysobjects) sample
GROUP BY randomNumber;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just to clarify, the script is grouping on the random number that was generated per row. So the total number of results is not guaranteed. You can be sure you'll never get more rows than <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sysobjects</code>, though.</p>
