<p>Your browser is correctly refusing to load data from a cross-domain source that doesn't set "Access-Control-Allow-Origin". Three possible solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a copy of the xml and host it on your own site</li>
<li>Make a request to your own site, which acts as a proxy and fetches the remote xml file</li>
<li>Kindly ask the site owner to set up CORS headers for you</li>
</ul>
