<p>You have a few serious html and javascript syntax errors that might be causing some trouble.
I properly indented your code in jsfiddle and seems like you have a broken body tag, and two extra closing div tags that are disconnected.</p>

<p>In your javascript, in the videos array, you missed a pretty important quote.</p>

<p>Check this fiddle <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/elclanrs/dp5wJ/12/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/elclanrs/dp5wJ/12/</a>. When the code is properly indented the erors are very easy to spot with the syntax highlighting.</p>
