<p>Conditional comments are not supported by newer versions (IE10+) of Internet Explorer, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh801214(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<p>So if you really want to handle IE10 or IE11 differently then I'd recommend you do it either through different responses handled by the server or using javascript on the client.</p>
