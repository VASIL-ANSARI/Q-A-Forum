<p>First look at your Apache logs, which scripts were they hitting? Next look at your site for any custom scripts and scrutinize them. Also, look for any back door apps they may have hidden. In some cases, you can look around for recently modified files or recently created files... if they were smart you would need to check all files.</p>
