<p>Actually the Session.SESSION_TRANSACTED is right in the API docs for JMS <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/jms/Session.html" rel="nofollow">Session</a>.  Although generally it doesn't matter what you put into the acknowledgement mode value when you create a transacted session since the provider will usually override that, but it's good form to use the transacted value.</p>

<p>As far as how the acknowledgement mode affects message producers, it doesn't, short and sweet.  In a transacted session the messages you produce are not posted to the target destination by the remote peer until you commit, if you rollback they are lost (possibly DLQ'd). A producer has no mechanism to ack messages so nothing to worry about.</p>
