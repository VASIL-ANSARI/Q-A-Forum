<p>From your brief and slightly confusing explanation of your project I don't see any need for you to be using OpenMP at all.  All that you want to do can be done entirely within Java which has good (enough) facilities for concurrent programming.</p>

<p>OpenMP was designed for a completely different type of 'concurrent' program -- really for parallel programs; at its heart it's for spreading loop iterations across processors.  This is not a good fit to your problem.</p>

<p>If you have been told that you must use Java and OpenMP then I suppose you must.  If this is so, go with JaMP.  Only if someone holds a gun to your head should you set out on the path of Java+JNI+C/C+++OpenMp.</p>
