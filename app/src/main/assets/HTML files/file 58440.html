<p>There are not "2 types of arrays" in JavaScript, and this is not "creating a non native array".  It is creating an Object <code>files</code> with Properties <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.  This is called <code>Object Bracket Notation</code>, and it occurs in Angular because Angular treats every property as an object unless it is defined otherwise ahead of time;  You are correct that you need to use <code>vm.files = new Array()</code> to <strong>pre-allocate</strong> <code>files</code> as an array.</p>
