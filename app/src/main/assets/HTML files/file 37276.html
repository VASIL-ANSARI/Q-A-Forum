<p>According to your example you are using Hibernate Validator 4.0.2.GA together with Bean  Validation 1.1.0.Final. That is not going to work. To use Bean Validation 1.1 you will need Hibernate Validator 5.x (5.1.2.Final being the latest). I would expect that your example is not even bootstrapping properly or eat least that there are some warnings in the logs. </p>
