<p>You could iterate through the values of the Map (with Map.values()), converting each to an Integer (with Integer.getInteger(String s)), and keeping track of the top 3 you see.</p>

<p>Or, you could do as above but instead of keeping track of the top 3, make a LinkedList and insert each Integer at the correct place (traverse the LinkedList until you find where the Integer should be inserted).</p>
