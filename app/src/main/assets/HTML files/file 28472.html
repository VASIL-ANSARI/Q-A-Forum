<p>Okay, set action for both buttons. You can call delegate method on view controller to Push/present a view controller where user can edit. And after taping on done, send a request to server with updated data. There should be a web page which receive and process your request.
Same is for delete, but you don't need new view controller you can just handle delete button tap and send a request to the web server with id of record to be deleted. And handle delete process from the web page in the web server.</p>
