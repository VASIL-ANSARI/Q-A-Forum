<p>I found the error.</p>

<p>Notice that I have two urls, one at <code>/user/login</code> and <code>/user/{user_id}</code>, because of the two starting <code>/user</code> urls, it confuses and doesn't know which to use, resulting in a 500 error.</p>

<p>Switching the <code>/user/login</code> to <code>/login</code> corrected the issue.</p>

<p>I feel stupid for not knowing that would happen.</p>
