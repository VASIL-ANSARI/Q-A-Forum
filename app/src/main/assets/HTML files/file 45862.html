<p>Though it is not a solution for all applications with transparent windows, it works for me since I only want this single application to not use Compton shadows.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a Compton config file.</li>
<li>Add <code>shadow-exclude = [ "name = 'WindowTitle'" ];</code> where <code>WindowTitle</code> is the title of the window.</li>
<li>Execute <code>pkill compton</code> in terminal.</li>
<li>Start Compton and make sure it is linked to the config file with the <code>--config</code> parameter.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it.</p>
