<p>In the current state of things, there is no good way other than by comments or a third-party solution. Boost provides a <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/concept_check/concept_check.htm" rel="nofollow">concept check library</a> for this, and I think gcc also has an implementation. Concepts are on the list of C++0x improvements, but I'm not sure if you can specify subtypes - they are more for "must support these operations" which is (roughly) equivalent.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Wikipedia has this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x#Concepts" rel="nofollow">section</a> about concepts in C++0x, which is significantly easier to read than draft proposals.</p>
