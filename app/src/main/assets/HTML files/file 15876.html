<p>I don't think that's possible. Take for instance the following code:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv){
  Object A = new Object(), B = new Object();
  if(argc == 1){
    delete A;
    delete B;
  }else
  {
    delete B;
    delete A;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>How would you know at compile time which destructor is called first?</p>
