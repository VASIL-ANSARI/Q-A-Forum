<p>Your regex is working fine.  In your regex, you have <code>()</code>.  This creates a group.  <code>.match</code> returns an array.  The 1st element is the result matched by the entire regex, the other elements are each group from your regex.</p>

<p><code>.match</code> is returning you <code>['#34','#34']</code> because the 1st is the entire regex, and the 2nd is the group in your regex <code>(#\d+)</code>.</p>

<p>Note: <code>{1}</code> is not needed, as it will match 1 match by default.</p>

<p>The properties of the array returned from <code>.match</code> is documented here: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec#Description" rel="nofollow">mozilla docs</a>.</p>
