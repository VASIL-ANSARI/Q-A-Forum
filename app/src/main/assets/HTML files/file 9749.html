<p>The <code>body</code> can't be accessed in the head until it has been loaded. Your second technique of using the onload attribute is correct. Alternately, I would recommend using jQuery with </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function()
{
    alert("body loaded");
});
</code></pre>

<p>It is cross-browser compatible. Without jQuery you would need to deal with DOM event differences between IE and others.</p>
