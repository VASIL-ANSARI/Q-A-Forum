<p>Follow step 1 to 4 here: <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/server-side/" rel="nofollow">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/server-side/</a></p>

<p>Make sure you enter 'manage_pages' and 'publish_stream' permission in step 1. This should give you a valid access token.</p>

<p>With this access token, you call the following api method: (replace xxxxxxx with access_token)</p>

<p><a href="https://graph.facebook.com/me/accounts?access_token=XXXXXXXX" rel="nofollow">https://graph.facebook.com/me/accounts?access_token=XXXXXXXX</a></p>

<p>In the output you should see something similar to this: </p>

<pre><code>    {
   "data": [
      {
         "name": "My App",
         "category": "Application",
         "id": "10258853",
          "access_token": "yyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
      }
   ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using the yyyyyyyyyyy access_token you can publish to any wall like you would do as a user.</p>

<p>I've been asking the same before. See my question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5687310/how-can-my-facebook-application-post-message-to-a-wall">here</a> for the code i was using then. I think you should manage with that and my answer above.</p>

<p>I hope i could make at least a few things clear for you. If not, ask me and i'll try to help you out.</p>
