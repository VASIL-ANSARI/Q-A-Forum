<p>To get previous value.Here find all which have views less than current and then sort in desc order and last one is then the previous one.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM posts WHERE views&lt;'$views' ORDER BY views DESC LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p>To get next value .Here find all which have views greater than current and then sort in asc order and first one is then the next one.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM posts WHERE views&gt;'$views' ORDER BY views ASC LIMIT 1 
</code></pre>

<p>Here only edge case will be when views are equal,in that case you have to get all views which are equal and then order by id also and then if views are equal add one more condition id > current id and vice versa for previous one. </p>
