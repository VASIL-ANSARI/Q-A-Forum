<p>In your base2dec, you will simply call this method and pass in 'b' as it is and x which should be the converted string.</p>

<p>Here is an implementation of dec2base. It is implemented recursively. </p>

<pre><code>void dec2base(int b, unsigned long x){
  if (x == 0)
     return;
  int y = x % b;
  x /= b;
  if (y &lt; 0)
     x += 1; 
  dec2base(b, x);
  //converted digits to hex after realizing this solution doesn't work 
  //for bases greater than 10. Credits to Trevor pointing this out.
  cout&lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; y &lt; 0 ? y + (b * -1) : y;
  return;
 }
</code></pre>
