<p>I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/arashpayan/appirater" rel="nofollow">Appirater</a> for showing an alert view to ask the user to rate your app. It is very small and easy to use, and keeps track of whether the user has clicked on the button to rate the app or if they want to be reminded later or if they don't want to be reminded again. You can easily set after how many days and how many uses or how many significant events should the rating alert show up.</p>
