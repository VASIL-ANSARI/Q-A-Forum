<p>Hrm, without knowing context and more about the data and how you are using the results and performance issues, i will try to suggest an alternative. Could you possibly split into multiple queries? Do the same as you do now, but instead of building a query with 2100+ in items, build two with 1050 in each, and then merge the results.</p>
