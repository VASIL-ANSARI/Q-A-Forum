<p>There are two aproaches to make different brandings of you app:</p>

<p>1) Split your app into multiple library projects, common code is in lets say common_lib library project, and all your brandings are in separate projects using common_lib but changing some of the resources, like strings, some drawables, also package name. This is the aproach we have choosen in our app.</p>

<p>2) Use gradle product flavors: <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-build.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-build.html</a>, I think this should now be the prefered solution.</p>
