<p>If I were you, I would choose option 3: have server prepare SQLite db and compress it using zip or gzip or something like it. Depending on your data, SQLite database should compress 2x-5x from original size.</p>

<p>Then your apk would connect to server, download compressed SQLite db, uncompress it into application home directory (or SDcard if you have permission and desire to do so).</p>

<p>From this point on, you just connect to this db from your app. If you want to download updates, it would be better to not redownload whole database, but implement incremental updates. If server is smart enough, it could offer another smaller SQLite db with incremental updates only (also compressed). Or, it can offer textual SQL script (again, compressed), by executing which you get necessary updates (and possibly schema changes as well).</p>
