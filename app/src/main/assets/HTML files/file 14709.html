<p>This works by getting the number of [whole] hours between "date 0" and <code>ImpDate</code>, then adding that to "date 0".</p>

<p>It's very similar in principle to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1177449/best-approach-to-remove-time-part-of-datetime-in-sql-server">removing the time</a> (which gets the number of [whole] days) and can be used to "truncate" to any date part (though for seconds or smaller, you may need to use a different "floor" date than 0 to avoid an overflow).</p>

<pre><code> SELECT ImpFile, DATEADD(hh, DATEDIFF(hh, 0, ImpDate), 0)
 FROM nol_artikula_izmaina
</code></pre>
