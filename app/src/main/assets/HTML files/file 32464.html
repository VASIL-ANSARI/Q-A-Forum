<p>Sounds like a bug, it could be that the tool concatenates files in a non-chronological order, if the JVM emits ten (or more) files per second, i.e.  a file named 2014_01_15_20_03_14_35880_10.jfr would come before 2014_01_15_20_03_14_35880_2.jfr, which perhaps confuses the Mission Control parser.</p>

<p>You could try to concatenate the files yourself, in the correct order. </p>
