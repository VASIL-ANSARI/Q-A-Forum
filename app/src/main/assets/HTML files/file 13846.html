<p>On Android, according to <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html#values" rel="nofollow" title="Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD">Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD</a>, the <code>value</code> array  corresponds to the micro-tesla readings of the magnetometer in the X, Y and Z directions. If you look at the MSDN docs for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.devices.sensors.compassreading%28v=vs.92%29.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="CompassReading Structure">CompassReading Structure</a> the <code>MagnetometerReading</code> will give you a <code>Vector3</code> providing the raw magnetometer readings from the device.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the MSDN docs specifically call out that these are <strong>raw</strong> readings where as the Android docs don't specify this. As such you'll probably get very different readings between the two systems.</p>

<p>MSDN has a good article on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh202974%28v=vs.92%29.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="How to: Get Data from the Compass Sensor for Windows Phone">How to: Get Data from the Compass Sensor for Windows Phone</a> which would be a good starting point.</p>
