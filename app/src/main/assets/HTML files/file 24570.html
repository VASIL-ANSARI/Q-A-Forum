<p>1) The constructor should not be calling the database, as Henk Holterman says. This both increases the coupling and decreases the cohesion.</p>

<p>2) The design pattern you may be looking for is called a Factory Pattern - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern</a> - this separates construction, initialization and population. On the other hand, you may want to introduce a helper or handler class that deals with the persistence aspects of your object.</p>

<p>3) It is reasonable to put in a database access stub to perform testing, since refactoring your code may be outside your jurisdiction. However, personally, I would recommend introducing a persistence helper class to bind a newly created object to the database values.</p>
