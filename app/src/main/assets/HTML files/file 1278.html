<p>Fix your database capacity issues. If you need to be able to reliably save <em>n</em> changes per second, then your database needs to be able to handle <em>n</em> operations per second.</p>

<p>Anything else (including saving every few operations) will lead to some possibility of data loss. If you can accept that data loss risk, then that would work.</p>

<p>A distributed cache (project Velocity or otherwise) could also help (data is at least saved to multiple machines). But that needs extra hardware, and you could spend that on the capacity of the database.</p>

<p>Finally, rather than trying to cache changes look for other opportunities to cache database reads, taking that load off might allow the writes to go through. At least until you get more usage.</p>
