<p>There are two aspects here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compile-time: This works because the only thing you know about <code>D</code> at compile-time is that it's an <code>Object</code>, so it's perfectly possible that the returned value is actually going to be a <code>D</code>--the compiler can't determine otherwise.</li>
<li>Run-time: Because Java implements generics via erasure, generic types are almost entirely a compile-time concept. This method actually has no idea what <code>D</code> is at run-time, so the cast doesn't do anything at all. If a non-generic method assigned the result to some type that was known at runtime (i.e. non-generic), then it could create a cast exception if the object was not of the right type.</li>
</ol>
