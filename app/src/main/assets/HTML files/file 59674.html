<p>If you want you can use an interface, although you'll probably find that you only ever have one implementation of this interface, defeating the whole purpose of the interface. Annotations themselves are pretty much interfaces. So an annotated class will be much the same.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you think having an ID field will mean that the class will be database dependent. The whole design intent of spring is to not make it interface with any persistence technology you want, and so you can use hibernate or whatever for persistence. If you do use hibernate you could configure your persistence classes in xml, so you won't see any persistence stuff in your domain object... except the ID of course, though I don't see this as a problem, if it is a massive problem well you could extend from a base class which has a private id field but you might not like that.</p>

<p>When you do annotate a domain object with persistence concerns, won't have any problems with other client code which doesn't want to know about persistence. They will only be able to see it if they are using reflection or something crazy to read annotations.</p>

<p>IMHO making all services, daos, entites, and all this stuff into interfaces, and then have only one implementation is overkill although I know some people will disagree. But I believe this is still a code smell none-the-less, because at then end of the day you have an interface with only 1 implementation. Say you are going to have more than one implementation later it will literally take you 10 seconds to change this back into an interface with 1 implementation with refactoring in eclipse. Simply copy your implementation code some where, extract the interface, change the current class to be the extracted interface, and put your copy code back in your project with something like <code>InterfaceImp extends Foo</code> on the top. Done. No need to overdo it at the start with maintaining some ghost interface.</p>
