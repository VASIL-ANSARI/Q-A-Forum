<p>It seems that Font-squirrel is going through some maintenance right now.  I would have to assume that this is the reason why their generator isnt properly converting files.  I solved this problem by useing another converter for fonts.  <a href="http://fontface.codeandmore.com/" rel="nofollow">found here!</a>  I'm not sure as to why but the fonts also became 20kbs smaller using this generator vs font-squirrel.  If anyone has any ideas why this generator reduces file sizes that would be great i'll upvote ya.  I hope this stops some headaches.</p>
