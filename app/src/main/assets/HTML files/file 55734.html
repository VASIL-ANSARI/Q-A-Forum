<p>I searched this topic since 2-3 month ago and found <code>OkHttp 's Authenticator</code>. You can use it . There is one link here : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22450036/refreshing-oauth-token-using-retrofit-without-modifying-all-calls">refreshing-oauth-token-using-retrofit-without-modifying-all-calls</a></p>

<p>It working like : If your request returns <code>401</code> , then <code>Authenticator</code> moves in , and refresh your token. But dont forget to <code>return null</code> or put any try limit .If you dont limit,it will try to refresh multiple times when your refresh fails and also use basic <code>HttpUrlConnection</code> instead of <code>Retrofit</code> when you are refreshing your token. Also i had a question in here , maybe you will take a look at : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35516626/solved-android-retrofit2-refresh-oauth-2-token">android-retrofit2-refresh-oauth-2-token</a></p>

<p>Also for example if you have a token and you need to refresh it per 3 hours . You can write an <code>Interceptor</code> too. In <code>Interceptor</code> : compare time and refresh your token without getting any <code>401</code> response. </p>

<p>You can read <code>Interceptor</code> page : <a href="https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/Interceptors" rel="nofollow">OkHttp Interceptors</a></p>

<p>You can take a look at there too : <a href="https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/Recipes#handling-authentication" rel="nofollow">OkHttp handling-authentication</a></p>

<p>I know there is no code here , but try links and edit your question , then i will help you.</p>
