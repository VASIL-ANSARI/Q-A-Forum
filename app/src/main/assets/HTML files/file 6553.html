<p>Welcome to the wacky world of CSS, where there is rarely a logical solution for simple problems. In this case there are a couple reasons why your border ain't tight. </p>

<p>First is simple, you are explicitly setting the width of <code>div.friendsbox</code> with an inline style. Remove that.</p>

<p>Now if you just do that, the containing <code>div</code> that you want a border on will simply stretch to fill the entire width that is available. Here is where it gets tricky, to get the <code>div</code> to only be as wide as its contents (assuming page width > <code>div</code> contents) you must set it to <code>float</code>. So...</p>

<pre><code>div.items div {
  float: left;
  border: solid 1px red; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you'll have a nice red border around your images, however you'd notice that the border extends below the images a small amount. The problem here is, well I think at least, that <code>img</code> elements are <code>inline</code> by default, which means they are treated like text, which means that extra padding is automatically added by the browser in somewhat unpredictable and not easily controlable ways. So the best solution I came up with was to also <code>float</code> each <code>img</code> element:</p>

<pre><code>div.items img {
  float: left;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Done? Of course not...you see there's one more issue. That box with the grey border is now collapsed, apparently ignorant of all those boxing guys inside of it. This is a CSS quirk, and can be fixed with a trailing element that has a <code>clear</code> style set:</p>

<pre><code>span.clear {
  clear: both;
  display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And in your markup you'd need to add</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="clear"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>after the closing tag for the <code>div</code> containing the pictures.</p>

<p>If anyone has a more elegant solution, please please post it. All this just reminds me of why I sometimes hate CSS.</p>
