<p>The button used when Enter is pressed is the Shell 'default' button.</p>

<p>In a property page you could set it with:</p>

<pre><code>getShell().setDefaultButton(buton);
</code></pre>

<p>You would have to make sure the default is reset whenever your property page becomes inactive.</p>

<p>I think changing the default away from the OK button might be very confusing.</p>
