<p><strong>For Web Server requests</strong></p>

<p>dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']) will give you what you need. Failing that $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] or even REQUEST_URI will have it.</p>

<p><strong>For CLI (command Line)</strong></p>

<p>this won't work in cli (command line) scripts as $_SERVER is added by the web server.</p>

<p>Fortunately it's a lot easier with cli scripts (as there is no web server to mess about with things).</p>

<p>All you need is to read the command line that started the script: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.argv.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.argv.php</a>. The first argument $argv[0] is always the name that was used to run the script. </p>
