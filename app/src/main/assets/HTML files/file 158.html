<p>IIRC, the browser pops the auth dialog when the following comes back in the request stream:</p>

<ul>
<li>Http status of 401</li>
<li>WWW-Authenticate header</li>
</ul>

<p>I would guess that you'd need to suppress one or both of those. The easy way to do that is to have a login method that'll take a Base64 username and password (you are using HTTPS, right?) and return 200 with a valid/invalid status. Once the password has been validated, you can use it with XHR.</p>
