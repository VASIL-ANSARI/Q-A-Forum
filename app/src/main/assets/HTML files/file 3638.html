<p>The design you have gone for is very chatty.  You have attached a new <code>FinishHandler</code> to each widget, when you only need to set it to your <code>btnFinish</code>.  The way you have it set, for each change in the GUI, you will update your <code>DataStorage</code> object.  Instead, by only adding it to the <code>btnFinish</code>, you can reduce the amount of times your Handler gets called and can simplify your process.  Of course, you will then need to consolidate your <code>itemStateChanged</code> and <code>actionPerformed</code> methods.  This will then give you the option of initializing your <code>DataStorage</code> object when you get into <code>actionPerformed</code>, and you can then initiate your persistence process.  Look at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html" rel="nofollow">SwingWorker</a> and concepts around <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html" rel="nofollow">concurrency in Swing</a> as you look into moving your data from memory to storage.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>By 'consolidate your <code>itemStateChanged</code> and <code>actionPerformed</code> methods,' I mean move all of you data gathering for your checkboxes into the action performed method.  This way, when you click on your finish button, you can gather all of the data that you need for your <code>DataStorage</code> object.</p>
