<p>Please take a look at the <a href="http://itextpdf.com/sandbox/stamper/ChangeVersion" rel="nofollow">ChangeVersion</a> example I made:</p>

<pre><code>public void manipulatePdf(String src, String dest) throws IOException, DocumentException {
    PdfReader reader = new PdfReader(src);
    PdfStamper stamper = new PdfStamper(reader, new FileOutputStream(dest), '4');
    stamper.close();
    reader.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, I create a <code>PdfReader</code> and a <code>PdfStamper</code>. In the <code>PdfStamper</code>, I tell iText that I want the version of the file to change to version 4.</p>

<p>Once I close the stamper, the magic is done. Please check the file <a href="http://itextpdf.com/sites/default/files/other_version.pdf" rel="nofollow">other_version.pdf</a> to convince yourself that this works.</p>

<p>One observation: your original file <a href="http://itextpdf.com/sites/default/files/OCR.pdf" rel="nofollow">OCR.pdf</a> has a compressed cross-reference table. If you would open this file in a text editor, and manually change the version number from 1.6 to 1.4, Adobe Reader will tell you that the file is an 1.5 file because compressed cross-reference tables didn't exist in PDF 1.4. They were introduced in PDF 1.5.</p>

<p>In this case, iText will uncompress the cross-reference table, resulting in a valid 1.4 PDF file. However: iText doesn't downgrade <em>all</em> new functionality automatically. If a specific PDF contains newer functionality (e.g. OCGs), then iText won't remove those OCGs if you change the PDF version to a version predating the introduction of OCG.</p>
