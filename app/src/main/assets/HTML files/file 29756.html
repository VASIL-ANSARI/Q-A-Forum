<p>Yes, this is expected behavior.</p>

<p>The client does not send anything. And it exit as soon as it connect to the server; cause disconnection.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html#socket.socket.recv"><code>socket.recv</code></a> returns an empty string if the peer performed shutdown (disconnect).</p>

<p>While, in the REPL, the  socket is not closed until you issue <code>sys.exit()</code> or you quit the interactive shell.</p>
