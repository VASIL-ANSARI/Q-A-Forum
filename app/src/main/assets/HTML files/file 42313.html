<p>Yes, your assumption is correct. Parse.com will be enough to implement your initial requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>use <a href="https://parse.com/docs/android_guide#users" rel="nofollow">ParseUser</a> for users stuff;</li>
<li>use <a href="https://parse.com/docs/push_guide#top/Android" rel="nofollow">Push notifications</a> to notify about new messages;</li>
<li>use <a href="https://parse.com/docs/android_guide#files" rel="nofollow">ParseFile</a> to handle sharing of files.</li>
</ul>

<p>But keep in mind <a href="https://parse.com/plans" rel="nofollow">price</a> for that. I guess, Free plan will be enough at initial state, but later when your project will require more, you'll need to pay. </p>

<p>So you need to think about it and weight all +/- </p>
