<p>Your only other option is to use P/invoke to call <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms681988%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">ChangeServiceConfig2</a> with <code>SERVICE_CONFIG_DELAYED_AUTO_START_INFO</code>. But since you seem to be unwilling to add the registry entry, I doubt you would want to use P/invoke. There's no other way to do it from the .NET Framework (&lt; 4.0).</p>
