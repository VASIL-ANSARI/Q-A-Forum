<p><a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/annotations/3.5/reference/en/html_single/#entity-mapping-property">The docs</a> say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.2.2.2. Access type</p>
  
  <p>By default the access type of a class hierarchy is defined by the position of the @Id or @EmbeddedId annotations. If these annotations are on a field, then only fields are considered for persistence and the state is accessed via the field. If there annotations are on a getter, then only the getters are considered for persistence and the state is accessed via the getter/setter. That works well in practice and is the recommended approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it is expected and documented behaviour - so place your annotations consistently - either fields or getters.</p>

<p>(If you read the documentation below what I quoted, it says there is a way to mix access types, using the <code>@Access</code> annotation, but I would not recommend that - be consistent. I, personally, prefer putting the annotations on the fields)</p>
