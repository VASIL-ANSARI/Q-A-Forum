<p>If you have a settings view controller, I assume you have some sort of model object to keep track of saved settings. In that model object you should keep track of the user name.</p>

<p>In your main view controller just add:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidAppear
{
    [super viewDidAppear];
    self.userNameLabel.text = [self.modelObject valueForKey:@"userName"];
}
</code></pre>
