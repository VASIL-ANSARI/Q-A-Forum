<p>I was facing the same problem sometime ago, I decided to go with following structure. (I have an app with LITE / PAID edition).</p>

<p>I use a <strong>single</strong> codebase for both edition and I can do this thanks to maven.
With it I can just build the target version I need. </p>

<p>My Maven (pom.xml) is so configured that it creates a total new source-base, refactor package name, change AndroidManifest, replace icons, replace properties file, build and sign with the right key the APK all with a single command-line:</p>

<pre><code>mvn install -Dedition=lite -P release
</code></pre>

<p>I think this is a good solution, the only drawback is that requires some work to configure your pom.xml right (especially if you don't know maven well).</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
