<p>Although USB is a serial protocol, you can't treat USB like a serial port:</p>

<p>It's dependant on what the actual device is. For example a mobile phone, may provide several "endpoints" for USB, one being a serial port to use the phone as a modem, one as a storage device allowing you to transfer photos and music files to/from the phones storage, and as a camera device that you can take photos with. All of these have different behaviour and need a USB driver-plugin to make it behave correctly - these are typically shipped with Windows, and your phone will appear as COM5:, the E: or "Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini" drives and as a camera under the "cameras and scanners". </p>

<p>Of course, you can programmatically open all these devices, but it is done as the device-type that they present as on the inside of windows (so you use serial port functions or file functions or camera functions). </p>

<p>You CAN also write a device driver for a device, if you have sufficient details of how it works. </p>

<p>But there's no real way to "open the port". The USB API is a driver API, not a user-mode API. Here's a page to start from to understand USB drivers:

<p>There is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/hardware/ff540196(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">WinUSB</a> driver, which allows a single application to access a single device, assuming you know how to operate that device. </p>
