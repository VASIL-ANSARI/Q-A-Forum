<p>I suggest you use gems, and bundle them in your application. We are using several private gems and keep them in the <code>vendor/cache</code> directory.</p>

<p>Plugins are deprecated, and will be removed. (Rails 4.0 I believe will remove them) They also cause warning spew.</p>

<p>Using a submodule is an interesting idea, but I would still stick with a gem.</p>
