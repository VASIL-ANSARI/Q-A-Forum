<p>The point of MVC is to move data connections out of the View (aspx page) and into a Controller. </p>

<p>Read some more MVC tutorials, and buy a book or two. You should actually populate the data into a viewmodel on the controller, and then pass that viewmodel to the view. This way, the view knows nothing about how to get the data -- it already got it from the controller.</p>

<p>Views should have the responsibility of displaying data to users over the web, not getting the data or manipulating it directly. </p>

<p>With that aside, here is how you would do it:</p>

<p>Pass the query as a string to an Action Method on a Controller (using HTTP POST or GET) using AJAX (i.e. jQuery $.ajax() method). </p>

<p>Have the action method return the HTML for your popup window, using a Partial View. You could also return Json, but I think HTML / partial view would be easier in this case. This is the method that will do your OLE DB connection, and execute the query. </p>

<p>In your $.ajax() success function callback, write javascript that will popup a new dialog with the partial view HTML that was returned by the controller action method. </p>
