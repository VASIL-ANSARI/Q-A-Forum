<p>What you have there seems like it would work alright assuming the <code>changeStatus()</code> call would do something like: <code>is_modal = !is_modal;</code> You could definitely define your template a little more simply. For example, wrap both of the advanced fields in a single <code>div</code> with a single <code>ng-show="is_modal"</code> then you wouldn't have to deal with the extra span, but it just depends on what you're trying to accomplish with your markup...</p>

<p>But, it looks like what you have there should work just fine.</p>
