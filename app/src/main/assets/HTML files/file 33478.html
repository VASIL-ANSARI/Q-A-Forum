<p>Change the code as below.</p>

<p>You need to check on every fork() its return code and not only on the last call of fork. I didn't run and try but this is the error I feel.
You said - you need 1 Parent and 3 child - so during first fork() - 1 child will be created and then for second fork() - 1 grandchild of child and 1 more child of a parent will be created. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<pre><code>      parent
       /   \  
   fork-1  fork-2
      |      |
    child1  child-2
      |
    fork-2
      |
    child3 


for(int i=0;i&lt;2;i++)
{
   if (fork()==0)
      printf ("Init Child. PID =%d\n", getpid());
      sleep(1);
   } else {
      printf ("I am the parent. PID = %d\n",getpid()); 
      sleep(1);
   }
}
</code></pre>
