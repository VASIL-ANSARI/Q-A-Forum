<p>There isn't an equivalent in the sense that you describe, since String is a variable-length collection of characters, and having zero characters is still a valid String.  One integer cannot contain zero integers, since by definition, it is already an integer.</p>

<p>However, your problem revolves around how Scanner works, rather than how int works.</p>

<p>Take a look at <code>scan.hasNextInt()</code>, which returns true if there is an int to read, and false otherwise.  This may give you what you want, using something like:</p>

<pre><code>Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
int sum = 0;
while(scan.hasNextInt())
{
    int a = scan.nextInt();
    sum = sum + a;
}
System.out.println(sum);
</code></pre>
