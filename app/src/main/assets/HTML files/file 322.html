<p>The PDB is a database file that maps the instructions to their line numbers in the original code so when you get a stack trace you'll get the line numbers for the code. If it's an unmanaged DLL then the PDB file will also give you the names of the functions in the stack trace, whereas that information is usually only available for managed DLLs without PDBs.</p>
