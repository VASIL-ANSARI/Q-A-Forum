<p>That message is a standard error one when SQLite can't open the database file. It doesn't necessarily mean the database is encrypted, indeed it almost certainly isn't unless you've specifically tried to encrypt it. It just means the file you're accessing is not a valid normal SQLite database file. </p>

<p>Did you go wrong somewhere earlier, in creating the file or trying to open the wrong file path ? </p>
