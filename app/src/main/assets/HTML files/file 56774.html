<p>I would go from a different angle to do this by detecting the blue circle first.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Detect base colors</strong></p>

<p>see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/37476754/2521214">RGB value base color name</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Select all blue pixels neighboring white or gray-ish ones</strong></p>

<p>As your circlehas black border then you have to select all blue pixels near white,gray,black... just to be sure. This is the result (Green are selected pixels):</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XUXFp.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/XUXFp.png" alt="example"></a></p>

<p>another (more robust) possibility is to select all black pixels neighboring white and blue at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>do a connected components analysis</strong></p>

<p>so merge all connected pixels into polylines</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For each polyline decide if it is circle/ellipse/oval</strong></p>

<p>that can be done by investigating angle between line segments. If has sharp spikes then sharp edges are present and it is not an oval. If the circumference is too far from circle/elipse/oval  computed from its bounding box then it is not oval but some more complicated curvature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>For each oval decide if it is filled with blue</strong></p>

<p>so just flood fill mask of the oval circumference and compare how many pixels are int the original image blue against those that are not. if the ratio is closer to 100% blue then it is filled blue oval shape....</p>

<p>As your marker has also some features inside you can compute the ratio of all base colors inside it to more accurately detect the marker.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/36054594/2521214">Algorithms: Ellipse matching</a> for some additional ideas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>now you can similarly check if the background is white/gray-ish</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are a lot of other possible approaches like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22879053/2521214">OCR and character similarity</a> or based on FFT/DCT, Hough transform for circles... also you are not bound only to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22166032/2521214">geometric properties comparation</a> instead you can compare histograms...</p>
