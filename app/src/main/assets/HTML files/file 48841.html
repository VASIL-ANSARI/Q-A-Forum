<p>If you carefully inspect your URL, it looks like your it is wrong anyway: <code>http://http//</code> - is your host really named <code>http</code>, and do you really need two slashes after it? Anyway if you fix that, the <code>Host</code> header will carry <code>localhost.fiddler:60001</code>. </p>

<p>By removing the Host header, you're essentially downgrading your request to HTTP/1.0. </p>

<p>You can set the HTTP version in the <code>HttpRequestMessage</code> as explained in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28097457/set-http-protocol-version-in-httpclient">Set HTTP protocol version in HttpClient</a>:</p>

<pre><code>msg.Version = HttpVersion.Version10;
</code></pre>

<p>But when using Fiddler, it acts as a proxy, and forwards your request as an HTTP/1.1 request - including the host header again. You can also alter the request in Fiddler. This is explained in <a href="http://www.telerik.com/forums/how-do-i-prevent-fiddler-from-insering-host-http-header" rel="nofollow">How do I prevent fiddler from insering "Host" HTTP header?</a>, but note the bold text, emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Per the RFC, as a HTTP/1.1 proxy, Fiddler is required to add a Host header.</p>
  
  <p>It's not clear why this is problematic-- <strong>any server that has a problem with this is, by definition, buggy and should be fixed</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>You can remove the header if you'd like (although doing so can cause problems elsewhere). Click Rules > Customize Rules. Scroll to OnBeforeRequest and add the following:</p>

<pre><code>if (oSession.oRequest.headers.HTTPVersion == "HTTP/1.0")
{
    oSession["x-overridehost"] = oSession.host;
    oSession.oRequest.headers.Remove("Host");
}
</code></pre>
