<p>Use a <code>BorderLayout</code> for the main layout.</p>

<ol>
<li>add the "header" to the <code>NORTH</code>.</li>
<li>add the "footer" to the <code>SOUTH</code>.</li>
<li>Create another panel and add it to the <code>CENTER</code>. Then set the layout manager of this panel to an appropriate layout manager. We can't advise you what layout manager to use for this panel since we don't know how the two components area related. Then add "area1" and "area2" to this panel. </li>
</ol>

<p>The key to this answer is that you don't need to use a single layout manager, you can nest panels with different layout managers.</p>
