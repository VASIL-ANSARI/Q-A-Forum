<p>We can't know why the contributors to jQuery didn't do something.  We can guess that they didn't want to make a method for every property and attribute (to avoid bloating the size) so they chose a generic way of addressing all of them.</p>

<p>You can roll your own methods easily enough if it matters to you:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.disable = function() {
    return this.prop("disabled", true);
}

$.fn.enable = function() {
    return this.prop("disabled", false);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, a single method:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.enable = function(val) {
    if (val === undefined) {
        val = true;
    }
    return this.prop("disabled", !val);
}
</code></pre>
