<p>If you want to do this in Excel without having to go through VBA use:</p>

<pre><code>=TRIM(CLEAN(A1))
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you want to clean cell A1.  From my tests this removes all tabs, carriage return and line feeds, but also converts multiple spaces to single ones so it may not be exactly what you want.</p>
