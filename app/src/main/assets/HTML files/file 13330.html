<p>We know magento is built on ZF. But integrating it in your site will not be easy. Magento table structure will be different then your site. You will need to do lot of work for integration. And  if your site is in middle like user and products modules are already completed. Then might be you need to rework totally for them.</p>

<p>Best way is make your own shopping cart system according to your needs.</p>
