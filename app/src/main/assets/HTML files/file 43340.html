<p>If you don't want to serialize a member of a class. Just mark it as <code>transient</code>. </p>

<p>In your particular case, you don't need to go through the trouble of creating a super class. Do this instead :</p>

<pre><code>public class Bucket implements Serializable {
    transient private int f3 = 3;
    transient private int f4 = 4;    // useless data when it comes to storing
    transient private int f5 = 5;
    private int f1 = 1;
    private int f2 = 2;

   //leave the remaining code in this class as it is
}
</code></pre>
