<p>Check that the option 'Full Screen at Launch' is checked on the Window in you MainWindow.xib.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem and others when updating for iPhone 5 screen. Apparently the 'Simulated metrics' of Window will be the actual metrics when launching (provided you have not checked 'Full Screen at Launch').</p>

<p>Apple actually has a Note about it in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIWindow_Class/UIWindowClassReference/UIWindowClassReference.html" rel="nofollow">UIWindow Class Reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... If you choose to create a window in Interface Builder, be sure to select the Full Screen at Launch option in the Attributes inspector so that the window is sized appropriately for the current device. ...</p>
