<p>Just implement the method without awaiting:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;Foo&gt; GetFooAsync()
{
    return new Foo();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't matter that you're not awaiting anything. It's not a requirement of an async method to await anything (although the compiler will warn you that you're not awaiting anything).</p>

<p>If you don't want the overhead of an aysnc method (there's a cost associated with the async "state machine" that might be undesirable), you could</p>

<pre><code>public Task&lt;Foo&gt; GetFooAsync()
{
    return Task.FromResult(new Foo());
}
</code></pre>
