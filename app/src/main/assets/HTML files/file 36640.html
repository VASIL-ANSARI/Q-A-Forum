  <p>Isnt malloc creating dynamic memory for you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does. However, you need to be able to hold the address of that memory somewhere, too.</p>

<pre><code>int *ptr = malloc(1000 * sizeof(int));
...
free(ptr); // Once you are done, you need to release the memory by calling free
</code></pre>

<p>The address is stored in a pointer <code>ptr</code>, which needs a small amount of memory to be stored. You use that pointer to reference the memory that you have allocated.</p>
