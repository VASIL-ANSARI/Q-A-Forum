<p>When providing an argument for a pass-by-reference parameter, the compiler will do the necessary &amp; operation behind the scenes. You, as the programmer, know that it is internally using the address of your argument, but this is hidden in the pass-by-reference abstraction. This is safer than using a pointer as you cannot inadvertently reassign a reference.</p>
