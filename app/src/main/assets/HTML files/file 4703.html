<p>Your question is more about javascript (client side) than GAE (server side).</p>

<p>You should start from something like <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/autocomplete">jQuery AutoComplete</a>. If the number of tags is small you can just embed the data in the html, otherwise look at the examples using AJAX calls. </p>

<p>If you go AJAX then you need something at the server side - all you have to do is put up some URL that accepts a query and returns JSON formated data. I like to use <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> on GAE, it has nice <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/serialization/">serializers</a> for this.</p>
