<p>Are you going to publish both modules separately or together in one package? </p>

<p>If the former, then you'll probably want to have your users install your xml module (I'd call it something else :) so that it is, by default, already on Python's path, and declare it as a dependency of the tasklist module.</p>

<p>If both are distributed as a bundle, then <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references" rel="nofollow">relative imports</a> seem to be the best option, since you can control where the paths are relative to each other.</p>
