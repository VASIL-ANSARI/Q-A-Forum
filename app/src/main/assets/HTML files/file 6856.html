<p>Are there other RichFaces componentes in that page? When you insert rich:panelMenu, it will trigger to load jQuery/Prototype over that page. Are you using another version of jQuery/Prototype for your old school menus?</p>

<p>Check which jQuery version are you using. Open Firefug console (Firebug is an extension to Firefox) and write this (with and without rich:panelMenu):</p>

<pre><code>jQuery().jquery
</code></pre>

<p>Another option: maybe your JavaScript's menu is overriding some JavaScript from jQuery/Prototype (used by rich:panelMenu).</p>
