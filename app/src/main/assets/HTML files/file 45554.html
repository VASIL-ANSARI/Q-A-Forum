<p>On Android 4.4 and 5.0 <br>localStorage for my phonegap app persists even on restart. The only way I know to actually clear it is by clearing the app's cache, or uninstalling the app completely.</p>

<pre><code>// Store
localStorage.lastname = "Smith";
// Retrieve
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = localStorage.lastname;
</code></pre>
