<p>3 Options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Replace everything with a ListView, with the other parent and custom icons as a header view for the ListView. ListView is faster, because it only creates Views as it needs them.</p></li>
<li><p>Programatically create the contents of my_list_item instead of inflating, might be quicker</p></li>
<li><p>Use of <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/loading-ondemand.html">ViewStubs</a> may allow you to load views on-demand. </p></li>
<li><p>Maybe it isn't loading the views but the data? in which case prepare the data in a background thread.</p></li>
</ol>
