<p>At first, I don't know why you have implemented round() function, since there is a round() function is c.</p>

<p>Second, you have implemented round() function incorrectly. you need something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int round(double num)
{
return static_cast&lt;int&gt;(num+0.5);
}
</code></pre>
