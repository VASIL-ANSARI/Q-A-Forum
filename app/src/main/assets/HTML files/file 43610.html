<p>Looks like date is giving you a full timestamp. This is pretty much what your query is doing:</p>

<pre><code>date_1 = DateTime.parse('2015-04-03T10:01:00.000Z')
-&gt; 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 10:01:00 +0000'
date_2 = DateTime.parse('2015-04-03T10:11:00.000Z')
-&gt; 'Fri, 03 Apr 2015 10:11:00 +0000'
date_1 == date_2
-&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>Your query is checking for equality down to the second. Looks like you need something more like this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9624601/activerecord-find-by-year-day-or-month-on-a-date-field">ActiveRecord Find By Year, Day or Month on a Date field</a></p>
