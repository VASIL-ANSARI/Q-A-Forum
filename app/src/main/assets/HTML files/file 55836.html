<p>Passing a private constructor as an instance of <code>Supplier</code> does not break encapsulation, for the very reason that the constructor is passed as an instance of <code>Supplier</code>. The receiver of the instance (in this case <code>Game</code>) has no idea how the <code>Supplier</code> is implemented, only that it fulfills the <code>Supplier</code> interface. That's what <em>Programming to an Interface</em> is all about: even though the caller provides a concrete implementation, the receiver is only aware of the interface which the implementation fulfills. Encapsulation would be violated if the <code>Game</code> knew the specific implementation that it was getting.</p>

<p>Note that passing a <code>Supplier</code> to the <code>Game</code> may or may not make sense in the larger context of your application, but at least it does not violate the encapsulation of <code>MapBoardGenerator</code>.</p>
