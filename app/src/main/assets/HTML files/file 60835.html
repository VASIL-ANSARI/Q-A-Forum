<p>First of all there is already at least one Java application which can record LIRC codes for any remote: IrScrutinizer at <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/IrScrutinizer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.harctoolbox.org/IrScrutinizer.html</a></p>

<p>That said, you did not mention the lirc version used. IIRC, older versions including the really old 0.9.0 was not able to redirect the mode2 output. So, if you still want to follow this path, updating lirc to current 0.9.4b is a starter. Depending on your platform this might or might not require you to build it from upstream sources from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/lirc/files/LIRC/0.9.4b/" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/lirc/files/LIRC/0.9.4b/</a> </p>

<p>Note that the update from 0.9.0 to 0.9.4 is non-trivial, the configuration is very different. </p>
