<p><code>Dim mailServerName As String = "SMTP.MyDomain.com"</code></p>

<p>This line of code is setting the name of the server that you use.  It may be something like <code>mail.godaddy.com</code> or <code>mail.yourdomain.com</code> or something of that nature.  If you have mail services through your provider (GoDaddy) then you'll want to check with them as to what their outgoing (SMTP) mail server is.  They may also have other settings you need to keep in mind (such as authentication, SSL, port number, etc.) as well.</p>

<p><code>Dim message As MailMessage = New MailMessage(from, "onfire4godcollins@gmail.com", "feedback", body)</code></p>

<p>This line of code is creating a <code>MailMessage</code> object to send to the server.  It's instantiating it with a "from" address which was passed to the method, a specific "to" address (which I assume is you), a specific "subject" line (feedback) and the message body which was passed to the method.</p>

<p>If you're trying to run this code on your local machine as-is then you're probably finding that it throws an exception when attempting to connect to <code>SMTP.MyDomain.com</code> since I'm guessing that doesn't exist.  It'll need the real value of your SMTP server.  Keep in mind that your provider's server may also not be accessible from your local computer, possibly only from their host.</p>

<p>(Note: If that's your actual email address, you may want to edit it out of the question, and I'll edit it out of my answer as well.)</p>
