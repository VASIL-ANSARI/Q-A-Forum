<p>You want to use the <code>O_TRUNC</code> flag to <code>open()</code>, by OR-ing it with the existing flags you have above:</p>

<pre><code>int fout = open(out_file_name, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 644);
</code></pre>

<p>This will truncate the file. Below is the information in the man page for open(2).</p>

<pre><code>   O_TRUNC
          If the file already exists and is a regular file  and  the  open
          mode  allows  writing  (i.e.,  is O_RDWR or O_WRONLY) it will be
          truncated to length 0.  If the file is a FIFO or terminal device
          file,  the  O_TRUNC  flag  is  ignored.  Otherwise the effect of
          O_TRUNC is unspecified.
</code></pre>
