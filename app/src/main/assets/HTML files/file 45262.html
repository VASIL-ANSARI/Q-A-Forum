  <p>Is checking for the license mandatory or just a best practice so you apps are not pirated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not mandatory.  And in a packaged app (which all ARC apps are), it is difficult to do this securely, as noted at <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/check_for_payment" rel="nofollow">https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/check_for_payment</a>: "Although you can use the API in packaged apps and extensions, it's more difficult for them to use the license server securely"</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does anyone had a good sample code of performing the license check for chrome, written in java for an Android app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no exposed API to do a license check in this manner with ARC currently.</p>

<p>The more common monetization strategy so far for ARC apps has been ads on free apps, so any special work for paid apps has not been prioritized.</p>
