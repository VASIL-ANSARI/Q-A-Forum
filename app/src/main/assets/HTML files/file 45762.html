<p>There seems to be some weird behavior with loading <code>CalendarView</code>. I recently dealt with the issue in a <code>DatePicker</code> by setting <code>android:calendarViewShown="false"</code>, which speeds it up nicely. Perhaps you could try this too.</p>

<p>Edit: SO has several questions about CalendarViews performance, for example <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18721298/calendarview-takes-much-time-for-displaying">CalendarView takes much time for displaying</a></p>
