<p>First of all, for large data sets you better use MergeSort because it is much faster (<code>O(n log n)</code>) than BubbleSort (<code>O(n * n)</code>).</p>

<p>Besides that, you are only reading the first two characters of the inputstream and after reading the data, you override the value in the for-loop.</p>

<p>I think you first have to copy the entire content of in input file, to the output file. Then you need a way to swap 2 characters in the output stream. After that, you can run the bubblesort algorithm on the inputfile and apply the swap on the output file.</p>

<p>Your for-loop should look something like:</p>

<pre><code>// TODO: Copy input to output

for (int sortedElement = 0; sortedElement &lt; StreamLength; sortedElement++)
{
   // You don't have to loop till the end of the stream. Last
   // character is sorted on each iteration.
   for (int index = 0; index &lt; StreamLength - sortedElements - 1; index++)
   {
       // read character from input stream at position 'index' as leftValue
       // read character from input stream at position 'index+1' as rightValue

       if (rightValue &lt; leftValue)
       {
          // Perform swap values in outputfile
       }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should be it.</p>
