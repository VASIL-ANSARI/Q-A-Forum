<p>I work for <a href="http://www.twilio.com" rel="nofollow">Twilio</a>, which allows you to add Voice and SMS into you applications using the cloud. So instead of an SMS modem (I've had 'fun' with those myself!) you set use a web server. You can buy a telephone number from Twilio in over 40 countries, and simply configure that number to send the SMS messages to your server - <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2012/01/twilio-for-net-developers-part-2-adding-twilio-helper-libraries-to-your-project.html" rel="nofollow">a simple .Net web application is a great way to go</a>. You can host it yourself, or use <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/twilio-voice-and-sms-service/" rel="nofollow">Azure</a>.</p>

<p>There is a nice tutorial on <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/csharp/sms/hello-monkey" rel="nofollow">how to get started here</a>.</p>
