<p>Apparently I'd missed out the xml declaration at the top of the xml document. Clever.</p>

<p>However, the best way to get this working is to create a Questionnaire object and classes for the Question and Answer and then convert the XML to the classes by deserializing it. Then you can bind the Questionnaire's questions to the drop down list and it basically works a load better and easier after the initial work you have to do to create the objects.</p>
