<p>I'm going to assume that this line's the cause of your problem:</p>

<pre><code>EditText editText3=(EditText)findViewById(R.id.xray);
</code></pre>

<p>Your activity_select.xml doesn't define a control with the ID <code>xray</code> hence the call to findViewById returns a null and your call to editText3.setText() results in an NPE. It does, however, have TextViews with IDs <code>XRay</code> and <code>xRay</code>. Try using one of those instead. </p>
