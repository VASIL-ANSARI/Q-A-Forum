<p>I've been able to eliminate the crash by calling the UsageMgr read() method in my appDelegate.applicationWillEnterForeground() method. read() allocates a new usage dictionary and reads the previous values from NSUserDefaults. </p>

<p>But I'm not happy with this fix. Clearly it appears ARC is releasing my usage dictionary when the app enters the background, and that's not my understanding of how ARC should work. It's certainly not how it's worked in my objective C applications, many of which have run in the background (while using background fetch, location services, etc). The auto release pool should still exist, and if I have global references to these objects (including the Singleton) I don't think they should be released. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something about ARC or how Swift implements it.</p>
