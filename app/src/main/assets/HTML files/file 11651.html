<p>If you look at the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/animate/" rel="nofollow">jQuery <code>animate</code> documentation</a>, you will see that there's a calling form that allows you to pass it a step function that will be called for each step of the animation.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/animate/" rel="nofollow">jQuery documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>.animate( properties, options )</code></p>
  
  <p><strong><code>properties</code></strong>: A map of CSS properties that the animation will move toward.<br>
  <strong><code>options</code></strong>: A map of additional options to pass to the method.</p>
  
  <h2>Supported keys:</h2>
  
  <p><strong><code>duration</code></strong>: A string or number determining how long the animation will run.<br>
  <strong><code>easing</code></strong>: A string indicating which easing function to use for the transition.<br>
  <strong><code>complete</code></strong>: A function to call once the animation is complete.<br>
  <strong><em><code>step</code></strong>: A function to be called after each step of the animation.</em><br>
  <strong><code>queue</code></strong>: A Boolean indicating whether to place the animation in the effects queue. If false, the animation will begin immediately. As of jQuery 1.7, the queue option can also accept a string, in which case the animation is added to the queue represented by that string.<br>
  <strong><code>specialEasing</code></strong>: A map of one or more of the CSS properties defined by the properties argument and their corresponding easing functions (added 1.4).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending upon the time you set and the speed of your animation, there is no guarantee that the step function will fire for every single pixel, but it will fire for every step of the animation (some of which might be multiple pixels, rather than one).</p>

<p>Here's a working example of the step function: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/8bKz3/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/8bKz3/</a>.</p>
