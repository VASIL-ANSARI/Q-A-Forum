<p>yes that is acceptable! The browser will ignore line breaks and will teat them as spaces. So in you second example you will have an <code>h1</code> element with two classes as attributes.</p>

<p>So </p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 
class="one
two"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as </p>

<pre><code>&lt; h1 class="one two"&gt;
</code></pre>
