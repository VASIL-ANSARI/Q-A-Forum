<p>You seem to have put T-SQL command in CSDL. At the CSDL your database was abstracted and the EF does not "know" (and does not care) what your back end is. The DefiningExpression is an expression in Entity SQL - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387145.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb387145.aspx</a> - and not any dialect of SQL specific to a database. At this level the string type is the type from the EDM type system (denoted as Edm.String) which does not have .value property of function. (In fact it does not have any properties or functions). If you need store specifc function defined using the dialect of Sql the database is using you need to store it in SSDL Function element - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd283136(v=VS.90" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd283136(v=VS.90</a>)</p>
