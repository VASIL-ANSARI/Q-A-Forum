<p>You should install the latest version, which is <em>revision 4</em>. You do that with the <em>SDK Manager</em>, aka. <em>Android SDK and AVD Manager</em>. The driver is in <em>Third Party Add-ons</em>, then in <em>Google Inc.</em></p>

<p>This is true, you may need to do it several times to resolve dependencies</p>

<p>Then adb and ddms are in new locations in the sdk Find them and use the new versions\Bonne Chance
