<p>When you create your servlet you decide whether you will make it single threaded or multi-threaded. You can mark your servlet as single-threaded by implementing the interface</p>

<pre><code>javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel
</code></pre>

<p>A single threaded servlet can serve only one request at a time, and that's usually not what we want. So typically we allow our servlets to be multi-threaded and implement accordingly. Code on the assumption that many threads, each of which corresponds to one user's request, may be in our servlet at the same time. This is not hard to do - avoid using instance variables that can be changed by any one request thread and remember that any synchronized code will become a point of contention.</p>
