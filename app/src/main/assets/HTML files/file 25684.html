<p>This sounds like a great use for a Yeoman generator. If you haven't already experimented with Yeoman, <a href="http://yeoman.io" rel="nofollow">check it out</a>. In addition to being a tool that scaffolds a full application, pre-configured with best practices and common Grunt tasks, you also have the option to create your own "generator", to develop a prompt-based, custom build process that suits your needs. And for finer-grained tasks such as "insert this script in index.html," a "sub-generator" is used to do just that.</p>

<p>Developing a generator isn't restricted to something you intend to distribute, but can just be used to make your own common tasks more efficient. The <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators.html" rel="nofollow">Generate a Generator guide</a> shows how you can do essentially just what you're describing, with little effort.</p>

<p>Grunt init templates are in the process of moving to Yeoman generators, so if you haven't already, now's a good time to play around with the Yo man! If you decide to try it out, let me know what you think.</p>
