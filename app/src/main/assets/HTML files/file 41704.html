<p>I Think a better way (without being too loud) should be to check the date every request and show when the date is passed.</p>

<p>So in DB we can inagine a table "Advert" that store all adverts you want with id, name, content of the advert (text? link? path to picture? and BeginDate ...)</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Advert&gt; advertsToShow = yourDB.GetAllAdvert.Where( x=&gt; x.BeginDate &gt; DateTime?Now).toList();
</code></pre>
