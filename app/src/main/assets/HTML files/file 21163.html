<p>The default action you are preventing on the <code>mouseup</code> event is not responsible for changing the href. That being said, it doesn't matter if you prevent it or not, the href gets executed on the <code>click</code> event.</p>

<p>The <code>click</code> event gets fired after <code>mousedown</code>, so changing the <code>mouseup</code> to <code>click</code> should work just fine.</p>
