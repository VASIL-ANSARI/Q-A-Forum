<p>The issue is probably solved as mentioned by the comments, where redundant spaces in the 'names' causes them to compare unequally. You also have an issue when you want to compare names in a case-insensitive manner.</p>

<p>The first issue can be solved by trimming whitespace from each name:</p>

<pre><code>BoysAndGirlsList = BoysAndGirlsList.Select(name =&gt; name.Trim()).ToList();
MostPopularNamesList = MostPopularNamesList.Select(name =&gt; name.Trim()).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>The second issue can be solved by using an invariant case comparer:</p>

<pre><code>if (BoysAndGirlsList.Contains(NameEntered, StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) &amp;&amp; 
    MostPopularNamesList.Contains(NameEntered, StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))
</code></pre>
