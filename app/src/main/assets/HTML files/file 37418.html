<p>Set the binding navigator on the main page to have the datasource as the entire tbl_Personen.
Then set the bindingsource on the datagridview to that person objects related person's language...</p>

<p>Here's some kinda code to do the first part (it's not perfect, but you get the general idea):</p>

<pre><code>using (var data = yourdataentities())
{
   var person = data.Personen.FirstOrDefault();
   formbindingsource.DataSource = person;
   var languagesGuySpeaks = from p_x_l in data.link_spricht
                            join language in data.Sprachen on language.Id equals p_x_l.SprachID
                            where p_x_l.Person_ID == person.Id
                            select language;


   datagridbindingsource.DataSource = languagesGuySpeaks;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then add an event handler to update datagridbindingsource.DataSource when your person changes (however you want to handle that; like a dropdown or whatever)</p>
