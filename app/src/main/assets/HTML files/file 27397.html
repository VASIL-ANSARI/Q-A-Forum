<p>If you want something to vary, say, with every load of a page, use a server-side technology such as php. If you want it to vary within one page load, I.e. in response to user interaction, use a client-side technology I.e. JavaScript.</p>

<p>To attempt to answer the original question, or at least give you some pointers, you want something a bit like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id="menu" style="display: none;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a id="btn" href="#"&gt;disable menu&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
document.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', function() {
    document.getElementById('menu').setAttribute('style', 'display: block');
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's not perfect (in practice, for one thing, you don't want to just point your link to "#" since that won't do anything for those with javascript disabled) but it's a pointer in the right direction. The jQuery equivalent would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
$('#btn').click(function() { $('#menu').hide(); });&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>if that's more appealing, check out jQuery.</p>
