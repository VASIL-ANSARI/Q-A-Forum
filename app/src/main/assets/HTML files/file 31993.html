<p>I think you don't have so many alternatives to a switch/case statement.</p>

<p>In your case, the statement to execute for each case is specific, because you have to cast to a precise class. In my opinion, there isn't much more to do, except if the classes you have to cast to your object are linked to a common interface and maybe you can use polymorphism.</p>

<p>The problem, as pointed out in <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/187010">this answer</a> isn't the length of the switch/case but the number of times you have the switch. If the statement is repeated so many times, maybe you have to review the design of your architecture.</p>
