<p>You need to define your static members. They are only declared.</p>

<pre><code>class prueba {
  // as before
};
</code></pre>

<p>and in the <strong>implementation file</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>bool prueba::flag=false;
int prueba::num=0;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you shouldn't put the definitions in a header because you will get a definition of the statics for each translation unit. You need to put them in an implementation file that is then used to make a single object file that clients can build against.</p>

<p>Be careful though, each time you instantiate a new <code>prueba</code> object, you reset the static members in the constructor.</p>
