<p><code>Foreign key</code> is a column or a combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables (TableA &amp; TableB for example).</p>

<p>There's no problem in creating a TableB with a foreign key, as long as TableA, which contains the columns you want to link already exists.</p>

<p>As in the example below, you can create the FK, as long as the column P_Id exists in table Persons.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE Orders
(
O_Id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
OrderNo int NOT NULL,
P_Id int FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Persons(P_Id) 
)
</code></pre>
