<p><code>&amp;</code> takes the address of (you're comparing pointers), when really you want to dereference using <code>*</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (*cit1 == *cit2)
    cout&lt;&lt; "They are the same \n";
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, there is <em>absolutely no</em> point to using pointers here, let alone dumb ones.</p>

<p>Here's how it would look without them (the proper way):</p>

<pre><code>CCity cit1("bob", 1, 1);
CCity cit2("bob", 2, 2);
cout&lt;&lt; "Comparing 2 cities:\n";
if (cit1 == cit2)
    cout&lt;&lt; "They are the same \n";
else
    cout &lt;&lt; "They are different \n";
</code></pre>

<p>Also, as WhozCraig mentions, consider using const-ref parameters for your <code>operator==</code> function since it shouldn't modify the arguments.</p>
