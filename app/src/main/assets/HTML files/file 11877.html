<p>I'd suggest creating a mutable dictionary with each iteration of the loop and, after adding all the numbers to that, put it into the "master" array:</p>

<pre><code>while (remainder !=0) {

    // Each time through the loop, a new dictionary is created and put
    // into iterationDict; you can then add objects to it.
    NSMutableDictionary * iterationDict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];

    // ...

    q=[NSNumber numberWithInt:quotient];
    end=[NSNumber numberWithInt: dividend];
    or=[NSNumber numberWithInt: divisor];

    [iterationDict setObject:q forKey:@"quotient"];
    [iterationDict setObject:end forKey:@"dividend"];
    [iterationDict setObject:or forKey:@"divisor"];

    // etc.
    [numberSaver addObject:iterationDict];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Storing these things in a dictionary rather than an array means that you don't have to remember the <em>order</em> in which you added them (<code>divisor</code> before <code>dividend</code>, e..g). Instead, you access them by the key. Later, you can get the values for any given iteration out of the array:</p>

<pre><code>NSUInteger iteration = 3;
NSNumber * quotient = [[numberSaver objectAtIndex:iteration] objectForKey:@"quotient"];
</code></pre>

<p>Please comment if any of this needs explication.</p>
