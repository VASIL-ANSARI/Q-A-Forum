<p>Your form will only submit the button if it was clicked. You could do something with an array:</p>

<pre><code>$buttons = array("button1id", "button2id");
foreach($buttons as $button){
   if(isset($_POST[$button])) echo $_POST[$button];
}
</code></pre>

<p>or you could do something that requires a little less maintenance over time:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($_POST as $key =&gt; $value){
        //check if the key (button name) has the word button in it. If so, echo the value
        if(strstr($key, 'button') !== false) echo $value;
}
</code></pre>
