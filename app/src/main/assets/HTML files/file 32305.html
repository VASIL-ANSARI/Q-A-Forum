<p>I've tried it around 15 times, the map loads each time.</p>

<p>But it takes some time, the map will be loaded onload(when all ressources are loaded), what is for me after 20-25 sec</p>

<p>First you should optimize the page to speed up the loading-time, e.g. there are multiple images with a size >1MB, up to 2.8MB ! , I would say it's a no-go for a webpage. Saving these images scaled to the needed size and compressed should decrease the size to 10% of the original</p>

<p><strong>The complete size of the loaded data for this page is around 20MB</strong>.</p>

<p>Furthermore you don't need to wait for the <code>load</code>-event, call <code>initialize</code> immediately .  The maps usually will be loaded <code>onload</code> to ensure that the map-container is already known, but in your page the container is already known, because the script that initializes the map is placed after the map-container. </p>
