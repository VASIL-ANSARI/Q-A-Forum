<p>It actually doesn't automatically press the button, that isn't what's submitting the form. The form is being submitted because that's a default characteristic of text boxes - if you have focus in the text box, pressing the enter key will cause an attempt to submit the form.
This article goes into a deeper explanation: <a href="https://www.tjvantoll.com/2013/01/01/enter-should-submit-forms-stop-messing-with-that/" rel="nofollow">https://www.tjvantoll.com/2013/01/01/enter-should-submit-forms-stop-messing-with-that/</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Actually, more specifically, a form will only submit on the enter key if:
1)A submit button exists in the form, or
2)The form only contains one text input</p>

<p>If neither of these conditions is true, then the enter key should not submit the form</p>
