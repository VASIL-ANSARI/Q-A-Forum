<p>To answer your first question: Follow the <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html#linux-installation" rel="nofollow">Installation in Linux</a> instructions on the OpenCV page. I setup OpenCV on Ubuntu 12.04 and later on 14.04 following these instructions and it helped me perfectly.</p>

<p>To your second question: I don't know javacv, but if it says it's deprecated, you probably shouldn't use it ;) OpenCV supports Java bindings since version 2.4.4, so you won't need javacv. I think you can do everything with Java-OpenCV you need. For information about Java development with OpenCV, see <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/desktop_java/java_dev_intro.html#java-dev-intro" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Java Development</a>. As far as I remember, Java bindings are created by default when building.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>
