<p>Not for now, unfortunately. But a feature proposal that would address exactly this kind of use-case (and others, especially regarding asynchronous callback code and Callback Hell in general) <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/2662" rel="nofollow">is being actively discussed in the CoffeeScript Issues</a>. The proposed feature is called "backcalls" and it's basically a syntactic transformation to get this kind of callback nested code to look more sequential. Your module definition would look like:</p>

<pre><code>(dep1, dep2) &lt;- define 'myModule', ['dep1', 'dep2']

funcA: -&gt;
funcB: -&gt;
# etc...
funcZ: -&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you want something working <em>right now</em>, one thing you can do is to add a preprocessor step to your build configuration so that the <code>define ...</code> line and the indentation gets added before getting into the CoffeeScript compiler. </p>

<p>You could declare your modules with some special comments on the .coffee source:</p>

<pre><code>#!module=myModule
#!dependencies=dep1,dep2

funcA: -&gt;
funcB: -&gt;
# etc...
funcZ: -&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then have a script that would read those comments and generate the <code>define 'myModule', ['dep1', 'dep2'], (dep1, dep2) -&gt;</code> line and add one level of indentation to every line in the input file.</p>

<p>So your build steps would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>cat myModule.coffee | add-amd | coffee -sc &gt; myModule.js
</code></pre>
