<p>You may need an upgrade step for existing objects. See for example eea.soercontent <a href="https://github.com/eea/eea.soercontent/blob/master/eea/soercontent/upgrades/evolve19.py" rel="nofollow">evolve19.py</a>  and <a href="https://github.com/eea/eea.soercontent/blob/master/eea/soercontent/upgrades/configure.zcml#L88" rel="nofollow">configure.zcml</a> </p>

<p>To test if this is the case, before writing the upgrade step, go to <strong>Edit</strong> and <strong>Save</strong> without changing anything. Now if you go to Edit again, you should have your Rich Text Editor in place.</p>
