<p>Are they the same repositories?</p>

<p>A couple things to keep in mind in regards to browsers:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you are using any kind of repository viewer like ViewVC etc. the URL in your browser is not the same one a SVN client uses.</li>
<li>Watch out for Proxy servers.  Browsers are often auto-configured for proxies. Your SVN client will not be.  You have to configure the SVN client to use a proxy if one is required.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other than those suggestions it is hard to provide much more of an answer based on the information that was given.</p>
