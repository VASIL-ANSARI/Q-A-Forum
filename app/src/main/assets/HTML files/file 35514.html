<p><code>ASCII.GetBytes</code> conversion replaces <em>all</em> characters outside of ASCII range (0-127) with question mark (code 63). </p>

<p>So since your string contains characters outside of that range your <code>asciiValue</code> have <code>?</code> instead of all interesting symbols like <code>â¢</code> - its <code>Char</code> (Unicode) repesentation is 8482 which is indeed outside of 0-127 range.</p>

<p>Converting string to char array does not modify values of characters and you still have original Unicode codes (<code>char</code> is essentially <code>Int16</code>) - casting it to longer integer type <code>Int32</code> does not change the value.</p>

<p>Below are possible conversion of that character into byte/integers:</p>

<pre><code>var value = "â¢";
var ascii = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(value)[0]; // 63(`?`) - outside 0-127 range
var castToByte = (byte)(value[0]); // 34 = 8482 % 256
var Int16 = (Int16)value[0]; // 8482 
var Int32 = (Int16)value[0]; // 8482 
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>ASCIIEncoding corresponds to the Windows code page 20127. Because ASCII is a 7-bit encoding, ASCII characters are limited to the lowest 128 Unicode characters, from U+0000 to U+007F. If you use the default encoder returned by the Encoding.ASCII property or the ASCIIEncoding constructor, characters outside that range are replaced with a question mark (?) before the encoding operation is performed. </p>
