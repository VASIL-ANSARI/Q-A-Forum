<p>You can use a component? Which basically is a slot with some sort of action attached to it. In your action you can do whatever your logic needs and render it in the same way as above, but with more logic.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_2/07-inside-the-view-layer" rel="nofollow">manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A component is like an action, except
  it's much faster. The logic of a
  component is kept in a class
  inheriting from sfComponents, located
  in an actions/components.class.php
  file. Its presentation is kept in a
  partial. Methods of the sfComponents
  class start with the word execute,
  just like actions, and they can pass
  variables to their presentation
  counterpart in the same way that
  actions can pass variables.</p>
