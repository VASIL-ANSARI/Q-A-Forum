<p>The easiest way to solve this is with a subquery:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [MyCol1], [MyCol1]+49 AS [MyCol2], COUNT(*) AS [Anzahl],
       CAST(AVG(col3) AS decimal(3,2)) AS [MyCol3]
FROM (select t.*, CAST(FLOOR(ISNULL(col1,col2)/50) * 50 AS INT) as [MyCol1]
      from T
     ) t
WHERE Time BETWEEN @start AND @final
GROUP BY [MyCol1]
ORDER BY 1
</code></pre>

<p>It also makes the query more understandable.</p>
