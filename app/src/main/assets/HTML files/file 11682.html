<p>If you need the collection every time the entity is used, then the best approach is by configuration. By default collections are lazy-loaded. You can configure them to be eagerly-loaded (in other words: pre-loaded). Every time you ask for the entity you will always get the collection.</p>

<p>However, if you only need the collection some of the time (the scenario that lazy-loading is intended to address), you have a couple of options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider separating the collection(s) from the entity entirely. For
example, instead of having a User with an Addresses collection,
separate them out so that once you have your User, you then call
getAddressesForUser(User) separately.</li>
<li>Or write additional methods on the server-side that specifically invoke
the collections on each entity so that they get pre-loaded before
returning to the client. All you have to do is invoke the size()
method on the collection. This is definitely not elegant, but works
if you can't separate the collections from the entity for whatever
reason.</li>
</ul>
