<p>You can do either: the key part is that the environmental variable must be present for the SDK to pick up in the code that you're running. You could set it programmatically in Python (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5971312/how-to-set-environment-variables-in-python">example</a>) or in your terminal (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234742/setting-environment-variables-in-linux-using-bash">example</a>), depending on what you want to do. You just need the process that's executing your code to have the variable set in <em>its</em> environment.</p>

<p>Use an absolute path.</p>
