<p>For a pure Python solution, I think you could reuse something I developed for the same problem, but for the client point of view: avoiding to issue more than 'x tries per sec' to a service provider.</p>

<p>The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/icecrime/RateLimiting" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>: you can probably reuse most of it, but you'll need to replace the <code>time.sleep</code> call for your 'blacklisting' mechanism.</p>
