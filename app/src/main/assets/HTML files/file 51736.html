<p>You can use the <code>T</code> <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html#expressions-types" rel="nofollow">Type Operator</a> to call static methods on a class. So you can just call <code>String.format()</code> as you usually would. eg.</p>

<pre><code>${T(java.lang.String).format('0x%06X', intColor)}
</code></pre>

<p>The only slight limitation here is you can't perform the bitwise and from within Thymeleaf. You'll either need to do this before you add it to the model, or maybe look at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#toHexString-int-" rel="nofollow">Integer.toHexString()</a> which will allow you to format your number as if it were unsigned:</p>

<pre><code>'0x'+${T(java.lang.Integer).toHexString(intColor).toUpperCase()}
</code></pre>

<p>This second approach requires some additional work to get the leading <code>0x</code> and to uppercase the characters.</p>
