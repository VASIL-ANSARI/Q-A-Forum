<p>To answer your immediate question, you must put the character % at the beginning and end of the match string:</p>

<pre><code> "AND tags NOT LIKE '%$instag%'"
</code></pre>

<p>However, you should be aware that this is a <em>terrible</em> way to store data in an SQL database.  There are at least three problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have tags that embed other tags ("cat" and "scat" for instance) you will find the wrong records unless you write very complicated comma-based searches.</li>
<li>These searches can never be indexed and will therefore become very slow as the number of records grows.</li>
<li>You cannot verify the tags used against a list of allowed tags, guarantee that only allowed tags are in the database, or easily present a list of existing or allowed tags.</li>
</ol>

<p>The correct solution is to add at least one table to your database, called something like gals_tags, with columns galid and tag.  Insert <em>one record</em> per tag into this table.  If a gal has more than one tag, add one record for each tag.</p>
