<p>The object will accept style attributes to demostrate that try:</p>

<pre><code>object {visibility: visible;}
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>object {visibility: hidden;}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is the .swf being displayed inside the object does not use external CSS. You only have access to style the object which contains the .swf flash handles the rendering for the actual button. While uploadify can accept many parameters from the uploadify method, such as buttonImg, width, and height there is no parameter for a cursor argument. The only other option you have is to modify the uploadify.fla to handle the cursor and publish a new uploadify.swf.</p>

<p>If you have Flash find the line in the ActionScript that has:</p>

<pre><code>browseBtn.useHandCursor = true;
</code></pre>

<p>Change that line to this:</p>

<pre><code>browseBtn.useHandCursor = false;
</code></pre>

<p>This is change it from CSS cursor ~ 'pointer' to 'arrow'</p>

<p>*Flash does not have a MouseCursor of 'crosshair' only ARROW, AUTO, BUTTON, HAND, and IBEAM, but you can craft your own</p>
