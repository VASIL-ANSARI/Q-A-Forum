<p>Pass them as a List or array. With these, you can get the number of items and do whatever processing you need to do. </p>

<pre><code>Public Function DoSomething(names As IEnumerable(Of String)) As String
    'Include this if there is a possibility of an names containing nothing
    If names.Count = 0 Then
        Return ""
    End If

    Dim csvString As String = names(0)

    'First one is already added, loop through remaining
    For i As Integer = 1 To (names.Count - 1)
        csvString = csvString + ", " + names(i)
    Next

    Return csvString
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>You would preferably use IEnumerable which can take arrays or list among other things. You could use IList(Of String) or String() if you wanted though.</p>
