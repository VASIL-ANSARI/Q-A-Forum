<p>"armv7s" is the instruction set supported by the new ARM processor in the iPhone 5. Xcode 4.5 by default generates binaries for armv7 and armv7s.</p>

<p>The linker error means that your app is compiled for armv7 and armv7s (and i386 for the Simulator), but is linked to the DropboxSDK framework which does not contain armv7s code.</p>

<p>So you have the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download and install the latest DropboxSDK framework. According to the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/static/developers/CHANGELOG-objc.txt">CHANGELOG</a>, iPhone 5 support has been added.</li>
<li>Compile your app for "armv7" only. This is configured in the "Architectures" of the "Build Settings" of your target.</li>
</ul>

<p>You said that "No lib that refers to Dropbox". But there must be some reference to that library, otherwise the linker would not complain. You can check that in the "Link Binary with Libraries" section of the "Build Phases" tab of your target settings.</p>
