<p>You are using WordPress filter add_filter('less_vars', 'my_less_vars', 10, 2); to add your less variables.</p>

<p>I'm using Netbeans and I'm sure it is the same in PhpStorm. Netbeans compiler can't use WP filters, simple as that. You can't use PhpStorm compiler to compile unless all vars are in written in the less files.</p>

<p>One solution is to compile file using WP-LESS only when you have some changes in less files or variables (which will be changed after you change some theme option related to it).</p>

<p>Hope this helps :)</p>
