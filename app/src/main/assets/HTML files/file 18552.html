<p>Of course, you can add an attached behavior using either an attached dependency property or a <a href="http://winrtbehaviors.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow">Behavior</a> that you could bind a string to that will navigate to that string when the value changes (e.g. when it is first assigned).</p>

<p>The other problem could be though with how it performs. I would think of the WebView control as a browser window, so if you have a hundred items in your ListView you might not want to create a hundred IE windows for all of them. Even assuming you use the default VirtualizingStackPanel as the ItemsPanel of your ListView - this sounds like a source of many issues. I haven't tried that, so I might be wrong, but I would rather try parsing the html and formatting it for use in regular TextBlocks. For very basic html you could use the LinkedHtmlFragment extension of the WinRT XAML Toolkit with a RichTextBlock if all you have is plain text and links. For something more fancy you might need to do some coding yourself or use something like the <a href="http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">HTML Agility Pack</a> (though I am not sure if it supports WinRT yet).</p>
