<p>Did you try starting a new project with only this part of your example code? Doesn't it append new lines for you?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockquote</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>ofstream ofs;
ofs.open("somename.txt", ofstream::out | ofstream::app);
ofs &lt;&lt; "write params";
ofs &lt;&lt; "write results in same line";
ofs &lt;&lt; endl;
ofs.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Try to use ofstream::app only, it will automatically create new file for you. Frankly, I don't see any problem with the above code.</p>

<p>(Sorry I never made an answer. It looks lame :( )</p>
