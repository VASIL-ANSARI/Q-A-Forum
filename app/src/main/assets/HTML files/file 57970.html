<p>Sorry I'm so late to the party on this, but what IP or hostname are you binding?  I've found that with Mono it requires the HOST header in the HTTP header match with the hostname prefix that is aded, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>HttpListener http = new HttpListener();
http.Prefixes.Add("http://hostname.com:80/");
http.Start();
</code></pre>

<p>It requires that whatever is in the HTTP request itself (on the wire) have Host: hostname.com present.</p>

<p>While using an IP address, "127.0.0.1", "localhost", "0.0.0.0", "+", and "*" seem to work on Windows, when I deploy on Mono on Ubuntu, I have to specifically add a prefix that uses a hostname or the interface's IP address.  Note that when using an IP address it needs to be the one bound to the interface, not whatever public-facing external IP address it may be mapped to.</p>
