<p>There's a lot of aspects to profiling a site, in terms of database calls, business logic, rendering a view, and even client side performance (any jQuery that might run, for example). </p>

<p><a href="http://miniprofiler.com/" rel="nofollow">StackOverflow's MiniProfiler</a> is one of the easiest things to get going, just install a NuGet package, add some Javascript includes, and wrap whatever you want to test inside a using() block, and you'll see execution times (including LINQ-to-SQL and EF). You can even create steps if you want finer grained timings of individual calls. </p>

<p>The nice thing about MiniProfiler is you can enable/disable based on the environment, which makes it suitable for running inside Azure (as opposed to say, the Visual Studio Profiler). </p>

<p>You can also look at <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/net/common-tasks/performance-profiling/" rel="nofollow">Azure Performance Counters</a>, which will give you an idea of system resources, but isn't profiling in the sense that MiniProfiler is. It will however give you an idea of network latency and CPU and memory utilization. </p>

<p>Once you're satisfied there, you can use <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/12/javascript-profiling-chrome-developer-tools/" rel="nofollow">Chrome's Developer Tools</a> to profile your application on the client side. It'll give you an idea of how well your Javascript is doing, including CSS selectors and rendering. </p>

<p>Also worth noting, Visual Studio has a really good <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2s0xxa1d.aspx" rel="nofollow">Profiler</a> in some higher editions that can give you deep insights into your code. Time spent in methods, call counts, etc. </p>

<p>Between these four methods, you should be able to find most bottlenecks, especially for a first pass. </p>
