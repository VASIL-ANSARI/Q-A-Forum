<p>I imagine you are exhausting all of the available ephemeral TCP/IP ports because of the rapid succession of open/close DB connections.  You should open the connection once and use that connection for each of your inserts.  Steve's suggestion of using pooling should also solve this problem for you because the connections will be transparently shared in a similar fashion.</p>
