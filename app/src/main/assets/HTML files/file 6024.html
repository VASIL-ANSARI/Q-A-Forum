<p>If you get OutOfMemory on server side you have memory growth. I am sorry. :(
I'd suggest you to use one of popular Java profilers to locate the source of you problem. Alternative way is try to simplify the application as much you can. Good luck. I am sure that you can find the problem using profiler very quickly.</p>
