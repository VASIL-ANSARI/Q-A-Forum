<p>I'm not sure about what you exactly want but maybe this code could help you. I add 3 image in consecutive order just like you want, </p>

<pre><code>var myImage = UIImage(named: "image\(i).jpg") 
</code></pre>

<p>with this line, i can access my image without putting in an array. I think you can access in animation as well.</p>

<p>Here's the full code.</p>

<pre><code> override func viewDidLoad() {
                var x = 50
                super.viewDidLoad()
                for(var i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i){
                    var cgfloatx = CGFloat(x)
                    var myImage = UIImage(named: "image\(i).jpg")
                    var myImageView = UIImageView(frame: CGRectMake(100, 100 + cgfloatx, 90, 90))
                    myImageView.image = myImage
                    self.view.addSubview(myImageView)
                    x += 100
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>I hope i understood your problem correct, but next time, try to do something by coding, then ask here what's wrong in my code. I got lots of negative points just like asking question like yours.</p>
