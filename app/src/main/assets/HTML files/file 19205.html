<p>You can have a cron job set up to back up your database and dump it to a directory of your choosing:</p>

<pre><code>mysqldump --all-databases --skip-lock-tables | gzip -9 &gt; /your/backup/dir/here/`date +%Y%m%d`_backup.sql.gz
</code></pre>

<p>What you do from there is up to you, but I agree that you should not email it due to the size.  Perhaps you can use <a href="http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php" rel="nofollow">SCP</a> to send it to a different server.</p>
