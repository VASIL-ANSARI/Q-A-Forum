<p>You can visualize the sequence of calls and returns in a tree like this:</p>

<p>The calls traverse this tree left to right, depth first:</p>

<p>Hopes this helps your intuition a bit. 'Arrow down' is call, 'arrow up' is return. Each function call has it's own lump of data, called a 'stack frame'. That's were' your n is remembered FOR THAT CALL. With each call a new stack frame is created. With each return the stack frame of the function you return from is destroyed. If you're 3 calls deep, you'll have 3 stack frames, containing e.g. n == 3, n == 2, n == 1 respectively.</p>

<p>At the deepest point, look at the green arrows:</p>

<p>Have added green arrows to illustrate the point where the first recursion terminates and the second begins. Since traversal is depth first it starts at the lowest point, not at the root / top</p>
