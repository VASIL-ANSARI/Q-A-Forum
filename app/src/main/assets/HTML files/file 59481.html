<p>So I figured out how to resolve my problem. I don't know why it works or what caused the problem, but for now here is the solution</p>

<p>The correct formula for PixelSearch is PixelSearch(left, top, right, bottom). </p>

<p>After playing around with the numbers it appears pyautoit is using (right, top, left, bottom). If I plug in my numbers with that formula it works perfectly, EXCEPT on my third monitor. </p>

<p>My third monitor seems to work with (left, top, right, bottom). I am wondering if it has something to do with negative numbers (-1680, 0, -3, 1050), not 100% sure.</p>

<p>I tested this on my work computer (two monitors), home computer, (three monitors), and my laptop. In all scenarios the (right, top, left, bottom) worked, except home computer on the third monitor.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone else out in the future.</p>
