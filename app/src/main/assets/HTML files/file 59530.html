<p>The doc says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A prepared statement is specific to the session in which it was created. If you terminate a session without deallocating a previously prepared statement, the server deallocates it automatically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Prepared Statements get deleted automtically after the session ends. Besides, a Prepared Statement does not have a name It is just a query string.</p>
