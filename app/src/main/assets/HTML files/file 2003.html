<p>I assume this is in a directory that is not the root?  The / at the beginning of your URL is going to take the link to the root of the site.  I would assume you need to put some logic at the front of the URL to build it correctly.</p>

<p>So something like this:</p>

<pre><code>string goBackLinkForErrorMessage = "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=" + Request.ApplicationPath.TrimEnd('/') + "'/MyController/Action?id=" + blah + "'&gt;Go Back&lt;/a&gt;";
</code></pre>

<p>You will want to keep the TrimEnd on the end of that Application Path for cases when it is the root.</p>

<p>A lot of this was made on assumptions because "it doesn't work" isn't real clear.</p>
