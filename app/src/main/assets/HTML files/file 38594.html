<p>The <code>mail()</code> function returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on whether the mail was sent or not (which does not mean it will reach the inbox because it might be considered spam). More information here: <a href="http://php.net/manual/de/function.mail.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/de/function.mail.php</a></p>

<p>I recommend you apply the suggestion from Fred to see if your message was accepted by your email provider. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>if(mail(....)) {
    echo 'ok';
} else {
    echo 'error';
}
exit();
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>error</code> appears on the page, it means your email was rejected. There is not much you can do with your current script to change that. Below are some suggestions.</p>

<p>You seem to be using Google Apps. Google has an aggressive spam fighting policy. Your email will probably never reach your inbox with such a simplistic script. If you care about deliverability, you may want to look into <a href="http://swiftmailer.org/" rel="nofollow">Swiftmailer</a> or services such as <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/" rel="nofollow">Postmark</a> or <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" rel="nofollow">Sendgrid</a>.</p>
