<p>You can test incoming SMS messages using <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/ddms.html" rel="nofollow">DDMS</a>.</p>

<p>From the doc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spoofing calls or SMS text messages</p>
  
  <p>The Telephony Actions section of the Emulator controls tab lets you
  spoof calls and messages. This is useful when you want to to test your
  application's robustness in responding to incoming calls and messages
  that are sent to the phone. The following actions are available to
  you:</p>
  
  <p>Voice - Enter a number in the Incoming number field and click Call to
  send a simulated call to the emulator or phone. Click the Hang up
  button to terminate the call. </p>
  
  <p>SMS - Enter a number in the Incoming
  number field and a message in the Message: field and click the Send
  button to send the message.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're using Eclipse, you will find "Emulator Control" view, which you can use to send this fake SMS. In command line, use <code>ddms</code> executable which is in <code>$ANDROID_SDK/tools/</code>.</p>
