<p>First off, why are you using reflection?! That's a red flag to me. The APIs allow you to talk to another device via bluetooth, see <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice.html#createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord%28java.util.UUID%29" rel="nofollow">this link</a> so you should not use reflection.</p>

<p>A socket will always return not connected before its <code>connect</code> method is called. It seems that your code obtains the socket but never tries to make a connection with it. You first need to call <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothSocket.html#connect%28%29" rel="nofollow">this method</a>.</p>
