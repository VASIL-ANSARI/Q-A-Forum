<p>^ is start of line
$ is end of line </p>

<p>You likely want words... not whole lines... so</p>

<pre><code>\&lt; = start of word 
\&gt; = end of word
\b is word boundry...
</code></pre>

<p>\&lt; and > aren't supported in many languages... </p>

<p>so </p>

<pre><code>\b(\d{1,4})\b
</code></pre>

<p>however that will match 22.33 as two separate matches.</p>

<p>You could avoid that by doing something like this.</p>

<pre><code>(?:^|\s)(\d{1,4})(?:\s|$)
</code></pre>

<p>However that would miss</p>

<pre><code>super duper 3333,and 
</code></pre>

<p>So you would have to add "," or other puntuation to the list of trailing characters...</p>

<pre><code>(?:^|\s)(\d{1,4})(?:\s|$|[,:;?])
</code></pre>

<p>However that brings us back to...</p>

<p>There were people numbering 5.  Today... </p>

<p>The 5 would get missed!  How do you tell the difference between that and "there were 55.55  percent of people"</p>
