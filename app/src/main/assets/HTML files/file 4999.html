<p>The runtime is saying it all: You're trying to call something in <code>NSString</code> that doesn't exist, and I know for sure that <code>[NSCFString setBackgroundImage:forState:]</code> does not exist, hence the error and "possibly" a crash. The compiler should show you a warning in your source code where you're going wrong.</p>
