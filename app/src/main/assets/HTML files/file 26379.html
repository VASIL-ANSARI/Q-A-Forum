<p>You will want to divide this into three tables and handle your problem with a one to many relationship.  You will want a 'rooms' table that simply holds an ID number and some brief information on what that room is (like you have here, a name and ID is fine).  You will want a second table as 'users'...just like rooms, this will hold an ID field for each user and some information on that user as you see fit.  You then have a bookings table that stores something a long the lines of 'room_id, user_id,datetime_booked'.  Each row in the bookings table represents a single booking.  Things like 'duration' (perhaps start_date and end_date to allow flexible booking lengths) or 'number of people' could also be added this if you want the additional functionality.</p>

<p>User information doesn't actually have to be stored as it's own seperate table...'booking' could have the user information in it, but each time that user creates a booking, you'll have their user information restored in the database (redundant lines).  The user table eliminates this data redundancy and replaces it with an ID column.</p>

<p>Hopefully you see how that set up works...Give some research (stack overflow is a great resource) into table normalization and how one to many relations work.</p>
