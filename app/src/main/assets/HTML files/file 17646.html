<p>You actually can do this, at least using private API's.  It's also not a percentage, it's instead stored as a collective "CPU time" which is used to measure power consumption.  I did this a while back with a project I worked on.  Check out <a href="https://code.google.com/p/syspower/" rel="nofollow">this Google Code project</a>.  It requires using private APIs and I make no promises that those APIs still exist, but I did do it at one point.</p>
