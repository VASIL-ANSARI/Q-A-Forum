<p>This is most likely to mean that you forgot to implement one of the virtual functions declared in <code>CProcManager</code> - probably <code>GetMemLimit</code>. Or that you forgot to link with the translation unit containing that implementation.</p>

<p>Explanation: it looks like you're compiling with GCC. That compiler generates the vtable in the same translation unit as the first non-inline, non-pure virtual function declared in the class. If you don't implement that function, the vtable will be missing, giving that error.</p>
