<p>There is no servlet dependency. There is a custom client/protocol dependency that's app server specific. Each server has their own way of setting up the connection, manifested through configuring JNDI for the proper providers and protocol handlers.</p>

<p>Why won't RMI-IIOP work over the internet? The only potential issue I can see there is security, I don't know if there's an encrypted version of RMI-IIOP or not, but other than that, it's a perfectly routable protocol.</p>

<p>You may run in to port and firewall issues, but that's not the protocols fault. If you want to run RMI-IIOP over port 80 (http's port), then that's fine (obviously it won't be http, nor work with http proxies, but again, that's not the protocols issue).</p>

<p>Weblogic also has (had?) their own protocol, T3? I think it was? Can you use that?</p>

<p>I think the key is why you don't think you can run RMI-IIOP "over the internet", and trying to  solve that problem, not necessarily what protocol to use.</p>
