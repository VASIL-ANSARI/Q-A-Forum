<p>You are right to override paintComponent instead of paint.  I think the issue here is that paintComponent should do one thing, paint your component.  Any number of things can cause a call to repaint() which will call your paintComponent, so it's not really guaranteed when and how often this method will execute.  Doing calculations and keeping track of variables should probably be a part of a separate model class that your component can look at to know what to draw.</p>
