<p>You could add an additional line to the end of your .htaccess file on your local WAMP install to automatically redirect images links locally to proper sub-directory of your root localhost website.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^images/(.*)$ /sitename/images/$1 [R=301,NC,L]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>* EDIT *</strong></p>

<p>I found some links for setting up multiple hosts on WAMP server, although not directly related; the process does configure WAMP to properly read URL paths locally for both SEF and file references.</p>
