<p>Your issue is that you are creating a new empty array at each mouse event with the line <code>a = np.zeros(shape=(h,w))</code> in mouseevent. To fix that you should have <code>a</code> declared in the <code>__init__</code> as an attribute (ie <code>self.a = np.zeros(shape=(h,w))</code>) so that you can acces and update it without overwriting it in your <code>mouseevent</code> function.</p>
