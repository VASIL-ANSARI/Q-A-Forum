<p>To tag a post with a location, you don't post to the <code>/feed</code> endpoint, you post to the <code>/checkins</code> endpoint.  You can see some brief documentation regarding it on the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/" rel="nofollow">Graph API Documentation</a> page under the <em>Publishing</em> header, which tells you which arguments you can post (coordinates, place (id), message, and tags (for who's with you).  There's a little more information on the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/checkin/" rel="nofollow">Checkin Documentation</a> page, but not a whole lot about actually posting them.</p>

<p>Hope that helps - and I'm sorry for the mass confusion; I completely whiffed on what you were asking originally :P</p>
