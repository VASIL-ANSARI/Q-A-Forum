<p>This ended up just being an issue with the GPU on the 3rd gen iPad not being up to the task to using <code>SKLightNode</code>s. I've now tested on iOS 8 and iOS 8.1 using the latest version of Xcode at the time (Version 6.1 (6A1052d) for iOS 8.1), with the same results. My test code runs at 60FPS on a iPhone 5s with 8 light sources, so the code itself doesn't seem to be the issue.</p>
