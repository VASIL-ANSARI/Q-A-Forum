<p>According to your comments above the application crashes on <code>Dialog.dismiss()</code>. 
<code>Dialog</code> variable is correctly declared and instatiated? Are you making it null somewhere?
(I suppose <code>Dialog</code> is a variable and not a class, right?)</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>OK, but the problem still remains the same. Have you checked that the <code>mHandler</code> object is properly declared instatiated and it is not <code>null</code>?</p>

<p>You are passing it as a param in the <code>AsyncTask</code>. Can you post the code where you take the <code>mHandler</code> and you store it "somewhere"?</p>

<p>Is the <code>AsyncTask</code> in the same scope of the <code>Handler</code>?</p>
