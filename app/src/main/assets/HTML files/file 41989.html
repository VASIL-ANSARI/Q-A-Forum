<p>You could delete and reinsert it</p>

<pre><code>var newobj = $.extend(chat,object);
delete newobj.msg; // delete the property
newobj["0"] = chat; // add the property
console.log(JSON.stringify(newobj));
</code></pre>

<p>And since you're using Numbers as the property names or identifiers, it would be better suited if it were an <code>Array</code> instead of an <code>Object</code>.</p>
