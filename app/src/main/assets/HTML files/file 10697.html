<p>Real stuff is a bit vague</p>

<p>But if you just want want all elements it's just a it of Xpath.</p>

<p>If you want a tree, then you can't avoid sequence etc.
If you have things like xs:choice in there you have even more issues.</p>

<p>Then there's attributes...</p>

<p>From SimpleContent or ComplexType...</p>

<p>Might be easier to generate a 'blank' xml document from the xsd and then get what you want out of that. That's a fair chunk of code as well though. Might be one lying around you can borrow though.</p>
