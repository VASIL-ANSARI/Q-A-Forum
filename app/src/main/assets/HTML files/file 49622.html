<p>Chrome do not "preload" images which aren't actally showed and, being this a desiderable effect, all modern browser shouldnt't.</p>

<p>To "force" browser in having all image ready in the cache when needed you may follow different approuches:</p>

<p>1) Preload required images with Javascript, you can use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var prld = ["one.gif", "two.gif", "three.jpg", "..."];
var img = [];
for (i = 0; i &lt; prld.length; i++) {
    img[i] = new Image();
    img[i].src = prld[i];
}
</code></pre>

<p>but you might written in different ways, of course, that's just a suggestion.</p>

<p>2) The second metod has a different approach, it is based on the idea that with a classic Javascript preload you have anyway to make as many "calls" as the images actually are. So 10 images with preload produces 20 calls to the server... not really a desiderable thing cause the "delay" of the calls will slowup all the page load...
So we put more than one image into a single files (like a "puzzle") than we put images as a background (of an empty DIV for instance) passing a different positioning of the background trought CSS.
No need to build a unique file for ALL the images, for instance you would decide for building several mosaics of two images just for the preloading purpose; so the :hover will "replace" the background rather than make a substitution.
The technique is described here: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp</a></p>

<p>Each of those metods has its downside, it depends on situation.</p>

<p>All in all, as a general consideretion, i'd avoid "hovering" at all, taking in account that, on mobile experience, is, basically, without meaning... and it would lead to additional efforts to avoid mobile "extraload" useless contens...</p>
