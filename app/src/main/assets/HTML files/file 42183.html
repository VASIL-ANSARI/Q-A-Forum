<p>The problem with centering Google Maps in various browsers is common. There are different coding techniques recommended to implement Maps in order to make it work on all browsers. Here is one solution that might help in your case.</p>

<p>Try instantiating other functions within the ready(function(){}) block instead of calling from a separate function. Here is an example I have used the GoogleMap function to create a map instance and then setting its center coordinates. </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){ 
  var map = new GoogleMap(document.getElementById('map')); 
  var Warrington = new GLatLng(53.401325,-2.661248); 
  map.setCenter(Warrington, 8); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>You can give it a try!!Hope that will help :)</p>
