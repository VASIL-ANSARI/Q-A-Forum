<p>Either one of your workaround you mention will work and I don't think there is anyway to bind to two different object. The reason lies in the way .NET data binding works. It uses the first object to determine the properties and then expects the rest to follow.</p>

<p>Personally, I would create another class that contains User and Message and then "forward call" when needed. Obviously, when you create this class, you make sure to put the User and Message with the matching ID together.</p>

<p>for instance,</p>

<pre><code>class Chat
    {
        private User user;

        private Message message;

        public string UserName
        {
            get
            {
                return user.Username;
            }
        }

        public string MessageText
        {
            get
            {
                return message.MessageText;
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
