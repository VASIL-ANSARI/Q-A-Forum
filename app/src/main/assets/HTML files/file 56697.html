<p>There would be a <code>$rootScope</code>,
then there would be Controller <code>scope</code>, from <code>ExampleController</code>,</p>

<p>then, since <code>ng-repeat</code> creates a new <code>scope</code> for every row, so outer <code>ng-repeat</code> would create <code>list.length</code> scopes, <code>ng-init</code> would not create a new scope, 
Now the internal <code>ng-repeat</code> runs once for each outer <code>ng-repeat</code>, so it would create <code>innerList.length</code> scopes for each list item. </p>

<p>so, total scopes would be : <code>$rootScope</code> + <code>$scope</code> from Controller + <code>list.length</code> * <code>innerList.length</code>.</p>

<p>So total in this case 1 + 1 + 2 * 2 = 6.</p>

<p>(I am not sure why this information is required, but here it is).</p>

<p>P.S: you can check the documentation to know which <code>directive</code>s create a new(isolated) <code>scope</code>.
Also note that, if the innerList has variable length for each list item, then the formula would include summation of innerList lengths over outerlist length and not a direct multiplication, </p>

<p>i.e, ( 1 * i1 + 1 * i2 + ... outerlist.length times ), where i1,i2 are inner list lengths</p>
