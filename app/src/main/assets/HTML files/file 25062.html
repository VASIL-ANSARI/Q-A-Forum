<p>First of all, as @VJD commented, you have a syntax error - unneeded <code>;</code> at:</p>

<pre><code>if(f.listofinteger.get(1) instanceof Integer);
</code></pre>

<p>About your question, generics are <strong>compile time</strong> tool to check for type safety. In runtime there's no validation, as of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/339699/java-generics-type-erasure-when-and-what-happens">type erasure</a>. That's why you get no error adding <code>String</code> to list of <code>Integers</code>..</p>
