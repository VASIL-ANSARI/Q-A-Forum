<p>You're probably making too many requests, triggering the hourly request limit of 150 - which becomes 75 with your code.</p>

<p>I'd recommend using</p>

<pre><code>if (($xml = simplexml_load_file('...')) !== FALSE) {
</code></pre>

<p>instead. Your <code>$xml = ...</code> line is then not required anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>

<p>The 400 error isn't always actually used for bad requests at Twitter. Since it works 20% of the time I'd say it's safe to say there's something else.</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid XML unless your programming language doesn't accept JSON (PHP does so use JSON!)</li>
<li>Avoid using non-recommended URLs. Use <code>https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.xml?count=6&amp;screen_name=quitecheesedoff</code> instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past the 400 error was also given when Twitter's internal proxies made mistakes.</p>
