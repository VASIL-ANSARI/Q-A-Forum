<p>The only explanations I can think of for that taking 6 minutes to read a 2000 line file are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are using an unbuffered reader.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual lines are very long.</p></li>
<li><p>Both of the above.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, a good way to identify performance bottlenecks is to use a profiler.</p>

<hr>

<p>If (hypothetically) the problems are caused by one of the above, you can improve read times by (respectively):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>wrapping the <code>Reader</code> with a <code>BufferedReader</code>, </p></li>
<li><p>using a <code>Scanner</code> to read directly from the reader rather than reading a whole line and splitting, and</p></li>
<li><p>avoid holding the entire file content in memory.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm inclined to the opinion that 2. won't make a lot of difference, and 3. won't either unless the file is VERY big.</p>
