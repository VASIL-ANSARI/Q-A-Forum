<p>You probably have solved this already, but just in case someone else needs it.</p>

<p>As described at Cloud Logging Doc in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/logging" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/articles/logging</a></p>

<pre><code>"Cloud Logging and Managed VMs apps
Applications using App Engine Managed VMs should write custom log files to the VM's log directory at /var/log/app_engine/custom_logs. 
These files are automatically collected and made available in the Logs Viewer. 
Custom log files must have the suffix .log or .log.json. If the suffix is .log.json, the logs must be in JSON format with one JSON object per line. 
If the suffix is .log, log entries are treated as plain text."
</code></pre>

<p>You have to output the log file to the folder /var/log/app_engine/</p>

<p>It worked for me only when the output file was named /var/log/app_engine/app.log. I didn't work when I tried with .json extension, I believe it's a bug since the Cloud Logging service is still in Beta.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
