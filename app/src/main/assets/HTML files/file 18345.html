<p>"many projects per repo" is called <strong><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules" rel="nofollow">submodules</a></strong> in git world.<br>
Limiting each repo to one project is better (and more compatible with other frameworks expectations, like Jenkins), but a git repo can reference many other repos through submodules.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Working_Directory" rel="nofollow">working directory</a> is by default x, but could be any other path if you want to separate the actualt repo <code>x/.git</code> from the working directory (you could want to be elsewhere)</p>
