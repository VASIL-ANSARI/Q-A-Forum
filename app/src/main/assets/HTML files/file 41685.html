<p>You can try:</p>

<pre><code>var membership = db.Memberships.Where(m =&gt; SqlFunctions.DateDiff(m.ExpiryDate, /*[other parameters]*/))
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you don't use methods in other parameters. If you need DateTime.Today.AddDays(30) declare it as a variable before using it in linq to entities.</p>

<p>However, based on your questions I don't think you really need the DateDiff function. You need only to compare the ExpiryDate with targetDate = DateTime.Today.AddDays(30) in your linq to entities query.</p>
