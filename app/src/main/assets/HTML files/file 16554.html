<p>Yes, you can.  As far as I know it can be a single statement only (semicolons between [] produce error).  For more complicated code, you can enclose it in a function:</p>

<pre><code>template_templates : [
    function() {
        //jQuery code here
    }
]
</code></pre>

<p>Or, depending on what you want to achieve, you can put there a variable, and its value can be computed outside of this object.</p>
