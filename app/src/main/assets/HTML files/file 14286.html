<p>I think you are just deleting the row from database... but you should also refresh the view so that the change you made in the database will show the effect... like.. if you are using a listview to display... then call </p>

<pre><code>adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
</code></pre>

<p>after this method</p>

<pre><code> xmlc.delete(num);
</code></pre>

<p>which makes the listview with fresh data...</p>
