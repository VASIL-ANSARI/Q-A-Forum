<p>I'm assuming that this code block is inside of an angular service, controller, or directive.  If it is not then there is a much broader issue at hand.  Angularjs comes with an <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.%24http" rel="nofollow">$http</a> service that should be used in place of $.ajax here.  $http provides all the same capabilities as $.ajax with the added bonus that it is testable and it integrates with the angularjs digest cycle so you don't need to worry about the $scope.$apply() stuff.  I would do something like the following instead:</p>

<pre><code>MyClass.prototype.doSomething = function () {
  var self = this;
  $http.get( turl ).success( function (data) {
    self.property = data.stuff;
    self.analyzeContent();
  } );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing to remember here is that javascript uses function scope, not block scope.  As long as an object exists in the same function it is considered "in scope."  Since the value of <code>this</code> varies depending on the context you can just stick it in a variable (self) and be confident that the value is what you expect it to be.</p>
