<p>I had a similar exception when my executable project was set to Any CPU and had a reference to a dll compiled with x86.</p>

<p>Try setting your executable to x86 and see if it works. If it doesn't try <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e74a18c4%28VS.71%29.aspx">fusion log</a> to get more detail about the error.</p>
