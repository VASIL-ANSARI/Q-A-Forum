<p>Well, <code>tan(pi/2)</code> in radians is essentially infinite, isn't it? So you'd expect to get a very large number, wouldn't you? (It's not infinity because pi/2  can't be exactly represented as a <code>double</code>. You're finding a value on an asymptotic curve very <em>close</em> to where it would become infinite.)</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/maths/algebra/furthergraphhirev5.shtml">these graphs of sin/cos/tan</a> to see what I mean, remembering that pi/2 radians is 90 degrees.</p>
