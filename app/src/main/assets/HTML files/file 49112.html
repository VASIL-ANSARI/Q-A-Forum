<p>Services are killed when the user swipes the app from recents.  But if <code>onStartCommand(...)</code> returned <code>START_STICKY</code>, they will be restarted a few seconds later.  I consider it a bug that they are killed and restarted; they should either not be killed, or killed and not restarted.  I'm not sure if Google agrees.</p>

<p>Before the service is killed, it will get a call to <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html#onTaskRemoved%28android.content.Intent%29" rel="nofollow">onTaskRemoved(...)</a>.</p>
