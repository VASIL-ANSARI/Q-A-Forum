<p>Hope this logic to remove duplicates from an array might help. I'm not saying to copy this and paste this. I just want to share the logic, and the rest I think you can figure it out.</p>

<pre><code>var items = ["milk","bottle","mobile","cups","milk","screen","table", "toothpaste"];
var filteredItems= [];
$.each(items, function(i, element){
    if($.inArray(element, filteredItems) === -1) filteredItems.push(element);
});
</code></pre>

<p>The array :<code>filteredItems</code> will contain uniquevalues without sorting the original array..<br>
Hope that serves you.</p>
