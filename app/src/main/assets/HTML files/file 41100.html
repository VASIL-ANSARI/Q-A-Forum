<p>I call you to look at the following link. It may help:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/396856/how-to-instantiate-a-class-in-python">How to instantiate a class in python</a></p>

<p>However you are nearly there. The code would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>exampinstance= exampleclass()
exampinstance.func1(1)
</code></pre>

<p>Note the () at the end of the first line. You need to instantiate the class properly. Note how the class is instantiated in the Main Method of the file itself. </p>
