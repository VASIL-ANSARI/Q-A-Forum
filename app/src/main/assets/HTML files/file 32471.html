<p>Spring Actuator auto configures Spring Security, however when I added the configuration noted above it added it didn't remove the config that Spring Actuator had added.</p>

<p>The solution: disable the Spring Actuator added security by adding the following to your application property file: <code>security.basic.enabled=false</code></p>
