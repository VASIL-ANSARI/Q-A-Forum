<p>You can't check if there is a JavaScript error on the page.</p>

<p>What you can do is on "trappable" errors, you can insert text into a hidden field and read that in your c# code.</p>

<p>But if there is an error in code then I don't think you'll be able to check that in c#.</p>

<p>Actually, you could have a hidden field on the page that already has text in it.  Then use JavaScript to clear out the field.</p>

<p>In c# code, if you can see an entry in the field, then there was an error in the JavaScript and if it's empty then the JavaScript ran ok and there was no error.</p>
