<p>The idea of the <code>UIInterpolatingMotionEffect</code> is to take care for itself - you just provide the minimum and maximum values and it reads the axis values and translates the tilt value (in the range of -1 to 1) to a value relative to you minimum and maximum ones. It is not intended for directly providing you the tilt value.</p>

<p>A possible "hack", which I do not recommend is to create a transparent view, with min value of -1 and max value of 1. This way you can read the tilt value from this view.</p>

<p>EDIT:
You can check this answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21740713/use-uimotioneffect-with-opengl-es">Use UIMotionEffect with OpenGL ES</a>
which explains a similar approach.</p>
