<p>While it is somewhat puzzling that you want to display a JOptionPane from a console program without further gui, the code seems to work fine.</p>

<p>I pasted it into my IDE, let it run and it correctly showed the option panes on corresponding input. I tried running it from a command prompt and the result was the same - the code runs fine without the problems you describe.</p>

<p>I suggest trying to run it from a command prompt yourself.</p>
