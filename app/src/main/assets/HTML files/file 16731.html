<p>I know it's a very old question, but I had the same sort of problem recently.<br>
I believe you can delete all of the jaxws jars from <code>$JBOSS_HOME/lib/endorsed</code> and put there the newest jars taken from <strong>JAXWS-RI</strong> (e.g. from this <a href="http://jax-ws.java.net/2.2.6/JAXWS2.2.6-20120220.zip" rel="nofollow">archive</a>). Even if this is not a direct answer to your question, it should be a decent work around.</p>
