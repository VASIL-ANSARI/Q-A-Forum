<p>Firstly, I wonder why do you choose to use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and attach a background image to it?<br>
Secondly, each image src will be an http request (in css and in html tag), so using a sprite is surely a good idea when you choose to display the image as background image.<br>
You might consider loading a 1px by 1px transparent gif to the src of the img tags to minimize the http load. (you can stretch it to the desired width and height)</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
