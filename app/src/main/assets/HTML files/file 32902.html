<p>From your <em>updated</em> question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need to create an array which will return $r and $c.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you mean an array with two entries in it (the value of <code>$r</code> and the value of <code>$c</code>), then yes, that works, although usually this is clearer:</p>

<pre><code>var moveArray = [$r, $c];
</code></pre>

<p>From your <em>original</em> question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need to create two dimensional array having $r and $c which is for row and column.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that code creates a one-dimensional array with two entries.</p>

<p>JavaScript doesn't have two-dimensional arrays at all, it has arrays of arrays. To create them, you have to write a loop:</p>

<pre><code>function checkfutureMove($r,$c,$player1,$board) {
    // Create the return array
    var moveArray = [];
    var n;

    // Loop through adding entries to it
    for (n = 0; n &lt; $r; ++n) {
        // Each entry is an array
        moveArray[n] = [];

        // This sets the length of the array (which still has no entries),
        // which you may or may not want to do.
        moveArray[n].length = $c;
    }

    // Return the result (or do something else with it)
    return moveArray;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My comment above about <code>length</code> is because standard arrays in JavaScript are inherently <em>sparse</em> (their length may be greater than the number of entries they actually contain). In fact, standard arrays in JavaScrript <a href="http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2011/01/myth-of-arrays.html" rel="nofollow">aren't really arrays at all</a>, they're just objects with a special class of properties.</p>
