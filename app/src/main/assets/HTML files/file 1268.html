<p><a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/index.html" rel="nofollow">log4net</a> is quite a beautiful and standard system to use. Well worth learning, and you can log to a variety of formats (or custom). (Edit: However, as far as I know, it's not supported on Silverlight yet, if that interests you, so you may need to implement your own system there).</p>
