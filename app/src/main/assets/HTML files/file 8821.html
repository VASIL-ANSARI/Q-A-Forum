<p>I suspect that there is a difference in the classpath when the app is run from NetBeans, and when it is run from the command line.<br>
There must be some kind of exception that is being thrown, have you got an outermost<br>
<code>catch (Exception )</code> block in the main method?</p>

<p>You could try to debug the application using "remote debugging", although you won't be debugging over a network, you can still use this method to catch the breakpoint started at the command line in NetBeans.<br>
Here's an article that explains how to do remote debugging with NetBeans <a href="http://manikandanmv.wordpress.com/2009/09/24/debugging-java-applications-with-netbeans/" rel="nofollow">http://manikandanmv.wordpress.com/2009/09/24/debugging-java-applications-with-netbeans/</a></p>
