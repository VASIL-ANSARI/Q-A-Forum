<p>It depends on your <code>Transactional</code> settings.</p>

<p>Spring-transactions in local mode, work on a thread-local connection for all the db activities within single transaction.</p>

<p>If you have not configured transactions, then basically each DB call will retrieve connection from datasource using <code>Datasource.getConnection()</code> </p>

<p>In terms client connecting to DB, if you are using datasource with connection pooling capability, then connections are returned from the pool.</p>

<p>But if datasource is not backed by pool, then it will instantiate connection to DB server on demand ( on getConnection() ) call</p>
