<p>It is giving you the log correctly. When ever you try to print the <code>ManagedObject</code> you'll only see a <code>fault</code> in logs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A fault is a placeholder object that represents a managed object that has not yet been fully realized, or a collection object that represents a relationship:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>A managed object fault is an instance of the appropriate class, but its persistent variables are not yet initialized.</p></li>
  <li><p>A relationship fault is a subclass of the collection class that represents the relationship.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in short, unless you try to access those properties, CoreData wont fill property values. It will have a <code>fault</code>. Just trying to log the <code>ManagedObject</code>, without accessing its properties previously, will only show <code>fault</code>.</p>
