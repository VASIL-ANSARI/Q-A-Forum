<p>Your solution should work fine. Just note that you have a typo in "(Math.abs(fMaxLat - fMaxLat)) * 0.5)". You are using twice "fMaxLat".</p>

<p>You could write it in a simpler form:</p>

<pre><code>mapView.getController().zoomToSpan((int)(Math.abs(fMinLat-fMaxLat) * 1.5), (int)(Math.abs(fMinLong-fMaxLong) * 1.5));
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can try different multiplying values between 1.0 and 1.99, to see what better achieve your expectations.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that zoom always change in steps (is not progressive) of powers of 2, meaning it will double the zoom or it will reduce to half. The final result achieved will vary with different points in the map, which can fit closely to a zoom value and very distante from the edge on previous one.</p>
