<p>ArrayList is <em>not</em> thread-safe. From the relevant <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that this implementation is not
  synchronized. If multiple threads
  access an ArrayList instance
  concurrently, and at least one of the
  threads modifies the list
  structurally, it must be synchronized
  externally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need a thread-safe implementation of List, there are (at least) two provided in the JDK: CopyOnWriteArrayList and Vector.</p>
