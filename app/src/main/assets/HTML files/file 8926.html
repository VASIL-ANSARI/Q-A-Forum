<p>Maybe you miss something like the <code>DOCTYPE</code> in the page.. make sure to have this as the very first line in your code, above the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;
</code></pre>
