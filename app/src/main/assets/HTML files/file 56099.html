<p>To answer the spirit of you question all of the options you mentioned are more or less intended and well suited for various relatively short running jobs that have a defined start and end.  Of the options listed "BackgroundWorker" is the closest fit, but that as well is more intended for a job that can report progress and finishes.  If you really need something that is running all the time through the life of your app then you should probably create and manage a dedicated Thread.</p>

<p>All that being said to Cody's point have you considered just checking on startup? if regular checking is a must setting a Timer that does it on an interval might be a good choice.</p>
