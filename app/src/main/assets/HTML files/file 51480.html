<p>A function is a number is a string is a boolean is an array is an object.</p>

<p>Okay, well, it's not that simple. But a function is an object and can have properties just like every other object in JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>var a = function() { return 10; };
a.foo = function() { return 20; };
console.log(a());     // 10
console.log(a.foo()); // 20
</code></pre>
