<p>Static libraries, that makes life more difficult in this regard. In case of dynamic libraries you could just have used ldd on the resulting executable and be done with it. The best bet would be some kind of configuration file. Alternatively you could try to look for -l arguments to gcc/ld. Those are used to specify libraries. You could write a script for extracting it from the output, though I suspect that you will have to do it manually because by the time you know what the script should look for you probably already know the answer.</p>
