<blockquote>
  <p>s is Student Type But How and Why Do we Need to Make Data Type Like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In java Array is Object.
In <code>Student[] s = new Student[100]</code> is array of Student Object which are <code>null</code> right now by default.Means every single index of <code>Student[]</code> from <code>0 to 99</code> will have Object reference stored at index.</p>

<p>As you can see in image every box contains value which is nothing but <em>value stored at specific memory address allocated to the array.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why Do we Need to Make Data Type Like?</em> Yes.Array is very older than <code>collection</code> as before collection array was the option to store the collection of variables
  of same data type and access it by index.So still now array is there
  for storing values/references of same type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To use <code>s</code> you have to first initialize it <code>s[0]=new Student()</code> so it's Object now before this <code>s[0]</code> was <code>null</code></p>
