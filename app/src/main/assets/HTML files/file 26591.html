<p>This is not a 2D array, this is an array of objects, so this should work:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
    console.log(array[i].title); //Log the title of each object.
    if (array[i].title == "Apple") {
        console.log("Found apple!");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, objects are key/val pairs, denoted by <code>key : val</code>, not <code>key = val</code>. Your array has syntax errors and shouldn't run.</p>
