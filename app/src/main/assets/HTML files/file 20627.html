<p>A post is just text, and text will evaluate as true in php. A quick fix would be to send a zero instead of false. You could also put quotes around your true in PHP. </p>

<pre><code>if ($_POST['undo_vote'] == "true") {
    Photo::undo_vote($_POST['photo_id']);
} else {
    Photo::vote($_POST['photo_id'], $_POST['vote']);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can pass in true/false text. If that's what you prefer. </p>
