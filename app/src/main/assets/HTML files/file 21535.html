<p>I think the problem could come from your query <strong>insert into users(id...</strong>. There is no interval after table name, but I can't be sure. You should set errors to work.</p>

<hr>

<p>You shoudd add <code>or die(mysql_error());</code> after every line with <code>mysql_query</code> to dump if there are any errors.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code> //We count the number of users to give an ID to this one
               mysql_query('select id from users order by id dest limit 1')
</code></pre>

<p>A think this way of getting the last user id is better.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also I think that, when you insert into db you should use <code>INSERT INTO table SET id=1, name=Ivan, role=admin</code>  than <code>INSET INTO table (...) VALUES(...)</code>, because that way it's clear to see what do you insert and it's ease to change some values.</p>

<p><strong>action="sign_up.php"</strong> shuold be <strong>action="sign-up.php"</strong></p>
