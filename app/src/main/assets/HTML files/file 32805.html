<p>You are joining back on the Employee table to get the data of, I suppose, the employee's manager or responsible. If the condition:</p>

<pre><code>Pos.PPOSRP = Mgr.APOSNO AND Mgr.AACCT = Emp.AACCT
</code></pre>

<p>...selects two rows, then you should verify why it is doing so. It is obviously insufficient to isolate just one row on that table. You probably have to add some other condition in AND to select the one you want. Maybe the position has been covered by two different persons in different times, then you probably have to ADD some condition to select the one that interests the time frame of your SELECT statement.</p>

<p>As a side note, I wonder why you are sorting on the AEMPNO when you say you expect to have only one row in the result set.</p>
