<p>Apparently the problem was not caused by the ViewFlipper. I noticed the animation lag only when debugging on my Galaxy Nexus device. I found out <a href="http://www.dkeesto.com/?p=198" rel="nofollow">here</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Galaxy Nexus is 1280 x 720 for a total of 921K pixels on screen.
  So basically, the GPU on the Galaxy Nexus has to draw 2.4 times as
  many pixels per frame as the it does on the Infuse or S II. The potential frame rate can be expected to be roughly 2.4 times worse on the Galaxy Nexus as it can on the Infuse or Galaxy S II.</p>

<p>That's the reason for my animation problem. Solved it by enabling hardware acceleration:</p>

<pre><code> @Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= 11) {
        getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_HARDWARE_ACCELERATED, WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_HARDWARE_ACCELERATED);
    }
    setContentView(R.layout.content);

    initUI();

}
</code></pre>
