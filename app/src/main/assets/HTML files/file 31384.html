<p>Unfortunately, <code>listFiles</code> is quite buggy (especially with unicode names). What you can use is:</p>

<pre><code>try (DirectoryStream ds = Files.newDirectoryStream(folder)) 
{
    for (Path file : ds) {
    // Your code goes here
    }
} 
catch (IOException e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is not to say it will certainly fix your issue, but it's worth a try.</p>
