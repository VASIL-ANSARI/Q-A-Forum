<li><p>You can only request focus on a visible component on a visible GUI. Therefore you can't request focus in the constructor.</p></li>
<li><p>You should NOT be using a KeyListener anyway. Swing was designed to be used with <code>Key Bindings</code>. Read the section from the Swing tutorial on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/keybinding.html" rel="nofollow">How to Use Key Bindings</a>. When using key bindings the component does not (always) need to have focus to respond to the key binding.</p></li>
