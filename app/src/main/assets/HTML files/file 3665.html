<p>I'm not sure why you want to ban JOIN as its fairly essential to SQL. It's like banning function calls in a functional language.</p>

<p>A good way to solve this is to create a result set containing the ids you want to return and join with it. Here's one way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Table1.*
FROM Table1
JOIN (SELECT 1 AS id
      UNION ALL SELECT 2
      UNION ALL SELECT 3
      UNION ALL SELECT 4
      UNION ALL SELECT 5
      UNION ALL SELECT 1
      UNION ALL SELECT 2
      UNION ALL SELECT 5
      UNION ALL SELECT 5) AS T1
ON Table1.id = T1.id
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if you have considered this method? It has none of the problems that you seem to be afraid of.</p>

<p>If you ban joins you can't do this unless you use a stored procedure, which I'd say is worse than joining.</p>
