<p>The reason for the assignment is that Java has only one method of passing parameters - by value.</p>

<p>A reference to <code>root</code> is passed to <code>add</code> method by value. However, <code>add</code> needs to modify a node passed to it as a root: for example, when you add the first node to the tree, the value of <code>root</code> is <code>null</code>, but it needs to become non-<code>null</code> after adding a node.</p>

<p>An idiom to work around this limitation is to make a method that returns the modified value, and assign it back to the parameter. That is what your <code>add</code> method is doing here</p>

<pre><code>root=add(root,e);
</code></pre>

<p>and here</p>

<pre><code>n.left = add(n.left, e);
n.right = add(n.right, e);
</code></pre>
