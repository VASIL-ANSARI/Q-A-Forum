<p>So the answer to your question in the title "does Android have a server..." is no. There's no server that Google provides specifically for Android. However, Android can do standard network communication--you can use any accessible server of your choice. There are plenty of free (tiered) servers including <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" rel="nofollow">Google App Engine</a>, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" rel="nofollow">Heroku</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/" rel="nofollow">AWS</a>. You'll have to create your own server-side component though.</p>

<p>You're probably getting downvotes because the actual body of your question is extremely broad. I could probably reword your question as "How can I create Craigslist but for Android?". There's a lot involved and there are a huge range of possibilities and differing requirements. You need to break down your problem into pieces, fill in what you can and then if you have any specific technical questions about pieces of that, then ask those here on StackOverflow.</p>

<p>I will try to help you get started in the right direction as you asked though, you should take a look at learning how to implement a web service, then create one to post your listings to and to retrieve listings. In that web service you'll have to interpret the request, and most likely save the data into a database. Likewise when retrieving listings, you'll have to go to the database to retrieve previously stored listings, potentially filter/sort them and then return them in some form back.</p>

<p>This is not a trivial task, good luck.</p>
