<p>Your method returns an <code>IEnumerable&lt;GenderDTO&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;GenderDTO&gt; GetGenderList()
</code></pre>

<p>But you're trying to return a <code>GenderDTO</code>:</p>

<pre><code>GenderDTO model = new GenderDTO();
//...
return model;
</code></pre>

<p>They're two different types.  If you want the method to return one object, change the method to do that:</p>

<pre><code>public GenderDTO GetGenderList()
</code></pre>

<p>If, on the other hand, you want to return a collection of objects, then change your return type to do that:</p>

<pre><code>return new List&lt;GenderDTO&gt; { model };
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>It's <em>highly likely</em> that you want the first option.  It would be kind of silly to always return a collection of exactly one object.  Though, to be fair, it's not really clear what this <code>GenderDTO</code> model is supposed to represent anyway.  You're never setting the <code>ID</code> or <code>Description</code> properties.</p>
