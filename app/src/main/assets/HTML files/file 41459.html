<p>Yes.  The return value of <code>Interlocked.Exchange</code> won't be torn, and the value that <code>flopsErrorMargin</code> <em>eventually</em> ends up as will be <code>value</code> (those are the two guarantees that <code>Interlocked.Exchange</code> give you), but an unsynchronized read access could be torn.</p>
