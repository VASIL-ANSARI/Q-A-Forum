<p>Can't you override the ForeColor and BackColor properties when it's locked?</p>

<p>Failing that, create your own textbox class that listens to the KeyUp event and intercepts the key press if the ReadOnly (or Locked) property is set to true (preventing it being added to the text.)  Then you can use any styles you like.</p>
