<p>Once all of your assemblies are loaded, you can iterate through each Assembly and call GetTypes() to return all types (you can optionally get private types as well, though this will take longer).  You can filter the types by IsEnum to get only those that are enum types.  Note that this will also return all BCL Enum types.  If you don't want the BCL types, you'll need to filter them out.  You can get rid of most of them by ignoring assemblies whose names start with "System".  Alternately, you can check that the path contains your local path, assuming all of your project assemblies are local to your EXE.</p>
