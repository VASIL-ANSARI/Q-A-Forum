<p>No matter what you chose to use <code>Entity Framework</code> or <code>ADO.NET</code> always do put your connection strings in <code>App.Config</code> or <code>Web.config</code> file for better maintainability.</p>

<p>So that, tomorrow if needed to change the connection string; you know there is only once place to change this.</p>

<p>Again, changing the config file <code>*.config</code> file doesn't need your code to be rebuild and redeployed to production environment.</p>
