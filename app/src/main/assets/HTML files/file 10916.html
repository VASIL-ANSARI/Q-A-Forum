<p>Beware of MD5, there's no guarantee that two different Strings won't generate the same hash.</p>

<p>As for your problem, it depends on a number of constraints: are the strings short or long? Do they have to be meaningful? Etc... Two solutions from the top of my head:</p>

<p>1 Generate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier" rel="nofollow">UUIDs</a> then turn them into String with a binary representation or base 64 algorithm.</p>

<p>2 Simply generate random Strings and put them in a searchable structure (HashMap) so that you can find very quickly (O(1)-O(log n)) if a generated String already has a duplicate, in which case it is discarded. </p>
