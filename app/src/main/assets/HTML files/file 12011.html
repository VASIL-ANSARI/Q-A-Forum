<p>Unfortunately IE7 and IE8 have very buggy support for the <code>max-width</code> css rule. So no, you won't be able to do that reliably without javascript or fixed widths.  If it helps, the code you have is <em>supposed</em> to work in IE 7+.</p>

<p>But you could make it only fixed width for those two browsers by adding a conditional css rule after the rules you have above:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
    td, span {
        width: 150px;
    }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you later move your css into an external file, you would of course change that to a link tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--[if lte IE 8]&gt;
   &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ie8.css" /&gt;
 &lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can detect IE 7 and 8 with javascript and redirect the user to this page: <code>http://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/new/</code></p>
