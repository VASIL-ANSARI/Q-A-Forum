<p>To make a long story short: You have to do this on the application side, as cursors are tied to collections. So you have to manually merge the result sets.</p>

<p>After you merged them, you can use the following approach to sort them</p>

<pre><code>function sortByField(a,b){
  if(a.fieldName &lt; b.fieldName) {
    return -1;
  }
  else if(a.fieldName == b.fieldName){
     return 0;
  }
  else return 1;
}

var sortedArray = mergedArray.sort(sortByField)
</code></pre>
