<p>You have to make sure you modify the include to g++'s command. Reading from the man page (which is your best friend for this sorta stuff):</p>

<pre><code>Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for
header files.  Directories named by -I are searched before the
standard system include directories.  If the directory dir is a
standard system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure
that the default search order for system directories and the
special treatment of system headers are not defeated .  If dir
begins with "=", then the "=" will be replaced by the sysroot
prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.
</code></pre>

<p>For you the command should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -I path/to/boost test.cpp
</code></pre>
