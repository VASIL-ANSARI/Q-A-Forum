<p>you can load a QPixmap from the same directory of the application </p>

<p><code><code>QPixmap("./image.png")</code></code></p>

<p>else you can load the image from a qrc file:</p>

<p><code>
<code>QPixmap(":path")</code> 
</code> 
path depends on how you made the qrc file
it s difficult to me explaining how to do qrc file because i m not english. but you can find a lot of documentation on internet. </p>
