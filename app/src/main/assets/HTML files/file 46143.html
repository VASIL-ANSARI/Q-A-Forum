<p>The concept of the view is used to perform any number of actions, and any action can have any number of results. A result is used to return a view. The action that returns a view is placed on top of the <code>ValueStack</code> to be easy accessible via evaluating OGNL expressions. The result view could be mapped to any action in any action class. It knows nothing about action which calls it, but it can determine it, again using OGNL. You can map actions to different method of the same action class, so you don't need to have many <code>input()</code> methods.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You problem is you bounded form fields wrong. Each form should have a separate storage to display it correctly. Fields are bounded by name, and you'd better have a form bean for the search condition variables and put it somewhere in the action context. </p>

<pre class="lang-jsp prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;s:form action="executeSearch"&gt;
    &lt;s:textfield key="searchBean.name" label="Name"/&gt;
    &lt;s:textfield key="searchbean.age"  label="Age"/&gt;
    &lt;s:submit/&gt;
&lt;/s:form&gt;

&lt;s:form action="executeRegister"&gt;
    &lt;s:textfield key="firstName" label="First Name"/&gt;
    &lt;s:textfield key="lastName" label="Last Name"/&gt;
    &lt;s:textfield key="age" label="Age"/&gt;
    &lt;s:submit/&gt;
&lt;/s:form&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p><sub>Note: the <code>key</code> attribute generates <code>name</code>, <code>label</code>, and <code>value</code>.</sub></p>

<p>Each action needs to initialize a <code>searchBean</code>, unless it has a session scope. If you put a bean to a session, then you should use <code>#session.</code> prefix.  More about <a href="http://struts.apache.org/docs/ognl.html" rel="nofollow">OGNL</a> you can find on the docs page.</p>
