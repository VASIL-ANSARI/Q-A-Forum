<p>Instead of defining you model param as Dictionary create a model that would require more explicit binding</p>

<p>Something like</p>

<pre><code> ModelClass { 
    string SomeName {get;set;} 
    T Internal {get;set;}
}

public ActionResult YourAction(ModelClass boundInstance){}
</code></pre>

<p>This would certainly not get bound to random query string parameters. Do note however any model objects defined as optional parameters will never be null, they will just have empty data, even in your case if there were no query string parameters you would still end up with a constructed but empty Dic(). The default model binder calls any parameters empty constructor before attempting to bind data so the object is constructed even if no data can be bound to it.</p>

<p>Other option - If your only planning on getting the Dictionary data from a post you can add the attribute [FromBody] to the binding</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult YourAction([FromBody]Dictionary&lt;string, T&gt; boundInstance){}
</code></pre>

<p>Rant: Avoid using generic collection types as action parameters and you can avoid these issue entirely.</p>
