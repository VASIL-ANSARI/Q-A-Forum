<p>Your problem seems to be that the upload component is showing only one of the select multiple values.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://support.persits.com/show.asp?code=PS01032617" rel="nofollow">"Upload.Form returns only the first selected item of a multi-select control"</a>.</p>

<p>As the workaround shows, you will have to loop through each form element named <code>ChosenData</code> and display.</p>
