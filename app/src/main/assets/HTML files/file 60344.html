<p>The second method is undefined behaviour due to violating the strict aliasing rule. Even though <code>struct one</code> and <code>struct two</code> have the same layout, it is not permitted to use an lvalue of type <code>struct one</code> to access an object of type <code>struct two</code> or vice versa. </p>

<p>In general, accessing an object via an expression of a different type is only allowed for using a character type to access another object; or via a union.</p>

<p>An alternative would be:</p>

<pre><code>memcpy(&amp;s1, &amp;s2, sizeof s1);
</code></pre>
