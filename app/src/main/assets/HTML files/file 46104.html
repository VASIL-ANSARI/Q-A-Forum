<p>I think there are nothing to do with <strong>Parse.com</strong>, their linking function is just for logging user in.</p>

<p>You can call API from Facebook iOS SDK in order to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/picture/" rel="nofollow">get that image</a>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
Although you use your Facebook ID to log in, you won't get the <code>authData</code> back when you query for it. So, the best way to do is to have your own custom field to store the Facebook ID so that it's available for you when you fetch it.</p>
