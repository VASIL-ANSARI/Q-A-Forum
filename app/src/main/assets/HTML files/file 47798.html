<p>I found an answer. I do not really know why the byte array was getting messed up, maybe it was too large? Even so, both the input and output byte arrays were the same length, so not a very good explanation.</p>

<p>Anyway, I found my answer here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11010386/send-bitmap-using-intent-android">Send Bitmap Using Intent Android</a>. The first answer by Zaid Daghestani is the same as what I initially tried, but his edit is what worked. Instead of passing a byte array, you save the compressed bitmap to a temporary file, and pass the filename through the intent. Definitely works for passing a bitmap, now I just have to figure out how to display the bitmap on a SurfaceView instead of an ImageView...</p>

<p>Also, just in case you need a mutable bitmap (in order to pass it to an ImageView) you can use:</p>

<pre><code>BitmapFactory.Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();
options.inMutable = true;
bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(input, null, options);
</code></pre>
