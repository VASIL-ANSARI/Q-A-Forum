<p>The problem is that you are using <code>$_SESSION['status1']</code> for all of the staff members.  Therefore, when that variable is set, it will look like all surveys are completed.</p>

<p>You may want to consider another way of doing this, however, such as using a MySQL table that stores whether or not a user has completed a survey, and load the status from there.</p>
