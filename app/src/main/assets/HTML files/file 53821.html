<p>I was finally able to figure out what's going on. Changing my attribute name from <code>initBalance</code> to <code>startingBalance</code> makes everything work again. In fact, changing the attribute's name to anything that does not start with <code>new</code> or <code>init</code> works just fine. I got the idea from this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21304385/application-crashes-if-a-property-name-starts-with-new">post.</a></p>

<p>It seems that when using ARC, your property's name should not start with the word <code>new</code>. It turns out that <code>initBalance</code> (or <code>newBalance</code> for that matter) produces the same issue. Hope it helps the next poor soul running in a similar problem. </p>
