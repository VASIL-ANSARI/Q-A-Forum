<p>You are setting the <code>addToBackStack</code> argument to <code>false</code> and not putting the replace operation on the back stack.  So it's likely that the <code>FragmentManager</code> releases the reference to the fragment since it doesn't have to undo that transaction thus there's no reason to hold onto the fragment anymore.  I'd have to try it out to be sure, but I'm pretty confident that that's what is going on.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, <code>setRetainInstance(true)</code> has nothing to do with this logic.  What that does is to prevent the fragment from being destroyed then recreated on configuration changes.  Once you replace the <code>HomeFragment</code> and it's not on the back stack, there's no point in having the <code>FragmentManager</code> keep that fragment around.</p>
