<p>The <code>d3.tsv</code> method makes an AJAX request for data. On most browsers, this won't work locally due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same Origin Policy</a>, which generally prohibits AJAX requests to <code>file:///</code> urls.</p>

<p>To get an example that uses AJAX running locally, you'll need a local webserver. If you have Python, running</p>

<pre><code>&gt; python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</code></pre>

<p>from the command line in the directory with your files will do it. If you prefer node.js, try <a href="https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server">http-server</a>.</p>
