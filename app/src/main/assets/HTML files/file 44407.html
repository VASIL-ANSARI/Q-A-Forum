<p>I seemed to have fixed the problem and like always its something simple but thats coding for you lol,</p>

<p>i forgot to instantiate a string variable to act as a holder for the GUI so when i was inputting the department the string was going nowhere so it wasn't recognizing the department.</p>

<p>the working code is now : </p>

<pre><code>if(command.equals("Add Manager")){
        m_name = inputName.getText();
        m_num = inputNum.getText();
        m_year = Integer.parseInt(inputHire.getText());
        m_yearlyPay = Double.parseDouble(inputYearly.getText());
        department = inputDepartment.getText(); 


        if(department.equalsIgnoreCase("Payroll")){

             Manager temp = new Manager(m_name,m_num,m_year,m_yearlyPay,Manager.Department.PAYROLL);
             System.out.println(temp);
        }
        if(department.equalsIgnoreCase("Production")){
            Manager temp = new Manager(m_name,m_num,m_year,m_yearlyPay,Manager.Department.PRODUCTION);
            System.out.println(temp);
        }
        if(department.equalsIgnoreCase("Accounting")){
            Manager temp = new Manager(m_name,m_num,m_year,m_yearlyPay,Manager.Department.ACCOUNTING);
            System.out.println(temp);
        }
        if(department.equalsIgnoreCase("Research")){
             Manager temp = new Manager(m_name,m_num,m_year,m_yearlyPay,Manager.Department.RESEARCH);
             System.out.println(temp);
        }
        if(department.equalsIgnoreCase("Marketing")){
             Manager temp = new Manager(m_name,m_num,m_year,m_yearlyPay,Manager.Department.MARKETING);
             System.out.println(temp);
        }



    }
