<p>Singletons are generally considered "bad"; see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/228164/on-design-patterns-when-to-use-the-singleton">this section here</a> for a flame war on the topic.</p>

<p>That said, using factory methods or factory classes to create objects is generally considered good, so you're fine there :)</p>

<p>I personally use the <a href="http://components.symfony-project.org/dependency-injection/" rel="nofollow">symfony dependency injection</a> component (can be installed in any project without using the symfony framework) to simplify dependency injection and avoid singletons where it seems appropriate.  </p>

<p>I do still use some singletons, where it makes sense to me; loggers and factory objects, for example, seem to naturally be single to me, so I make them that way.  The idea is that global <em>functionality</em> (e.g. a factory) is fine, but global <em>state</em> is bad, I believe.</p>

<p>With regards to your amended question on whether to throw an Exception or whether to return false from your create() call; it depends on whether your application can continue successfully without the created object if not.  If, for example, you were creating a database connection that is necessary to create a page, then throw an Exception.  If you're doing something less essential, return false and continue on your merry way :)</p>
