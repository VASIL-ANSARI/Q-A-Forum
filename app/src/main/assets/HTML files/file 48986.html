<p>This assignment</p>

<pre><code>timeStampLast24H= expr $timeStamp - 86400
</code></pre>

<p>is incorrect.</p>

<p>Notice how it differs from this assignment?</p>

<pre><code>timeStamp=`date +%s`
</code></pre>

<p>You added a space after the <code>=</code> and left out the backticks or <code>$()</code> wrapping.</p>

<p>Fix those problems and your issue will likely go away. As it is you are putting no value into your query.</p>
