<p>Notice that your results are almost exactly half what they should be.</p>

<p>If you try printing out the dart locations for distance 0, it should be obvious where the problem arises: The <code>x</code> values are all negative, and they're as low as -2, when clearly they're supposed to be in the range from -1 to 1. So, you're only getting half as many hits as you should. And the problem is the same with any other distanceâa bit less obvious to nail down, but obvious enough that something similar is wrong.</p>

<p>So, look at the formula for each <code>x</code>:</p>

<pre><code>x=(width*(random.random()))-width
</code></pre>

<p><code>width*(random.random())</code> gives you a random number from 0 to width. Subtracting <code>width</code> gives you a random number from -width to 0.</p>

<p>And now, the fix should be obvious:</p>

<pre><code>x=(width*(random.random()))-width/2
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Meanwhile, <code>d2</code> is always going to be positive, because it's the sum of two squares, so <code>d2&gt;=-1</code> is always true. You wanted to check <code>d2&lt;=1</code>. (If you're working from a description that says you wanted dy>=-1, you probably needed to negate the squares, rather than the expressions inside the squares. But that's going to have the same effect anyway.)</p>

<p>For the 0 distance case, this makes no difference, because the <code>d2</code> values are between 0 and 1 exactly when the <code>d1</code> values are. But as distance increases, you will overestimate the counts quadratically more.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, the way the problem is usually describedâand the way you specifically described itâthe circles are supposed to be centered about points on the X axis. But you're not doing that; you're picking numbers from 0.0 to 1.0. You wanted <code>y=random.random()-.5</code>.</p>

<p>But you're also calculating the distances wrong; you need <code>y-0.5</code>, not <code>y-0</code> in the <code>d</code> and <code>d2</code> equations.</p>

<p>By getting both of those wrong, you've effectively just shifted the X axis down by 0.5, which obviously has no effect on the results. So, this could be a useful optimization/simplification, if done intentionally. Or it could be two bugs that just happen to cancel out.</p>

<hr>

<p>While we're at it, you could simplify most of your expressions to make them more readable. You've got parentheses all over the place around single values, like the <code>(0)</code> in the <code>return</code> statement, or the <code>(random.random())</code> in the <code>y</code> assignment. Obviously <code>-0</code> has no useful effect. <code>x-(distance*-1)</code> is the same as <code>x-(-distance)</code> which is the same as <code>x+distance</code> (which also makes the relationship between d and d2 much more obvious). And so on.</p>
