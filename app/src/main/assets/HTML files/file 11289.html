<p>No, you can't do it pure XML, as XML is just a way to organize info
so you could do it in java, as for the start, i unfortunately don't know how to code in java,
but can give some advice:</p>

<p>First, you will need to have the Java applet get current time from somewhere, whether online or the windows clock, next you will probably have to use a java graphics library to draw the clock and animate it. You may need to map the time to a certain graphic, or frame for the clock, finally set up a loop to update constantly and check the time. Good luck!</p>
