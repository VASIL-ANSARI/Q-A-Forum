<p>Just a guess. I haven't used that sample project before.</p>

<p>A new pointer to the old <code>peerList</code> array is created, called <code>tempList</code>:</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *tempList = peerList;
</code></pre>

<p>The code makes a copy of <code>session.peerList</code> and assigns the <code>peerList</code> pointer to that new copy:</p>

<pre><code>peerList = [session.peerList copy];
</code></pre>

<p>The old <code>peerList</code>, which is actually now pointed to by <code>tempList</code>, can then be released safely:</p>

<pre><code>[tempList release];
</code></pre>

<p>If you had assigned <code>[session.peerList copy];</code> right away, the old array would have no more retained pointers left, and if it wasn't autoreleased it would be a memory leak.</p>

<p>If you had assigned <code>tempList</code> but not released it, it leaks memory for the same reason, but the purpose of <code>tempList</code> is purely so the program knows what to release when you call <code>release</code> anyway.</p>
