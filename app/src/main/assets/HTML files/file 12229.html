<p>Only place JPA and memcached will relate through an API I can think, if you are using hibernate, is caching. If you are using Hibernate you may configure memcached as your 2nd level cache provider by using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hibernate-memcached/" rel="nofollow">hibernate-memcached</a> project. Though I believe there are better alternative than memcached if you are just planing to use it as a hibernate 2nd level cache.
Memcached is an in memory caching system which you may use as a db it self.</p>
