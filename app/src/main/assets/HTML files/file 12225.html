<h2>First Check</h2>

<p>Does it give you any error log?..Have you tried with another addresses?,Try writting city name ...Are you trying this in emulator..then test in device cause Geocoder class don't work in emulator..if api level is 2.2..try changing it to lower and higher..may be because of zoom level you can't recognize the result..set it to mc.setZoom(16); </p>

<h2>Then Check</h2>

<p>I suspect the problem is within to see the result..write some Address outside the US and see if there is any difference.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>If you have Device..try your code on it..and I am sure It will run ok or Use higher version Emulator.</p>
