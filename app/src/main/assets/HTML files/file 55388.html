<p>Problem is solved - I just had to change this line:</p>

<pre><code>config.serve_static_files = ENV['RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES'].present?
</code></pre>

<p>To</p>

<pre><code>config.serve_static_files = true
</code></pre>

<p>In <em>config/environments/production.rb</em> to serve static files from <em>/public</em> directory.</p>
