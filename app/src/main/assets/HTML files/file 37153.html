<p>You may use code generator to generate initialization code. That is, write program that will write your initialization code for you. You may actually calculate values at generation-time.</p>

<p>Remember that C++ allows placing <code>,</code> after last element. It's also isn't necessary to specify array size. These two things should ease writing of generator.</p>

<p>This simple python code should work well:</p>

<pre><code>from math import sin

print('const float A[', N, '] = {')
for i in range(N):
    print('\t', sin(i*D), ',', sep='')
print('};')
</code></pre>
