<p>A good data-structure for storing and lookup strings is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" rel="nofollow">Trie</a>:</p>

<p>It's essentially a tree structure which uses characters or substrings to denote paths to follow.</p>

<p>Advantages over hash-maps (quote from Wikipedia):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Looking up data in a trie is faster in the worst case, O(m) time (where m is the length of a search string), compared to an imperfect hash table. An imperfect hash table can have key collisions. A key collision is the hash function mapping of different keys to the same position in a hash table. The worst-case lookup speed in an imperfect hash table is O(N) time, but far more typically is O(1), with O(m) time spent evaluating the hash.</li>
  <li>There are no collisions of different keys in a trie.
  Buckets in a trie, which are analogous to hash table buckets that store key collisions, are necessary only if a single key is associated with more than one value.</li>
  <li>There is no need to provide a hash function or to change hash functions as more keys are added to a trie.</li>
  <li>A trie can provide an alphabetical ordering of the entries by key.</li>
  </ul>
