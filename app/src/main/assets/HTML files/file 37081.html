<p>Data from serial port type is <code>str</code></p>

<p>You are trying to read the data and use <code>if .... &gt; 100</code> this will never work.</p>

<p>You need to read the data to a buffer and then check it, Also you need some sync frame to know you have got all the data(it's not a must but its much eaiser)</p>

<p>for example let say the read data is <code>100!</code> and <code>!</code> is your sync frame.</p>

<pre><code>import serial
my_serial = serial.Serial('COM7',9600)
my_data = ""
while(1):        
    if(my_serial.inWaiting()&gt;0):
        my_data = my_serial.readline()
        if '!' in my_data:
            break

my_data = [:my_data.find("!")]
if int(my_data) &gt; 100:
    print("dist is greater than 100")
else:
    print("this shit does not work")
</code></pre>
