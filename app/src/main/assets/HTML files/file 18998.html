<p>Each thread should obtain its own session from Hibernate session factory. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not intended that implementors be threadsafe. Instead each thread/transaction should obtain its own instance from a SessionFactory.</p>

<p>See here: <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/api/org/hibernate/Session.html">Hibernate Session JavaDoc</a></p>

<p>When you "cancel" a thread - it should do its own cleanup like transactions rollback, session close etc. </p>
