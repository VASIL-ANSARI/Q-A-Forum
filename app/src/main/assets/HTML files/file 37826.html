<p>Set a width to the container for this div, and add the following styles too;</p>

<pre><code>.mapCanvas{
        max-width: 800px; 
        height: 200px;
        width: 100%;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>This css will ensure the mapCanvas div does not exceed 800px; but also will ensure it stays at 100% width of the containing div, therefore as the window (device) decreases in width so will the map.</p>
