<p>They don't work for version 10 and greater.</p>

<p>There is a hack for Internet Explorer 10, which you might want to use:</p>

<pre><code>. ie10 #hack{
  /* Only works in IE10 */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe you have to arm yourself with some JavaScript for the fight against the future versions of Internet Explorer, if you can't fix the underlying problem. For example with <code>JQuery</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if ($.browser.msie &amp;&amp; $.browser.version == 10) {
  $("html").addClass("ie10");
}
</code></pre>

<p>As @Spudley mentioned, the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.browser/" rel="nofollow"><code>$_browser</code></a> property is <strong>deprecated and already removed</strong> in the newer version of jQuery. Maybe it's better to check the browser for e certains feature you need. For example with <a href="http://modernizr.com/" rel="nofollow">Modernizr</a>. This is also recommended in the JQuery documentation.</p>
