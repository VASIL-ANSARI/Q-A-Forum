<p>The local variables, as well as the argument, aren't actually <em>pushed</em> on the stack. Instead the compiler adds code to change the stack pointer by enough to fit all variables, and then when referencing a local variable the compiler have code to get the value from an <em>offset</em> from the stack pointer.</p>

<p>I recommend that you look at the assembler output of your example program to understand how it works.</p>
