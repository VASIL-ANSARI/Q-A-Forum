<p>You should have an inverse relationship from Offer to Store. Then you fetch the Offer by offerID and access the Store in the code simply by accessing the store property of the offer.</p>

<p>I suspect this would be easier on the database than using ANY in the predicate.</p>

<p>You can even improve this a little. If you specify your inverse relationship from offer to store as a relationship for prefetching when fetching offer, youâll save one trip to database when accessing <code>offer.store</code> after the fetch.</p>
