<p><code>func(,2)</code> is not legal in C++, there's no way to accomplish that.</p>

<p>You could use <code>operator()</code> to access a cell in the matrix, and have one <code>row</code> function that retrieves an entire row, and one <code>col</code> function that retrieves a column.</p>

<p>Or you can overload <code>operator[]</code> for getting a column, but I suspect this will confuse your users quite a bit. I suspect overloading <code>operator()</code> to get a single row will also confuse your users, it's not very C++-y.</p>
