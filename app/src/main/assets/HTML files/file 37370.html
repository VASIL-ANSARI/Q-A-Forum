<p>Your List "pressureUnits" is empty. You've specified that it is a list of Pressures but not added anything to it. Usually this is done with the "add" method, i.e. pressureUnits.add(...).</p>

<p>However what I think you want to use is Enums.Pressures.values(). This will return an array containing each of your enum elements. Then you will be able to create an adapter using that array. If you can't do it with the BaseAdapter you are using now, have a look at using the ArrayAdapter class rather than the BaseAdapter.</p>
