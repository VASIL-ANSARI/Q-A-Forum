<p>If you get some error from <code>vector</code>'s code in this line</p>

<pre><code>students[current_student].scores.push_back(grade);
</code></pre>

<p>it doesn't mean that the problem is with the vector. what it does mean is that you access invalid memory (not initialized or not allocated). Probably <code>current_student</code> is out-of-bounds of <code>students</code>, or you allocated <code>students</code> by a call to <code>malloc</code> instead of <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>Your question cannot be answered without you giving more of your code.</p>
