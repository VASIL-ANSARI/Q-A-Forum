<p>From the screenshot of your DOM, I notice you have a table inside of a table. The upper most table having no width, and the inner most table having width 100%. I believe the upper most table having no width is what is giving you trouble here.</p>

<p>By any chance are you using a VerticalPanel to layout your CellTable? It's underlying implementation is a table which can cause this sort of wonkiness. </p>

<p>If so, you can try:</p>

<p><strong>1:</strong> Using a FlowPanel, SimplePanel, or HTMLPanel instead. Their underlying implementations are divs, which as a block level element will expand to fill the entire width of their parent.</p>

<p><strong>2:</strong> Apply width=100% to your VerticalPanel</p>
