<p>In my project, I use <a href="https://github.com/mobiata/twine" rel="nofollow">Twine</a> to maintain .strings files for many languages and it works pretty well. It allows to store translated strings for all languages in one "master" file and then generate appropriate .strings files for each language. </p>
