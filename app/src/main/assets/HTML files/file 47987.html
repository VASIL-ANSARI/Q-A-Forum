<p>Error code 0 means that were no errors. </p>

<p>Using events (OnFingerGone, OnFingerTouch) means your application to <em>wait</em> for them. "The proccess exited with code 0" usually means that main thread (?) of your <em>console application</em> is done or that your WPF, WinForms, etc. application called something like this.Application.Close().</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Pseudocode {
    event EventHandler myEvent;

    int main(){
        myEvent += onMyEvent;
        //do work 1
        return 0;
    }

    void onMyEvent(Object sender, EventArgs e){
       //do work 2
    }
    //other methods and work
}
</code></pre>

<p>If amount of work in main() is small, application will be closed immediately. </p>

<p>In console application you can prevent this simply adding Console.ReadLine(); (before return 0; according to example), so your application will be waiting for "Enter" key. </p>

<p>In windowed application you need to look for manual exit calls or something like this because they are not known as "self-closable".</p>
