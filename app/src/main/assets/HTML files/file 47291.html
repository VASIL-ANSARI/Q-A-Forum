<p>So you asking how to insert text in PHP?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="modify" runat="server"&gt;&lt;?php print 'text'; ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You do it by print/echo. You can print strings, or variables. You cannot print when html was already sent to the browser. Only javascript then.
But you can always use ob_start to catch all text, and after generated html, get it to variable, to replace with what you wan't.</p>

<p>If you asking, how to work with existing page, use DomDocument or i will sugest SimpleHTMLDom library</p>
