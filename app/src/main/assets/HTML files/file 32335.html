<p>This answers your question but not necessarily resolves your exception. If it doesn't, you might want to post HTML snippets and stacktrace.</p>

<p>Here is how to use WebDriverWait in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code># create wait like you have already done
wait = Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout =&gt; 20)

# wait until something, you can use any locators you want, not just ids
# don't inject JavaScript directly, unless you have to
wait.until { driver.find_element(:class =&gt; "dojoxGridCell") }

# do stuff to your raw data
</code></pre>
