<p>I think you should consider using </p>

<pre><code>'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication'
</code></pre>

<p>which will be much easier to handle on a mobile app, as you can just store the token after login, and use that token for any other API call. It also allows you to safely use csrf_exempt</p>

<p>AFAIK, $.ajax won't send any cookies if you are crossing domains, which you are doing by definition from a mobile app. So, I think your issue has to do with CORS and how you initialize the ajax call.</p>

<p>Try using:</p>

<pre><code>xhrFields: { withCredentials:true }
</code></pre>

<p>on your .ajax call. </p>

<p>You also need to set up CORS (use django-cors-headers)</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/ajax-csrf-cors/" rel="nofollow">http://www.django-rest-framework.org/topics/ajax-csrf-cors/</a> for other things that you may need to worry about. In particular</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/csrf/#ajax" rel="nofollow">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/csrf/#ajax</a></p>

<p>But as I said, consider using tokens instead of sessions.</p>
