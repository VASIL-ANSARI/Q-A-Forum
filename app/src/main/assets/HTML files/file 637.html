<p>It's not the same as "not adding these properties", but the last time I saw this, the engineer addressed it by implementing concrete NHibernate classes and deriving them from a common abstract base class (e.g. MyAuditable) that implemented the properties you dislike. This way you only have to solve the problem once.</p>
