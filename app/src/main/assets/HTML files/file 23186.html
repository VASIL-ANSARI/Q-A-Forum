<h2>Nope.</h2>

<p>This is another one of those annoying limitations with the built-in controls. If it were possible, some insanely smart person on GitHub would build me thing to allow it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <code>UIImagePickerController</code> is a private, system class, which doesn't really allow alteration.</p>

<p>What you might do, though, is something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pick an image</strong></p>
  
  <p>This app stores its images in the 'Unicorn' album.</p>
  
  <p><kbd><strong>Choose Image</strong></kbd></p>
</blockquote>
