<p>I have solved it. I couldn't figure out how to delete or format the time on standard notification, but I can create custom notification using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder.html" rel="nofollow">NotificationBuilder</a>, and passed formatted string time to the custom notification instead of Time.</p>
