<p>Look into the <code>UIScrollView</code> class.</p>

<p>From what I read in your question, this should give you what you need.</p>

<p>The scroll view acts as a kind of 'window' on top of a content view. The content view is clipped by the scroll view if it is larger.</p>

<p>So you could have a content view is that is say, for arguments sake, 50x320, and the scroll view be only 50 x 50. The area of the content view will be clipped to the 50x50 size, and you will be able to move the content view by scrolling with your finger, like other native iPhone controls.</p>

<p>Many, if not all, iPhone apps use a scroll view in some way. <code>UITableView</code>s are subclasses of scroll views, as are <code>UITextView</code>s.</p>

<p>Apple has a decent example app that shows how to use a scroll view, so check that out too.</p>
