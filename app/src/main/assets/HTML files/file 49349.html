<p>Based on your comment, then you have a problem at these lines:</p>

<pre><code>            AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo info = (AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo) item.getMenuInfo();
            mDbHelper.deleteHistory(info.id);
</code></pre>

<p>This means that your <code>info</code> object is <code>null</code> and your call to <code>item.getMenuInfo()</code> is not working. </p>

<p>That means your <code>HistoryCustomCursorAdapter</code> is not setting this value correctly. You have not posted the code for that object, but I think this should be sufficient to allow you to find the error.</p>
