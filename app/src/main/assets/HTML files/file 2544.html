<p>Edit: So the actual problem wasn't that the process was dying, but that the process was stuck in an exception handler dialog waiting for the user to hit debug or cancel.  The solution to the problem was to disable the .net JIT debug dialog, instructions here

<p>My original proposed solution is below</p>

<hr>

<p>Not a window service, but this is a pretty easy .NET program to write. </p>

<p>use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process_methods.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.Diagnostics.Process</a> to get a Process object for the process you want to check.  You can use <code>GetProcessByName</code> if you want to open an existing process.  If you create the process from C#, then you will already have the process object.  </p>

<p>Then you just can <code>WaitForExit</code> either with or without a timeout on the <code>Process</code> object.  or test the <code>HasExited</code> property, or register an <code>Exited</code> callback.  Once the process has exited, you can check the <code>ExitCode</code> property to find out whether the process returned an error value.</p>
