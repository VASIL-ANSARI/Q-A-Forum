<p>You're very close. A service is not an activity, so you can't use <code>startActivity</code> to start it. Instead, use the similarly named <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#startService%28android.content.Intent%29" rel="nofollow"><code>startService</code></a> method.</p>
