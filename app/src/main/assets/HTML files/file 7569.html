<p>You'll probably have better luck with Rails if Gift looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Gift: { 
  # author and receiver refer to User objects obviously
  author_id: object_id(...),     
  receiver_id: object_id(...), 

  name: str 
  ... 
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then, add a <code>:foreign_key</code> to Gift:</p>

<pre><code>class Gift 
  include Mongoid::Document

  belongs_to :user, :foreign_key =&gt; 'author_id'
end
</code></pre>
