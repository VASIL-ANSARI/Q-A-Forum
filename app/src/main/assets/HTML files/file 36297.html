<p>The issue is that you are using the Google+ Sign-In, which does <strong>not</strong> use your Redirect URI. Instead, it uses a magic URI of <code>postmessage</code>.</p>

<p>You don't need to add <code>postmessage</code> to the developer console (<a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/server-side-flow#step_1_create_a_client_id_and_client_secret" rel="nofollow">the directions</a> (step 1, item 7c) usually say to clear this field completely), but you <strong>do</strong> need to use it when you're exchanging the code for tokens (see the sample code in <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/server-side-flow#step_8_initialize_the_google_api_client_library_and_start_the_google_service" rel="nofollow">step 8</a>).</p>

<p>So your code above should read something more like</p>

<pre><code> String query = "code="+code; 
 query += "&amp;";
 query += "client_id=[MY_CLIENT_ID]&amp;";
 query += "client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]&amp;";
 query += "redirect_uri=postmessage&amp;";
 query += "grant_type=authorization_code";
</code></pre>
