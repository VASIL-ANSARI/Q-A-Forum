<p>EDIT: I found it! After asking this question, I figured I'd go work on different objects since I was waiting for an answer. There I discovered that the transform.Translate function moves objects in a different direction based on their rotation. When I changed to simply reassigning the position, it worked fine. As per usual, the act of talking to someone else helped to resolve the issue.</p>
