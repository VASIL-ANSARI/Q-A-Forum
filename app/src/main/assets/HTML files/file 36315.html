<p>Your explode function needs double quotes around its delimiter:</p>

<pre><code>$SpamArray = explode("\r\n", $SpamWords);
</code></pre>

<p>With single quotes, explode will attempt to split on the <code>\r\n</code> literal.</p>

<p>Or you could use <code>file()</code> instead of <code>filter_get_contents()</code> which will return the file as an array, with each line per key. <code>trim()</code> each line that's returned and you have your resulting array:</p>

<pre><code>$SpamArray = array_map("trim", file('/spamwords.txt'));
</code></pre>
