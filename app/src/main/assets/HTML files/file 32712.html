<pre><code>a, b, c, d = 1, 2, 3, 4.44
my_tup = (a, b, c, d)
my_tup = tuple([float("{0:.1f}".format(n)) for n in my_tup])
</code></pre>

<p>However, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#tuple" rel="nofollow"><code>tuple</code></a> is an immutable sequence so you can't change it after you have created it. It's probably better to have your numbers formatted correctly before you put them in a tuple; this will also avoid the whole (ugly) create a <code>list</code> then create a <code>tuple</code> from it in <code>tuple([float("{0:.1f}".format(n)) for n in my_tup])</code></p>
