<p>The first solution that comes into my mind is some kind of routing method:</p>

<pre><code>def routing(call = :a)
  begin
    call = send call
  end until call == :end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then the other methods just return the name of the method to call next:</p>

<pre><code>def a
  ...
  case some_condition
  when foo then :a
  when bar then :b
  else          :c
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This will keep the call stack flat. When you want to skip the routing loop, return :end.</p>
