<p>I suspect interrupting those builds might have left things in a bad state. First off, uninstall 1.9.2. 1.9.3-p545 is the oldest supported version, as of now at least. </p>

<p>Next, uninstall the gem 'spring-commands-rspec' and run a gem pristine -all. Then do another bundle install. FWIW, I am able to run spring on my 10.9.2 macbook. You may have to reinstall the xcode command line tools if your gcc is giving you issues.</p>

<p>Beyond all that, you don't need spring to run a rails app. It's primarily a helper during development and testing. Once you get things cleaned up, I would just remove the thing from your Gemfile until you actually need it.</p>
