<p>Based on the data above <code>INNER JOIN</code>s would be written like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM Wines
    INNER JOIN Carry ON Wines.wine_id = Carry.wine_id
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that diagram relationship between Wines and Caries shows 0 to many (1..1 - 0..*). Also notice that wine_id is not listed in the Carry table column list but implied throught the relation.</p>

<p>Next you want to know price for today (hint: since table Carry table has <code>price_start_date</code> and <code>price_end_date</code> it implies that prices are not fixed and you need to use these fields):</p>

<pre><code>WHERE price_start_date &lt;= CURDATE() AND CURDATE() &lt;= price_end_date
</code></pre>

<p>To get prices below $15:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE price_start_date &lt;= CURDATE() AND CURDATE() &lt;= price_end_date
    AND price_on_carry &lt; 15
</code></pre>

<p>Question 1 query would be something like below (you will need to add relevant column names):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM Wines
    INNER JOIN Carry ON Wines.wine_id = Carry.wine_id
WHERE price_start_date &lt;= CURDATE() AND CURDATE() &lt;= price_end_date
    AND price_on_carry &lt; 15
    AND Wines.color = 'Red'
</code></pre>

<p>Note: English is not my first language so I am confused by "whether or not they are from Canada", specifically if we need to include information about whether the wine is from Canada or not. I assumed that we don't need to include this information.</p>
