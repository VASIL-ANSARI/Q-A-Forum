<p>I actually never use Python Sphinx, but I remember seeing a similar question on SO. After searching through, I found the Q+A <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10030149/how-do-i-output-a-config-value-in-a-sphinx-rst-file">here</a></p>

<p>So you could output the config value directly into your index.rst master doc.</p>
