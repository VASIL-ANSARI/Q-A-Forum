<p>No, a python dictionary has an ordering for the keys but does not guarantee what that order will be or how it is calculated.<br>
Which is why they are not guaranteed to be ordered in the first place.<br>
The values stored in the dictionary do not have an effect on the hash values of the keys and so will not change ordering.</p>

<p>Taken from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow">Python Documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The keys() method of a dictionary object returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in arbitrary order</strong> (if you want it sorted, just apply the sorted() function to it). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the in keyword.</p>
