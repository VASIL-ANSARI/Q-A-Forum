<p>You can copy the DB from the device to your machine. I use <a href="http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/" rel="nofollow">iExplorer</a> to do this.  The best way to view/edit the DB from there is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/base/id402383384?mt=12" rel="nofollow">Base</a>, but Firefox has a FREE plugin called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/" rel="nofollow">SQLite Manager</a>.</p>
