<p>I don't think it's safe to call CFRelease.<br>
displayedPerson is defined as follows in the header.<br>
So, displayedPerson is just assigned and not copied or retained when we set the value.<br>
Therefore, I think we can't release it.</p>

<pre><code>@property(nonatomic, readwrite) ABRecordRef displayedPerson
</code></pre>
