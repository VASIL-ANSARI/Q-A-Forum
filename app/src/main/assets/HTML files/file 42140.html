<p>I think that the concept is different, while your <code>Promo</code> class inherit from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> then all child classes inherit its attributes, so, the column names are shared in all the STI. but you still can set the column <code>image_filename</code> as null in the DB and validate it in your models, so you will be able to store and update the record based in your case with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Promo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  #Common validations
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :user, presence: true
end

class Event &lt; Promo
  #event related validations
  validates image_filename, presence: true
end

class Discount &lt; Promo
  #discount related validations
  validates percentage, presence: true
end
</code></pre>
