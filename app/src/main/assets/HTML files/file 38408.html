<p>You have declared <code>bar</code> in <code>Foo</code> but you haven't provided a definition for it. You need to add the following to your code.</p>

<pre><code>int Foo::bar;
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like to initialize it with a specific value (say 42) you can do</p>

<pre><code>int Foo::bar = 42;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason you only get a linker error for <code>Project1</code> is because neither the static library nor <code>Project2</code> actually <em>access</em> <code>Foo::bar</code> so there are no references to it for the linker to resolve.</p>
