<p>Same as C, you would do</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
...
srand(time(NULL));
int r = rand() % 74;
</code></pre>

<p>(assuming you meant including 0 but excluding 74, which is what your Java example does)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Feel free to substitute <code>random()</code> or <code>arc4random()</code> for <code>rand()</code> (which is, as others have pointed out, quite sucky).</p>
