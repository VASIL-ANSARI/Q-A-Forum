<p>I would suppose that the framework is not directly intended for the task you are thinking of. For me at least it looks that its simply used for managing mobile workers. i.e. you have your Admin's assigning location specific tasks, and then you have workers handling them.</p>

<p>So, if you want to use the framework for just monitoring some users locations without any additional communications needed, then I would suggest searching for other platform which would be build to suit that need.</p>

<p>In case you would want to use the coordinate still, then do check whether you could extract the location data of the workers, and then have your own map control in which you would then show your employees to your client. Or check whether the framework actually already supports having such a more limited views. Good starting point would be the <a href="https://support.google.com/coordinate/" rel="nofollow">Help center</a>.</p>

<p>Of course you could also make a simple application which sends coordinates &amp; ID to the central server, and in server side you would then have a database storing the locations so they could be shown in a map. This approach would allow you to use other devices than the iOS &amp; Android ones supported by the Google Coordinate.</p>
