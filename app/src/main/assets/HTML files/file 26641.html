<p>The application puts a d around the data because there is a security vulnerability from passing an array directly to the client.  See this <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx" rel="nofollow">resource for more information</a> on why.  That's why the application framework does it.  I think a lot of other serializers require the same...</p>

<p>Your only alternative is to serialize each object, and manually write out the array of objects.  But again, beware of the vulnerability with doing that.</p>
