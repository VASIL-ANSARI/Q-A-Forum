<p>Create a folder in your project and call it i.e. 'resources' and put your image in that folder. This will ensure that given image is on your classpath and can be easily accessed. </p>

<p>Then you can just do :</p>

<pre><code>new ImageIcon("resources/card.jgp")
</code></pre>

<p>Problem with accessing outside resources is that special characters needs to be escaped and also if you export the project and give it to someone else, he/she will not have the image required by software ;) </p>
