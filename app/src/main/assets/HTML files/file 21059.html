<p>Cross Domain Request should be accomplished using JSONP. JSONP stands for <em>JSON with Padding</em>. I'll try to explain it here a little.</p>

<p>How do you want to fetch data (script when we talk about JSON) from server? You have two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>An ajax request, which is done behind the scene using an instance of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object, and which is limited to be sent only to the same domain,</li>
<li>A simple HTTP Get request, which is done via inserting a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag somewhere in the HTML document, mostly in the head section.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second technique is not limited to Cross-Domain Policy. However, let's examine how browser works as our agent in these two scenarios:</p>

<p>ajax scenario: developer code => browser => request => server => response => browser => developer code. This means that when you use ajax, browser on behalf of you creates an HTTP Request (with <code>X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest</code> header field) and sends it to the server, then it gets the response base, *<em>but it gives you the response back</em>, so that as the developer, you have the opportunity to analyse response and do whatever you want to do with it.</p>

<p>HTTP Get scenario: developer code => script tag in head => browser => request => server => response => browser => response execution.</p>

<p>See? When you use JSONP, or when you insert in simple <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in head, browser gets the script back from the server, but it runs script and that's the end. You haven't been hooked into the response, and you don't have control over it. Thus, you need to provide a <code>callback</code> function for it. <code>callback({})</code> differs from <code>{}</code> in point that when it gets executed, it gives you the opportunity to get the result and do something with it.</p>
