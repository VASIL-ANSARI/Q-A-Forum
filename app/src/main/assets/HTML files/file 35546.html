<p>Something like this should give you the list of ones you want to flag, from this you could create the update...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT [A].[name], [A].[Age], iif([A].[Group] =1,2,[A].[Group]) gp, count(*)
FROM Raw_table A
WHERE Age is not null and age &lt;&gt; ""
Group by [A].[name], [A].[Age], iif([A].[Group] =1,2,[A].[Group])
having count(*) &gt; 1 
</code></pre>

<p>--Update to to show... update statement... hate those double words.
--There's a better way to do this but w/o Access... it's hard for me to figure out the right syntax.</p>

<p>--USING &amp; to contat I can't remember if Access uses + or &amp;
--whereclause needed or you get your blank ages set to true...</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE tblTest set SET A.Flag = "True"
WHERE Name&amp;Age in (SELECT Name&amp;Age
FROM tblTest
WHERE age is not null and age &lt;&gt; ""
GROUP BY Name&amp;Age
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1)
</code></pre>
