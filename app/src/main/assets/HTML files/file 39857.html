<p>You could use <code>:nth-child()</code> selector in css to select the checkbox you want.</p>

<p>So maybe something like this to select the second checkbox:
<code>tr:nth-child(2) table input { }</code></p>

<p>Not sure it the above css works but, you can use <code>:nth-child()</code> to select the <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> you want from the parent table then from there you can select the input box in the child table.</p>
