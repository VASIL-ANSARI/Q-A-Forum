<p>You have created a Serial Dispatch Queue, but it doesn't mean that there should be a thread attached to the queue, the system manager the background thread and it will provide a thread to some queue to execute the code you push to the queue.</p>

<p>The Serial Dispatch Queue guarantee the works you push to it is executed one by one but it doesn't guarantee the thread which do the work is the same.</p>

<p>So you face the same problem when using Global Concurrent Dispatch Queues.</p>
