<p>The folllowing seems to be the way to go:
First we create a  couple of views so to make the actual select query easier to comprehend</p>

<p>This first view represents rows that are already completely filled - meaning that all 5 numbers have also been called.</p>

<pre><code>create or replace view filled as
select 
    r.ticket_id, f.ticket_row_id, 0 path_distance
from 
    ticket_row_field f
    inner join ticket_row r
        on r.id = f.ticket_row_id
    inner join ticket t
        on t.id = r.ticket_id
    inner join called_number n
        on n.called_number = f.content
group by ticket_row_id
having count(*) = 5;
</code></pre>

<p>The other view represents rows that are not completely filled</p>

<pre><code>create or replace view incomplete as
        select 
            r.ticket_id, f.ticket_row_id,
                coalesce(filled.path_distance, count(content)) path_distance,
                case when 
                    filled.path_distance is not null then 
                    '' else 
                    group_concat(content order by content) 
                end path
        from 
            ticket t
            inner join ticket_row r
                on r.ticket_id = t.id
            inner join ticket_row_field f
                on f.ticket_row_id = r.id
            left join called_number n
                on n.game_id = t.game_id
                and n.called_number = f.content
            left join filled
                on filled.ticket_row_id = f.ticket_row_id
        where 
            n.called_number is null or filled.ticket_row_id is not null
        group by 
            ticket_row_id;
</code></pre>

<p>Then we use the following select query to get the tickets we need, including their path (= the missing numbers)</p>

<pre><code>select 
    r1.ticket_id, r1.path_distance + r2.path_distance distance_sum, concat(r1.path, ',', r2.path) path_combined
from 
    incomplete r1
        inner join incomplete r2
            on r2.ticket_id = r1.ticket_id
where 
    r2.ticket_row_id &lt; r1.ticket_row_id
order by 
    distance_sum
limit 5;
</code></pre>
