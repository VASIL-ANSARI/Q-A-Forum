<p>The physical implementation could use a log table that is range partitioned by date. Can use a rolling window where the old partitions are archived off or summarized into some kind of summary table. Table access can be transparent to the app, but access with date prunes the query to the appropriate partition (searches on the single partition being more efficient than on the entire table).</p>

<p>Also, since log data only enters the current partition, older partitions can be put into a "read only" state. Depending on the rdbms, this can have advantages such as only needing to be backed up once and excluded for future backups, being able to swap in and out on the file level, etc.</p>
