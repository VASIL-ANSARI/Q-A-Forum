<p>This depends largely on the version of SQL Server you are using. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1690892/transactionscope-automatically-escalating-to-msdtc-on-some-machines">here</a> for anothe SO question addressing a similar issue.</p>

<p>Its to do with how SQL 2005 and SQL 2008 differ in handling multiple connections within the same <code>TransactionScope</code>. i.e. SQL 2008 can open multiple connections in the same <code>TransactionScope</code> without escalating to the MSDTC.</p>

<p>Could this be the issue you are seeing</p>

<p>If this is the case, I think the only two options are upgrade to SQL 2008 or enable the MSDTC. I understand that both of these options are probably massive headaches.</p>
