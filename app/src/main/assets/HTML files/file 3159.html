<p>The first way serializes the object to the MemoryStream which results in the MemoryStream being positioned at the end of the bytes written. From there you read all bytes to the end into the byte array: none (because the MemoryStream is already at the end).</p>

<p>You can move the position within the MemoryStream to the start before reading from it:</p>

<pre><code>ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
</code></pre>

<p>But the code then does exactly the same as the second way: create a new byte array of ms.Length length, and copy all bytes from the stream to the byte array. So why reinvent the wheel?</p>

<p>Note that the second way doesn't require the Seek as ToArray always copies all bytes, independent of the position of the MemoryStream.</p>
