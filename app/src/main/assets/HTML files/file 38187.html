<p>Create a wrapper class which holds both the user friendly name and the "type" (i.e. the type name) and use a custom array adapter to map it. </p>

<p>It's a little more involved than simply creating a ready built adapter but it's a good idea to learn how to do this as early as you can since you'll most of the time be creating custom lists with more than one string in them which will require custom adapters and custom views.</p>

<p>This looks to be a good example:

<p>If anything is unclear, let me know and I'll try to help further.</p>
