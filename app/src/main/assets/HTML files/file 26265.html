<p>I'm going option D.</p>

<p>Static members are resolved at compile time using the <em>declared</em> type, not the <em>actual</em> type. </p>

<p>That's why <code>((Base)s).FOO)</code> refers to <code>Base.FOO</code> - even though the object is a <code>Sub</code>.</p>

<p>This would also occur, and is better illustrated, in the following:</p>

<pre><code>Base b = new Sub(); // valid
System.out.print(b.FOO); // foo
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>b.FOO</code> refers to <code>Base.FOO</code> because of the <em>declared</em> type, even though the instance is a <code>Sub</code>. </p>
