<p>It doesn't have to do with the fact that it is 64 bit, you need to alter the DB to allow it.  Try this:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER DATABASE YOURDATABASEHERE
SET TRUSTWORTHY ON;
GO
</code></pre>

<p>if that alone doesn't work, you can try these options as well</p>

<pre><code>USE YOURDATABASEHERE
GO
sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
GO
RECONFIGURE;
GO
sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1;
GO
RECONFIGURE;
GO 
</code></pre>
