<p>If you want the "Button Row" on top of the layout simply add at the LinearLayout:</p>

<pre><code>android:layout_gravity="bottom"
</code></pre>

<p>For default the views added to FrameLayout stacks.</p>

<p>Seeing your layout I noticed too that all the buttons has the visibility to GONE. To chech if the row is on top of the surfaceView add a background to the Button row LinearLayout.</p>
