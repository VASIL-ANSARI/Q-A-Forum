<p>Have your server issue an HTTP 301 status with a Location header redirecting to the HTTPS site.</p>

<p>You can do this at the PHP level with the <code>header</code> function, but I'd do it at the web server level. In Apache HTTPD (you didn't specify your server) that just requires <code>Redirect 301 / https://example.com/</code> in the virtual host configuration for the port 80 HTTP site.</p>

<p>(NB: The Apache Redirect directive will maintain the rest of the URI, so <code>http://example.com/foo</code> will redirect to <code>https://example.com/foo</code> and so on)</p>
