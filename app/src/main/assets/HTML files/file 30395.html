<p>I believe this will generate the <code>MPMoviePlayerScalingModeDidChangeNotification</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self 
                selector:@selector(movieScalingModeDidChange:) 
                name:MPMoviePlayerScalingModeDidChangeNotification 
                object:nil];
</code></pre>
