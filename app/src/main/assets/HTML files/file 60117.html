<p>Here : <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-is-static-and-dynamic-binding-in.html" rel="nofollow">Link</a></p>

<p>Few important difference between static and dynamic binding</p>

<p>1) Static binding in Java occurs during Compile time while Dynamic binding occurs during Runtime.</p>

<p>2) private, final and static methods and variables uses static binding and bonded by compiler while virtual methods are bonded during runtime based upon runtime object.</p>

<p>3) Static binding uses Type(Class in Java) information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Object to resolve binding.</p>

<p>3) Overloaded methods are bonded using static binding while overridden methods are bonded using dynamic binding at runtime.</p>

<p><strong>Static Binding Example in Java</strong></p>

<pre><code> public class StaticBindingTest  
 {  
  public static void main(String args[])  
  {
    Collection c = new HashSet();
    StaticBindingTest et = new StaticBindingTest();
    et.sort(c);
  }
  //overloaded method takes Collection argument
  public Collection sort(Collection c)
  {
     System.out.println("Inside Collection sort method");
     return c;
  }
  //another overloaded method which takes HashSet argument which is sub class
 public Collection sort(HashSet hs)
 {
    System.out.println("Inside HashSet sort method");
    return hs;
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output: Inside Collection sort method</p>

<p><strong>Example of Dynamic Binding in Java</strong></p>

<pre><code> public class DynamicBindingTest 
 {
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Car(); //here Type is vehicle but object will be Car
        vehicle.start();       //Car's start called because start() is  overridden method
    }
 }

 class Vehicle 
 {
     public void start() 
     {
       System.out.println("Inside start method of Vehicle");
     }
 }
 class Car extends Vehicle 
 {
    @Override
    public void start() 
    {
       System.out.println("Inside start method of Car");
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Output: Inside start method of Car</p>
