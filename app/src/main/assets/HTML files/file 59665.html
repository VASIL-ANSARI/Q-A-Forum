<p>You will want to set your Graphic2D's RenderingHints to handle aliasing. This smooths out the jaggies that may be causing your (small) circle to render as a square. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;
g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);
</code></pre>
