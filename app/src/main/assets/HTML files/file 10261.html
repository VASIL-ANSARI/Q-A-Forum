<p>As you are trying to do something a bit more custom that doesn't seem to be fitting in with the default Backbone behaviour I would suggest you either override the Sync() function within your model or define a different function where you can define your own Ajax call.</p>

<p>I tend to think of Backbone model functions as a set of sensible defaults that can be overridden when needed rather than a set of functions you must live with.</p>
