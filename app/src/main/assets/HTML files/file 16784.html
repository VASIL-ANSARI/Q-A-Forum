<p>The advantage and problem with carrierwave_direct is that your file is stored on s3 and s3 only. Carrierwave_direct have some functions to process files uploaded to s3 but all of them first download the file to your server, process it and then reupload it to s3 so all processing is done on your host. </p>

<p>If you need to do some processing like that of yours, carrierwave_direct won't help you with that. </p>

<p>One solution would be to spawn virtual machine on amazon just to process your files. Im not sure how transfer between s3 and ec2 is billed but, it won't be more then transfer back to heroku. </p>
