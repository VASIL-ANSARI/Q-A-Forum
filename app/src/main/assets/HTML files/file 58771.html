<p>The concept is as a matter of fact indeed  baffling , but ones you understand the actual flow, it would remain clear throughout.</p>

<p>The actual order of execution is ..<strong>Compile -> Controller -> Pre-Link -> Post-Link</strong></p>

<p>For further understanding, just go through this <a href="https://www.undefinednull.com/2014/07/07/practical-guide-to-prelink-postlink-and-controller-methods-of-angular-directives/" rel="nofollow">article</a>, it surely helped me.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
