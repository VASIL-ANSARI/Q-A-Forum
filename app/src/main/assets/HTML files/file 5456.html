<p><strong>(4)</strong> is not an option.  The implicitly declared copy assignment operator assigns each member of the right-hand side object to the same member of the left-hand side object.  </p>

<p>The compiler can't implicitly generate a copy assignment operator for a class that has const-qualified data members for the same reason that this is invalid:</p>

<pre><code>const int i = 1;
i = 2;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> is problematic since you have to overcome this same issue somehow.</p>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> is the obvious solution; if your class type has const-qualified data members, it is not assignable and assignment doesn't make much sense.  Why do you say that this is not a solution?</p>

<hr>

<p>If you don't want your class type to be assignable then you can't use it in a container that requires that its value type is assignable.  All of the C++ standard library containers have this requirement.</p>
