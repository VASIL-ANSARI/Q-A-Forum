<p>I think is not so easy to correctly load both libraries each in its way, because both are asynchronous in a different way.
Instead, is easier to let one load the other.</p>

<p>The first and simplier approach is to put the client.js lib at the end of all scripts, and then do a manual Angular bootstrap when the Google library is fully loaded.</p>

<p>Other method could be the opposite, so let Angular create the Google client.js script tag and load the library.</p>

<p>Check this project: <a href="https://github.com/canemacchina/angular-google-client" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/canemacchina/angular-google-client</a>
I've create this library to help me using Google client library in Angular, and it use the second method...</p>
