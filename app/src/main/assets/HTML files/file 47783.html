<p>The documentation on MSDN appears to be out of date.</p>

<p>In 1.1 of the Application Insights SDK (the latest, which I'm assuming you are using), has <code>TelemetryContext</code> in this namespace: <code>Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts</code> (note DataContracts not just Contracts). I used Resharper to let it find the <code>TelemetryContext</code> class and it found it in this namespace in the core package (Microsoft.ApplicationInsights).</p>

<p>The SDK release notes do not mention anything specifically about this namespace moving however, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-release-notes-dotnet/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-release-notes-dotnet/</a>.</p>
