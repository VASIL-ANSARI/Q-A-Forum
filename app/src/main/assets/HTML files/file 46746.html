<p>This is up to the window manager to add such effect.</p>

<p>For example, KWin and Mutter both have their way to handle dialogs. KWin does shade the main window, and I think Mutter does it too with some additional effect.</p>

<p>In Mac OS, modal window are already have special properties to put it in focus on relation of it's patent window.</p>

<p>The way windows handle this is by forcing the focus on the modal I think. But it really is the window manager's job, and up to the user's preference to choose what effect should be active.</p>
