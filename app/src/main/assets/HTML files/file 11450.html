<p>The problem is that you can only access Objective-C objects by reference through pointers, like this:</p>

<pre><code>UIColor *color;
</code></pre>

<p>you can't have a "bare" object, like this:</p>

<pre><code>UIColor color;
</code></pre>

<p>So the solution is to insert the asterisk in your code (which you probably meant to do, and the bug is just a typo).</p>
