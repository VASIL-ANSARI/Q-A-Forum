<p>The key insight for this question is that a char is actually an 8-bit number. For instance, 'a' is 97 in decimal, 'z' is 122, 'A' is 65, and 'Z' is 90:</p>

<p>All the alphabet characters are represented sequentially. Because a char is actually a number, you can use it in an arithmetic expression, like so:</p>

<pre><code> int num = 'd' - 'a'; //num is now (100 - 97), which is 3.
</code></pre>

<p>This should be enough information to figure out what they want you to do in that problem.</p>
