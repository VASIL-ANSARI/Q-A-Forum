<p>You will probably need to retain your statuses</p>

<pre><code>statuses = [[parser objectWithString:json_string error:nil] retain];
</code></pre>

<p>The JSON parser will return an autoreleased object :)</p>

<hr>

<p>As Dan points out in the comments the better way of doing this is to set the property like this :</p>

<pre><code>self.statuses = [parser objectWithString:json_string error:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>This has the advantage of not leaking memory if you set it twice and you can use KVO ot tell if it's changed. Much better :)</p>
