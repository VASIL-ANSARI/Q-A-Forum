<p>Consider using <a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git-history/v12.0/javadoc/com/google/common/cache/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">Guava's cache</a> package.  If you look at <a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git-history/v12.0/javadoc/com/google/common/cache/CacheBuilder.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CacheBuilder</code></a>, it includes most of the features you specify.  I don't know about ordering preservation (why do you want that?)  </p>

<p>The underlying collection (can't tell from your question/title if you're looking for a complete cache implementation or a collection that would support it) is probably <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html?is-external=true" rel="nofollow">ConcurrentHashMap</a>.</p>
