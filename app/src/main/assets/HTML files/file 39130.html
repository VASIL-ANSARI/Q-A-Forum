<p>Here's a way to do it with conditional comments. I don't know how your fonts and other styles are organized, but you'll probably want to use</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--[if IE 9]&gt;
    stylesheet using internally served fonts
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and maybe</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--[if !IE]&gt; --&gt;
    stylesheet using CDN
&lt;!-- &lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The latter will apply not only to non-IE browsers but also to IE10 and up, but you might only need to use the former.</p>

<p>To answer your first question, I prefer using fonts from my own servers when in production. Cuts down on the number of moving parts and means that my site doesn't rely on another site.</p>
