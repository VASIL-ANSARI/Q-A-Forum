<p>Is your supervisor familiar with a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/BitSet.html"><code>BitSet</code></a>?  128 bits is 16 bytes, which could be stored as 2 <code>longs</code>.  However, using a BitSet, you won't need to worry about dealing with the combination of 2 <code>longs</code>.  BitSet also provides methods for all the common bit operations.  I think you'd be pretty hard-pressed to find a better solution than this.</p>

<p>The polynomial approach is a pretty cool idea, but I think it's more theoretical than practical.</p>
