<p>No, not directly. The only metadata that the file has left is its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_header" rel="nofollow">ELF headers</a>, which do not include the name of the .c file it was compiled from. It would be problematic if they did: what if it came from multiple .c files? Would it include paths to binaries on the system that it was linked against? What would happen if you renamed the .c files? Would renaming a .c file need to trigger a recompilation?</p>

<p>That aside, there are a number of ways you could figure it out: run the executable and compare it against the .c files, or try compiling each of the .c files and comparing the two executables (assuming you know what flags the executable was compiled with). </p>
