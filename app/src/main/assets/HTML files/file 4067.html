<p>Subprocesses can be pretty awesome, but I guess you are looking for something like <a href="http://www.pango.org/" rel="nofollow">pango</a> or the font rendering engine in Qt. It looks like you can achieve everything you need with <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qpainter.html#drawText-10" rel="nofollow">QPainter::drawText(...)</a>. See also <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qfont.html" rel="nofollow">QFont</a>.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that I have dragged in Qt specifically for font rendering before, without using it for anything else. It needs you to create a <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qcoreapplication.html" rel="nofollow">QCoreApplication</a>-object, but that's it. Works like a charm :)</p>
