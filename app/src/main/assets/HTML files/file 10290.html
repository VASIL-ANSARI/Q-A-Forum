<p>It's the same likelihood of one <code>random.getrandbits(20)</code> colliding with another since the outer functions are deterministic.</p>

<p>If the output of <code>random.getrandbits</code> are in fact, random -- the chance of one colliding with another is 1/(2^20) or ... about <strong><em>1 in a million</em></strong></p>

<p>For n entries, the chance that an additional entry (entry n+1) collides is n/(2^20).  So the probability grows linearly with the number of entries in the dictionary.  At 1,048,576 entries, it is guaranteed that the next entry will collide.</p>
