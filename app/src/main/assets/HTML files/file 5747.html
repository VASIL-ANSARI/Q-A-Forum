<p>I'm not sure, but it may be choking on your public serializable list of pictures.  Just for testing, I would try adding the following immediately above this one <strong>property</strong> on your class</p>

<p>[DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden)]</p>

<p>I believe if you make it hidden, it won't make it an editable value from the properties sheet, and thus not actually try to write the object's serialization content.</p>
