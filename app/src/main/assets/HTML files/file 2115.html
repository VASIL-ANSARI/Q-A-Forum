<p>From the <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/3.1-problems.html">BeautifulSoup documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Version 3.1.0 of Beautiful Soup does significantly worse on real-world HTML than version 3.0.8 does</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it might help you to use this earlier version. That is precisely what the author himself recommends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can pretend that Beautiful Soup version 3.1.0 was never released. Version 3.0.8 still works fine on Python 2.3 through 2.6.</p>
