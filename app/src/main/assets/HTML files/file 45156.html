  <p>I try to add a mouslistener to each object so that they can each have their own MouseEvent.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; handler.gameObjects.size(); i++)
{
    GameObjects temp = handler.gameObjects.get(i);
    this.addMouseListener(new MouseInput(temp));
}
</code></pre>

<p>That code is adding the MouseListener to the same object, not a different object. Instead I would guess the code should be:</p>

<pre><code>//this.addMouseListener(new MouseInput(temp));
temp.addMouseListener(new MouseInput(temp));
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>so when it is clicked on it returns a unique ID for each object. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to know which object was clicked you can get that information from the MouseEvent:</p>

<pre><code>GameObjects temp = (GameObjects)e.getSource();
</code></pre>
