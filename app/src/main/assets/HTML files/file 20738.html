<p>See <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.execute.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.store-result.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <code>mysqli_stmt::execute()</code> by default stores the results server side and fetches row by row unless you call <code>mysqli_stmt::store_result()</code> to buffer them client side. Attempting to prepare another statement most likely fails while there are unfetched reults server side from a previous statement.</p>
