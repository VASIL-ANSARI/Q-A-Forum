<p>I use the following generic method to move ckeditor contents back into the text area they were attached to:</p>

<pre><code>   var $editors = $("textarea.editor");
   if ($editors.length) {
       $editors.each(function () {
           var instance = CKEDITOR.instances[this.id];
           if (instance) { $(this).val(instance.getData()); }
       });
   }
</code></pre>

<p>If your situation is simpler there is no need for the loop.</p>

<p>There is also the jquery helper that is handy for this sort of thing.</p>
