<p>Your <code>while</code> loop doesn't seem to be related to your design. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(0,10):
    try:
        x = my_get_fuction
    except:
        print "error"
        print i
        time.sleep(100)
        continue
    break
print x
</code></pre>

<p>This code will loop a maximum of 10 times, sleeping each time for 100s. If the assigned <code>x = my_get_function</code> doesn't complete by 1000s or so, then the loop gives up.</p>
