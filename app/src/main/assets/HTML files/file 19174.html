<p>The easiest solution is to rename the folder from <code>app</code> to <code>App</code> and set</p>

<pre><code>"psr-0": { "App": "." }
</code></pre>

<p>I guess else you need a custom autoloader. However, I recommend to follow some proven use-cases:</p>

<pre><code>src/App/App.php
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>"psr-0": { "App": "src" }
</code></pre>

<p>Looks curious, but I must say, that I would never call a namespace or class (or even both) just <code>App</code> ;) It doesn't say anything and with aliasing (<code>use MyApplication as App</code>) there is no reason anymore to write as short identifiers as possible.</p>
