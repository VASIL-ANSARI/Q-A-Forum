<p>My understanding is that Android's notification system has a limited height per notification in order to avoid a single notification filling up the screen.</p>

<p>From the page you linked: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caution: When you use a custom notification layout, take special care to ensure that your custom layout works with different device orientations and resolutions. While this advice applies to all View layouts, it's especially important for notifications because the space in the notification drawer is <strong>very restricted</strong>. Don't make your custom layout too complex, and be sure to test it in various configurations.</p>

<p>You can, however, display multiple notifications, 'sticky' notifications or perhaps scrolling text inside the notification.</p>
