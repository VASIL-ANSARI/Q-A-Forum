<p>Use <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstring/memset/" rel="nofollow">memset</a> instead. This would just nullify the buffer but the memory allocated would any how gets deallocated from stack when the variable goes out of scope.</p>

<pre><code>memset (name,'\0',sizeof(name));
</code></pre>
