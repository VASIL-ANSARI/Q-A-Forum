<p>The Gateway is typically used for communication between physical sites over HTTP.  Since you are exposing an endpoint to the world to accept callbacks, I'm thinking you could just use the built-in WCF hosting and expose your endpoint through the firewall to 3rd parties.  The rest of your setup sounds appropriate to me.  </p>

<p>As for errors, you are correct, NSB retries immediately, but if you using web call backs this may get you by in the cases there are small hiccups.  You will need to determine how you want to process the error queues, we just build in a new endpoint to process the error queues with logic to determine the retries, delay etc.  A nice way to accomplish this is to use a Saga, which includes a Timeout manager.  This enables a workflow where you can retry a specified number of times, try another communication, log everything, and ultimately notify someone who can contact the 3rd party to let them know there stuff is busted.</p>
