<p>Hard to say for sure since I don't have access to IE7 at the moment, but you might want to look into setting the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_pos_z-index.asp" rel="nofollow">z-index</a> of the input or its container.</p>

<p>Also, when I looked at your HTML it looked like something was malformed because I saw the attribute "value" without a value.  Double check all the HTML is correct.</p>
