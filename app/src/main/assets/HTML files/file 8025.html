<p>You seem to be basing all of your calculations off of the row of the picker. If you want to do this such that picker row 1 of lbs is the same weight as picker row 1 of kg, then you will have no choice but to have it like this.  A better solution is to make the wheel go from 0 â 300 without labels. Put the label somewhere else (perhaps as a second picker wheel next to it or a switch somewhere). Then you can get the value for the weight and the value for the units and do the right thing.</p>

<p>Better yet, you can determine the locale for the user and set the units automatically for them.</p>
