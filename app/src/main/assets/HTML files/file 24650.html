<p>You could subclass the listview and do it yourself. </p>

<p>Or, you can tag certain rows as subrows of the one above it using <code>.Tag = IndexOfPreviousRow</code> and track the relationships in a model. It's kinda hacky, though. </p>

<p>As far as doing it natively with the .NET listview, I don't believe you can. </p>
