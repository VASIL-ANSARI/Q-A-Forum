<p>Each "day_id" would be in it's own <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/or/" rel="nofollow"><strong><code>$or</code></strong></a> argument:</p>

<pre><code>$query = array(
    'proc_id' = &gt; $xxx,
    '$or' =&gt; array(
        array( 'day_id' =&gt; array ( '$lt' =&gt; $day ) ),
        array( 'day_id' =&gt; array ( '$gt' =&gt; $anotherDay ) ),
    )
)
</code></pre>

<p>That is how <code>$or</code> conditions work as a "list" of possible expressions.</p>

<p>The JSON syntax is clearer to visualise:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "proc_id": $xxx,
    "$or": [
        { "day_id": { "$lt": $day } },
        { "day_id": { "$gt": $anotherDay }}
    ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since there is a very clear distinction between a "list" and an "object" definition. <code>$or</code> conditions are "lists" of "objects", and that means you list the full condition just as if it were a query in itself. Since this is not called within an <code>$elemMatch</code>.</p>

<p>And of course the "DELETE" part is the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mongocollection.remove.php" rel="nofollow"><strong><code>.remove()</code></strong></a> method:</p>

<pre><code>$collection-&gt;remove($query)
</code></pre>

<p>There are general examples and resources in the core documentation <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/sql-comparison/" rel="nofollow">SQL to MongoDB Mapping Chart</a>, where if the examples there do not immediately help, the linked articles and presentations should.</p>
