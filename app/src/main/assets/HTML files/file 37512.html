<pre><code>VAR = "C_program '$@'"

<p>doesn't do what you want. And your <code>mv</code> line is broken too.</p>

<pre><code>VAR=$(C_program "$@")
mv "$1" "$VAR"
</code></pre>

<p>Also, your C program doesn't exit with an error when an error is detected.</p>

<p>Also, <code>sed</code> and <code>tr</code> are existing programs that are suitable alternatives to writing your C program to transliterate (<em>translate</em>) characters in strings.</p>

<p>Also, <code>rename</code>/<code>prename</code> are existing (Perl) programs that handle rename files with regular expression pattern functionality to rename files, which may be already available on your system(s).</p>
