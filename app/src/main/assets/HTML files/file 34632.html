<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://source.roslyn.codeplex.com/#CompilerPackage/CompilerPackage.cs#910828e3cf38ae5d">CompilerPackage sources</a> to see how we install the compiler on your machine when you install the preview VSIX. The trick is we drop some MSBuild files in <code>AppData\Local\Microsoft\MSBuild\12.0\&lt;target name&gt;\ImportAfter</code>. These files are loaded automatically in any C# or VB.NET build.  In them, we change the corresponding <code>CscToolPath</code> or <code>VbcToolPath</code> to a path that contains the Roslyn compilers. There's also some additional trickery to deal with multiple hives in the scenario if you had different versions of the compilers installed in different experimental hives in VS.</p>

<p>So if you take a look at that, create those same .target files and edit them to point to some place where you've dropped <code>rcsc</code> and <code>rvbc</code>, it should work.</p>
