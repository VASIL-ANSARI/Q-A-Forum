<p>You can return the value :</p>

<pre><code>//Modify you function so it will return the result
function addition() {
    return $GLOBALS['z'] = $GLOBALS['x'] + $GLOBALS['y'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then :</p>

<pre><code>//Catch variable and echo
echo $z = addition();
</code></pre>

<p>I hope it's what you want, because your question is not clear.
Moreover, you 'll have error if <code>$opType</code> is different than <code>anand</code> because function 'll be called but it 'll not exist.</p>

<p>It should be better to declare it in any case and not only if <code>$opType === 'anand'</code>.</p>
