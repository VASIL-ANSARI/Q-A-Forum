<p>I had the same issue and it turned out that adb was crashing. In my case the cause for the crash was a permission error. Try deleting the file <code>/tmp/adb.log</code> before running the job. Please see this thread for more information: <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/237636/is-it-possible-to-fake-a-specific-path-for-a-process">Is it possible to fake a specific path for a process?</a></p>

<p>You could also add the <code>-verbose</code> option to the emulator to see more output that might help.</p>
