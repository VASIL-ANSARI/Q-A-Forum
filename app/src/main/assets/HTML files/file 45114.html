  <p>Is it possible to pass a callback function to page-mod::PageMod (not as a String or a URL to another JavaScript file)? If not, can it be done using the lower level API?</p>

<p>No, everything that goes through the port is serialized using JSON serialization (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Guides/Content_Scripts/port#emit%28%29" rel="nofollow">See docs</a>). Instead you would probably emit an event from your content script to execute the callback method with parameters you pass it in the module scope and hardcode parts that need to be done in the content script with port event listeners.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to actually redirect a page in a tab into another page only using high level APIs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Totally, if you're in a content script, you can just set window.location, or in your modules you set the location of a tab, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/tabs#url" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/High-Level_APIs/tabs#url</a>.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to remember the original destination's location (with the request method and contents) and call it in the process of page-mod::PageMod (in order to re-redirect out of the authorization page)? If not, can it be done using the lower level API?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possible? Yes, depends a lot on how the redirection from the W-LAN works. Generally all the SDK offers you is getting load/ready events for tabs and reading a tab's current URL. So if you get a ready event at the point of the redirect you're fine. If your college login remembers the redirect target using a get parameter in the URL you're fine. If your college doesn't adjust the URL, you're fine. If you really need to dig through the request, you'll have to ge a bit deeper than even what the SDK offers you, but it is possible.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to perform the addon's redirection function on inactive (background) tabs where the opened webpages automatically keep connecting to the Internet and get redirected to the authorization page?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JS execution for Add-ons is not paused based on a tabs state.</p>
