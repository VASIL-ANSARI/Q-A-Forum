<p>If you want to keep a valid image in the cache, you should not do the <code>image.Dispose()</code> call. This will basically release unmanaged GDI+ resources, but keep the image reference in the cache, and GDI+ will not be happy on the next call.</p>

<p>Do the Dispose call only prior to removing it from the cache (if ever you need to remove it from the cache) or at expiration time only.</p>
