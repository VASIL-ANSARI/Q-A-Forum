<p>You are getting that error because its failing on <code>expect</code> method. <code>expect</code> method is expecting a spy to be passed in but its not. To fix this problem do:</p>

<pre><code>var text = new String("sometext");
</code></pre>

<p>Your test case will still fail because you are not calling the match method anywhere. If you want it to pass, then you would need to call text.match(/WHATEVER REGEX/) inside the <code>it</code> function.</p>
