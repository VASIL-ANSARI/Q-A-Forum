<p>MySQL collations apply only to contents of columns in the database. They are not a factor in your problem.</p>

<p>Column names, index names, etc, are all case-insensitive.</p>

<p>On Windows and Mac HFS, table names, like file names, are case-insensitive. On Linux / BSD / Unix, they, like file names, are case sensitive.</p>

<p>There are lots of things you can do to monkey around with all this.  See here.</p>

<p>If your MySQL database runs on a Windows (or Mac HFS) platform, you probably should do nothing. If it's on a *nix box, you might consider renaming the tables so they have the same case as your query code.</p>

<pre><code> RENAME `TABLENAME` TO `tablename`
</code></pre>

<p>Or, you can consider setting <code>lower_case_table_names=1</code>, renaming all your tables so they have lowercase names, and going from there.  That probably gives you the most resilient coding environment to use your database: it will make your table names in your code case-insensitive.  Of course if you have two different tables named <code>tablecase</code> and <code>TABLECASE</code> this won't work.  </p>
