<p>Because it is as efficient as using a heavy truck to move a single small box... If you want to send a box or move your from your home, you almost all the time ask someone else to do it. And when you are hungry, I'm pretty sure that you never ask for all the food available at the restaurant.</p>

<p>Ok you can allocate as many memory as you can in one allocation, but now : how would you manage this huge chunk? You will certainly have needs such like using this part as an integer, this one to store a given structure, etc. And this will lead you to implement some kind of memory management by yourself. I'm sure that you wouldn't like to do so.</p>

<p>You also have to think about resource sharing, if you consume all is possibly available but more than what you need, some others will be in starvation.</p>

<p>Your scenario of putting in memory the whole content of a very very huge file is almost not realistic, there is almost no need for such a thing. Anyway, if you really need this you will probably use a memory mapped file not such a "reading-storing" algorithm.</p>
