<p>I'm not sure I completely understand what you are asking.
If you are asking what syntax to use when performing an update with an inner join.</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE      tableAlias
SET         Column = Value
FROM        table1 as tableAlias
INNER JOIN  table2 as table2Alias on tableAlias.key = table2Alias.key
</code></pre>
