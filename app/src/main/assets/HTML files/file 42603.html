<p>If you always load the image to position <code>(0,0)</code>, then you can set the size of the canvas to the size of the loaded image by adding </p>

<pre><code>  canvas.width = img.width;
  canvas.height = img.height;
  ctx=canvas.getContext("2d");
</code></pre>

<p>to the very beginning of your <code>start()</code> function. The first two lines resize the canvas. After resizing the context has to be updated to make it work properly.</p>
