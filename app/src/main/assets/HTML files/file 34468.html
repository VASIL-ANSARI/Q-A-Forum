<p>First, please try the same exact code with 1.7-SNAPSHOT. It should be faster.</p>

<p>Then in 1.7-SNAPSHOT we just added the ability to delete vertices from a sub-query. This is because why browsing all the Work when you could delete all the incoming vertex from the Status vertex "Not Started"?</p>

<p>So if you've 1.7-SNAPSHOT change this query from:</p>

<pre><code>delete vertex Work where out('status') contains (work-state = 'Not Started')
</code></pre>

<p>to (assuming the status vertex is called "State"):</p>

<pre><code>delete vertex from (select in('status') from State where work-state = 'Not Started')
</code></pre>
