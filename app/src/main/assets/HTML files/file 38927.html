<p>I'd love to see this, too. Unfortunately this could only be done in Javascript - not in PHP. Probably it would be possible to use picturefill.js as a Galleria plugin but unfortunately I don't know enough Javascript to do this. 
Explanation: Galleria dynamically looks for the image referenced and shows that one. Something is needed to tell Galleria to use a different image source (depending on the screen size e.g.). To do this the method that picturefill.js uses (replacing src by srcset) would be perfect but it has to be integrated as a function in Galleria.
It's probably not too hard for someone with a good knowledge of Javascript - anybody?
This recently has also been asked at Galleria's support: <a href="http://support.galleria.io/discussions/questions/18040-compatible-with-picturefilljs" rel="nofollow">http://support.galleria.io/discussions/questions/18040-compatible-with-picturefilljs</a></p>
