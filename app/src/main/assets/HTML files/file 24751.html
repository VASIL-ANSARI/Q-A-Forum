<p>Easiest to adapt to your need would be to build a list of tuples from your file :</p>

<pre><code>data = []
for l in open('file.csv'):
   data.append( l.strip().split() )
</code></pre>

<p>at this point data is a list of quadruples. So you can do your example like this:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(len(data)/2):
    _,_,i1,i2 = data[2*i]
    _,_,j1,j2 = data[2*i+1]
    print('command {}:{} moretext {}:{}'.format( i1,i2,j1,j2 ))
</code></pre>

<p>Here I use _ to say that I don't care about the two first variables of the quadruple. Hence, I don't even named them. It's a nice feature to write clear code.</p>

<p>You can also do this in a single loop:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('file.csv')
while True:
   l1 = f.readline()
   l2 = f.readline()
   if not l1 or not l2: break # file ended
   _,_,i1,i2 = l1.strip().split()
   _,_,j1,j2 = l2.strip().split()
   print('command {}:{} moretext {}:{}'.format( i1,i2,j1,j2 ))
</code></pre>
