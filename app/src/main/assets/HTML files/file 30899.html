<p>First, how to include regular expressions in a Python program:</p>

<pre><code>import re

if re.match(pattern, string_to_match):
    # there is a match
else:
    # there is no match
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the first regular expression you need. As you haven't given any code, and this question smells of homework I won't give you the others.</p>

<pre><code> re.match(r"^[aeiou].{,3}[aeiou]$", string_to_match)
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>The <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> ensure that the match is from the beginning to end of the string.
The <code>[aeiou]</code> checks for a character that is a vowel.
The <code>.{,3}</code> checks for up to 3 repetitions of any character (represented by <code>.</code>).</p>
