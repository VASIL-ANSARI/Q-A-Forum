<p>You couldn't just make a DBMS use the .NET CLR but if the DBMS supports a way to call arbitrary code via standard entry points then you can create a bridge. Oracle for example has <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28395/ociadwin.htm" rel="nofollow">the OCI (Oracle Call Interface)</a> that you could use to bridge to .NET assemblies.</p>
