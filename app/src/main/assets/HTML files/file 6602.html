<p>That's what the C++ (and C) standard decided. Floating point literals are of type double, and if you need them to be floats, you suffix them with a <code>f</code>. There doesn't appear to be any specifically stated reason as to why, but I'd guess it's a) For compatibility with C, and b) A trade-off between precision and storage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2.13.3 Floating literals</strong> The type
  of a ï¬oating literal is double unless
  explicitly specified by a suffix. The
      suffixes f and F specify float, the suffixes l and L specify long double.
  If the scaled value is not in the
  range of
      representable values for its type, the program is ill-formed.</p>
