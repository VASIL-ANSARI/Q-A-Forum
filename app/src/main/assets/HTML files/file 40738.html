<p>There is no hard and fast rule to have -1 as guess value in your case. You could even initialize it to value greater than 101 or any number other than between 0 - 101.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could use do while loop like below if you dont want to initialize it:</p>

<pre><code>int guess;
do {
    System.out.print("\nEnter your guess: ");

   guess = input.nextInt();


   if (guess == number)
       System.out.println("you are correct, the number is " + number);
   else if (guess &gt; number)
       System.out.println("your guess is too high");
   else
       System.out.println("your guess is too low");
} while (guess != number);
</code></pre>
