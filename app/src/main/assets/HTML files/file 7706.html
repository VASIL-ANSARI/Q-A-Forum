<p>What you basically need is to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/auth/#limiting-access-to-logged-in-users-that-pass-a-test" rel="nofollow">Limit access to logged-in users that pass a test</a>. But the part with "contacts of contacts" can lead to very complicated sql-queries. And I suggest you to rethink that requirement. (I have lots of good friends whom I like and trust. But they have all kinds of weird people as friends ...)</p>
