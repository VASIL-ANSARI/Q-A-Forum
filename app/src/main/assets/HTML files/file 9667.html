<p>I found out that this "Application_EndRequest" was hit BEFORE unity has cleaned up its objects. This in turn terminated our NHibernate session, so when unity then tried to dispose of all objects inside the created classes it would fail. Still have not figured out why it tries to dispose of non created classes. The wrapperclass was created by unity and the wrapper class in turn created the UserIdent. My guess is that the garbage collector or something ran and tried to go through all the created classes and their child objects. This was done outside the HttpContext which resulted in several exceptions.</p>
