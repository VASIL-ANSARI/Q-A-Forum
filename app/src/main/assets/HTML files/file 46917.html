<p>Yes, If your point location having same latitude - longitude then you will not be able to display all points separately.
You can try on hack.
You can separate list of all those points having same latitude - longitude and before applying them for clustering, just change one of it's lat-long value to + or - 0.00007 and create one pattern.
It will not make big difference in displaying and you can display all you points in cluster.</p>
