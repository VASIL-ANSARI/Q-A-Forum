<p>First read this: <a href="http://software-gunslinger.tumblr.com/post/47131406821/php-is-meant-to-die" rel="nofollow">PHP is meant to die</a>.</p>

<p>For your Problem, You have several things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>is <code>set_time_limit(0);</code> allowed?</li>
<li>your webserver could also have a seperated <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2414441/how-to-increase-request-timeout-in-iis7-0">maximum execution time</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also sleep, is not very acurate (but for this usecase acurate enough). If you realy don't have access to cron, i would check the both steps about. If you have access to cron, i would realy consider to use it (If your on windows, take a look at scheduled tasks).</p>

<p>A workaround could be, on every visitor call, you check for a file <code>lastbackup.txt</code> and check for the last backup time. If it is older then 50 minutes/not availible, you could write the current timestamp in this file and execute the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/10579116/2441442">backup script after flushing output</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, with this way it will not 100% executed every 50 Minutes, but if it will not, there is nothing big to backup</p>

<p>Max execution time <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22658908/set-ini-max-execution-time-dosent-work">Nginx</a>:</p>

<pre><code>http {
    #...
        fastcgi_read_timeout 300; 
    #...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Max execution time <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/277386/apache-2-2-cgi-timeout-configuration">Apache</a>:</p>

<pre><code>FastCgiServer /var/www/cgi-bin/php-cgi-5.3.1 -idle-timeout 120
</code></pre>

<p>Max exectuion time <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2414441/how-to-increase-request-timeout-in-iis7-0">IIS</a>: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.web&gt;
    &lt;httpRuntime executionTimeout="180" /&gt;
&lt;/system.web&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a free web based cron availbile: <a href="https://cron-job.org/" rel="nofollow">https://cron-job.org/</a> (Don't know if it also on english), but i am sure, there is more then this.</p>
