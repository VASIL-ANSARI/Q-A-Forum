<p>Try changing the line where you do the assignment to:</p>

<pre><code>wireSeg[i].track[j].parentWireSeg = &amp;wireSeg[i];
</code></pre>

<p>You see, wireSeg is of type <code>WireSeg*</code>, so when you dereference it by doing <code>*wireSeg</code> or <code>wireSeg[0]</code> or <code>wireSeg[i]</code>, you get something that is of type <code>WireSeg</code>.  If you want the address of the object instead of the object itself, so you can make a pointer, you need to add the address operator (&amp;).</p>
