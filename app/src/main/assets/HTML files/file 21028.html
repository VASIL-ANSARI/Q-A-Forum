<p>"I'm not even sure im asking the right question, all i want is to make a table for a manufacturer so when i display the manufacturer names, i click on one of the names and every phone that belongs to that manufacturer/os shows up."</p>

<p>In that case to make things easy on yourself, have one table called phones, one table called manufacturer and one table that links the phone to the manufacturer (and possibly another table for O/S ?)</p>

<pre><code>Manufacturer table:
manufacturerID
name
otherData
moreData

Phone table:
phoneID
name
phoneData

OS Table:
osID
name
osData

Link Table:
phoneID
osID
manufacturerID
</code></pre>

<p>Perform all of your searches on the link table, then simply retrieve the information you want from the other tables.</p>
