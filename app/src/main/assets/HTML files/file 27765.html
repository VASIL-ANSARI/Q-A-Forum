<p>You will want to change <code>time.sleep(3)</code> to <code>gevent.sleep(3)</code> which is the way of telling the individual greenlet to sleep.  From the <a href="http://www.gevent.org/gevent.html#gevent.sleep" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gevent.sleep(seconds=0) Put the current greenlet to sleep for at least
  seconds.</p>
  
  <p>seconds may be specified as an integer, or a float if fractional
  seconds are desired. Calling sleep with seconds of 0 is the canonical
  way of expressing a cooperative yield.</p>
