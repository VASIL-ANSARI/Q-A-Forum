<p>The reason hello.txt was not found is because your curl -I request will be handled by a new instance of your application. To demonstrate, I can delete my index.php in bash, but when I use curl -I to retrieve it I get 200 OK.</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku run bash
Running `bash` attached to terminal... up, run.3070
~ $ cd web
~/web $ ls                    
index.php
~/web $ rm index.php      
~/web $ ls
~/web $ curl -I http://xxxxx.herokuapp.com/index.php
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to show this it to open up two different bash connections, then run heroku ps</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku ps
=== run: one-off processes
run.3070 (1X): up 2015/04/01 19:30:07 (~ 37m ago): `bash`
run.7783 (1X): up 2015/04/01 19:59:48 (~ 8m ago): `bash`
</code></pre>

<p>Those two processes are not going to share the ephemeral memory.</p>
