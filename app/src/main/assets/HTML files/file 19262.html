<p>Your question is abstract. You should show the code of your functions. However I think you are using HTTPClient in your functions. Titanium statements are executed sequentially except the xhr (HTTPClient object). It always works asynchronously i.e. it sends the request to server and next statements are executed. I think you may have the same problem here. To solve it you can use javascript setTimout function or callbacks as more advanced option.</p>
