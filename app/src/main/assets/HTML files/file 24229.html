<p>I am not familiar with jQuery File Tree but I believe that the key to your issue lies inside the loops.</p>

<p>The only thing you need to do is create a blacklist, an array with the name of the folders/files you dont want to show.</p>

<pre><code>$blacklist = array('namefile1', 'namefolder1', 'namefile2');
</code></pre>

<p>And then implement a check inside the loop, so that it skips the name if the file/folder name matches one that is inside the blacklist (case sensitive).</p>

<pre><code>foreach( $files as $file ) 
{
     if (in_array($file, $blacklist))
         continue;

     .... the rest of the code ...
     .... goes here ..............
}
</code></pre>

<p>That is basically what you need to do. You could also use regular expressions and the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php" rel="nofollow">preg_match</a> function, to make it more flexible..</p>
