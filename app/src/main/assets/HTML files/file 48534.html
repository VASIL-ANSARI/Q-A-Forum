<p>Your scenario with <code>SDWebImage</code> is correct.<br>
For editing purpose you need set delegate to <code>SDWebImageManager</code> object and implement necessary method:  </p>

<pre><code>// Set delegate
[SDWebImageManager sharedManager].delegate = self;

// Implement delegate method
- (UIImage *)imageManager:(SDWebImageManager *)imageManager 
 transformDownloadedImage:(UIImage *)image 
                 withURL:(NSURL *)imageURL {

    UIImage scaledImage = ... // Make scale based on 'image' object
    return scaledImage;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this method called immediately after image was downloaded but before storing it to memory cache and before completion block is called.<br>
Documentation for this method:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allows to transform the image immediately after it has been downloaded
  and just before to cache it on disk and memory. NOTE: This method is
  called from a global queue in order to not to block the main thread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that you will be able to use <code>SDWebImageDownloader</code> and <code>SDImageCache</code> as in your question:  </p>

<pre><code>[SDWebImageDownloader.sharedDownloader downloadImageWithURL:imageURL
                                                options:0
                                               progress:^(NSInteger receivedSize, NSInteger expectedSize) {
                                                   // progression tracking code
                                               }
                                               completed:^(UIImage *image, NSData *data, NSError *error, BOOL finished) {
                                                   if (image &amp;&amp; finished) {
                                                        [[SDImageCache sharedImageCache] storeImage:image forKey:myCacheKey];
                                                   }
                                               }];
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can manage cache by using methods of <code>SDImageCache</code> class:  </p>

<pre><code>- (NSOperation *)queryDiskCacheForKey:(NSString *)key done:(SDWebImageQueryCompletedBlock)doneBlock;
- (void)removeImageForKey:(NSString *)key fromDisk:(BOOL)fromDisk withCompletion:(SDWebImageNoParamsBlock)completion;
</code></pre>
