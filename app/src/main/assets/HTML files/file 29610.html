<p>Someone may correct me, but I believe outside of either loading these three in separate script tags placed in the correct order, or loading a single js file with these plugins concatenated in the correct order, you can't.  Loading a <code>src</code> on a programatically created element now runs in an async fashion (in current browsers anyways I beleive), meaning you wouldn't be sure exactly when it's going to return back, and in what order.</p>

<p>It sounds like you want to use something like browserify or require.js which can help handle what you're trying to accomplish.  I suggest checking out those projects.</p>
