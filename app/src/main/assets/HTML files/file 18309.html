<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
     oi.catalog_id,
     SUM(CASE
            WHEN ocardtype in ('Paypal','Sofort') THEN numitems
            WHEN ocardtype in ('Mastercard','Visa') and odate is not null THEN numitems
            ELSE 0 END) as numitems,
     SUM(CASE
            WHEN ocardtype is null then numitems
            WHEN ocardtype in ('Mastercard','Visa') and odate is null THEN numitems
            ELSE 0 END) as ignoreditems
FROM
   oitems oi
      inner join
   Orders o
      on
         oi.orderid = o.orderid
GROUP BY
   oi.catalog_id
</code></pre>

<p>(Assuming that wherever you've used the word "empty" in your narrative, you mean the column is <code>NULL</code>)</p>
