<p>Hash functions as well as <code>password_hash()</code> - which implements different Password Based Key Derivation Functions (PBKDF) using either a HMAC or a ciphered MAC - always return the same amount of data for any input value. If the password is being truncated then that is because of code that happens <em>before</em> any of these functions is called. Normally these functions return 20 bytes if you use SHA-1.</p>

<p>Of course the salt value needs to be stored as well.</p>

<p>If you store that using hexadecimals then you need twice the number of characters compared to the binary value. If you utilize base 64 encoding you need  ( <code>(size + 2) / 3 * 4</code> ) characters if you include padding.</p>

<p>So your password can be as long or short as wanted, the salt takes one byte (encoding) per byte.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that you also store some kind of indicator of the function used. That may be a single byte indicating your current protocol. That way you can upgrade your password protocol per entry once a user returns to fill out his (new) password.</p>
