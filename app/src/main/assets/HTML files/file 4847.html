<p>you need to look into AMFPHP. It allows you to send data to and from flash/flex to php and back. In php once you receive the data you can use it like any other object in flash to build your sql statement.</p>

<p>I would not construct the sql statement in flash since someone might inject some nastiness in your sql. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.amfphp.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.amfphp.com</a> ... There are others version of AMF that you could also use like CakePHP and Zend. FlashBuilder actually will create the ZendAMF sample class for you. But you don't have to use flex to get access to AMF but I would recommend it for any web app. Flash is for animation, flex is for apps.</p>
