<p>:enabled and :disabled aren't supported in IE &lt; 9; so a fall-back might be required... Try to use selectivizr.js....  CSS3 pseudo-classes and attribute selectors in Internet Explorer 6-8. Simply include the script in your pages and selectivizr will do the rest.  <a href="http://selectivizr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://selectivizr.com/</a></p>
