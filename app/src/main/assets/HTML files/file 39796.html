<p>There is no way to hide parts of a text box value while still having them in the data.</p>

<p>You could look at using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable" rel="nofollow">a content editable div</a> instead (these are generally used as the foundation of so-called wysiwyg editors) and convert <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> for use inside it.</p>

<p>You'd then have to remove the spans when you pulled the data back out of the div though.</p>
