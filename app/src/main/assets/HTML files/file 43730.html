<p>I just tried it myself and there are MANY pitfalls in this.</p>

<p>I hacked a demo project which you can find here:
<a href="https://github.com/sticksen/WatchKit-Map-Sample-Project" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sticksen/WatchKit-Map-Sample-Project</a></p>

<p>Checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be sure to request authorization for Location Services and start updating location <strong>after</strong> the user has granted access.</li>
<li>If authorization is already granted, you can start updating locations right away</li>
</ul>

<p>And now the worst part:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your main targetÂ´s (which isnÂ´t the WatchKit target, just to make it clear!) Info.plist has to have a key with the name <code>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</code> or <code>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</code>(depending on what authorization you request) which as the value has a description string why you want to use Location Services. Without setting this key in the Info.plist <strong>it wonÂ´t work</strong>!</li>
</ul>
