<p>Conceptually it can work. You have to have your SQLite database hosted on a remote machine somewhere that both the C# application and the Android application can access from different places.</p>

<p>The great thing about databases is that they're not built to only work with a certain language. Any programming language that has, either built-in or through a third party, and way to connect to the type of database you're working with, can use it; however you have to be conscious of differences in operating systems. Two seemingly identical values transmitted from different OSes might look slightly different after being stored in your database. New line characters on Windows vs. Linux, for example, are slightly different.</p>
