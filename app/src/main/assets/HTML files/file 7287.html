<p>You don't have to serialize the body yourself. Just do </p>

<pre><code>request.RequestFormat = DataFormat.Json;
request.AddBody(new { A = "foo", B = "bar" }); // uses JsonSerializer
</code></pre>

<p>If you just want POST params instead (which would still map to your model and is a lot more efficient since there's no serialization to JSON) do this:</p>

<pre><code>request.AddParameter("A", "foo");
request.AddParameter("B", "bar");
</code></pre>
