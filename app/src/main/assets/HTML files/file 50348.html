<p>Depends on your definition of "better".</p>

<p>Inform yourself about Entity Framework, about its strong and weak points (especially the weak points!), experiment with it, and if you feel that it will really help you to save time and produce good quality code, then by any means use it. If not, there's absolutely nothing wrong with using plain old ADO.NET (altough using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net" rel="nofollow">Dapper</a> certainly helps in this case). </p>
