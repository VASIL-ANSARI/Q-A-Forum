<p>Your code computes the powers of two. <em>Prove it</em> (hint: induction). This should give you a clue about its <em>theta</em> complexity. Prove that by induction as well.</p>

<p>Another hint. After you compute it, you'll notice the big-theta complexity of your program is less than n!. Assuming your exact complexity is f(n), a simple way to prove it's "less" than n! is to compute the limit of f over n! as n goes to infinity.</p>

<p>That means that your big-O complexity is in the O(n!) class. Prove that by the definition of big-O class.</p>

<p>As for an example of theta (n!) code, you can figure a way to write a factorial function in a <em>very</em> inefficient way.</p>
