<p>You open/close the output for every value, I think we can do better! Just replace it with this code:</p>

<pre><code>using (System.IO.StreamWriter newfile = new System.IO.StreamWriter(@"asc_files\divfile.txt", true))
{
    foreach (string inputline in inputfile)
    {
        int count = 0;
        foreach (string measurements in inputline.Split(' '))
        {
            newfile.Write((Convert.ToDouble(measurements) / 6).ToString("F4", CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture("en-US")));
            if (++count &lt; 1122)
            {
                newfile.Write(" ");
            }
        }

        newfile.WriteLine();
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>For the reading part, you may want to read one line at a time with <code>ReadLine()</code> instead of reading the whole file in a huge block and then splitting it in-memory. This <em>streaming</em> approach will greatly reduce memory allocation and based on hardware (how much memory you have, how fast your disks (HDD? SSD?) are) may enhance performance in a sensible way!</p>

<p>Let me please know how it works now, I'm very curious!</p>
