<p>For creating chat bots, consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIML" rel="nofollow">AIML</a>. And an interpreter that would help you use your AIML files. Going for a backend database isn't a good thing I would say, since AIML is built for Artificial Intelligence stuff,chat bot in your case. Most of the famous chat bots on the Internet use AIML, example <a href="http://alice.pandorabots.com/" rel="nofollow">A.L.I.C.E</a> .</p>
