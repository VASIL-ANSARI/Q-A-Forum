<p>This is not supported by the Android system. You can not exchange activities in a TabHost because the content of a Tab is not changeable.</p>

<p>One workaround would be that you exchange the content of your root layout of your activity shown in a Tab. I did this once and I can not recommend it because you will get a really complex activity.</p>

<p>Best solution: Redesign your app so that you do not need this functionality and more.</p>
