<blockquote>
  <p>How can I create many Models with the same attributes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can subclass:</p>

<pre><code>class SpecialPost(Post):
    """Special post type that is a different kind than Post."""
</code></pre>

<p>Though it's often easy enough to use the same kind and just add an extra field that represents the kind of post which you can filter on in queries.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to create new Models dynamically (similar to "Custom Post Types" in WordPress)? Does it work if I use <code>ndb.Key('Blog', blogid)</code> instead of declaring a Model?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not 100% sure that I understand what you're asking here.  You <em>can</em> dynamically create models the same way you can dynamically create classes in python (using <code>type</code>), but you probably don't want to be doing this.  Getting those dynamically created models (and keeping track of their names) will probably end up giving you serious headaches.</p>
