<p>Depending on if you want pre or post aggregation filtering</p>

<p>Just replace 3 with whatever number of products you want.</p>

<p>Explanation:
When you do a group by you can only include columns in your result which are either part of the group by clause OR are being aggregated in some way. Here I've used SUM which aggregates the saled_qty column and I've ommited all the other columns from your query.</p>

<p>The best way to think of this is to imagine you yourself rather than SQL were grouping the data.... Say we group by item_no... how are you meant to know what to do with all the saled_qty values? You will have multiple values of saled_qty for each row of your results (One row per whatever is in your grouping clause... in this case item_no). SQL will not allow you to be ambiguous about this and so throws an error.</p>
