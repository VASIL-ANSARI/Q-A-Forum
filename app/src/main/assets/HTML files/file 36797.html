<p>If the goal is to throw an exception only in case of a problem when opening the file, why not write:  </p>

<pre><code>bool f(const char *file)
{
    ifstream ifs;
    string word;

    ifs.open(file);
    if (ifs.fail())  // throw only when needed 
        throw std::exception("Cannot open file !");  // more accurate exception

    while (ifs &gt;&gt; word) {
        if (word == "foo") return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could of course set : </p>

<pre><code>ifs.exceptions(ifstream::badbit);
</code></pre>

<p>before or after the the open, to throw an exception in case something really bad would happen during the reading.  </p>
