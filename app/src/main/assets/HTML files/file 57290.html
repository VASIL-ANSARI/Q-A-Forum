<p>Static methods are fine under the correct context. </p>

<p>Try to figure out if it makes sense to call a method, even if a class has not been declared.</p>

<p>For example, the Math methods in the java API. You want the convenience of being able to simply type:</p>

<pre><code>Math.abs(value)
</code></pre>

<p>and not have to worry about pointlessly creating a class just to perform this function. </p>

<p>That being said, for your example:</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassA {
// no instance fields
public int method1(int x, int y) {
    // do things...
    return x+y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>If that is all the code is doing, I don't see a reason why you would want to create a class with no instance fields just for the utilization of one method.</p>

<p>I would declare this as static.</p>
