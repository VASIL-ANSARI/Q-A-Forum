<p>There's no automatic way to get the entire linked entity data (as an <code>Entity</code> object) that I know of (that's not to say it's impossible, mind you).</p>

<p>But I think it'd be a lot easier to just query the data you need in another request.</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the list of opportunities you need</li>
<li>Use the regarding object IDs as the parameter of an "IN" filter for the second query.</li>
</ul>
