<p>Provided there are no other references to <code>l</code>, then memory will be released yes.</p>

<p>What happens is:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>l[25:100]</code> creates a <em>new</em> list object with references to the values from <code>l</code> indices 25 through to 100 (exclusive).</li>
<li><code>l</code> is <em>rebound</em> to now refer the new list object.</li>
<li>The reference count for the old list object formerly bound by <code>l</code> is decremented by 1.</li>
<li>If the reference count dropped to 0, the old list object formerly bound by <code>l</code> is deleted and memory is freed.</li>
</ul>
