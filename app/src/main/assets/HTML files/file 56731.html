<p>You have a <code>location</code> column in both tables. MySQL cannot decide which one to use in the query, hence it raises an error message. Indicate from which table you want to use the <code>location</code> field by adding table name to the field reference (use the appropriate table):</p>

<pre><code>...
AND ppa.LOCATION = 'London'
...
</code></pre>
