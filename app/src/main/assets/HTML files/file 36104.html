<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>select 
itemnumber, description, 
coalesce("WallyMart",0) as "WallyMart",
coalesce("J-Mart",0) as "J-Mart",
coalesce("Big-H Foods",0) as "Big-H Foods",
coalesce("DollarDays",0) as "DollarDays",
coalesce("WallyMart",0) + coalesce("J-Mart",0) + coalesce("Big-H Foods",0) +     coalesce("DollarDays",0) as "Total"
from
(select * from stores) s
pivot
(max(ordered)
 for store in 
 ('WallyMart' as "WallyMart",
  'J-Mart' as "J-Mart",
  'Big-H Foods' as "Big-H Foods",
  'DollarDays' as "DollarDays")) p
</code></pre>

<p>To explain a bit, the <code>PIVOT</code> clause consists of 2 parts - the aggregation and the list of values used for this aggregation. For your case, the aggregation used is <code>MAX</code>, since it looks like one store can have only one record for a particular product. If that is not so, <code>SUM</code> would be the right function to use. Likewise, since we want store-wise details, and not product-wise, we specify the distinct values of the <code>store</code> column in the list.</p>

<p><code>COALESCE</code> is used to default null values in the <code>ordered</code> column to 0. Finally, we add the 4 derived columns (after coalescing to 0) to get the total value.</p>
