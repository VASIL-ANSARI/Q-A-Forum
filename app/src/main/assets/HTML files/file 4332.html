<p>The why is almost certainly related to your connection speed.  Unless you're connecting via a LAN to the machine in question you'll in all probability be connecting via a consumer grade broadband connection.  These are pretty much always configured so that download speed is a lot higher than upload speed.  As a consequence, that 20 meg file that takes a minute or so to download will take 10 minutes or more to upload over the same connection.  </p>

<p>What can you do about this, other than switching to an enterprise-grade broadband connection?  Not a great deal, those bits will only transfer so fast over the connection you've got and no faster.  What you can do, however, is at least keep the user informed as to how the upload is progressing.  PHP from version 5.2 onwards provides hooks that you can use to monitor the progress of a file upload.  You can use javascript to monitor these hooks and display a progress bar to the user. </p>
