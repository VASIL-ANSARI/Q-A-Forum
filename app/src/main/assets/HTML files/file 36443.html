<p>The problem is the html is being rendered before jquery's .ready() function executes because .ready() executes after the page and all the html has been loaded. </p>

<p>You can solve your issue by styling #content in the CSS stylesheet and removing the .hide() from .ready()</p>

<pre><code>#content {
    display:none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Information regarding .ready() and .load():</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$('document').ready runs the code when the DOM is ready, but not when
  the page itself has loaded, that is, the site has not been painted and
  content like images have not been loaded.</p>
  
  <p>$(window).load runs the code when the page has been painted and all
  content has been loaded. This can be helpful when you need to get the
  size of an image. If the image has no style or width/height, you can't
  get its size unless you use $(window).load.</p>
