<p>Using plain HTML is certainly one way, as suggested by LJ_1102, and for this needs, maybe a simpler one too.</p>

<p>The process to create this effect with webGL would be as follows:</p>

<p>create canvas, draw one square (two triangles in total) over entire canvas, take mouse position on the canvas and calculate percentage of how far left/right is it from one of the edges; and for that square use some fragment shader similar as this one bellow.</p>

<pre><code>uniform float percentage;
uniform vec2 canvas_size;
uniform sampler2D left_image;
uniform sampler2D right_image;

void main() {
    vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy/canvas_size;
    if ( uv.x&lt;=percentage )
        gl_FragColor = texture2D(left_image,uv);
    else
        gl_FragColor = texture2D(right_image,uv);

}
</code></pre>
