<p>A way of doing it is with <code>NOT EXISTS</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT matchId, summonerId, championId, teamId, winner
FROM mytable AS t1
WHERE matchId = 2528256239 AND 
      NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
                  FROM mytable AS t2
                  WHERE t2.summonerId = 42999456 AND
                        t1.matchId = t2.matchId AND 
                        t1.teamId = t2.teamId)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.matchId, t1.summonerId, t1.championId, t1.teamId, t1.winner
FROM mytable AS t1
LEFT JOIN mytable AS t2 
  ON t1.matchId = t2.matchId AND t1.teamId = t2.teamId AND t2.summonerId = 42999456
WHERE t1.matchId = 2528256239 AND t2.matchId IS NULL
</code></pre>
