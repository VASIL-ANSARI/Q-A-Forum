<p>Somebody on the polymer team has suggested that Google is capable of indexing such pages <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/docs/issues/940" rel="nofollow">SEO for Polymer</a> (Polymer Element Catalog was used as an example and it is indeed a Polymer app and does show up on Google).</p>

<p>I am however seeing behavior identical to what you described here - Fetch as Google renders a blank page when WebComponents/Polymer is used.</p>

<p>You might want to open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/polymer" rel="nofollow">Polymer GitHub repository</a> for this.</p>
