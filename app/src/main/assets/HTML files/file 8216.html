<p>It is not good practice to have a TabBarController embedded within another TabBarController, and I'm pretty sure it is not allowed in the human interface guidelines. What I would recommend for you is if you really want to do something like this, either open up the "embedded" TabBarController as a modal view controller with an obvious transition (like a flip) when appropriate, or to use a UISegmentedControl.</p>

<p>For the general question of hiding the tab bar though, you can use the hidesBottomBarWhenPushed property of the view controller to hide the bottom when pushed if its in a navigation stack, otherwise you have to hide it in a custom way.</p>
