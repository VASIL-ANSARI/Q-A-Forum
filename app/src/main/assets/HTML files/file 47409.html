<p>I guess you do not want to have a button click on which webservice should be called. What you can do is set delegate for both UItextField and use this delegate method</p>

<pre><code>- (void)textFieldDidEndEditing:(UITextField *)textField;
</code></pre>

<p>What this delegate method does is this will be called each time you move out of the textfield. here you can check whether user have entered both the textfield and set your http body.</p>
