<p>The best way to know the location of the form is to decide where you want and put it there.</p>

<pre><code>   Form formDemo = new DemoForm();
   formDemo.Location = new Point(20, 30);
   formDemo.Show(); //or formDemo.ShowDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>After @Diego clarified his question I believe this will do what is needed:</p>

<pre><code>    int ScreenWidth = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea.Width;
    int ScreenHeight = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea.Height;
    int formTop = (ScreenHeight/2) - (formDemo.Height / 2);
    int formLeft = (ScreenWidth/2) - (formDemo.Width / 2);
</code></pre>
