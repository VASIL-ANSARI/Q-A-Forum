<p>With Chrome, you can use the <em>Copy XPath</em> context menu entry to sort of do it:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/P6drJ.png" alt="XPath stuff"></p>

<p>It'll give you an XPath selector that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//*[@id="sidebar"]/div[4]/div/div[13]
</code></pre>

<p><code>div[13]</code> is like <code>div:nth-child(13)</code>. It'd be really nice if Chrome had a <em>Copy CSS</em> option, but for some reason it doesn't. Maybe someone will make an extension.</p>
