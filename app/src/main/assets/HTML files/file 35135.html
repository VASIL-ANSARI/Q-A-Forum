<p>Do you have a specific question? Otherwise it's hard to help you.</p>

<p>However, I can point in you in the direction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV" rel="nofollow">CalDav</a>, which is the backing implementation that most calendar sync platforms use.</p>

<p>As for specifics: </p>

<p>Since you mentioned below that this is for a doctor's office, do keep in mind that if you're in the US, you should comply to HIPAA. </p>

<p>You'll need a backend server, since you're not going to want to sync that information to Google Calendars. A quick Google search comes up with <a href="http://radicale.org/" rel="nofollow">Radicale</a>, but there are others in the CalDAV link above.</p>

<p>You'll also need to move away from the system calendar frameworks (since I believe they only work on the subscribed calendars) and use a more general CalDAV framework (also in the above link). </p>

<p>In short, you'll have to deploy a WebDAV service that supports calendars, and sync to that. Then when you switch local users, you re-authenticate to that server with the new user and download their calendars.</p>
