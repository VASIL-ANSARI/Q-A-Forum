<p>Create a C++Library.dll. 
As this library is being used by both managed and unmanaged clients, doing the following could be useful</p>

<p>Create a static library C++StaticLibrary.lib
Then wrap the C++StaticLibrary.lib in a C++DynamicLibrary.dll by exporting the required interfaces. </p>

<p>Refer C++DynamicLibrary.dll from your c++/cli (adapter) dll.
This way you could avoid building your adapter if you have only the implementation change in the library. If, however there is a change in the library interface the updation of the adapter is unavoidable.</p>
