<p>ASIHTTPRequest only knows if the download is compressed if it's being served by a server that sets the content-encoding HTTP response header to "gzip". </p>

<p>Is your test/web server doing this?</p>

<p>Also, in your code, change your NSLog line to:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@"compressed? %@", dataWasCompressed ? @"YES" : @"NO" );
</code></pre>
