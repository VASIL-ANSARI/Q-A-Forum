<p>The JSON specification does not allow for comments. If your data includes comments, then it is not JSON and a JSON parser should be expected to error on encountering them.</p>

<p>It sounds like you will have to preprocess your non-JSON data to split it into a JSON part and a comment part, then process the JSON part normally and the comment part with some custom code.</p>
