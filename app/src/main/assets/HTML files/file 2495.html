<p>If you want it to have its own length consistently then you'll need to normalize the parent's velocity by dividing it by the parent's speed. Obviously this will not work if the parent is sitting still so you'll need some sort of "idle" state for the particles in that case (random conical distribution or whatnot).</p>

<p>Also, only acquire the velocity in the constructor, and keep using it during the ticks.</p>
