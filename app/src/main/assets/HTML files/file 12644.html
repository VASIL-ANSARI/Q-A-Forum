<p>Using Relative layout is a better option
Use <strong>dp</strong> - density independent pixels for UI components and <strong>sp</strong> for Text sizes</p>

<p>sp</p>

<p>Scale-independent Pixels - this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and user's preference.</p>
