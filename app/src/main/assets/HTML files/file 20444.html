<p>One possible consequence of a larger heap is an increase in GC times - the JVM has to analyse a larger space, so it takes longer - particularly if its a stop-the-world GC.</p>

<p>Can you flesh out your question a little?</p>

<p>What heap size are you using? What durations are you seeing? Whats the usage pattern of objects in your application? A few long lived objects, or lots of short lived ones, for example.</p>
