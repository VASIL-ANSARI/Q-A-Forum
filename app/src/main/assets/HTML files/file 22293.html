<p>The <code>develop</code> command wants to add a <code>.pth</code> entry for your project so that it can be imported as an egg. See the <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode" rel="nofollow">Development mode documentation</a>, as well as the <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#develop" rel="nofollow"><code>develop</code> command docs</a>.</p>

<p>The default is to put that entry in site-packages. Set a different library path with the <code>--install-dir</code> switch.</p>
