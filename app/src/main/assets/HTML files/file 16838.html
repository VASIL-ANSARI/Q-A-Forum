<p>I am not 100% clear on your logic, but I think you are looking for something like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.TableA_Update 
ON dbo.TableA
FOR UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE  TableB
    SET     Desc3 = i.Desc1,
            Desc4 = i.Desc2
    FROM    TableB b
            INNER JOIN inserted i           
                ON i.ID_AA = b.ID_BA        -- MATCH CRITERIA IN QUESTION
                AND i.Status = 'success'    -- NEW STATUS IS "SUCCESS"
            INNER JOIN deleted d
                ON d.ID_AA = i.ID_AA
                AND d.Status != 'success'   -- PREVIOUS STATUS WAS NOT "SUCCESS"
END
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If there is not a corresponding row in <code>TableB</code> you may want to consider using <code>MERGE</code> </p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER dbo.TableA_Update 
ON dbo.TableA
FOR UPDATE
AS
BEGIN
    ;WITH Updated AS
    (   SELECT  i.ID_AA, i.Desc1, i.Desc2
        FROM    inserted i
                INNER JOIN deleted d
                    ON d.ID_AA = i.ID_AA
                    AND d.Status != 'success'   -- PREVIOUS STATUS WAS NOT "SUCCESS"
        WHERE   i.Status = 'success'
    )
    MERGE INTO TableB USING Updated ON ID_AA = ID_BA
    WHEN MATCHED THEN
        UPDATE
        SET Desc3 = Desc1,
            Desc4 = Desc2
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
        INSERT (ID_BA, Desc3, Desc4) VALUES (ID_AA, Desc1, Desc2);
END
</code></pre>
