<p>Here is what I did in console, and it seems to be working quite well.</p>

<pre><code>GalleryPhoto.order('id DESC').each do |record|
  original_style_name = "original_#{record.image_file_name}"
  new_style_name = "small_download_#{record.image_file_name}"
  image_path = "#{Rails.root}/private/images/galleries/#{record.gallery_id}/#{record.id}"
  system "cd #{image_path} &amp;&amp; cp #{original_style_name} #{new_style_name} &amp;&amp; mogrify -resize 600x600 #{new_style_name}"
  puts record.id
end
</code></pre>
