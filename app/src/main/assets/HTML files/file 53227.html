<p>Rather than using separate variables for each of your costs and sales, you should probably combine them into a list for each, or a dictionary, depending on the possible values for level. Depending on how your logic works for what costs are relevant for what levels, this may allow you to access the appropriate cost and sales entries based on the value of level</p>
