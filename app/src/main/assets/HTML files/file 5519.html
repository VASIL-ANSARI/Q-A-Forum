<p>If using a T-SQL statement, you can rewrite the SQL with an ending of</p>

<pre><code> ORDER BY Name DESC
</code></pre>

<p>this will allow it to be alphabetical in descending order and ten it will be easier or when searching add a search clause</p>

<pre><code> WHERE Name = 'Earl Smith'
</code></pre>

<p>if you do comment with more specific in how you are getting the table would be helpful as well.</p>

<p>full Query and of course update customer_records to your table name:</p>

<pre><code> SELECT * FROM customer_records ORDER BY Name DESC;
</code></pre>
