<p>It turned out that I was missing a reference to the new tables in my DataContext. The solution was to add the three new tables to the DataContext. The migrations worked as expected.</p>

<pre><code>public DbSet&lt;Table1&gt; Table1Collection { get; set; }
public DbSet&lt;Table2&gt; Table2Collection { get; set; }
public DbSet&lt;Table3&gt; Table3Collection { get; set; }
</code></pre>
