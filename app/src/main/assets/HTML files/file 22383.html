<p>I found the cause for the Problem.</p>

<p><code>Advice.getPointcutExpression()</code> outputs either the real Pointcut as String (if it is written into the Advice directly) or the Signature of the Pointcut declared in the Aspect.
The declared pointcuts can be accessed with <code>AJType.getDeclaredPointcuts()</code></p>
