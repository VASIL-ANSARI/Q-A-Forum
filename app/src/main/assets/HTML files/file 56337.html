<p>Will need more inputs to answer your question. (Maybe your code snippet will help understand things better)</p>

<p>Are you using inline keyword explicitly for the function containing switch case in your code?!
Well if you have (I presume you have) then, just wanted to say that, Compiler can ignore the request for treating the function as inline.
There are few cases where the Compiler may ignore the inline functions, they are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Function containing a loop. (for, while, do-while)</li>
<li>Function contains static variables.</li>
<li>Recursive function</li>
<li>Function containing <strong>switch</strong> </li>
<li>Function containing goto statement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Above are the few conditions which I can recollect for the time being. </p>
