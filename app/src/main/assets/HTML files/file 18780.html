<p>You should compute a hashCode like for the image on the client side and compare only the code with the hashCodes of the images stored on the server side. I would use SHA-1 (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1</a>) as a hash function.</p>
