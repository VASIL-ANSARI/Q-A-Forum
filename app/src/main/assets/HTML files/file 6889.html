<p>Maybe try:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;video preload="none"&gt;
    &lt;source src="video.mp4" /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm very new to HTML5, so I'm not sure if my suggestion here is more or less identical to your code.</p>

<p>I know little to nothing on the server side of things. Where are you getting your data about the 10 requests? Looks like you're testing using the iPhone Simulator. Is this from the console log?</p>

<p>Found a reference to 206 Status here: <a href="http://jonathanstark.com/blog/2010/02/15/notes-on-html5-video-and-iphone/" rel="nofollow">Notes on HTML5 Video and iPhone</a>. Caveat is that it's over a year old.</p>
