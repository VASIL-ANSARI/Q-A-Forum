<p>First of all:</p>

<p>A. Are you sure that an article has many article colors and a color has many article color sizes?</p>

<p>B. What is an article color size, if a color is an integer?</p>

<p>It would be easier to understand your Q, if you add an example.</p>

<p>To your Q:</p>

<p>You go from article colors to article color size the same way you went from article to article color. There is nothing special:</p>

<pre><code>article = â¦;

articleColors = article.articleColors;
articleColor = [articleColors anyObject]; // or whatever you want to get a color.

articleColorSizes = articleColors.articleColorSizes;
articleColorSize = [articleColorSizes anyObject]; // or whatever you want to get a color.
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm pretty sure that you did something wrong with your model.</p>
