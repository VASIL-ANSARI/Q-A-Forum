<p>Do you really mean <em>menu bar</em>? Your buttons sound more like a <em>tool bar</em> thing.</p>

<p>That said, a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JMenu.html" rel="nofollow"><code>JMenu</code></a> is just a special kind of button, so perhaps you can derive your own custom menu class from that, in order to paint top level menus in a different way. For the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JFrame.html#setJMenuBar%28javax.swing.JMenuBar%29" rel="nofollow">main menu bar</a>, some platforms (Mac OS in particular) probably won't handle the custom painting code, as that menu bar is handled by native OS code. But for a second menu bar, which gets painted by swing, I'd expect no problems. After all, a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JMenuBar.html" rel="nofollow"><code>JMenuBar</code></a> is just a <code>Component</code>.</p>
