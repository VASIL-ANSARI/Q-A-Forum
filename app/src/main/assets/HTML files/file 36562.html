<p>Yes indeed, you have the right way.
From <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html#Deactivating_a_profile">maven profiles user guide</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Deactivating a profile</strong></p>
  
  <p>Starting with Maven 2.0.10, one or more profiles can be deactivated using the command line by prefixing their identifier with either the character '!' or '-' as shown below:</p>
  
  <p><code>mvn groupId:artifactId:goal -P !profile-1,!profile-2</code></p>
  
  <p>This can be used to deactivate profiles marked as activeByDefault or profiles that would otherwise be activated through their activation config.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted by @Calfater in the comments, the exclamation mark needs to be escaped in most linux shells (not on windows command line, though)</p>
