<p>Instead of messing your <code>models.py</code> I would go with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gaeunit" rel="nofollow">gaeunit</a>.</p>

<p>I've used it with success in a couple of projects and the features I like are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Just one file to add to your project (gaeunit.py) and you are almost done</li>
<li>Gaeunit isolates the test datastore from the development store (i.e. tests don't pollute your development db)</li>
</ol>
