<p>The problem and the solution for the crash are both in the error trace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caused by: android.content.ActivityNotFoundException: Unable to find
  explicit activity class {com.myapp.myapp/com.myapp.myapp.Register};
  have you declared this activity in your AndroidManifest.xml?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open your <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file and make sure there's something like this in there:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;activity android:name="com.myapp.myapp.Register"&gt;
    &lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>
