<p>2 things:
1. add "display:block;" to the  tag, this will allow it to be as large as the image within.
2. The  (menu) is covering it, making it unclickable. Remove the margin-top: -130px, and you'll be able to click it fine.</p>

<p>I have no idea why there's all that space at the top of that UL, though. It looks like you don't need a UL, in any case, and can just use a div, since there's only one li element within it.</p>
