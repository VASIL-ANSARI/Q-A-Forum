<p>This probably is not a direct answer to your question, but...</p>

<p>We've been using Jenkins (formerly Hudson) for just over a year and a half now. We have not used any feature that is Jenkins specific that I would not get on other CI systems. However, after going through configurations of buildbot and CruiseControl (sorry, please don't hate me) initially, I found that the plethora of plugins available and the general ease of use of Jenkins made the choice a no-brainer. We now have 86 projects building, and have two servers - one for development, and one for QA and Release builds. </p>

<p>As for backups, we actually back up the entire Jenkins home folder once a week (for both servers). Once every month, we back up all our virtual machines (entire virtual hard disk). </p>

<p>Note that both our servers and all slaves are VMs. </p>

<p>This way, if something goes wrong, I can restore at least the job configurations easily - the oldest it will be is one week.</p>

<p>The repository has all the latest code anyway, and the virtual machines can be brought back to a version which is (at most) one month old. </p>

<p>Also, Jenkins has a backup plugin - <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Backup+Plugin" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Backup+Plugin</a> - which makes it quite easy to back up at least the configuration.</p>

<p>Considering that backup is not the primary function of a CI system, chances are all of them are going to have their own quirks for backup and restore.</p>

<p>Just my 2 paisa/cents/pence. </p>
