<p>I just created <a href="https://github.com/aaronrenner/heroku-buildpack-rgeo-prep" rel="nofollow">heroku-buildpack-rgeo-prep</a> to address this problem.</p>

<p>This buildpack overwrites .bundle/config to set BUNDLE_BUILD__RGEO to the current build path. Unfortunately, you can't set BUNDLE_BUILD_RGEO=/app because your project is actually built somewhere like /tmp/build_1890cktlpat5d.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this buildpack will make it much less painful to use RGeo on Heroku.</p>
