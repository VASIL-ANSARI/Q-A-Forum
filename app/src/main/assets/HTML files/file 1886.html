<p>There is an excel reader available on Codeproject <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/office/ExcelReader.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The article covers the Excel file format layout, and the related material from Sun, in respect to how OpenOffice reads in the Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<p>AFAIK, there is no way to include an xls in a webpage unless you are talking about showing the actual data, it may be possible under IE only, to trigger the end user's Excel application, but IMHO that would be a dangerous assumption as that assumes the user has MS-Office installed.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,
Best regards,
Tom.</p>
