  <p>..what is the best way to grant these permissions?</p>

<p>The problem is not exactly as you expect.  The bottom line is that an applet cannot create a <code>File</code> object on a server (for e.g. to get the file list of a directory).  That is not because of permissions, but just the way that files &amp; servers work.</p>

<p>To get the file list will require help from the server.  And by 'help' I mean the server providing a file list that the applet can read.</p>

<p>If the server is set up to provide the list, and the applet is hosted from that server, it requires no special or extra permissions.</p>
