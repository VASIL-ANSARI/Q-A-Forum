<p>I like to use session's for errors instead.</p>

<p>if an error is to be returned I usually do something like.</p>

<pre><code>    $_SESSION["error"] = "my error text.";
</code></pre>

<p>I usually try to send them to a success page after they do something.</p>

<p>At the top of the success page I put something like this to redirect them back to the original page.</p>

<pre><code>    if (!empty($_SESSION["error"])){
        header('Location: original_page.php');
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in the original page I put something like this.</p>

<pre><code>    if (!empty($_SESSION["error"])){
        echo $_SESSION["error"];
        $_SESSION["error"] = null ;
        unset($_SESSION["error"]);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This way they are displayed their error and no code could ever be executed if they start trying to type random things.</p>

<p>I never use $_GET for anything that could be manipulated.</p>
