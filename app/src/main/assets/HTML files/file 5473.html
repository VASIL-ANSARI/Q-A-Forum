<p>I ran your code in VS 2010, and I believe that the allocations you see are only Visual Studio STL debugging facilities as all the 8 bytes allocations are issued from <code>_String_val</code> constructor :</p>

<ul>
<li>In release (<code>_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL == 0</code>), the constructor is trivial</li>
<li>In debug (<code>_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL != 0</code>), it allocates a <code>_Container_proxy</code> (which happens to have a size of 8) through the allocator.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I run your code in release mode, the node allocation for the map falls to 72 bytes and the 8 bytes allocation and deallocation disappear : the strings seem to be correctly moved.</p>
