<p>why not just use</p>

<pre><code>import constants

def use_my_constants():
    print constants.GOOD, constants.BAD, constants.AWFUL
</code></pre>

<p>From the python zen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Namespaces are good. Lets do more of those!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Except, when you do quote, you should include a reference and check it, because as others have pointed out, it should read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This time, I actually copied it from the source: <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python</a></p>
