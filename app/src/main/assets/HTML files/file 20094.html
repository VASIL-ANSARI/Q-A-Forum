<p>Check for the presence of the HTTP authentication headers and use this to determine what to display.</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'])) {
    $username = $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'];
    $password = $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'];
    // validate login credentials
    $private = true; // or false if validation fails
}

if ($private) {
    // load special view
}
else {
   // load normal view
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will not prompt the user to log in if they have not already done so elsewhere. </p>

<p>If you are going to be doing this in multiple places it would make sense to have a single re-usable class or file that provided a function to check for the headers and validate the credentials (returning <code>true</code> on success, <code>false</code> on fail) rather than duplicating code.  </p>
