<p>You just tried to print a byte array. In Java, that just prints out the type of the object <code>[B</code>, followed by its address <code>@40e3f9b8</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to print the text out, use <code>new String(bytes)</code> to get a string from the bytearray (using the default charset), then print the string out.</p>
