<p>If you can add an additional ID column to the salaries table, you can use standard rails functions, like</p>

<pre><code>(in app/models/person.rb)

class Person
  has_many :salaries
  has_one :current_salary, :class_name =&gt; "Salary", 
          :conditions =&gt; lambda { {:year =&gt; Time.now.year} }
  # outer curlies are for the lambda, inner curlies are for it to return a hash
end

(in config/routes.rb)


resources :people do
  resources :salaries
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then use normal access by ID</p>
