<p>You could create a base form class with common functionality such as remembering the position and size and inherit from that base class.</p>

<pre><code>public class myForm : Form {
protected override void OnLoad(){
    //load the settings and apply them
    base.OnLoad();
}

protected override void OnClose(){
    //save the settings
    base.OnClose();
}
}
then for the other forms:

public class frmMainScreen : myForm {
// you get the settings for free ;)
}</code></pre>

<p>Well, something like that ;)</p>
