<p>Although, we use the interfaces as the same way we use inheritance (":"); interfaces are not inherited; they are to be implemented. In such a case; inheritance is confused with implementation since they are defined using the same operator (":").</p>

<p>As a summary;
<code>IA : IB</code> and <code>A:IA</code> means; any class implementing IA, shall implement IB. In this case; A shall implement IA and IB.</p>

<p><code>A:B</code> means A class inherits B class; it does not implement.</p>

<p>The confusion here derives from using the same operator (":").</p>
