<p>In fact this is not 'mixed' order. This is just a result of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" rel="nofollow">Breadth-first search</a> performed by XPath. And you need, as I can see, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" rel="nofollow">Depth-first search</a>. The DFS result will be just like a plain search result - what appears first in the document, that will appear earlier in search result.</p>

<p>You could try to implement it yourself by using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbem.html" rel="nofollow">StAX</a> - a stream reader. That is not DFS, but plain XML reader which could give you a desired result.</p>
