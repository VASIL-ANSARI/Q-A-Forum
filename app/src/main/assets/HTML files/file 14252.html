<p>You should start by learning more about the <code>Gallery</code> in general. This <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-gallery.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> would make a good start. </p>

<p>Understand that code, go through the tutorials and begin experimenting on making incremental changes and seeing if they work.</p>

<p>Using this knowledge and prototype code start thinking about how you might go about creating your custom semi-circle gallery. Experiment and try some different things. </p>

<p>When/if you run into any issues or specific problems, post your question on a new thread and I'm sure you will find people willing to help you out.</p>
