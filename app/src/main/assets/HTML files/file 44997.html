<p>Your logic is broken. <code>UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum</code> can also fail hence the <code>completionTarget</code> and <code>completionSelector</code> exist. You should check them.</p>

<p>Because you do use Storyboards, the easiest way is to create segue in Storyboard with some name. Let's say <code>show-image</code>. Then you just call <code>performSegueWithIdentifier("show-image", sender: image)</code> and that's it. Where <code>image</code> is some reference to the image you would like to pass (if you would like to do it). If you do not want to pass image, just pass <code>nil</code> there.</p>

<p>Then override <code>prepareForSegue</code>, check if <code>segue.identifier</code> equals to <code>show-image</code> and then assign your <code>image</code> reference (<code>sender</code> in this case) to some <code>segue.destinationViewController</code> property.</p>

<p>But it's hard to help or be more specific, because you don't provide more details about what's wrong.</p>
