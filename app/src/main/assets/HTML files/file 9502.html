<p>Your problem is that this:</p>

<pre><code>'POLYGON((? ?, ? ?, ? ?, ? ?))'
</code></pre>

<p>is an SQL string literal that just happens to contain eight question marks. Since that is an SQL string literal, none of the question marks inside it are considered to be placeholders. That leaves you with two placeholders: the one at the very beginning of the <code>VALUES</code> list and the one at the very end.</p>

<p>You'll have to build your polygon some other way. There might be a better way than <code>ST_GeographyFromText</code> but, alas, I don't know what it is and I don't have PostGIS set up anywhere. If necessary, you can build the POLYGON string by hand with standard string wrangling and then use a placeholder for it:</p>

<pre><code>VALUES (?, ST_GeographyFromText(?), ?)
</code></pre>

<p>The placeholder inside <code>ST_GeographyFromText</code> will be seen as a placeholder as it isn't inside a string literal and you could user <code>stmt.setString</code> to give it a value.</p>
