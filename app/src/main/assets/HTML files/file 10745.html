<p>I don't think that's possible.</p>

<p>HttpModules and HttpHandlers are called on a per-AppPool basis. They don't run in multiple AppPools at once, nor do they allow control to start in one AppPool and continue in another. This is also in keeping with your stated goal of complete isolation.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that an AppPool is basically an entirely separate process, so there's no easy control flow from one to the other.</p>
