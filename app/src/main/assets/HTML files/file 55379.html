<p>You are not instantiating <code>InputStream</code> in the first example. You are instantiating an anonymous class that extends <code>InputStream</code> and implements the only abstract method of <code>InputStream</code> - <code>read()</code>. That anonymous class is not abstract, so you can instantiate it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <code>new InputStream()</code> attempts to instantiate an abstract class, which is not possible.</p>
