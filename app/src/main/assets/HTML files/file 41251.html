<p>Class variables of reference type have a default value of null (as opposed to local variables that don't have a default value). Similarly, class variables of primitive types have their own default values.</p>

<p>Your code is equivalent to :</p>

<pre><code>public class Employee {

    String name = null;
    int empId = 0;
    ...
}
</code></pre>
