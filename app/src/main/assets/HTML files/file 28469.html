<p>The class <code>StandardCharsets</code> gives you a list of encodings / charsets that are "guaranteed to be available on every implementation of the Java platform."</p>

<p>This list doesn't contain the Windows encodings but for most common Java versions on Windows, Mac and Linux, <code>Cp1251</code> is available.</p>

<p>Note that you'll get a <code>UnsupportedCharsetException</code> or <code>UnsupportedEncodingException</code> when it's not available, so the code above is safe (in the sense that it won't produce garbage).</p>

<p>If you want to be really safe, the common approach is to use only UTF-8 encoded data in your projects.</p>
