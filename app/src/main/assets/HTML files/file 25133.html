<p>because you are setting the posDelayed actions without any dealy. you are setting the delay before execution of runnable. But there is no delay between two iteration of your while loop</p>

<p>perhapse you can do something like this</p>

<pre><code>      handler.postDelayed(r, 1000);

      Runnable r = new Runnable()
        {
             @Override
            public void run()
            {
               txtView.setX((int) txtView.getX() - 1);

               i--;
               if(i&gt;0)
                    handler.postDelayed(r,1000);
            }
        }
</code></pre>
