<p>I would make a new matrix, padded with <code>(n-1)/2</code> zeros around it:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

rows, cols = 4, 6
n = 3
d = (n-1)/2
data = np.arange(rows*cols).reshape(rows, cols)
padded = np.pad(data, d, mode='constant')
for x, y in  np.indices(data.shape).reshape(2, -1).T:
    sub = padded[x:x+n, y:y+n]
    print sub
    bootstrap_nxn = np.random.choice(sub.ravel(), (n, n))
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes <code>n</code> is odd, and that the submatrix <em>center</em> is always within the the original <code>data</code> matrix.  If <code>n</code> is even, the <em>center</em> of the submatrix isn't well defined.</p>

<p>If you actually want to have the submatrix overlap with the data matrix with only one row, then you'd need to pad with <code>n-1</code> zeros (and in that case even vs odd <code>n</code> won't matter).</p>
