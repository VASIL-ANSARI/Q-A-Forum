<p>The answer depends on the semantics of what you've termed a <em>direction vector</em>.</p>

<p>In the computer graphics context I would normally take that term to mean a <em>unit vector</em> facing in the specified direction.    Whereas in a mathematics context you <em>might</em> simply mean the <em>relative vector</em> that results from subtracting the two points' coordinates.</p>

<p>[Using P1 and P2 to represent the required two points, and V for the vector].</p>

<p>In the former case, you also need a specify a <em>length</em> for the vector, so you'll need:</p>

<pre><code>P2 = P1 + n * V
</code></pre>

<p>whereas in the latter case, it's just trivially</p>

<pre><code>P2 = P1 + V
</code></pre>
