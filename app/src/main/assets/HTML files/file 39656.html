<p>First, you will need to change up your routes a bit.</p>

<pre><code>resources :posts, except: [:index] do
  resources :comments, only: [:create, :destroy]

  post 'upvote', on: :member
  post 'downvote', on: :member
 end
</code></pre>

<p>The reason these are member routes instead of collection routes is being they apply to a specific member of the collection of posts...a single <code>Post</code>.</p>

<p>Then, you will want to run the command, <code>rake routes</code> in your Terminal to see what the appropriate path methods are. It should be something like</p>

<pre><code>upvote_post_path(:id)
</code></pre>

<p>which requires an object be passed in..so in your view you would use it like you currently are.</p>

<pre><code>upvote_post_path(post)
</code></pre>
