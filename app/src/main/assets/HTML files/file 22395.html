<p>The short answer is <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/moped/" rel="nofollow">Moped</a>.  This is the lower-level API that Mongoid is built upon and will be available if you already use Mongoid.  The Moped API is a thin wrapper around the raw MongoDB operations.  The documentation here: <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/moped/docs/driver.html" rel="nofollow">http://mongoid.org/en/moped/docs/driver.html</a> should be useful.</p>
