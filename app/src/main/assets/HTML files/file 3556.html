<p>The root cause of this problem lies in the communication line between your Java code and the DB server in question. It can be everything. A bug in your JDBC code, a bug in the JDBC driver, a bug in NIC driver, a crappy NIC, a poor network cable, a stuttering DB server, a DB server dropping connections because it runs out of them, etcetera. </p>

<p>There's no straightforward cause, even not based on the stacktrace. I would start checking if the JDBC code is properly and robust written. I.e. acquiring and closing all DB resources in shortest possible scope in a try/finally block.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre><code>public Entity find(Long id) throws SQLException {
    Connection connection = null;
    PreparedStatement statement = null;
    ResultSet resultSet = null;
    Entity entity = null;

    try {
        connection = database.getConnection();
        statement = connection.prepareStatement(SQL_FIND_BY_ID);
        statement.setLong(1, id);
        resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
        if (resultSet.next()) {
            entity = new Entity();
            entity.setSomething(resultSet.getObject("something"));
            // ...
        }
    } finally {
        close(resultSet);
        close(statement);
        close(connection);
    }

    return entity;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next step would be upgrading the JDBC driver and then checking the hardware matters. </p>

<p>Good luck nailing down the cause of the problem. </p>
