<p>The <code>Intersect</code> extension method returns an <code>IEnumerable&lt;&gt;</code>, but does not actually perform the intersection until you begin enumerating it (e.g. do a <code>foreach</code>, call <code>.ToList()</code> etc.). As such, I wouldn't expect any of the methods on your comparer to be called based on the snippet you've given, since you aren't enumerating the result.</p>
