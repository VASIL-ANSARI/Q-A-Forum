<p>As well as calling your custom <code>clean</code> method, Django validates each form field individually. It is the individual field check that is causing the required field error. For full details see the Django docs on <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/validation/#form-and-field-validation" rel="nofollow">Form and field validation</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not require user input in the code field, you can override the form's <code>__init__</code> method, and set <code>required=False</code>.</p>

<pre><code>class MyAdAdminForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Ad

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MyAdAdminForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['code'].required = False
</code></pre>

<p>Once the field is not required, the form <em>will</em> call the <code>clean_code</code> method during validation, so you can set the value there.</p>
