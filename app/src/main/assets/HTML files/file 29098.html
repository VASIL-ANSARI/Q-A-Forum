<p>I'm fine. Thanks for asking.</p>

<p>1 - yes this is 100% doable. (I honestly cannot remember the steps, as I did it a year ago, but you would change what is the ourput of the page... from html to json I think)</p>

<p>2 - godaddy.com (and 3 zillion other sites, which can be easily googled)</p>

<p>enjoy coding.</p>
