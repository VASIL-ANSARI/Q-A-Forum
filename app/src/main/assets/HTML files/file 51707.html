<p>I finally managed to get it working. However, I am not sure it is the best way to do it. It's a quick fix until I find a more proper solution.</p>

<p>When someone enters my website with the datakey variable as a $_GET parameter, I set a cookie with the value. When the user logs in, the FOSUBUserProvider checks whether the datakey cookie is set; if it is, it will do its thing.</p>

<p>This is the best I can do for now, as I haven't managed to succeed sending parameters through the hwioauthbundle and into my FOSUBUserProvider. </p>

<p>If someone finds a better solution, let me know!</p>
