<p>When you don't redirect them, file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are all your terminal. And you can read from or write to any of them - try it! (Strictly speaking, the file descriptor is not the terminal, it just refers to the terminal)</p>

<p>When you type stuff in your terminal, your terminal is ready for reading, so all FDs 0, 1 and 2 are ready for reading because they are all the same terminal that you typed stuff in.</p>

<p>When you redirect input (file descriptor 0), FD 0 instantly becomes ready for reading even if you don't type stuff, because it's not waiting for you to type stuff. So your program sees that FD 0 is ready, reads FD 0, then exits. FD 1 and 2 <strong>would</strong> become ready if you typed stuff while the program was running, but you never got a chance to do that because your program exited straight away.</p>
