<p>So I figured out a way programatically select sheets. </p>

<p>You can create a string array of names, and use the ordering of the array to get a collection of the sheets. Select this collection, and you should have all the specified sheets selected.</p>

<pre><code>String[] sheetsToBeSelected = {"Sheet3","Sheet1","Sheet2"}; //Note, Sheet3 is the first item in this array
excel.Workbook workbook = ExcelApp.ActiveWorkbook; //get your Excel application however you want
excel.Sheets worksheets = workbook.Worksheets; //get all the sheets in this workbook

//This gets a collection of the sheets specified and ordered by the array of names passed in. 
//Just call select on this collection, and the first sheet in the collection becomes the active sheet!
((excel.Sheets)worksheets.get_Item(sheetsToBeSelected)).Select(); 
</code></pre>
