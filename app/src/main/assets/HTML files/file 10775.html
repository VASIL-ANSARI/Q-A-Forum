<p>I'm afraid that before you could write it on a separate file it's already occupying some space on your memory and the worse it would do a lot of process and occupy more space on the memory instead, I think another good approach is to look for a parameter on the function your using that could control the size of the response like for each response I want only to have a maximum of 5mb response size. I find it a bit difficult to explain but it's something you would do with pagination concepts you limit each page to 5 items for example on page 1 display 5 items, on page 2 another 5 items and so on. If that wouldn't work or it's not possible to do so then the last option is upgrade your server to be able to support what you really need I know this might be a heavier option but if there is no other way then I think this would be the most feasible option to resolve you problem. :)</p>
