<p>Don't requery the form, just requery the combo. The best bet is probably the current event which will work if more than one person is doing data entry. It will also work if people are editing the table as well as entering data. Events that only fire when a record is added will not pick up changes to the combo contents.</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Form_Current()
   Me.MyCombo.Requery
End Sub
</code></pre>
