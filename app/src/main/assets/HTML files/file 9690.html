<p>You have to use</p>

<pre><code> Intent intent = new Intent( "mypackage.myaction" );
 activity.sendBroadCast( intent );
</code></pre>

<p>Where activity is the one that launches your BroadcastReceiver and Intent, an intent that matches the filter of your BroadcastReceiver in your manifest file.</p>

<p>You will do something that looks like :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;receiver android:name="your broadcast receiver class" android:label="a name"&gt;
    &lt;intent-filter&gt;
        &lt;action android:name="mypackage.myaction" /&gt;
    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/receiver&gt;
</code></pre>
