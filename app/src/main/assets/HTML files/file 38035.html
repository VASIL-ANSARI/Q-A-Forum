<p>If I'm reading your question correctly, you want the <code>rollno</code> variable to be unique for each instance of the <code>staticdemo</code> class? Well then you can't have the member as <code>static</code>, because <code>static</code> members are shared among <em>all</em> instances of a class.</p>
