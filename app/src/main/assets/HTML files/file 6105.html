<p>How is the date picker formatting the date selected?  All of my experience with JS date pickers returns human-readable dates, not the UNIX timestamps that I would assume you are using in your database.  In that case you can use <code>$choice_timestamped = strtotime($choice);</code> on the date string from the date picker then the <code>date()</code> function when outputting it to display in whatever format you like.</p>
