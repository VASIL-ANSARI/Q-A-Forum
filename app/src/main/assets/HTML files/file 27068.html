<p>You are using incorrect <code>this</code>. try this way. <code>this</code> inside the handler represents <code>#element</code> not the context of the function itself.</p>

<pre><code> var self = this; //cache the context here
 $('#element').on('click', function(){
   var newResponse = self.Second("Bug"); //Access it with self
 });
</code></pre>

<p>Also i think you are missing a comma after <code>First</code> function definision and before <code>Second</code> function.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/N9HTx/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a></strong></p>

<p>The reason being the callback you give gets invoked from within the context of the element so your <code>this</code> context changes. <code>this</code> context refers to the context from where the callback was invoked. But there are other ways to get around this like using <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/" rel="nofollow">$.proxy</a> while binding your callback with jquery, using EcmaScript5 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind" rel="nofollow">Function.prototype.bind</a> etc. But ideally you don't want to do that because most of the cases you would need the context of the element there inside the handler.</p>
