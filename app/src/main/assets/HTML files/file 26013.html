<p>The code is syntactically invalid (as <a href="http://validator.w3.org" rel="nofollow">http://validator.w3.org</a> would tell), because the <code>label</code> element must not contain a heading element. (They could be nested the other way around.) This may confuse a checker.</p>

<p>If this does not explain it, then the problem is either in the checker or elsewhere on the page (e.g., there is another <code>label</code> element with the same <code>for</code> attribute).</p>
