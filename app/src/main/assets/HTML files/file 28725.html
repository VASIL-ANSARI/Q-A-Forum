<p>You could try explicitly calling the destructor and then calling operator delete.</p>

<pre><code>my_class* p = ...;

p-&gt;~my_class();
::operator delete(static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(p));
</code></pre>

<p>It's not strictly correct but it will probably work. Whether it's a good idea is another issue.</p>
