<p>CFNE is just as it should be.</p>

<p>You have mysql jdbc driver in module but your deployment and it's <code>@DataSourceDefinition</code> know noting about it.</p>

<p><code>@DataSourceDefinition</code> uses deployments classloader to load the jdbc driver but it is not available to it as it is in module.</p>

<p>To solve this you should either</p>

<p>1) add deployment's  dependency to your mysql driver module via manifest.mf / jboss-deployment-structure.xml, see <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Class+Loading+in+WildFly" rel="nofollow">https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Class+Loading+in+WildFly</a> for details how</p>

<p>2) add jdbc driver to your war's lib directory</p>

<p>but I would definitely go with 1) </p>
