<p>I'd look at using full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="nofollow">ISO 8601</a> syntax with the local time offset included from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#UTC" rel="nofollow">UTC</a> timestamp.</p>

<p><code>2015-11-04T09:20:22+00:00</code></p>

<p>Getting an ISO-8601 date and timestamp from an NSDate is quite straight-forward, but you might want to look at a library for tips, if this is all new to you.</p>
