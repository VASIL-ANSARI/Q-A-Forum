<p><code>static int number</code> is never defined. Add the following definition outside of your class.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt; int LinkedQueue&lt;T&gt;::number = 0;
</code></pre>

<p><code>static</code> members are <em>special</em>, <code>static int number</code> inside the class is only a declaration and not a definition. The reason for this is because headers are usually included in <em>multiple</em> translation units, so C++ forces you to define them outside of the class usually in a cpp file so that you do not get multiple definition errors.</p>
