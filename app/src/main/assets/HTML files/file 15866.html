<p>Your problem is that you only look at missed calls and not at categories, so you cannot notice categories that have no corresponding missed calls.</p>

<p>Here is the skeleton that will do that, supposing you will adapt it to the real structure of the category table.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ...
FROM Category cat
    LEFT JOIN missed_call call ON call.category = category.id
WHERE (call.name = 'whatever1' OR call.category IS NULL)
GROUP BY call.name, call.category
...
</code></pre>

<p>Note especially <code>call.category IS NULL</code>.  The column is supposedly not nullable; so this really checks for a <code>Category</code> row without any corresponding calls, an artifact of the outer join.</p>
