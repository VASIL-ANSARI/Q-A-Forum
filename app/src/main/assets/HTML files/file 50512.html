<p>You don't "place" data into a function, you pass them. That's what function parameters are for. Besides that, </p>

<pre><code>companyA(int pNumber, char company, int localMin, int longMin);
</code></pre>

<p>is a function declaration, which does not have a place here at all.</p>

<p>Here's the edited code that uses the variables you declared, and does not use <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ios/eof" rel="nofollow"><code>std::basic_ios::eof</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>// read to intermediate variables
while(infile &gt;&gt; pNumber &gt;&gt; company &gt;&gt; localMin &gt;&gt; longMin) 
{
    if(pNumber &gt; 111000)
        // just call the function, passing intermediate variables
        companyA(pNumber, company, localMin, longMin);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Moreover, <code>std::basic_fstream</code> does not have a <code>close</code> that takes some arguments (path). See the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_fstream/close" rel="nofollow">reference</a> and pay attention in the class.</p>
