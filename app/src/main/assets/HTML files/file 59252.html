<p>I'd be curious to see what SQL is generated for those queries and whether or not it changes when your result changes. Selecting a List to me seems like a pretty rare situation, so it's possible you have run into an edge-case (or at least into undefined behavior territory).</p>

<p>Since you're still essentially just selecting two columns, we can worry about how the data is structured after Entity Framework has finished it's work</p>

<pre><code>db.MyTable.Where(x =&gt; [WHERE Clauses])
    .Select(x =&gt; new { Number = x.Number.Trim(), Name = x.Name.Trim() })
    .AsEnumerable() //Force EF to materialize the result here
    .Select(x =&gt; new List&lt;string&gt; { x.Number, x.Name }) //Manipulate the result in memory
    .ToList();
</code></pre>
