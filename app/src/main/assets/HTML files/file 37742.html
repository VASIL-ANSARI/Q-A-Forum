<p>By moving the h-shadow to .1rem and -.1rem you are pushing the shadow left (or right) by that value, so by design, this will reveal more of the shadow on that sides.</p>

<p>Removing the value and having it as 0 will fix this, but will also show the shadow of the side you are trying to hide it from so this will not create the effect you are after.</p>
