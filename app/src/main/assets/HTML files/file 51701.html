<p>Well, first of all I think your OnStart method is written badly. I can't see the reason for creating a, basicly, empty thread. You should there only initialize service (If necessary), immediately start a new thread that will work for whole time and <strong>leave the OnStart</strong> method. </p>

<p>Second of all use try catch block, because in my opinion somewhere in there is exception and that's why your windows service stops.</p>

<p>Thirdly see this example <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/653493/WCF-Hosting-with-Windows-Service" rel="nofollow">WCF Hosting with Windows Service</a></p>
