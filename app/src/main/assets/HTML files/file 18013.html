<p>One way to get events from the lifecycle of other activities is to register your class as an <code>Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks</code> with the main <code>Application</code> instance and filter events for the <code>Activity</code> you're interested in.</p>

<p>This is a short example (you may want to register the callbacks from another method/class other than <code>MainActivity.onCreate</code> or you'll miss that message ;) and you may have a dependency there that you don't want)</p>

<p>On the activity you want to spy:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Register a spy for this activity
        getApplication().registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks(new ActivitySpy(this));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the Spy code looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class ActivitySpy implements ActivityLifecycleCallbacks {

    private final Activity mActivity;

    public ActivitySpy(Activity activity) {
        mActivity = activity;
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivityCreated(Activity activity, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        if (mActivity == activity)
            Log.i("SPY", "Activity Created");
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivityDestroyed(Activity activity) {
        if (mActivity == activity)
            Log.i("SPY", "Activity Destroyed");
    }

    // (...) Other overrides

}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also register the spy from another place if you have a reference to the Activity you want to follow.</p>

<p>I hope this helps :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I forgot to mention, this will only work on <strong>API Level 14 and above</strong>...</p>
