<p>You could do this by finding age, then moving forward your cursor two lines if you would like to do that, if you want the entire section of text after the "junk", and you know how long that text is, this would also work:</p>

<pre><code>lookup = 'age'
lines=[]
with open('C:/Users/Luke/Desktop/Summer 2016/Programs/untitled5.txt') as myFile:
    for num, line in enumerate(myFile, 1):
        if lookup in line:
            lines.append(num+2)
ofile=open('C:/Users/Luke/Desktop/Summer 2016/Programs/untitled5.txt')
line=ofile.readlines()
interestinglines=''
for i in range(len(lines)):
    interestinglines+=(line[lines[i]]+'\n')
</code></pre>

<p>you may need to tinker with it a bit, but I believe this should reproduce mostly what you're looking for. The <code>'\n'</code> is added onto the <code>line[lines[i]]</code> so that you may save it to a new file.</p>
