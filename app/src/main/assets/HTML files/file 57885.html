<p>Seriously, I think you just miss a small thing to tell cx_freeze to import easy_gui:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable


build_exe_options = {"packages": ["os", "sys"], "excludes": ["tkinter"],
                     "includes" = ["easy_gui"] } # &lt;-- Include easy_gui


base = None
if sys.platform == "win32":
base = "Win32GUI"

setup(  name = "ProgramGUI",
        version = "0.1",
        description = "My GUI application!",
        options = {"build_exe": build_exe_options},
        executables = [Executable("ProgramGUI.py", base=base)])
</code></pre>
