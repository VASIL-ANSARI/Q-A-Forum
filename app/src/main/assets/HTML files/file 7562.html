<p>I think the preferable way to return a single record would be along the lines of your second example, but you can omit the limit part:</p>

<pre><code>Foo.where(:bar =&gt; 'a-value').first
</code></pre>

<p>This follows the new syntax and supports chaining if you want to add more conditions to the lookup.</p>
