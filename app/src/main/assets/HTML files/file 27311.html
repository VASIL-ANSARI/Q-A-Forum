<p>Logcat would be helpful but I think the problem is here</p>

<pre><code> List&lt;String&gt; list = this.mySet.set_list;
</code></pre>

<p>You would get a <code>NPE</code> because you haven't yet iniitalized <code>mySet</code></p>

<p>You don't do that until the next line after going to this method</p>

<pre><code>    createSpinner();

    this.mySet = new MySet();
</code></pre>

<p>You need to initialize <code>mySet</code> before trying to call a method on it. So change the above lines around</p>

<pre><code>    this.mySet = new MySet();
    createSpinner();
</code></pre>

<p>After looking a little more, I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish with </p>

<pre><code> List&lt;String&gt; list = this.mySet.set_list;
</code></pre>

<p>They are both instance variables of <code>MySet</code> besides neither are initialized</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>In your <code>onCreate()</code> you have </p>

<pre><code>setContentView(R.layout.main_activity);
</code></pre>

<p>but the xml you posted you say is for <code>activity_main.xml</code> if that wasn't a typo in your post then the problem is trying to get a <code>View</code> from a <code>layout</code> which you haven't inflated.</p>
