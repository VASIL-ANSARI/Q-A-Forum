<p>The card reader plays an audio encoding of the card data, and the app is listening to the audio. So technically it's using audio recording APIs. There's no way to treat the headphone jack like a serial port and read data over it, only audio. If you wish to communicate directly with another device, either it needs to be over bluetooth or thru the dock/lightning connector.</p>
