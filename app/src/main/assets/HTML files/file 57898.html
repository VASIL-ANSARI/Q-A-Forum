<p>I would try moving <code>ng-app="StrangeCessation"</code> to a div that is after <code>&lt;div class="header&gt;</code> and put the <code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt; after</code>ng-app`s closing tag as well.</p>

<p>What is the main use of Angular here? If you're ending up with duplicate header / footer it means Angular is rendering nested views that also contain those elements. Without seeing all the views, partials, controllers etc. we can but speculate.  You might try removing header / footer from <code>application.html.erb</code> and see if the header / footer still render on login.  Also check what might be in <code>static_pages/home.html</code> </p>

<p>It looks like this line may be the problem, but not sure.  The view target here seems to be "main".  Is that correct?</p>

<pre><code>.state('quotes', { url: '/quotes',  views: {'main': { templateUrl: 'quotes.html', controller: 'QuotesCtrl'}}})
</code></pre>

<p>Also, not sure why your passing in <code>$urlRouterProvider</code>  But then you have that function definition commented out.  Also without seeing the partials, it's hard to know if they might be doing something funky.  Perhaps you could post a link to your full code somewhere?</p>

<p>Also, off topic but, not sure why your using things like <code>document.getElementById('settings').style.visibility = 'hidden';</code></p>

<p>When if your are using jquery you can just do: <code>$('#settings').hide();</code></p>
