<p>While reading code briefly what is flaring is magic numbers (9, 44) and very deep nesting.
Replace numbers with good-named constants and move out some parts of code as methods.</p>

<p>In case they are tightly twisted by used local variables - probably all this method worth moving out to worker class with single responsibility - to read the message. Thus local variables becomes class fields and methods wouldn't be so inflexible to refactoring.</p>

<p>Also MemberList(...) is poor name for a method as for me. Make it a verb that will describe what method is doing.</p>
