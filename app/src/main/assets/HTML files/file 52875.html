<p>I'm not sure if that's what you're trying to do but if you just want to filter out all negative <em>grades</em> then you could try this:</p>

<pre><code>//...
double grade = input.nextDouble();
if (grade &lt; 0){
    System.err.println("Not a valid grade");
    continue;
}
total += grade;
count++;
//..
</code></pre>

<p>this will print out an error message and prompt the user for a new number if it was negative. So you just check if the entered number was negative an if that's the case it will go back to the beginning of the loop using <code>continue</code> without changing <code>total</code> or incrementing <code>count</code>.</p>
