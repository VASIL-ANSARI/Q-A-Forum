<p>You have to make use of <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a> to get things working properly, and without worries in systems with more than one Python version. </p>

<p>Actually, it is quite a help even in system qwith a single Python version, if you have muliple Python apps running.</p>

<p>Visrtualenv will not only take care of setting up all the appropriate environment variables for you to use one Python or another, as it will allow you to use use a separate environment where you can safely "easy_install"  Python 2.4 modules without conflicting with CentOS .rpm packages of those same modules.</p>
