<p>I was using a content observer for watching outbound SMS messages and noticed that if you attempted to send an outbound SMS from the emulator, you'd actually see 3 instances of it go by because it was trying to resend the text but failing. Are you also seeing this for inbound text messages as well?</p>

<p>If it's just for outbound SMS messages then look at the SMS status field. A -1 value indicates a failure.</p>
