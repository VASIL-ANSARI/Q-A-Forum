<p>POSTing directly to the url should work, as presumably the website has a form with an ajax popup to make sure you <em>really</em> want to submit the form, THEN POSTs the data to the URL. It wouldn't work to POST the data first and then fire the popup (as the form is already submitted so it's too late to do anything about it)</p>
