<p>You are using a wrong data structure here. You should take a look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Dictionary</a>. And then use it like this (perhaps)</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;string, List&lt;DateTime&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>where string will be the station name, and List will contain your departing times.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can create your own class and store all the attributes of your station in that class. Then you can use that in dictionary or via direct LINQ queries.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>You need to use nested for loops to loop through the multi-dimensional arrays. Take a look <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8184306/iterate-through-2-dimensional-array-c-sharp">here</a></p>
