<p>This is <strong>an invalid</strong> question (it contains output of other code then provided), you are probably running the second (after initialization) part multiple times in your interpreter. The output of your code should look like</p>

<pre><code>-------------------

  List:  [[10], [10], [10]]
  Data: 10

at 1
  List:  [[10, 20], [10, 20], [10, 20]]
  Data: 20
-------------------
at 2
  List:  [[10, 20, 30], [10, 20, 30], [10, 20, 30]]
  Data: 30
</code></pre>
