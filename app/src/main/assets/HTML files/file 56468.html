<p>Ive created an easy to read version of your code <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/samando27/uvyfncze/" rel="nofollow">here</a> that just focuses on the query that is failing.</p>

<pre><code>function add_to_cart(){
   var quantity = $("#quantity span").html();
   console.log(quantity);    // 1
}
</code></pre>

<p>Initially your code is correct and a value of 1 is logged, however as soon as you increment/decrement the value it fails. This is due to your click event handlers</p>

<pre><code>$(this).parent().find('.value')
</code></pre>

<p>selects the spans parent div and overwrites its contents. Appending the same selectors to your increment/decrement functions should solve the issue.</p>
