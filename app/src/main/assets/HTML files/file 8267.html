<p>In general when you "unproject" a clip space point like [x,y,z,1] you will get a point on a ray emanating from the eye point (and in your case going through the vertex you clicked on).  The value of z will determine where you are on that ray.  You're almost guaranteed to not get back the point you clicked on.</p>

<p>So what you want to do is calculate that ray (say by unprojecting two points like [x,y,0,1] and [x,y,1,1] and calculating the line that the unprojected points are on), and then testing which of your vertices lies on that ray.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Also, you want to make sure that you've divided the first three coordinates of <code>world1</code> by the fourth coordinate.</p>
