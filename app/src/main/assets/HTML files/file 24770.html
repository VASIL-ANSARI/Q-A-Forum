<p>This is probably not what you want to hear, but....</p>

<p>While you could probably get this working by using the correct database server address, and fiddling around with a bunch of other bits, you really shouldn't.</p>

<p>Oracle is a server-side technology, and Android, obviously, is a client.
Most sane people stopped using this sort of Client-Server database access quite a number of years ago for very good reasons...to the point where it's pretty much a nostalgic joke now.</p>

<p>IMHO, you should build a server application, in the language of your choice, that presents an HTTP-based API (XML, JSON, etc.) to your Android application.</p>

<p>Then, either use the API directly from your Android app, or use the API to keep your Android's local sqlite database synched with some subset of the Oracle database.</p>

<p>There's lots of examples of doing both available through your favorite web search engine.</p>
