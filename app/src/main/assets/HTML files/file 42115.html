<p>Same as with most questions related to hardware requirements:
You'll probably find out by testing with different hardware setups.
As you'll need to test Android apps with various devices anyway, that should not be a big deal.
We can't know the font size and neither can we estimate the complexity of your algorithms. Also I assume that the font(s) which you use has an important influence, depending on the distinctness of their chars rendering.
Plus, if the image is blurred, that'll negatively influence the resources you need.</p>
