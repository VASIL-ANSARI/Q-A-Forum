<p>I think the problem here is that when you rerender the events, the eventMouseOver immediately triggered again, causing another rerender, and so on, until you keep the mouse on an event.</p>

<p>To prevent this, there are multiple solutions, e.g.: mark the event (add an attribute to it), and check this in your function, so when it is called again, you just skip. Of course this requires that when you mouseout, you unmark the event.</p>

<p>Another one is that you use a variable, if it is different than the current event title you mouseover-ed, save this new title and call the rerender. In the eventRender callback, check is the given event has the same title, if yes, change its border.</p>
