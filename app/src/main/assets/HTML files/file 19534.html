<p>I'd suggest to reinstall the Xcode. Xcode (at least the App Store version) is not owned by the user who installed it:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -ld /Applications/Xcode.app
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102  4 Oct 17:34 /Applications/Xcode.app
</code></pre>

<p>Also doing <code>chmod a+rwx</code> or <code>a=rwx</code> is certainly not a good idea. Not all files need to be executable (<code>x</code>) and what's worse <strong>adding <code>rw</code> without thinking twice makes your system vulnerable</strong>.</p>
