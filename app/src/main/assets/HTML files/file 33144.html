<p>You need to refactor your code to make it more testable.  That's the primary benefit of TDD - if the code's hard to test, then it's probably hard to maintain, understand, etc.</p>

<p>Regarding your example code, for testing class C, the unit test should just test methods on C, like your example shows.  Don't worry about invalid input to C - that's not a responsibility of C so it isn't tested in the unit test for C.</p>

<p>To test the validations, you'll write a unit test for class A and call the validation method with different inputs and check the result.</p>
