<p>can I suggest that you use a Null Layout for the parent component?</p>

<p>setLayout(null);</p>

<p>then use a setBounds(xPos,yPos, Width, Height);</p>

<p>to position the components on the panel etc?</p>

<p>Doing this will prevent Java's UI Manager to manage the components to the Frame, Panel etc.</p>

<p>That seems to be the easiest and less painful way.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
