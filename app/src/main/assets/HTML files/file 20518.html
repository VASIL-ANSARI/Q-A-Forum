<p>In the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/13_ManagingIn-AppPurchases_Robert/ManagingIn-AppPurchases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH4-SW1">iTunes development guide</a>, there's list of how long auto-renew subscriptions last in sandbox mode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sandbox Testing Your In-App Purchases</strong> </p>
  
  <p>You are required to test your in-app purchases in a sandbox environment before you submit them for
  review by Apple. You must first sign out of your iTunes Store account
  from your test device Settings before attempting to use the sandbox
  environment. If you mistakenly use your test-user-account credentials
  to log in to a production environment on your test device (instead of
  in to your test environment), your account credentials become invalid
  and cannot be used as a test account again. For more details on how to
  avoid mistakes during test account use, see âUsing Test User
  Accounts.â</p>
  
  <p>When testing auto-renewable in-app purchase subscriptions in the
  sandbox environment, the duration times will be compressed to allow
  for more streamlined testing. Additionally, a sandbox subscription
  will only auto-renew a maximum of 6 times. After the subscription has
  auto-renewed 6 times, it will no longer renew in the sandbox. The
  compressed duration times are as follows:</p>
