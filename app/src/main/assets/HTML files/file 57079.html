<p>In the EXPOPRT_CSV_BUTTON I was missing a getSelectedFile() call.</p>

<pre><code>File file = new File(TextFileHandler.getChooser().getSelectedFile().getPath() + ".csv");
</code></pre>

<p>The creates the file with no problems. I have also refactored my obfuscated code thank you for pointing that out.</p>
