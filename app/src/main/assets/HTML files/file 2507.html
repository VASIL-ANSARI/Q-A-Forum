<p>I don't think you can consider the date and time separately.  If you want to know what was active between 1500 and 1700 on the 02/02/2010, and the row has an Active date of 01/01 and the Inactive date of 03/03, then it was active the entire day on 02/02, so the start/end time in the DB isn't relevant.</p>

<p>If the Active or Inactive date occurs on the date in question (02/02) <em>then</em> you need to consider the time.</p>

<p>I think you want something like this pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>   (ActivateDate &lt; @StartDate OR ( 
        ActivateDate = @StartDate And ActivateTime &lt;= @ShiftStartTime )
    )
and (InActivateDate &gt; @EndDate OR ( 
        InActivateDate = @EndDate And InActivateTime &gt;= @ShiftEndTime )
    )
</code></pre>
