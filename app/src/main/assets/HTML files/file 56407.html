<p>In redux-saga your sagas are written as generator functions that yield a sequence of side effects. You can think of each of these side effects as the "sub-transactions." Obviously one is written about databases and the other a JS state management framework (which in a sense is a "database" for a front end app), so a similar approach can be applied to running complex, potentially async sequences of logic on those data. I believe that's inspiration behind the implementation of redux-saga and the reason for calling them sagas. </p>
