<p>jQueryUI dialog plugin binds keydown event handler to the dialog wrapper, not to 'body'.
So when you bind handler to body, and event happens on dialog, the dialog handler will be executed first according to events bubbling principle.</p>

<p>So, I think, what you can do - is just to invoke dialog with <code>closeOnEscape : false</code>, and handle ESC key on body in any way you like, as you already do. </p>

<p>To close dialog you can just call <code>$("#PersonDialog").dialog("close")</code> from there.</p>
