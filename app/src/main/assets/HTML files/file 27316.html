<p>I don't think you'll find an easy way to do this. Mostly because HtmlUnit is a headless browser and not such a low-level library to operate on the connections (as the Apache HttpClient classes that are used by HtmlUnit).</p>

<p>Probably, you should reconsider the use of HtmlUnit. If you still want to use HtmlUnit then I guess you'll have to see the code of the <code>DebuggingWebConection</code> to use it as guidance and create your own <code>WebConnection</code> implementation, which would likely inherit from <code>WebConnectionWrapper</code>. Then you'll have to handle the creation and maintainance of the list of connections yourself.</p>
