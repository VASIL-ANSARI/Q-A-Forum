<p>You will probably save yourself a lot of time and heartache by just integrating this <a href="http://silverlightfileupld.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Silverlight File Upload</a> codeplex project into your app.</p>

<p>You can't actual get good progress information from the standard <code>WebRequest</code> or <code>WebClient</code> components.  Not only do they not send any of the Request stream until your code has finished writing to it (a decision I can't begin to understand), it doesn't provide any progress events once it starts sending it.  For reasons I can't begin to fathom you can get progress events when sending a string, go figure.</p>

<p>I can only guess that these limitations arise from Silverlight needing to operate in multiple browsers and therefore the interface to the Browser HTTP transport is kept as basic as possible.</p>
