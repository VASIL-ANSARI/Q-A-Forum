<p>You could do something like this to convert the strings to numbers and back again:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT NAME, 
CASE WHEN MINSEQ=1 THEN 'GOLD'
     WHEN MINSEQ=2 THEN 'SILVER' 
     ELSE 'BRONZE'
END
FROM
(select NAME,
MIN(CASE WHEN SCORE='GOLD' THEN 1 WHEN SCORE='SILVER' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END) AS MINSEQ
FROM TABLE
GROUP BY NAME) AS T
</code></pre>

<p>A better solution will be to assign a number to each score in another table and join to that table. </p>

<pre><code>SCORE  RANK
GOLD    1
SILVER  2
BRONZE  3
</code></pre>

<p>That way you don't have to hard code the conversion from score to rank.</p>
