<p>What you're trying to do is not possible, but there is a workaround; unfortunately, the answer might taste like bathtub gin. As you are probably aware, you cannot directly <code>require</code> Stylus. Accordingly, your forced to use a Stylus loader which you have two options, stylus-loader or Walmarts <a href="https://github.com/walmartlabs/stylus-relative-loader" rel="nofollow">stylus-relative-loader</a>, I would recommend the latter. Here is where things get a bit convoluted. Since you want to use CSS modules and compile the styles into a stylesheet, you will have to use the <a href="https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin" rel="nofollow">extract-text-webpack-plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Long story short, if you are using Webpack 1.x here's an example configuration of the loader which you will need to implement into your Webpack config, which uses extract-text-webpack-plugin, css-modules, and stylus-relative-loader.</p>

<pre><code>  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.styl$/,
      loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract('style-loader', 'css?modules&amp;importLoaders=1&amp;localIdentName=[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]!stylus-relative-loader')
    }]
  },
  plugins: [
    new ExtractTextPlugin('main.css')
  ]
</code></pre>

<p>From here all you need to do is move your Stylus to a separate file like <code>my-styles.styl</code> and then <code>require</code> it into your React component like so.</p>

<pre><code>const styles = require('./my-styles.styl')

const HelloWorld = () =&gt; &lt;div className={styles.hello} /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>PS. Sorry, if this is not what you're looking for but my "reputation" does not allow me to ask questions via comments nor can I use more than two links.</p>
