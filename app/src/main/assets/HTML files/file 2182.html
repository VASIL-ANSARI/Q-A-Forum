<p>Some sample output would really help, but this is a guess at what you mean, assuming you want that information for each ID_Number/Status combination:</p>

<pre><code>select ID_Number, Status, EndDate - StartDate as DaysElapsed
from (
    select ID_Number, Status, min(coalesce(received_date, status_date)) as StartDate, max(coalesce(closed_date, status_date)) as EndDate
    from Table1
    group by ID_Number, Status
) a
</code></pre>
