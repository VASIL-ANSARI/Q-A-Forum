<p>After reading your question, I decided to investigate.  I found that the, <em>"Target must be an event emitter"</em> error only occurs when trying to capture the <strong>onEnd</strong> event from a combined animation.  It does not occur for chained animations.</p>

<p>After some digging around I noticed that combined animations seemed to have a _connects property, which suggested it was using the old depreciated <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojo/connect.html" rel="nofollow">"dojo/_base/connect"</a> functionality.  This is probably a bug in Dojo (or rather code that got missed in the most recent upgrades).  Had a look on the <a href="http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/" rel="nofollow">Dojo Trac</a> but not found anything yet, will probably open a new ticket for this one.</p>

<p>There are two work-arounds that I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojo/connect.html" rel="nofollow">"dojo/_base/connect"</a></p>

<pre><code>connect.connect(animation, "onEnd", function(){
    // connect == dojo/base/connect
})
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Connect to the onEnd event directly (or use <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.8/dojo/aspect.html#dojo-aspect" rel="nofollow">"dojo/aspect"</a>)</p>

<pre><code>animation.onEnd(function(){
});
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Neither of these ways are ideal, as you'll probably have to change your code to a <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.8/dojo/on.html" rel="nofollow">dojo/on</a> version at some future date.</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> Looks like someone else has already reported this as a bug, <a href="http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/16305" rel="nofollow">see here</a>.</p>
