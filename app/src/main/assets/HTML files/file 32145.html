<p><code>v()</code> is being called in the context of the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> element, not an array. Hence, the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> doesn't have a method <code>reduce()</code>. This is because <code>for ... in</code> iterates over non-numeric properties just as much as numeric properties. I would recommend using <code>some_array['head'].forEach()</code> instead.</p>
