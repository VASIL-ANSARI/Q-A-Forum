<p><strong>titleLabel</strong> method of UIButton is read-only.</p>

<p>Although this property is read-only, its own properties are read/write. Use these properties primarily to configure the text of the button. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>UIButton *button                  = [UIButton buttonWithType: UIButtonTypeSystem];
button.titleLabel.font            = [UIFont systemFontOfSize: 12];
button.titleLabel.lineBreakMode   = UILineBreakModeTailTruncation;
</code></pre>

<p>Create custom class for UIButton as you create for label and set property in it.</p>
