<p>I've actually done this a long time ago, but it wasn't petty.  What we did is use the <a href="http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Sawfish window manager</a> and wrote a hook to recognize the flashplayer window, then strip all the decorations and snap it full screen.</p>

<p>This may be possible without using the window manager, by registering for X window creation events from an external application, but I'm not familiar enough with X11 to tell you how that would be done.</p>

<p>Another option would be to write a pygtk application that embedded the standalone flash player inside a gtk.Socket and then resized itself.  After a bit of thought, this might be your best bet.</p>
