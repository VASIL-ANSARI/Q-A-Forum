<p>I tried your program but it seems to work fine for me. The <code>ThrowUnhandledException</code> gets called 3 times. All three messages get appended to the TextBox.</p>

<p>I tried adding a MessageBox:</p>

<pre><code>ThrowUnhandledException(1);
ThrowUnhandledException(2);
ThrowUnhandledException(3);

MessageBox.Show("Hello");
</code></pre>

<p>but that works as expected too. I get the message box but if I put a breakpoint on the exception handler it gets called three times. And when I close the message box, I can see all three messages in the MyForm window.</p>
