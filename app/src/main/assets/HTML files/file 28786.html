<p>In sql server your query would generate a group by related error, because not all the non-aggregated columns appear in the group by clause.</p>

<p>Accordingly I expect that your problem will go away once you either:</p>

<p>a) add the other non-aggregated columns into the group by clause, or
b) restructure your logic to build (1) a query with just model_name and the aggregated data which is then joined to (2) a query providing all the other data you want in your result set.</p>
