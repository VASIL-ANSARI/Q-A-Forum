<p>You should ask yourself what the mission critical code is for your project - reading files or parsing their content. For my projects, parsing was the interesting part, so I placed files to parse as test resources, read them in the unit test to string and pass them to the parser to unit test the parser. It is also possible to include the contents directly in unit tests as big ugly strings, but when you have a dedicated place for test resources, why not use it.</p>
