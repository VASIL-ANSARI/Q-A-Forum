<p>You just aspecify the index you want - <code>beds.add(bedNumber, patient);</code></p>

<p>This pushes the patients that were prior to the addition in locations <code>bedNumber</code> and later to bedNumber+1 ...., thus bringing your list back to the original order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>public void add(int index,
         E element)</p>
  
  <p>Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (adds one to their indices).</p>
