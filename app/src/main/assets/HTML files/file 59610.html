<p>From DDD (Domain Driven Design) the responsibility of a repository is to take care of loading, storing, modifying and deleting an entity on the designated data storage (which may or may not be a database -- it may even be a remote server or just a file).</p>

<p>A service, on the other hand, has (or should have) a very narrow responsibility of performing some useful activity. Each service is instantiated separately and then injected into code in the application layer or above, which acts as a bridge (Bridge pattern). This approach has proven to be very advantageous because it allows to manage the dependencies between otherwise unrelated (uncoupled) code.</p>

<p>Those two definitions and the origin of the concepts shows that they actually are very different things. By <em>pure chance</em> you noticed that a repository and a service have an apparent overlap, but that's due to implementation details or plain misuse. Their responsibilities may under circumstances go hand in hand (giving rise to a collaboration) but they really are orthogonal concepts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Repositories should arise from a deep layer (Persistance or DAL, Data Access Layer). Services, on the other hand, often are vertical cross-cutting or arise on the application layer.</p>

<p>Through proper layering the differences between repositories and services become even more apparent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not think about them as pure code artifacts you can move around. They are well-defined concepts useful to understand about and design the structure of a system. They decline into actual code only as a consequence of that design.</p>

<p>I hope I succeeded in writing something that clears up some ideas and is not confusing.</p>
