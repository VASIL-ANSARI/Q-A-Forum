<p>Heed the compiler warnings! :)</p>

<p>You have defined <code>char breakStatus[20];</code>, i.e. an array of characters. Then, in the printf statement, you've got <code>printf("...%s...", breakStatus[0]);</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>%s</code> formatting code expects a pointer to a string. breakStatus[0], however, is a char value. The compiler warns you about what it does to fix that: it turns the char value into a char * pointer (char value = 0 => pointer address is 0). Suppose the char value happens to be zero, then the whole thing magically turns into a NULL pointer. Trying to dereference a NULL pointer (or a 0xff pointer, perhaps... the value is essentially random, after all) almost inevitably causes a segfault.</p>

<p>(Update: what Vlad said... "did you mean: %c")</p>
