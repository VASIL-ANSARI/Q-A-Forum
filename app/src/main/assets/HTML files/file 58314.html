<p>I'm not sure I've understood your question correctly but sounds like you want to convert an array of strings which represent hex bytes into a number. </p>

<p>If you've got a string representation of hex numbers you could convert them using something like:</p>

<pre><code>function bufferToInt(buff) {
    var string = buff.join('');
    return parseInt(string, 16); // parseInt allows specifying a base
}

bufferToInput(['ff', 'ff']); // This returns 65535
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming each element in buff contained a string representation of a hex byte such as "ff" the above should allow simple conversion to an number using mainly built in functions.</p>
