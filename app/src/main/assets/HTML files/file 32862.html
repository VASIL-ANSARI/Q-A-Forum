<p>They are not equal. <code>auto</code> is not a valid value for <code>max-width</code>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a value that means "there is no upper bound for the width of this element", that value is <code>none</code> (see the spec on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#min-max-widths" rel="nofollow"><code>max-width</code></a>).</p>

<p><code>none</code> is not equal to 100% either, however. The value 100% means that an element can only be as wide as the constraints of its containing block at most (see the spec on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#the-width-property" rel="nofollow">the <code>width</code> property</a> for details on percentage widths).</p>

<p>With <code>none</code>, you could still cause the element to be wider than its containing block (which would typically result in overflow), e.g. by setting <code>width: 150%</code> on the element. With a max width of 100%, that limit would simply take precedence over the 150% setting.</p>
