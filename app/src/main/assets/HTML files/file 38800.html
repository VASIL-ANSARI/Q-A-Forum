<p>The trigger will completely run for every single row, see <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/faqs-triggers.html#qandaitem-A-5-1-3" rel="nofollow">Trigger FAQ</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A.5.3: Does MySQL 5.6 have statement-level or row-level triggers?</p>
  
  <p>In MySQL 5.6, all triggers are FOR EACH ROWâthat is, the trigger is
  activated for each row that is inserted, updated, or deleted. MySQL
  5.6 does not support triggers using FOR EACH STATEMENT.</p>

<p>That is valid for the currently newest version, <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/faqs-triggers.html#qandaitem-A-5-1-3" rel="nofollow">MySQL 5.7</a> too.</p>
