<p>Not all KitKat devices will support these sensors from my understanding of the <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.4.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both step sensors are hardware dependent (Nexus 5 is the first device to support them), so you should check for availability with hasSystemFeature(), using the FEATURE_SENSOR_STEP_DETECTOR and FEATURE_SENSOR_STEP_COUNTER constants.</p>
