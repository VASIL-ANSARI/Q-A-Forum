<p>You could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>mouse_event(MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE | MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE, 20000, 20000, 0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Note the dx and dy parameters on in the range of 0 and 65535 and not the actual screen coordinates. I suppose you could convert them if you wanted to. Also, you can leave out the <code>MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE</code> flag if you want to move the pointer relative to it's last position.</p>
