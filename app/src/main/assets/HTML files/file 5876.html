<p>The proxies of the GWT-P framework have nothing to do with the client server communication. Their solely purpose is to listen for events that indicate that their associated presenter and view need to be created. As written on the GWT-P site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proxies are the key to a fast MVP web application, they enable code splitting and lazy instantiation of the largest part of your code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume that the Restlet proxies you're referring to deal with the communication between client and server.</p>

<p>So no, they're not a replacement for the GWT-P proxies.</p>
