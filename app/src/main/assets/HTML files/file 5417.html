<p>I would say that before you learn any kind of PHP framework you first understand PHP as well as you possibly can, it pros and cons and its nuances. Many will argue that using a framework straight off means you are learning the framework not the language.</p>

<p>Once you become comfortable with PHP then go ahead and learn a framework, you're right, a lot of PHP development jobs do require prior framework experience.</p>
