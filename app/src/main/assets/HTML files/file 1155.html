<p>The reason the first constructor doesn't work is that ASP.NET does not load the user profile store, which is the default store if you don't specify a storage location using <code>X509KeyStorageFlags</code>. However, the machine store is always loaded by ASP.NET, which is why the second constructor works.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that you intend to use the private key on the certificate for encryption or  creating digital signatures (hashing), in which case you can't avoid using a certificate store as private keys can only be accessed programmatically from imported certificates, and not directly from blobs or files.</p>

<p>I don't think the certificate store is used if the certificate data only contains the public key (as there is no sensitive data to protect) - I've noticed that I only need to specify the machine store when I intend to work with certificates that contain a private key.</p>

<p>I can't comment on the Rackspace situation though - there may be issues with importing certificates in code running in a partially-trusted environment, as loading a private key container demands specific permissions that may not be granted to your assembly.</p>
