<p>You can certainly send messages through RabbitMQ from Java.  There is a Java client-side library for interfacing with RabbitMQ - <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html</a></p>

One flavour uses JSON, and there are lots of existing Java libraries for reading and writing in JSON; see <a href="http://json.org" rel="nofollow">http://json.org</a></p>

<p>The page linked above includes code snippets, and the RabbitMQ Java library has some (small) examples.  (At least, that's what the page says.)</p>
