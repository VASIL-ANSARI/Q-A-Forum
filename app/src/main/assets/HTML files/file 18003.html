<p>You problably want to take a look on <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/prog_guide%3asprites" rel="nofollow">how to create sprites</a> at <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/" rel="nofollow">cocos2d</a>.</p>

<p>Cocos2d comes with a set of tools that help you to animate single parts and offers abstractions to compose parts (like <code>CCBatchNode</code> or <code>CCNode</code>). Also, it comes with tools that helps you to pack sprites into sprite sheets (e.g <a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/Creating_and_using_Sprite_Sheets_in_Cocos2D-X_with_Texture_Packer" rel="nofollow">Texture Packer</a>) and develop levels (e.g <a href="http://maniacdev.com/2011/07/tutorial-building-complete-games-with-spritehelper-and-levelhelper/" rel="nofollow">Level Helper</a>).</p>

<p>Cocos2d is an open source framework and it is widely used. You also have <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/tag/cocos3d" rel="nofollow">cocos3d</a> but I never used it :).</p>
