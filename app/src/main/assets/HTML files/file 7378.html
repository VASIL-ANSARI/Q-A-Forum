<p>There are (more than) 2 ways of doing this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/latest/qgraphicsitemgroup.html" rel="nofollow">QGraphicsItemGroup </a>which
handles grouping of your tile items
for you. It moves, selects, updates
it's group members as if they are
one. I've never used it but from the
doc, it seems to work with typical
applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Paint the tiles yourself in the
paint() of one custom item. This
gives you total control on how to
place and draw the tiles while the
item truly acts as one item since it
is, well, one item. This is what I
do.</p></li>
</ol>
