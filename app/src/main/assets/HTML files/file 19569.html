<p>There isn't an easy way to do this that I'm aware of (speaking as a core Drizzle developer, former MySQL developer and currently at Percona as Director of Server Development). You may be able to get somewhere with Continuent for replicating from MySQL to Drizzle though.</p>

<p>While you may get some success with the FEDERATED or FEDERATEDX engines... I wouldn't bet that your access patterns make that remotely efficient.</p>

<p>The best bet is to move away from stored procedures - they're a maintenance and scalability nightmare anyway (schema versioning is hard, having application code in schema just makes it harder).</p>
