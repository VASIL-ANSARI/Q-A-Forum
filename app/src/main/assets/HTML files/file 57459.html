<h2> <em>Broadcasting means sending a message to everyone else except for the socket that starts it.</em></h2>

<h2>Sending and receiving events</h2>

<p>Socket.IO allows you to emit and receive custom events. Besides connect, message and disconnect, you can emit custom events:</p>

<p>Server:</p>

<pre><code>// note, io(&lt;port&gt;) will create a http server for you
var io = require('socket.io')(80);

io.on('connection', function (socket) {
  io.emit('this', { will: 'be received by everyone'});

  socket.on('private message', function (from, msg) {
    console.log('I received a private message by ', from, ' saying ', msg);
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', function () {
    io.emit('user disconnected');
  });
});
</code></pre>
