<p>You can use only one or two (for title and price) hidden input rather separate inputs for each values...all you need to do is use some special characters like ';','#' as a delemeter to seperate each values.. and when user delete the row just remove that value from the entire string....you can do it easily using javascript..</p>

<p>so ultimately you will have to submit only one (or two) hidden values...</p>
