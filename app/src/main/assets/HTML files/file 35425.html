<p>You can try to use the sf 1.5. version maintained by guys from L'Express: <a href="https://github.com/LExpress/symfony1" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/LExpress/symfony1</a> (they have fixed the problem)</p>

<p>If their changes are too much you can check how they managed to solve the 'e modifier' problem and copy their solution. Searching the code for use of <code>pregtr</code> it looks that there are only three places where the <code>e</code> modifier is used (in <code>lib/util/sfInflector.class.php</code> and in filter form classes in the <code>Doctrine</code> and <code>Proper</code> plugins). It's not that difficult to fix the code by yourself in those places.</p>
