<p>This is usually caused by whitespace being output by a file that is included before a session is started.</p>

<p>Make sure there's no extraneous whitespace (including new lines, spaces, etc.) in your <code>application/config/production/database.php</code> file. The very first characters in that file should be <code>&lt;?php</code> and you should omit the closing <code>?&gt;</code> tag entirely to ensure you don't get a problem with, say, <code>?&gt;\n</code>...</p>
