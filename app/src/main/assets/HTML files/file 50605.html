<p>I guess thats the drastic downside of SugarORM. If you <em>have</em> to use the combination of SugarORM and the FlickrJ Android library, your options are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change the source of FlickrJ so all the classes that you want to use extend <code>SugarRecord</code> or</p></li>
<li><p>Write own versions of all needed classes, let them extend <code>SugarRecord</code> and write some type of converter between the original classes and your own classes (cumbersome). </p></li>
</ol>
