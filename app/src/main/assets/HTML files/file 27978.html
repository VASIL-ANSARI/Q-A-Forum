<p>What you have written so far will return the <em>initial</em> data stream. To duplicate the behavior in a browser you need something implementing all the functionality (html parsing, DOM building, javascript execution, css rendering, fetching linked data, etc) of a browser to handle the dynamically generated DOM content.  Reading data from a <code>HttpURLConnection</code> is just the first of many required steps. By the time you're done you will have duplicated a modern browser.  That's a huge amount of work.</p>
