<p>Print line to see the pseudo-regex it's matching.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print line
{!W:(:
) [{":" !W:(:
)}]... LineEnd}
</code></pre>

<p>If I understand this right, it's looking for non colon non newline characters, which stops at the first newline (which in your example string2, takes the entire line), then looks for a colon and more words, if they exist (they don't), then the newline.  My guess is the newline instance is getting dropped somehow, not that your assertion that it would not match the string if it couldn't match the newline is false.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print line.parseString('xyzyy')
['xyzyy']
</code></pre>

<p>This does leave the question why it matches even without the newline...</p>
