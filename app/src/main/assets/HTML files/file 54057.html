<p>The version of EL used n XPages doesn't have support for calling methods with parameters. If <code>getPCStatus()</code> were a zero-argument method, you could call it with <code>#{CacheBean.pCStatus}</code>, presumably, but as it is it's the parameter that's in your way.</p>

<p>There are a few common workarounds: if CacheBean itself implements <code>Map</code> or <code>DataObject</code>, then EL will call the <code>get</code> or <code>getValue</code> method, respectively, with whatever you put after the "." - you could use that to sort of fake method calls.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could keep <code>CacheBean</code> a POJO (not implementing one of those interfaces) but have the return value from <code>getPCStatus</code> itself be a <code>Map</code> or <code>DataObject</code>, which would take whatever value you pass in (in this case, <code>PCModelBean.status</code>) and do the lookup, with a binding like <code>#{CacheBean.pCStatus[PCModelBean.status]}</code>. <code>DataObject</code>s aren't too bad to write: <a href="https://frostillic.us/blog/posts/FE0AE00B7CEC4F8885257D46006CAB68" rel="nofollow">https://frostillic.us/blog/posts/FE0AE00B7CEC4F8885257D46006CAB68</a></p>

<p>Or, as an complete alternative to all of this, if you don't need your binding to be read+write, you could use SSJS to call the method.</p>
