<p>As @Chris said, there are no shortcuts with JPEG. However - and I realise that this is a long shot - you can specify the compression rate directly if you are willing to use JPEG2000 instead of JPEG. If you look at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jj2000/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/jj2000/j2k/encoder/Encoder.java" rel="nofollow">Encoder</a> class in this <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jj2000/" rel="nofollow">JJ2000 library</a>, you'll see how to fix the bitrate of the encoded image.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as JPEG2000 support is nowhere near as widespread as JPEG, I fear this may not be much use to you.</p>
