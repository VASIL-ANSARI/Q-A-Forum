<p>It isn't clear to me exactly what your question means because you have conflicting words in the title and the first sentence (that indicate a different direction to the question), but here are two possible interpretations/answers.</p>

<p>Assuming the <code>$http</code> indicates AngularJS, then if you want to do a GET immediately after you receive a <code>'event_of_my_api'</code> event on the socket, then you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>socket.on('event_of_my_api', function(data){
    console.log('my api is working');
    $http.get('path/to/my/api').success(...);
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to do a GET immediately after you set up the event handler for the 'event_of_my_api' event without waiting for that event to actually be received, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>socket.on('event_of_my_api', function(data){
    console.log('my api is working');
});
$http.get('path/to/my/api').success(...);
</code></pre>

<p>If neither of these is the desired direction, then please clarify the question further as to exactly what you want the timing to be.</p>

<p>There seem to be several issues with using promises for this.  First off, <code>socket.on()</code> doesn't return a promise and secondly promises are for one-shot operations so using a single promise does not lend itself to events which could occur repeatedly (a promise will only change state once and then it is latched in that state).</p>
