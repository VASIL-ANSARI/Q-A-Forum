<p>There are a couple of ways to do this...one would be to "shell out" to Python by invoking a system call from your C# program. There, you would be looking to use the .NET runtime  Process.Start method to run the Python interpreter as a subprocess from your C# program.</p>

<p>Another option would be to use a tighter integration between C# and Python by using the <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">IronPython interpreter</a>.  IronPython (ipy), is the python interpreter implemented in .NET
ipy can run Python code (essentially the same as normal "c" python, but with some differences), but can also import .NET assemblies and interact with the .NET runtime, directly.</p>
