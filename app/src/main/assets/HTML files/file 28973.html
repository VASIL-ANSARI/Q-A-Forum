<p>Can't tell you about any plugins, but I'm not even sure how such a thing would even be able to tell how to change a flat-case name like <code>myvariable</code>.</p>

<p>Since you're already using Eclipse, probably the easiest approach is to use the <code>Rename</code> refactor option. It is located under <code>Refactor -&gt; Rename</code>. On Windows the shortcut is <code>ALT+SHIFT+R</code>, and <code>OPTION+COMMAND+R</code> on Mac. Simply place the cursor on the entity you wish to rename and either use the menu or hit the shortcut keys.</p>

<p>That will change both the variable (or method, or class...works pretty well on everything)  and all references to that entity, including references from outside the class.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
