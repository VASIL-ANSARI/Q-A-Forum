<p>All your statements are correct, but you are missing one definition, the difference between definition and declaration.</p>

<p><code>int c;</code> both declares <strong>and</strong> defines <code>c</code>, but does not initialize it.</p>

<p><code>extern int c;</code> will declare it but not define it. (It does not allocate storage.)</p>
