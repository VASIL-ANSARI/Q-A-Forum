<p>Last time I checked, you can't specify <a href="http://www2.nl.freebsd.org/mysql/doc/refman/5.1/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_uuid" rel="nofollow">UUID()</a> as the default constraint for a column in MySQL.  That means using a trigger:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TRIGGER
newid
BEFORE INSERT ON your_table_name
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.id = UUID()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know there are ways around that, but I figure the string based id would be better</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand you're after the security by obscurity, but be aware that CHAR/VARCHAR columns larger than 4 characters take more space than INT does (1 byte).  This will impact performance in retrieval and JOINs.</p>
