<p>You have two choices. One is to draw a composite image in code, just drawing the images, positioned as they are by the image view and its subviews, into an image graphics context. In your case, though, a simpler approach would be simply to <em>render</em> or <em>snapshot</em> the image view: that will effectively be a screen shot of the image view and its subviews, which is exactly what the user is seeing.</p>
