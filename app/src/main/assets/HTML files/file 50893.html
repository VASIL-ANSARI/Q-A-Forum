<p>Use a predicate similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>where start_tm &lt;= TO_DATE('2015-JUN-13 23:59:59', 'YYYY-MON-DD HH24:MI:SS')
  and (end_tm is null or TO_DATE('2015-JUN-11 00:00:00', 'YYYY-MON-DD HH24:MI:SS') &lt;= end_tm)
</code></pre>

<p>this will pick up all events which started before the end of your reporting period and ended after the start of your reporting period.</p>

<p>It will not pick up events which ended before the start of your reporting period or started after the end of your reporting period.</p>
