<p>Python has several solutions that may work here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Memcached (as you already know),</li>
<li>pickle (as Blender mentioned) - which of course can be used with eg. Memcached,</li>
<li>several other caching (eg. for local memory) &amp; serialization (eg. <code>simplejson</code>) solutions,</li>
</ul>

<p>In general <code>pickle</code> is very fast (use <code>cPickle</code> if you need more speed) and in Python you do not need anything like <code>var_export()</code> (although you can use <code>repr()</code> on variables to have their valid literal, if they are of one of primitive types). <code>pickle</code> in Python is more similar to <code>serialize</code> in PHP.</p>

<p>Your question is not very specific, but the above should give you some insight. Also you need to take into account that PHP and Python have different philosophies, so solutions to the same problems may look differently. In this specific case <code>pickle</code> module should solve your issues.</p>
