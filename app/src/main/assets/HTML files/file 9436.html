<p>Turn on a few warnings and you will be made painfully aware of the problems.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; gcc -Wall -c main.c
main.c: In function âmainâ:
main.c:2:5: warning: implicit declaration of function âfuncâ
</code></pre>

<p>C will by default assume things about unknown functions.  Good?  Probably not.  Historical.</p>

<p>Also <code>gcc -std=c99</code> will throw the warning as well.</p>
