<p>Generally what I would do is have a phone and a wear app, have the phone app register the listener and do whatever needs to be done, then send a message to the wear device to take whatever action needs to be done there.</p>

<p>The goal is to offload as much as possible onto the phone app and have the wear app simply respond.</p>
