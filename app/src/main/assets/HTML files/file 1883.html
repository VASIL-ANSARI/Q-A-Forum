<p>I butted my head against the SCM giving up causing my service to freeze up like it was sunbathing in Antarctica in June.</p>

<p>The issue for me was that the service did some processing that potentially could take longer than the SCM is willing to wait for it to respond to a stop request.</p>

<p>I like my software to start/exit/pause and even die gracefully.</p>

<p>The solution I implemented was to use a config file. I put an ExecutionMode parameter in the file. At the start of every processing loop, it checks the config file - if ExecutionMode is <em>Pause</em> or <em>Stop</em>, then it executes code to change state and uses SMTP to send an email to the email ids listed in a ServiceChangeNotification paramete. Details included in the email are Machine name, Timestamp, Service Name, Old State, Old State Start Time, Current State, Current State Start Time, Log details.</p>
