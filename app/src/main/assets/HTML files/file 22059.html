<p><code>a.__get__</code> is a way to <em>bind</em> a function to an object. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>class C(object):
    pass

def a(s):
    return 12

a = a.__get__(C)
</code></pre>

<p>is the rough equivalent of</p>

<pre><code>class C(object):
    def a(self):
        return 12
</code></pre>

<p>(Though it's not a good idea to do it this way. For one thing, <code>C</code> won't know that it has a bound method called <code>a</code>, which you can confirm by doing <code>dir(C)</code>. Basically, the <code>__get__</code> does just one part of the process of binding).</p>

<p>That's why you can't do this for a function that takes no arguments- it must take that first argument (traditionally <code>self</code>) that passes the specific instance.</p>
