<p>There are many, many ways to do something like this.</p>

<p>My choice would be:</p>

<pre><code>$string = preg_replace_callback('/[\x00-\x08\x0B\x0C\x0E-\x1F]/',function($char) {
    // format as desired, for instance:
    return "{".dechex(ord($char[0]))."}";
},$string);
</code></pre>

<p>You can define "non-printable" how you want, the one I did there is basically "Everything before Space, but allow Tab, CR and LF".</p>
