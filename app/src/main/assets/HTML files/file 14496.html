<p>According to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/64981/sql-server-2005-how-create-a-unique-constraint">SQL Server 2005 How Create a Unique Constraint?</a> the first answer says that you need a column name, but I see you have written <code>time</code> which is a keyword. If you have a column named <code>time</code>, write <code>[time]</code> instead :)</p>
