<p>This may be an oversimplification but...</p>

<pre><code> public void LoginButton_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    LdapAuthentication auth = new LdapAuthentication("YOURPATH");
    if (auth.IsAuthenticated("YOURDOMAIN", txtId.Text, txtPassword.Text))
    {
        //Login Passed
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming you are using WebForms and your username textbox has the ID "txtId", and your password textbox has ID "txtPassword". </p>

<p>If you are not using WebForms the implementation will be different. As spectacularbob mentioned, we can't really answer your question until we know which UI Framework you are using.</p>
