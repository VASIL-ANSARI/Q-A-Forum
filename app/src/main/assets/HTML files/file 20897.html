<p>In first case you lock on object that it known only within this method, so it is unlikely that anybody else will use the same object to lock on, so such lock is almost useless.  Second variant makes much more sense for me.</p>

<p>At the same time, myClass variable is also known only within this method, so it is unlikely that other thread will access it, so probably lock is not necessary here at all.  Need more complete example to say more.</p>
