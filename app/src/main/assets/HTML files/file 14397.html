<p>This code is written by <a href="http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Josh Smith</a> the WPF Guru to demonstrate MVVM in his excellent book "<a href="http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/advanced-mvvm/" rel="nofollow">Advanced MVVM</a>". </p>

<p>BubbleBurst code has very nice animation for simulating bubble movement. I have run the game and the animation is amazing.</p>

<p>IMO, Your soap bubble movement will be similar to this.</p>
