<p>Try setting the <strong>min-width</strong> property for each side as</p>

<pre><code>.left {
    float: left;
    min-width:250px;
}

.right {
    float: right;
    min-width:250px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also set them to a smaller px size to make the right side stay open at a smaller width. If you really want to be fancy you could create a media query to remove the float at a certain width</p>
