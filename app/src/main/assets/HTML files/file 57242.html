<p>Most people solve this by switching from webrick to thin (or even better, unicorn/puma/passenger). I don't think webrick is designed to run in production.</p>

<p>You could also terminate SSL at apache so that webrick only handles http. (Also, assuming Apache is running on the same box, you don't need to bind to <code>0.0.0.0</code>. Localhost will do, and binding to an external IP sounds like a security vulnerability.)</p>

<p>If you really want to keep webrick and have it handle SSL, you change <code>bin/rails</code> as described in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3640993/how-do-you-configure-webrick-to-use-ssl-in-rails">this other answer</a>.</p>
