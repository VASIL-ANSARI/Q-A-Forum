<p>I think your Option#1 is the best route. Otherwise you get into the business of trying to reconcile create and update actions - which you would need to do to handle Option #2.</p>

<p>You could override the setter for domain name and then perform custom logic, like so:</p>

<p>In your Model:</p>

<pre><code>def domain=(the_domain)
 raise ValidOwnerRequired if verified? &amp;&amp; domain != the_domain
 # if we got here then the this record is new and this is a creation attempt
 @require_domain_verification = true 
 # do other stuff here..
end

def require_domain_verification?
  @require_domain_verification == true
end
</code></pre>

<p>And then have an observer for that model:</p>

<pre><code>def after_save(record)
  if record.require_domain_verification?
    SomeMailer.deliver_domain_verification(record)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Something like that...</p>
