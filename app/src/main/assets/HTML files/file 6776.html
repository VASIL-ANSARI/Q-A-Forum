<p>I used to run <code>xbuild</code> on projects created using Visual Studio as IDE. Worked perfectly! I'm not sure if MonoDevelop generates a <code>.csproj</code> file for your web application but that's the best way to compile ASP.NET, which, however, was supposed to be compiled automatically by <code>xsp</code> on the first request</p>
