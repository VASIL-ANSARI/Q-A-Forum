<p>This reads like expected behavior - the picker belongs to a particular cell, that cell gets reloaded and is not the first responder any more. I <em>guess</em> one had to select a specific element anyway for the picker to appear, i.e. to make it first responder.</p>

<p>So you either need to make it become first responder again after reloading, or update the specific cell directly.</p>
