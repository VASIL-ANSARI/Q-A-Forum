<p>incidences-employees.* is giving you all the fields from that table, which include the two IDs.  One approach is to do two more joins, joining the employee table to the incidences table where employee.idemployee = incidences-employee.createdby and authorizedby.  </p>

<p>Then instead of using .*, you reference each field you want.  You will also make things easier by using aliases like:</p>

<pre><code>select ... from incidences-employee I
join employee E1 on E1.idemployee = I.createdby
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can reference E1.name for the createdby name.</p>
