<p>This just happened to me today on osx yosemite for the json 1.7.3 gem and I have no idea why.  I tried pretty much everything recommended for this problem - setting Archflags, updating command line tools, etc.  I believe the project I wanted to run was just too old (gem install json without the version worked just fine) and I gave up on it.  I frankly have no idea why bundle install was trying to load json 1.7.3 anyways.   </p>

<p>Try using gemsets to keep all of your app dependencies separate from one another. Sometimes that fixes the problem.  </p>

<pre><code>rvm gemset create [some name]
rvm gemset use [some name]
bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps!  I know it's not really an answer but stackoverflow won't let me comment until I have more reputation points.  I'll be following your question to see if anyone can give you an answer.</p>
