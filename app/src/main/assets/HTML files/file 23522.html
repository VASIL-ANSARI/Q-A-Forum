<p>well, turns out I was doing everything ok, just that I had forgotten one extra parameter in the form, a hidden input which had the id of the captcha. 
I just needed to capture the id at the same time that I captured the captcha image, and then send it in the form POST as an extra parameter.</p>

<p>Hope this helps anyone.</p>
