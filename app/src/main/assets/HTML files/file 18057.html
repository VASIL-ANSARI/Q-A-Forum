<p>Note that <code>a.T</code> is only a view on <code>a</code>, which means they hold the same data. Now:</p>

<pre><code> a += a.T
</code></pre>

<p>Adds <code>a.T</code> in place to <code>a</code>, but while doing so, changes <code>a.T</code> (as <code>a.T</code> points at the same data). Since the order of accessing <code>a</code> is a bit more complex, this fails (and you should not trust the result to be reproducable, because it will change when you change <code>np.setbufsize</code>.</p>

<p>To avoid it both of these will work, though the first version seems cleaner to me.</p>

<pre><code>a = a + a.T
a += a.T.copy()
</code></pre>
