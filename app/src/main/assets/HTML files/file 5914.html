<p>That's correct -- you'd create an array of NSEntityDescription objects, then call <code>setEntities:</code> on the new managed object model.  Then, finally, you'd merge that model with your built-in model.</p>

<p>But note that you can't change a model once it has been used to create a managed object context (or used for storage).  You'll need to create new storage and context after the model is changed.</p>
