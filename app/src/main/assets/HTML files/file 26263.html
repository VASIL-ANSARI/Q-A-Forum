<p>You can wrap one of the methods in a class <code>LayoutSizing</code> (maybe a local class), with an abstract method for the calculation on <code>m</code>, with <code>m</code> as parameter and then in both methods instantiate <code>new LayoutSizing() { @Override ... }</code> with the method implemented.</p>

<p>In Java 8 this will then hopefully sill be a bit nicer looking.</p>
