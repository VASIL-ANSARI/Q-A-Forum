<p>I recommend the <a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/subprocess/" rel="nofollow">PyMotW Subprocess page</a> from Doug Hellmann who (quoted) "Reads the docs so you don't have to"</p>

<p>Apart from that:</p>

<pre><code>f = file('sourcefile')
for line in f:
    if 'pattern' in line:
            # mind the , at the end,
            # since there's no stripping involved
            # and print adds a newline without it
            print line, 
</code></pre>

<p>if you need to match regular expressions apart from the documentation in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">Python Standard Library documentation for the re module</a> also refer to the <a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/re/index.html" rel="nofollow">PyMotW Regular Expression page</a></p>
