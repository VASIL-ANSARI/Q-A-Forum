<p>The binding path and mode in the View is correct. That is why you get the value on initialize. Your bound property however is not raising the correct Property Name on property changed. The UI is listening for <code>Note</code> but you are raising <code>m_Note</code>.</p>

<p>You need to update to</p>

<pre><code>private string m_Note;
public string Note
{
    get { return m_Note; }
    set
    {
        m_Note = value;
        if (PropertyChanged != null)
            PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Note"));
    }
} 
</code></pre>
