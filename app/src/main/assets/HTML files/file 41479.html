<p>I can't say for certain, but I think it ought to be fine. Generally Rails is pretty proactive about telling you when you're trying to use a name that'll conflict, so why not try it out and see what happens?</p>

<p>If the table name (as opposed to the model name) turns out to be an issue, you can always use <code>self.table_name = "some_other_table_name"</code> in your model (as described in <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html#overriding-the-naming-conventions" rel="nofollow">Active Record Basics</a>) to give it the name of another table to use.</p>
