<p>You're not executing your query. You're just creating a variable that happens to contain an SQL statement. it's like saying <code>$win = 'Win the lottery';</code> and expecting your bank account to get very large numbers deposited into it.</p>

<pre><code>$sql = 'SELECT ...';
$result = mysql_query($sql) or die(mysql_error());
$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);

$somedata = $row['somefield_from_your_database'];

echo "The value is $somedata";
</code></pre>

<p>is the basic sequence of code you need.</p>
