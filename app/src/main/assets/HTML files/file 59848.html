<p>There is no need to have a separate <code>yield continue</code> statement. Just use <code>continue</code> or any other conditional statement to skip the element as you need within your enumeration algorithm. </p>

<p>The enumeration algorithm that uses <code>yield</code> is internally transformed into a state machine by the compiler, which can the be invoked several times. The point of <code>yield</code> is that it generates an output, effectively pausing / stopping the state machine at the place where it's used. The effect of a possible <code>yield continue</code> would be none at all in respect to the behavior of the state machine. Hence it is not needed.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; YieldTest()
{
    for (int value = 1; value &lt;= 4; value++)
    {
        if (value == 3) continue;  // alternatively use if (value != 3) { â¦ }
        yield return value;
    }
}
</code></pre>
