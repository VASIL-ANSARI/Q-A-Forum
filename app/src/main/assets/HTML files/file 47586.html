<p>I actually would have thought that would work, but I think you can solve it another way.  This worked for me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>remove all references to CoreAudioKit in your target settings <strong>Build Phases</strong> (Link Binary With Libraries)</p></li>
<li><p>make sure there's no similar settings entered in manually. for example, don't add this setting: <code>-weak_framework CoreAudioKit</code> in the <strong>Other Linker Flags</strong></p></li>
<li><p>use preprocessor flags to conditionally compile your code for the simulator:</p></li>
</ol>



<pre><code>#import "ViewController.h"

#if !TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR
@import CoreAudioKit;
#endif

@interface ViewController ()

@end

@implementation ViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
   [super viewDidLoad];
   // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.

#if !TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR
   if ([CABTMIDICentralViewController class]) {   // maybe not needed?
      CABTMIDICentralViewController *vc = [[CABTMIDICentralViewController alloc] init];
   }
#endif
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: in my example above, you might <em>not</em> need to test for the existence of the <code>CABTMIDICentralViewController</code> class. It depends on whether your app is targeting only iOS 8+, or also iOS 7.</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>Per comments below by @Yar and @JeremyHuddlestonSequoia, note that this solution requires you to <strong>Enable Modules</strong> and <strong>Link Frameworks Automatically</strong> in project build settings. These Xcode settings now default to the proper values for this technique, but in case you're managing an older project, make sure they're enabled.</p>
