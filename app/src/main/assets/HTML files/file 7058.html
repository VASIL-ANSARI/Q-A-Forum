<p>Do the HTML page and the service conform to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" rel="nofollow">Same Origin Policy</a>?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>domain name</strong> must be the same, including subdomains (so you couldn't, for example, load a file hosted on test1.example.com in a page on test2.example.com).</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>protocol</strong> (e.g. <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>) must be the same.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>port</strong> must be the same (for example, you can't load a file at example.com:8080 from a page at example.com).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All AJAX requests need to meet this policy - otherwise, as @Mike Miller suggested, you may need to look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP" rel="nofollow">JSONP</a>.</p>
