<p>I've never used stxxl before but since it's a template you can take a look at the code here: <a href="http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/stxxl/trunk/queue_8h_source.html" rel="nofollow">http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/stxxl/trunk/queue_8h_source.html</a>. And since you're a newbie I'll explain a few things. This goofy queue maintains a queue of pointers. Line 00054 shows <code>typedef ValTp value_type</code>, so now your <code>int</code> is a <code>value_type</code>. Line's 00072 &amp; 00073 show that your front and back elements are of that <code>value_type</code>. Do you see how they will be maintained as pointers. Finally if you look at any constructor the <code>pool_type* pool</code> defined on line 00069 will be "new'd" up (which is the basis of your elements) and the <code>init</code> function is always called. And within <code>init</code>, <code>pool-&gt;steal()</code> is called, click on it if you want to learn more.</p>

<p>In short, you need to be pushing new'd up integers onto your queue. Bad interface, not your fault. </p>
