<p>Definitely check the error log (should be available in CPanel).</p>

<p>One common occurrence I see is when a host enables SuPHP (suexec for PHP scripts) and you have group writable scripts or directories containing scripts.</p>

<p>If your error log shows anything like "Apache SoftException", then this is the most likely cause. You need to change the filesystem permissions on your scripts and directories to remove the group "write" bit.</p>

<p>Another possible cause is your host has disabled <code>mod_rewrite</code> or removed the appropriate <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directive-dict.html#Override" rel="nofollow">overrides</a> (FileInfo) to use the <code>Rewrite*</code> directives.</p>
