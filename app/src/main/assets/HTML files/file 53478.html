<p>You are returning a value here: <code>return $month[$monthNum];</code>. After calling <code>$blog-&gt;getPosts()</code> your <code>getPosts()</code> gets executed and returns the first month. It's done then. You can't have a function returning more than one value in this way.
Instead of writing <code>return $month[$monthNum];</code> you could for example build up a string in your function:</p>

<pre><code>$string = '';
for ($monthNum = 1; $monthNum &lt;= 12; $monthNum++) {
    $string .= $month[monthNum];
}
return $string;
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that there'd be more work to do than only these five lines to get a nice output. There are many more ways (and maybe better ways) to get what you want.</p>
