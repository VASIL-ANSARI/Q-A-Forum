<p>I responded to a similar post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10587137/654187">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of options available to you.  You can, of course, test your code pre-generation in, what I claim, is a more unit testing style.  This should test the Java code in isolation, preferably without generated code involved.</p>

<p>You can also test the code post-generation.  The MyActivity_ classes generated by AA can be instantiated directly after compile time and test them accordingly.  I claim this is edging towards an integration testing style.</p>

<p>While, I think it is always better to test than not to test, I think for integration tests, you should test on the hardware in a situation similar to production.  This gives you a total picture of how your application will behave in a real world situation.  Thus, for integration tests I prefer high level "is everything working well together" tests.</p>

<p><a href="http://pivotal.github.com/robolectric/" rel="nofollow">Robolectric</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/robotium/" rel="nofollow">Robotium</a> can help greatly in these two efforts.  Robolectric allows you to instantiate you Activities in a unit test, while Robotium allows you to test selenium style directly on a device.</p>

<p>To recap, I prefer to heavily unit test my code without generation then do some light integration testing to make sure everything is working well together.  </p>
