<p>There was some related discussion in this recent question:<br>

<p>Based on the <code>AudioManager</code> source code, it seems that you must be in "call mode" before the <code>setSpeakerphoneOn</code> method has any effect.</p>

<p>However, I recently saw an application that could seamlessly switch between earpiece and speakerphone while still showing the current stream as the "media" stream, so I would be interested in any further answers.</p>
