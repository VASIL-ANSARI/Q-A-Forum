<p><code>getSupportedCipherSuites()</code> only shows you which ciphers your local SSL implementation can support (regardless of whether they are enabled or not); It does not use the remote connection. So your "debug" output is always going to succeed with the same results, regardless of the target of your <code>SSLSocket</code>. The remote connection is not opened until you attempt to handshake (or if a handshake is forced by attempting to read or write to the stream, or access SSL session information). </p>

<p>Are you confident the outbound TCP connection you are making is to an SSL server? Have you been able to confirm this with a different client, such as a browser or the OpenSSL command line client?</p>
