<p>This is what you need:</p>

<pre><code> SELECT * FROM table WHERE SubId='1' OR SubId IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately in English language, AND and OR can be used interchangeably in certain cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>"I always carry an umbrella for when it rains and snows."</li>
<li>"I always carry an umbrella for when it rains or snows."</li>
</ul>

<p>This is probably why you were trying to build your query with an 'AND'. You may want to check the following Wikipedia article for further information about this problem:</p>
