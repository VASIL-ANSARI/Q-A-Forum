<p>Unsure what version of visual studio you are using. Sounds like you forgot to add the d3d10d.lib file to the linker settings. If you're using 2010, try adding d3d10d.lib to Project->Properties->Linker->Input->Additional Dependancies.</p>

<p>The second problem is a misconfiguration with regards to your include paths. </p>
