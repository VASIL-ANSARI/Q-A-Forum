<p>I agree with @Unex. It is not bad make the DI optional but instead of hardconding in the constructor I would provide a factory in my library.
This way you keep the same loose coupling you get with DI and keep Client class with single responsibility. Why has Client class to know how to construct other classes? Class constructor is about self knowledge, nothing more. Keep in mind that build a entire dependency chain could be big and complex, maybe you have to even read config files at bootstrap, access constants defined in other php module, call utility functions, etc; you don't want to have all this code in a constructor.</p>
