<p>Yes. You can create a relatively positioned div and give it a border-radius of a high number (you'll have to experiment to find at what point it becomes a circle) specify a width and height for it, set it's z-index to being higher than the thing it is sitting on top of and position it in the bottom corner. Something like </p>

<pre><code>#circle{
    border-radius: 300px;
    z-index: 2;
    height: 40px;
    width:40px;
    left: 350px;
    top: 20px;
    background-colour:white;
}
</code></pre>

<p>These are only sample values. You'll need your own to do this correctly. If you wanted to get even more fancy I think you can specify which corners to apply the radius to. So you could (I think) create that exact shape in CSS rather than a circle which my method would do (but you position the circle to cut out just the corner).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: As pointed out, if you want a shadow, you can play about with the css box-shadow attribute(note this is not supported below IE9).</strong></p>
