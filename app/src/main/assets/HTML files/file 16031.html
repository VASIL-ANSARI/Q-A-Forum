<p>Here's the developer page for the View constructors:</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#View%28android.content.Context%29" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#View%28android.content.Context%29</a></p>

<p>The second and third parameters for a View are used if you want this view to have certain attributes or styles set upon the creation of that view.</p>

<p>It looks like you actually want your variable <code>leader</code> to be inflated.  This will take a layout defined in xml and assign it to dynamically created view.  You said that your leaderLayout is a LinearLayout, so it would look something like this.</p>

<pre><code>//Initialize the layout inflator, do this once and use it to inflate as many views as you want
LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater)context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE); 

//Assign your custom view to the variable leader
LinearLayout leader = (LinearLayout) inflator.inflate(R.layout.leaderLayout, tr); 
</code></pre>

<p>The first parameter for inflate is R.layout.<em>nameOfYourXmlFile</em>.  The second is the ViewGroup that will be the parent of your inflated View.  Once this is done, you can use <code>findViewById</code> on leader to get the child views in your Xml file, add more children dynamically, and add it as a child of your TableRow.</p>

<p>Here's the developer page for LayoutInflator, in case you're curious about other usages of the <code>inflate</code> method.</p>
