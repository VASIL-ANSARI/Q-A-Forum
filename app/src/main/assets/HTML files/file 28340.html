<p>I believe this is what you are looking for (<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/2aEGp/2/" rel="nofollow"><strong>jsFiddle</strong></a>). I used a combination of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>width:33.3%</code> and <code>float:left</code> on your columns. I set the first 2 to 33.3% even though there is not a third column but the product image takes the place of the third column.</li>
<li><code>overflow:hidden</code> on the column containers, since the columns are now floating we need to set overflow on it wrapping <code>#tagline</code> div.</li>
<li>Negative <code>margin-top</code> on the product image, so that it goes above the column wrapper. There was no need to add <code>z-index</code>. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can also <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/2aEGp/2/show/" rel="nofollow">view the jsFiddle fullscreen</a> to see how it would look like in a browser window.</p>
