<p>You can use <code>enumerate</code> to do the task...    </p>

<pre><code>def listMembers():               
        for i,name in enumerate(Names):
            age=Ages[i]
            print (name,age)
</code></pre>

<p>Output - </p>

<pre><code>John 22
William 33
Sarah 44
</code></pre>

<p>But as said in the comments its better to use a dictionary here</p>

<p>Another way to do this is to use <code>zip</code>- </p>

<pre><code>def listMembers():               
    for i,j in zip(Names, Ages):
        print (i,j)
</code></pre>

<p>Edit : </p>

<p>As said in the comment you can do it without making direct references, as in real world, the function will be encapsulated within another class so you won't have direct access to data.- </p>

<pre><code>def listMembers(Members):
    names = Members[0]
    ages = Members[1]
    for i, j in zip(names, ages):
        print (i, ", ", j)
</code></pre>
