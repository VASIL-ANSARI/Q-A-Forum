<p>Looking at the code you have provided and not really understanding what you are trying to do, have a look at this and see if it helps.</p>

<pre><code>$query = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE email='$email'"; 
$result = mysqli_query($connect,$query); 
if(mysqli_num_rows($result)&gt;0) 
{ 
    echo 'Email is already exists!'; 
    $sql="UPDATE user SET name='$name',email='$email',gender='$gender',purpose='$purpoââse',MobileNumber='$MââobileNumber', Status='$Status' WHERE Id = ".$_REQUEST['txtid'];
} 
else 
{ 
    if($_POST['txtid']=="0") 
    { 
        $sql = "INSERT INTO user(name,email,gender,purpose,MobileNumber) values ('$name','ââ$email','$gender','$ââpurpose','$MobileNumââber')"; 
    }
}
$query=mysqli_query($connect,$sql); 
</code></pre>

<p>This is untested and I am not sure if you have provided all the code so you may need to edit it a bit before use.</p>

<p>The basic though is that the check for the existing email is completed, if that shows that there is an row containing that email address then you update the row with the new information.  The the email address is not in the database then insert it.</p>
