  <p>Do you see anything wrong with the code?</p>

<p>Yes. Why are you adding the three fields together before you compare them?</p>

<p>I would probably do something like this: (assuming the fields are in the order you wish to sort them in)</p>

<pre><code>@Override public int compare(final Report record1, final Report record2) {
    int c;
    c = record1.getReportKey().compareTo(record2.getReportKey());
    if (c == 0)
       c = record1.getStudentNumber().compareTo(record2.getStudentNumber());
    if (c == 0)
       c = record1.getSchool().compareTo(record2.getSchool());
    return c;
}
</code></pre>
