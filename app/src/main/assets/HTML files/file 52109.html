<p>You add the <code>test</code> node to your <code>root</code> Pane, but then you add it also to <code>infoPane</code>. Since a node can only appear once in the scene graph, you are essentially removing it from the root pane before you can see it.  </p>

<p>Note that you never add <code>infoPane</code> to your scene graph. </p>

<p>I suggest you read <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/layout-tutorial/builtin_layouts.htm#JFXLY102" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a>, and maybe try a few simple layouts with <a href="http://gluonhq.com/open-source/scene-builder/" rel="nofollow">Scene Builder</a>. </p>
