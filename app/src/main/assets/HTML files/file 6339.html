<p>The fact that browsers have more memory shouldn't have anything to do with InProc Sessions and WebGardens as those are <em>server side</em> components. </p>

<p>You see more issues as you increase the number of worker processes because the more number of worker processes the less likely is that your request will be handled by the same worker process when it comes back. In other words if you only have one worker process you have a 1 in 1 chance that it will go back to the same worker process on a second request; if you have two worker processes you have 1 in 2 chances, if you have three worker process you have 1 in 3 chances, and so on.</p>

<p>I wonder why are you trying to use InProc Sessions, though. There is almost no good reason to as they can vanish very easily. See this article <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/Weblog/posts/1986.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.west-wind.com/Weblog/posts/1986.aspx</a></p>
