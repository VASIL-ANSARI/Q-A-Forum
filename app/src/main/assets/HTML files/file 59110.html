<p>You need to encode the values you are sending in your datastring correctly so that they won't be interpreted as special characters in a url (a <code>&amp;</code> separates key-value pairs...):</p>

<p>The easiest way to do that, is to let jQuery handle that by sending an object instead of a string:</p>

<pre><code>// Maybe a name change to dataObject...
var dataString = {
  pairchannels: 1,
  eventname: val1,
  // etc.
};
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to build the query-string yourself you need to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent" rel="nofollow"><code>encodeURIComponent()</code></a> on each individual value.</p>
