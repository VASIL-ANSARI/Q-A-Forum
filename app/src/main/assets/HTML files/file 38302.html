<p>I'm not really sure why this hasn't already come up, so maybe I'm misunderstanding, but you should be able to do something like this.</p>

<pre><code>var fileJson = JToken.Parse(file);

foreach (var item in fileJson["transactions"])
{
    // do stuff
}
</code></pre>

<p>That might have a missing cast in it, it's been a little while since I wrote any serialization code, but that should be the gist of it.</p>
