<p>There is just an insane amount of testing frameworks available to ruby, choosing one comes down to personal preference really. My personal favorite is <a href="https://github.com/thumblemonks/riot" rel="nofollow">riot</a></p>

<p>Riot makes a few assumptions about how tests should be written. Two big ones are that you should be testing one "thing" per test, and that assertions shouldn't modify that "thing". By making those assumptions, tests can be dramatically sped up, since they only need to run the setup once per block (rather then once for every test). </p>

<p>an example from the readme</p>

<pre><code>context "An Array" do
  setup { Array.new }

  context "with one element" do
    setup { topic &lt;&lt; "foo" }
    asserts("is not empty") { !topic.empty? }
    asserts("returns the element on #first") { topic.first == "foo" }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>topic</code> is the way you refer to what was setup in the <code>setup</code>. That is also just the basics of the syntax, there is an idea of "Assertion Macros" which let you DRY up your tests. You could also use <code>denies</code> rather then <code>asserts</code> for a negative assertion. With those two things in mind, the above example could be written as</p>

<pre><code>context "An Array" do
  setup { Array.new }

  context "with one element" do
    setup { topic &lt;&lt; "foo" }
    denies("is not empty") { topic }.empty?
    asserts("returns the element on #first") { topic.first }.equals('foo')
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Still sort of the tip of the iceburg, but hopefully that gives you at least a bit of a feeling for it.</p>

<p>I would say apart from the speed thing, what I like the most about riot is how structured it is. It takes away some freedom, but only really the freedom to do bad things. I find the only times I have problems with it are when I am about to write a bad test, and not being able to do it forces me to take a step back and think about what I am doing.</p>

<p>Another thing I would mention wrt TDD is <a href="https://github.com/timcharper/spork" rel="nofollow">spork</a>. The idea is that loading the rails environment can easily take 30-40 seconds, and that can become irritating REALLY fast when you are doing tdd. What spork does is set up a rails environment, then fork the process on every test run. Everything is already in memory, so that makes test runs start really fast.</p>

<p>Currently, they support rspec, cucumber, and test/unit. (sorta planning on contributing riot support one day when I have some time)</p>
