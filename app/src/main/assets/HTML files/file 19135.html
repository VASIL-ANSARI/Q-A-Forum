<p>To the best of my knowledge, not for an app that has no listing on the App Store.</p>

<p>The smart app banner 'code' requires the app id from the App Store, which is not available from an app just installed from Xcode.</p>

<p>If the app is an update to an existing app that you've installed via Xcode, then as long as it's available on the iTunes store it will launch the app as far as I am aware.</p>
