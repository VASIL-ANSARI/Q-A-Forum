<p>No a left outer join will give you everything from the left plus the ones on the right that can be joined. Null where they cannot. </p>

<p>I think What you want to do is get everything in the first set that is not in the second set. </p>

<pre><code>SELECT e.e_id FROM AppointmentTypes a1
INNER JOIN EmployeeQualifications eq ON a1.type_id = eq.ea_id
INNER JOIN Employees e ON e.e_id = eq.e_id
INNER JOIN EmployeeAvaliable ea ON ea.e_id = e.e_id
INNER JOIN EmployeeTimes et ON et.time_id = ea.time_id
INNER JOIN AppointmentTimes a2
INNER JOIN TypeTimes tt ON tt.time_id = a2.time_id AND tt.type_id = a1.type_id
WHERE et.wednesday = '1'
AND a1.type_id = '4'
AND et.start &lt;= '10:00:00' 
AND et.end &gt; '10:00:00'
AND e.e_id NOT IN (
    SELECT e.e_id

INNER JOIN Appointments a ON atp.type_id = a.type_id 
INNER JOIN EmployeesAttending ea ON a.a_id = ea.a_id 
INNER JOIN Employees e ON e.e_id = ea.e_id
