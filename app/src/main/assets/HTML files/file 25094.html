  <p>Explanation on why the constructor is being called again, and how to avoid that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>ctor</code> is not called twice on the same object - instead what might happen is that a new <code>View</code> and a new <code>ViewModel</code> are created each time.</p>

<p>By default I <strong>would</strong> expect a new ViewModel to be created on every forwards navigation on every platform.</p>

<p>By default I <strong>would **not</strong> expect this to happen during a back button on WindowsPhone - it doesn't happen here for my test cases - but it could happen if:</p>

<ul>
<li>WindowsPhone removes your first Page (and it's ViewModel) from memory - I guess this might happen if your app is tombstoned or if you are using a custom RootFrame - but I don't expect this to happen by default.</li>
<li>you somehow null the ViewModel (DataContext) in your first Page</li>
</ul>

<p>Without seeing more of your code I can't guess any more about why this might happen.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'd personally recommend you look deeper at why you are seeing new ViewModels created during Back, but if you just want a quick fix, then you could look at overriding the ViewModelLocator within MvvmCross - see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16723078/mvvmcross-does-showviewmodel-always-construct-new-instances/16723459#16723459">MvvmCross: Does ShowViewModel always construct new instances?</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Note that on WindowsStore, I would expect this to happen - WindowsStore doesn't hold Pages from the backstack in memory by default - but you can overriding this by setting <code>NavigationCacheMode = NavigationCacheMode.Enabled;</code> if you need to.</p>
