<p>Yes, you can do it using variables:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *,
         @seq := IF(id = @id, @seq + 1,
                    IF(@id := id, 1, 1)) AS seq 
  FROM table 
  CROSS JOIN (SELECT @seq := 0, @id := 0) AS vars
  WHERE id IN (1,2,3) 
  ORDER BY id) AS t
WHERE t.seq &lt;= 10
</code></pre>
