<p>To install application on device, you have <em>officially</em> to apply (pay) to Apple developer program.</p>

<p>There are also <em>not so official</em> workarounds involving jailbreak and patching iOS system files, which is not really easy to do...</p>

<p>I hope that was the question :)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>About your second part :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install from cydia some package named something like <code>syslogs</code> and do something like <code>tail -f /var/log/system.log</code> to understand why app fails to start. <em>(all from memory, didn't checked)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Most probable error is that your binary is not signed properly. The quick&amp;cheap solution is to use <code>ldid -S my binary</code> there is a cydia package I guess. <em>(again, memory, see <a href="http://www.saurik.com/id/8" rel="nofollow">that link</a> for more details)</em></p></li>
<li><p>The best solution <em>if you really don't want to pay $99 but waste hours to do a complex set up (full of workarounds, patchs and such...)</em>, and get the "Build &amp; go" of Xcode like you were paying... Give a look <a href="http://www.alexwhittemore.com/?p=398" rel="nofollow">at this</a>.</p></li>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>Give a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/246422/how-can-i-deploy-an-iphone-application-from-xcode-to-a-real-iphone-device">this SO question</a> for more details, what I've wrote in my previous edit is mostly there.</p>
