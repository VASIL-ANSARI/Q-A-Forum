<p>I was just fiddling with this and I found the whole thing confusing, but I think I got it figured out:</p>

<p>So you have declared N attributes in <strong>attrs.xml</strong>, for your class.
Now the size of the obtained <code>TypedArray</code> is N. It always passes the same sized array.</p>

<p>But maybe you defined only X attributes in your <strong>layout xml</strong>, so <code>getIndexCount()</code> returns X.</p>

<p>In your widget's init, if you were to ask yourself how many and which attributes 
were defined in xml, you would first find out how many, using <code>getIndexCount()</code>.
Then you loop from <code>0 to getIndexCount()-1</code> and ask the <code>TypedArray</code>: "what's the index of 
the i-th <em>supplied</em> attribute?". </p>

<p>So suppose you want to force an attribute to be set in xml, you can now check this 
because one of the calls to getIndex() has to return the id you are looking for.</p>

<p>But you can always ignore that, and supply default values. Then you can just call <code>a.getInteger( R.styleable.MyClass_MyAttribute, defaultValue );</code></p>

<p>You can check R.java to see that all attribute IDs start at 0, for every class. The generated comments are also helpful to understand.</p>
