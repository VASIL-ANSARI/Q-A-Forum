<p>your approach is wrong, try to add the following in onCreate:</p>

<pre><code>EditText et = new EditText(this);
et.setTextSize(30);
SpannableStringBuilder b = new SpannableStringBuilder("smallbsmall");
Object what = new AbsoluteSizeSpan(40);
b.setSpan(what, 5, 6, Spanned.SPAN_EXCLUSIVE_INCLUSIVE);
et.setText(b);
et.setSelection(6);
setContentView(et);
</code></pre>

<p>now the "cursor" is between big "b" and small "small" text, now type "i" and "g". you see what happens? now you have big "big", and you did nothing in your code - that's the way the spans work</p>
