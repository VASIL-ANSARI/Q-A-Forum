<p>You could write your own decorator which looks at pylons.config["debug"], and depending on that either returns function unchanged or decorated with beaker_cache. Something along these lines (completely untested!):</p>

<pre><code>from pylons import config

def my_cache(*args, **kwargs):
    if config["debug"]:
        decorate = lambda f: f
    else: 
        decorate = beaker_cache(*args, **kwargs)

    return decorate
</code></pre>
