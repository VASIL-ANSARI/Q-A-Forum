<p>Yes, <code>ReaderWriterLockSlim</code> is perfect for frequent reader/infrequent writer scenarios. </p>

<p>The behaviour is as you guessed - single writer only, writers block until all readers are done, readers cannot access while writer is in process.</p>

<p>Be careful that the time you hold the lock (whether for read or write) is long enough to prevent any concurrent access, and no longer.</p>
