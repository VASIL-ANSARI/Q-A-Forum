<p>You are not suppose to see an output, the program is suppose to crash because
Its not enough to change ans to char*, you need to allocate a place for the string using malloc:</p>

<pre><code>ans=malloc(sizeof(char) * 5);
</code></pre>

<p>And also the printf should be:</p>

<pre><code>printf("....%s"ï¼ans);
</code></pre>
