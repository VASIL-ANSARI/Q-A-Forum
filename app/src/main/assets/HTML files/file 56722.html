<p>if the relation is indeed 1-to-many and you don't want duplicate results add DISTINCT keyword:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT manufacturing_tote.mft_tote_barcode
FROM dbo.manufacturing_tote, dbo.works_order
WHERE manufacturing_tote.mft_wo_id = works_order.wo_id
</code></pre>

<p>When the result can have multiple different values, you have to decide how you want to use it:</p>

<ul>
<li>only fetch the first result</li>
<li>use IN instead of '=' as already mentioned</li>
</ul>
