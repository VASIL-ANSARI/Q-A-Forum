<pre><code>curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_HEADER, true);
</code></pre>

<p>The result of <code>curl_exec</code> will then also include the headers from the HTTP response, which you can parse to see if it is gzipped.</p>

<p>A gzipped response would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 26395

[GZIP COMPRESSED DATA]
</code></pre>

<p>So, you can first break up the response into headers and contents and then parse the headers to see if it says anything about gzip encoded content.</p>
