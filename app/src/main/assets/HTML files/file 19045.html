<p>This is the code that I ended up piecing together.  Since I'm not a developer, I can't vouch for it's efficiency or proper structure. It does what I had asked for help with, plus it filters by today's date and also pulls the name of the service from another table.  Hope this helps someone else looking for a similar solution:</p>

<pre><code>select SERVICE_NAME from DD_SERVICES where ID in (
select distinct DESTINATION_SERVICE_ID from(
    select
    ID,
    SOURCE_SERVICE_ID, 
    DESTINATION_SERVICE_ID, 
    level
    from DD_USER.DD_SERVICE_RELATIONSHIP where trunc(UPDATE_DATE) = trunc(SYSDATE)
    start with SOURCE_SERVICE_ID = {insert root value here}
    connect by prior DESTINATION_SERVICE_ID = SOURCE_SERVICE_ID
    )
)
</code></pre>
