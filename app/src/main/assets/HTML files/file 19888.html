<p>Did you try the other way round? Try accessing the details inside the item that is being played by the AVPlayer</p>

<pre><code>AVPlayer *firstPlayer = [[AVPlayer alloc]init];
</code></pre>

<p>After which you can access <code>firstPlayer.currentItem</code> .This will give you access the <code>firstPlayer</code>'s <code>AVPlayerItem</code>.</p>

<p>Eg:</p>

<pre><code>firstPlayer.currentItem.duration
</code></pre>

<p>will give you the duration of that track.</p>
