<p>Anaconda should add itself to the PATH variable so you can start any .py file with "python yourpythonfile.py"  and it should work from any folder. </p>

<p>Alternatively download pycharm community edition, open your python file there and run it. Make sure to have python.exe added as interpreter in the settings.</p>
