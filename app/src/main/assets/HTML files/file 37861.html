<p>You're worrying unnecessarily about storing a (presumably) small amount of text along with your <code>ToDoList</code>. Here's how I would handle it, if the goal was to keep it simple, and not add another model.</p>

<pre><code>class ToDoList(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(...)
    validated_at = models.DateTimeField(..., null=True, editable=False)
    rejection_reason = models.TextFiel(..., editable=False)
</code></pre>

<p>Query for <code>validated_at__isnull=False</code> to get validated todo lists, ignoring <code>rejection_reason</code> altogether. Query for <code>validated_at__isnull=True</code> to get a list of unvalidated todo lists, and use <code>rejection_reason</code> to display the reason to the user. If you want to save space in your database, empty the <code>rejection_reason</code> field when a todo list is validated. You can also use <code>filter (rejection_reason="")</code> to narrow the todo lists to those that don't have a rejection reason (e.g., those that haven't been validated or rejected yet), or <code>exclude</code> on the same thing to get those that have been rejected. </p>
