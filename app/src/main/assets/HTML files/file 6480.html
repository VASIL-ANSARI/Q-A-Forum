<p>If you are using Linux, you can try <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/" rel="nofollow">KDevelop</a> with the <a href="http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/playground/devtools/kdevelop4-extra-plugins/" rel="nofollow">Ruby plugin</a>. If there is one IDE supporting both Ruby and Qt, it's KDevelop.</p>

<p>If you are using Ubuntu, it is a bit of trouble because there is no .deb packages available for the Ruby plugin, you will have to build the plugin yourself.  </p>

<p>There is some instructions to build the php plugin for Ubuntu here : <a href="http://milianw.de/blog/building-kdevplatform-kdevelop-and-the-php-plugin-from-svn" rel="nofollow">http://milianw.de/blog/building-kdevplatform-kdevelop-and-the-php-plugin-from-svn</a>. I suspect that the procedure should be almost the same for the ruby plugin.</p>
