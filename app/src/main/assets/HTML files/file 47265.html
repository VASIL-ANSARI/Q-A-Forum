<p>I think you need to do this in <code>willDisplayCell</code> rather than <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> since that is called just before display which is as close as you can get to the point it actually appears on screen.</p>

<p>Then set the new constraint value before the animation block and also call <code>[cell.contentView setNeedsLayout]</code> to indicate that layout is needed on the cell content. </p>

<p>Finally only add <code>[cell.contentView layoutIfNeeded]</code> and your alpha change in the animation block which should animate the constraint change over your time period.</p>
