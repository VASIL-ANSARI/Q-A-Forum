<p>As you haven't given the version you're using, nor the oracle ADO.NET provider you're using (ODP.NET or MS Oracle), I can't help you further other than giving some general information:</p>

<p>As ODP.NET returns a NUMBER(10, 0) as long, I think you're using MS Oracle. MS Oracle (the .NET oracle provider) returns all NUMBER types as decimal. If you don't want that, use ODP.NET</p>

<p>The cast issue is weird, it should work properly. But as said, please post on our forums as we don't regularly monitor stackoverflow for llblgen related issues. Thanks.</p>
