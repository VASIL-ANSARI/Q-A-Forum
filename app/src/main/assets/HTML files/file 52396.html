<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
If you are just looking to redirect from <code>/School</code> to <code>/web/schools.html</code> you could just do hte following:</p>

<pre><code>    [Route("~/School")]
    public ActionResult YourActionThatReturnsSchoolDotHtml()
    {
        return View();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could do a simple <code>RedirectToAction</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    public ActionResult YourActionThatReturnsSchoolDotHtml()
    {
        return View();
    }

    [Route("~/School")]
    public ActionResult Schools()
    {
        return RedirectToRoute(YourActionThatReturnsSchoolDotHtml());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if this will help you, but if you are using <code>ASP MVC</code>, you could setup your routes via the App_Start/RouteConfig.cs file like this:</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();
routes.MapRoute(
    name: "Schools",
    url: "Schools/{*url}",
    defaults: new {controller = "Schools", action = "Index" }
);
</code></pre>

<p>And then, in your <code>SchoolsController.cs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[Route("Schools/{*url}")]
public ActionResult Index()
{
    return View();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Provided you also have an <code>index.cshtml</code> file under <code>Views/Schools</code> directory</p>

<p>This will basically redirect every calls to <code>/Schools/*</code> MVC action to your <code>angular router</code></p>
