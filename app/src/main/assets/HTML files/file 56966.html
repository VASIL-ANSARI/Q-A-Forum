<p>If using annotation style you have to do things a little differently, as the documentation describes (  <a href="https://eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/adk15notebook/ataspectj-pcadvice.html" rel="nofollow">https://eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/adk15notebook/ataspectj-pcadvice.html</a> ). In your case your aspect needs to be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>static boolean tracked = false;

@Pointcut("if()")
public static boolean tracked() {
  return tracked;
}

@Before("execution(*  testMaven.testing.aa(..)) &amp;&amp; tracked()")
public void testBefore(){
    System.out.println("yooi");
}

@Before("execution(*  testMaven.testing.setDd(..)) &amp;&amp; tracked() ")
public void testBefore2(){
    System.out.println("yooi2");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the code that would normally go into the <code>if(...)</code> clause in a code style aspect is now in a method body, which is tagged with <code>@Pointcut</code> using <code>if()</code>. I did have to make the field static. You could probably modify the code in the <code>tracked()</code> method to use <code>Aspects.aspectOf()</code> to keep it non static.</p>
