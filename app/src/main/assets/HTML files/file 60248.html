<p>There is no special syntax for "acquire the Lock at the beginning of the method, and release it at the end," like there is for <code>synchronized</code>.</p>

<p>You can, of course, just do that yourself:</p>

<pre><code>public void method() {
    lock.lock();
    try {
        // rest of the method
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
}
</code></pre>
