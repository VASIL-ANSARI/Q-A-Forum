<p>I had the same problem and found no solution. As workaround you could add an additional step. Example:</p>

<pre><code>import zookeeper as zk
parent_path = "/"
stat, acl = zk.get_acl(zoohandle, parent_path)
ret = zk.create(zoohandle, node_path, "", acl, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Further tip: In zookeeper-3.3.1 the zk.get() only returns up to 512 bytes of the node data. This should be fixed in the next release (3.3.3).</p>
