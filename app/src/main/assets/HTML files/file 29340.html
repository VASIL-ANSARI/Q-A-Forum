<p>I can't see whether you've set up the baudrate for sending and receiving data.
This was a problem I first had when I tried setting up the communication in my application.</p>

<p>If you want the baudrate to be 9600 you write the following:</p>

<pre><code>connection.controlTransfer(0x40, 0x03, 0x4138, 0, null, 0, 0); // Sets the baudrate to 9600
</code></pre>
