<p>I have solved it and it is a such a tiny issue that I will detail it here:</p>

<p>The problem was a missing quote ("), as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;p class="Note&gt;PLEASE NOTE: All items below are Optional&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;%= Html.ValidationSummary("Edit was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again.") %&gt;

&lt;% using (Html.BeginForm()) {%&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;fieldset&gt;
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>Can you spot it?  Don't worry, it took me a day:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class="Note&gt;...
</code></pre>

<p>Should have been:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class="Note"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The missing quote before the &lt;% using(Html.BeginForm()) %> was enough to scupper the form POST action.  There were no errors, no change of code colouring.  No visual indication.  Nothing.</p>

<p>One to remember!:</p>

<p>When your form won't post, look for malformed html above the Html.BeginForm() line.</p>
