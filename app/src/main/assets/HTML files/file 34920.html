<p>You have some errors in your query</p>

<ol>
<li>You have used tick mark around the variables which is invalid</li>
<li>Unwanted <code>,</code> at starting while entering values </li>
<li>This is not an error, but an advice:There is no need for breaking a query into several parts until it is large.</li>
</ol>

<p>For inserting only <code>cid</code> and <code>path</code> Do like this</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "INSERT INTO photo (cid, path) VALUES ('".$cid."', '".$new."')";
</code></pre>
