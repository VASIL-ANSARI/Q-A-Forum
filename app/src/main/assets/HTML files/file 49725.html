<p>If you posted the real code instead of the image, someone could have noticed.</p>

<p>However that error is simple: you didn't declare <code>_pin1</code> anywhere. So simply write <code>int _pin1;</code> inside the class declaration.</p>

<p>And... I think that you'll want to get rid of that <code>_pinl</code> declaration.. Because everyone can confuse <code>_pin1</code> (i.e. PIN ONE) with <code>_pinl</code> (i.e. PIN EL), but a computer doesn't...</p>
