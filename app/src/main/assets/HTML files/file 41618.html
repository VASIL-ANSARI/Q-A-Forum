<p>You are halfway there since you understand that you must join the 2 tables to be able to filter by category. Therefore, that is what we shall do:</p>

<pre><code>Select b.OUT_TO_CID "CID",
count(b.COPY_NUM) "Books checked out"
from BOOK_COPY b
inner join CUSTOMER c on b.out_to_cid = c.cid
where c.category = 'Faculty'
group by b.OUT_TO_CID
having count(b.COPY_NUM) &gt; 1
</code></pre>
