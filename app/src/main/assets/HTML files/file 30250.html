<p>I see two problems:</p>

<p>The first is that you are encoding the data in base 64 in c# but you are not decoding it in java, at least in the code that you have posted.</p>

<p>The second is that you are decompressing a <code>byte[]</code> who contains the length of the compressed data and the compressed data, which is normal that give an error.</p>

<p>Here you have an example of that you are trying to do: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/18606270/1587302">http://stackoverflow.com/a/18606270/1587302</a></p>

<p>And there another thing that i am not sure that if can cause problems: in c# you are compressing with GZipStream, who does not use zlib; in java decompressing with Inflater , who use zlib. As i said i am not really sure if it is a problem, but i recommend use the same in both sides: in c# <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/system.io.compression.deflatestream%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">DeflateStream</a> uses zlib and in java <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/zip/GZIPInputStream.html" rel="nofollow">GZIPInputStream</a> uses gzip.
<strong>Edit</strong>: as user3074196 confirm is his comment this is a problem too.</p>

<p><strong>Response to Edit 1</strong></p>

<p>I think that the problem is that you are sending binary data which interfiere with the data of protocol http. I can think two solutions:</p>

<p>The first is send a string encoded in base 64, as in you first version and decode it in java.</p>

<p>The second is use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8911362/passing-binary-data-through-httpwebrequest">stream request</a> and transmit binary data.</p>
