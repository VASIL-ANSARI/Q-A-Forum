<p>Okay, I'll present an answer now. :)</p>

<pre><code>QComboBox* myBox = new QComboBox();
connect( myBox, SIGNAL( indexChanged( int ) ), this, SLOT( handleIndexChange( int ) ) );

void myObject::handleIndexChange( int /*index*/ ) {
    // We actually don't need the index
    QComboBox* box = qobject_cast&lt;QComboBox*&gt;( sender() );
    if ( box ) {
        QVariant data = box-&gt;currentData();  // do whatever w/ data... sounds like call toInt() in your case.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The essence of all three of my approaches is that you have to do something extra to get data() which corresponds to the current item after a change.  It would be nice if it emitted a signal taking the underlying data as the argument, but that could get expensive.</p>
