<p>I'm not sure what you are asking.  Your title and your question refer to Ruby, but your description talks about JRuby.  Which are you asking about?</p>

<p>I know regular Ruby can run on Windows Mobile (see <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/12/rhodes-iphone-winmobile-rim" rel="nofollow">Rhodes</a>, for example, or <a href="http://rubyonmobile.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">RubyOnMobile</a>).</p>
