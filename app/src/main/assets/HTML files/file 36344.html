<p>Your web service is encoding the JSON incorrectly. It looks like you're not using the standard JSON encoder, since <a href="http://omegadelta.net/2013/04/28/changes-to-how-rails-3-2-13-and-4-0-encodes-unicode-in-json/" rel="nofollow">as of Rails 3.2.13, the Unicode characters are passed through</a> (that is, you shouldn't be seeing <em>any</em> <code>\u1234</code>-type encoding.)</p>

<p>That said, if you want to maintain the old encoding, try switching from <code>object.to_json</code> to <code>JSON.generate(object, :ascii_only =&gt; true).</code> (More details in the link in the 1st paragraph.)</p>
