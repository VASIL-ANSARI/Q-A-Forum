<p>dont think it complexly. This is very simple. put tag for the imageviews like tag 1 for imageview1, 2 for imageview2 and so on. Then run a for loop and pick the object and assign to the array. Thats all.</p>

<p>Like assume you put tag from 1 to 7 (don't put duplicate tag or 0 for any of your views)</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *arr = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
for(int ii = 1; ii&lt;=7; ii++){
    UIImageView *imgView = (UIImageView *)[self.view viewWithTag:ii];
    [arr addObject:imgView];
}
yourArray = arr;
[arr release];//if your array is a property otherwise no need to release.
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this will help you.</p>
