<p>Looking at the Stack Trace, when you change the Combobox selection it's (apparently) causing a change to the row in the dataset, and the data binding is attempting to repopulate the Combobox row accordingly. So maybe you have a property of the Combobox set to re-validate the data on selection, or perhaps the data binding object is re-validating when the selection changes?</p>
