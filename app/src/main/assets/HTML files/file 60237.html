<p>As suggested in the comments above, use console.log to view the contents. This yields <code>https://arlina-design.googlecode.com/svn/viewme.js</code> which seems to get a 404 error, but if the owner put it back up, then they could run that code-- the code that THEY control. If you include it, it can access your webpage, and it IS a security hole.</p>
