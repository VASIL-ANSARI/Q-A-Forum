<p>The error message is telling you exactly what is wrong: You can't call a constructor on an abstract class, and instead will have to initiate one of the concrete subclasses of OutputStream. Perhaps a BufferedOutputStream that wraps your clientSocket OutputStream.</p>

<p>Why do you even have this line?</p>

<pre><code>OutputStream outputStream = new OutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream(),
             true);
</code></pre>

<p>Why not simply use directly use the OutputStream from the clientSocket?</p>
