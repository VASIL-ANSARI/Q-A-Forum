<p>If you have less than several hundred columns, as long as your columns aren't BLOBs with several MB of data my guess is this isn't a performance roadblock for your program.  If you were passing several hundred (or several thousand) rows then that would be an entirely different issue, but even if you have 200 or so columns passing that much data around for a computer is nothing, it can do that many, many times in a space of time you are incapable of noticing.</p>

<p>Don't prematurely optimize.  Is your program running to slow to do its job?  If no, don't bother at all, you're done.  If it is, use a profiler to see what's taking longer than it ought to and look there for optimizations.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you have more than one or two columns it's probably best to make a class with fields for each column, populate an instance of that class, and then pass it.  It's just much easier to deal with than lots and lots of parameters.</p>
