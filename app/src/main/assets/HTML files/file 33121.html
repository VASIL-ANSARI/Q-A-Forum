<p>In your loops, <code>$stats</code> is referring to the value of each element in the array. I think you're looking for <code>$array['playerCredentials']['playerId'];</code>. If you want to iterate over all properties of a player, you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array['playerCredentials'] as $key =&gt; $value) {
    printf('%s =&gt; %s&lt;br /&gt;', $key, $value);
}
</code></pre>
