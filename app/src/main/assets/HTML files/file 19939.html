<p>If you read their documentation, a thread_id and a disqus_identifier are not the same thing. But to get the disqus identifier, I'd start with something like: </p>

<pre><code>def get_disqus(soup):
    for script in soup.find_all('script',{'type':'text/javascript'}):
        if 'disqusIidentifier' in script.get_text():
            print script.attrs
            print script.get_text()

get_disqus(url)
</code></pre>

<p>That gives you just the javascript lines that actually include the word "disqus_identifier" -- for me that reveals the fact that the value is optional. Happy to expand that if you can be more specific.</p>
