<p>NSURLConnection doesn't work that way. You start a connection and then receive callbacks as data is received. </p>

<p>If you want a simple call to retrieve remote data, use NSData's dataWithContentsOfURL method. However, you should only use that on secondary threads because otherwise it will lock up your user interface for the duration of the call and the system may terminate your app if it takes too long. </p>
