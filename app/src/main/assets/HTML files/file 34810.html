<p>After having a discussion with the OP, its been concluded that the following will go a long way in achieving the desired result. </p>

<p>Create a new class that looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>//FoodItem . h

NSString *foodItemName;
NSString *foodItemDate;
//You can add more stuff like calorie intake etc

//Have a custom init method
-(id)initNewFoodItemName:(NSString*)name withDate:(NSString*)dateInput;


//THEN IN YOUR 
//FoodItem.m

//Make sure you Synthesise the properties above.
-(id)initNewFoodItemName:(NSString*)name withDate:(NSString*)dateInput{
    if (self = [super init]) {
        self.foodItemName = name;
        self.foodItemDate = dateInput;
    }
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This class is a Data model which you will use to store your data in your database. 
If you dont have one setup but want to have fun with testing out your searching algorithm, you can always create a local temporary manual container that will live for the run time of your program.</p>

<p>Now whether you want to store it in your temporary database or in your local database using apples SQLITE database or using apples Core Data databases; you'll be able to do something awesome like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *temporaryDB = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
[temporaryDB addObject:[[FoodItem alloc] initNewFoodItemName:@"Banana" withDate:@"2014-04-20"]];
[temporaryDB addObject:[[FoodItem alloc] initNewFoodItemName:@"Egg" withDate:@"2014-03-20"]];
[temporaryDB addObject:[[FoodItem alloc] initNewFoodItemName:@"chocolate" withDate:@"2014-04-18"]];
</code></pre>

<p>Then when the user selects a specific date because you want to display all the food items that they've eaten on that specific date, you can extract the date from the date picker, convert it into a string using the date formatter, and then search through  the <code>temporaryDB</code> array to see if any objects get returned if a date matches, like so:</p>

<pre><code>-(NSMutableArray*)searchForAllFoodItemsOnACertainDate:(NSString*)searchDate{
    NSMutableArray *returnedResults = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; [temporaryDB count]; i++){

        FoodItem *currentFoodItem = [temporary objectAtIndex:i];

        //if a date is found in the temporary DB then store it into the returnedResults array
        if([currentFoodItem.foodItemDate isEqualToString:searchDate]){

            [returnedResults addObject:currentFoodItem];   
        }
    }
    //In the end you will have a all the food items that were eaten on the day or if none was eaten, then an empty array will be returned with a size of 0

    return returnedResults;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then somewhere else in the program once the user selects a date, and then clicks the <code>done</code> button, you can call the search function like so</p>

<pre><code> NSMutableArray *foodItemsEatenOnChosenDate = [self searchForAllFoodItemsOnACertainDate:dateFromDatePicker];


if([foodItemsEatenOnChosenDate count] &gt; 0){
    //These were the food items eaten on that date the user selected from the date picker
}
else{
    //let the user know that they didnt record any food items on that day
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Things to remember</strong></p>

<p>You've got to make sure that the date string you feed into the <code>foodItemsEatenOnChosenDate</code> search function is in the same format that you saved the dates in your temporary DB.</p>

<p>Goodluck buddy.</p>
