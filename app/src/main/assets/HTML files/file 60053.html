<p>This is a very common problem, and it's an encoding issue. You will need to encode your video using <strong>H264</strong> as the video codec, and <strong>AAC</strong> as the audio codec.</p>

<p>When you use H264 as your video codec, you will also need to choose a profile. Higher profiles require more CPU power to decode and are able to generate better looking videos at same bitrate. You should always choose the best profile your target devices support.</p>

<p>For example, the max supported profile for Desktop browsers, iPhone 4S+, iPad 2+, Android 4.x+ tablets, Xbox 360, Playstation 3 is <strong>High profile</strong>.</p>

<p>Most devices also have a maximum resolution and bitrate they can handle. That is usually expressed in as a H.264 level.</p>

<p>You can re-encode your video using the <strong>ffmpeg</strong> utility.</p>

<p>I personally use a website called <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-to-mp4" rel="nofollow">CloudConvert</a>, you just have to set the conversion options to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Video Codec: H264</li>
<li>Audio Codec: AAC</li>
<li>Leave the other options at their default values</li>
</ul>
