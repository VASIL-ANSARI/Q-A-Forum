<p>The phone number is missing in the Google Places API because Google Maps doesn't have a phone number for that particular place.  If you request the details for a place with a phone number on Google Maps, it will be returned.</p>

<p>Take a closer look at ChIJ8UadyjeuEmsRDt5QbiDg720.  It's an office building called "Workplace 6" âÂ notice that the details say it is of type <code>premise</code>.  If you visit the Google Maps URL in the <code>url</code> field (<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=Workplace+6&amp;ftid=0x6b12ae37ca9d46f1:0x6defe0206e50de0e" rel="nofollow">https://maps.google.com/?q=Workplace+6&amp;ftid=0x6b12ae37ca9d46f1:0x6defe0206e50de0e</a>) you'll notice there's no phone number listed there either.</p>

<p>The other Place ID, ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4, is for one of the businesses located inside that building (Google).  If you compare the <code>address_components</code> or <code>formatted_address</code> you'll see they don't have quite the same address (Google's address is floor 5 of that building).</p>

<p>In general, any field of a place might be absent.  This happens if Google Maps doesn't know it, or if it simply doesn't apply (e.g. you won't find <code>opening_hours</code> on France).  As the documentation for <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/details#PlaceDetailsResults" rel="nofollow">Place Details Results</a> say:</p>

  <p>Each result <strong>may</strong> contain the following fields:</p>
