<p>There are several ways to approach this problem. They range from a list of <code>(attribute, regexp)</code> tuples that you apply in a per-object basis to more complex things.</p>

<p>One option is to find some kind of declarative "language" with which you can specify simple queries such as the one you mention. This can be something that would be stored in a JSON or YAML structure, it all depends on how complex/extensible you want it to be.</p>

<p>If you want it to be really extensible, you may event want to have a DSL (domain-specific language):</p>

<p>Here is a past StackOverflow post that may be helpful.</p>

<p>The simplest solution I can see (to parse, generate and store) is a LISP-style prefix list of tuples, such as:</p>

<pre><code>[('and', ('body', '.*to be or not.*'), ('author', (not, '.*shakespeare.*'))),
 ...]
</code></pre>

<p>If all you need is basic boolean operators and RegExs, that should be enough.</p>
