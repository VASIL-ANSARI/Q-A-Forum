<p>You can use <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.xmlwriter-open-memory.php" rel="nofollow"><code>openMemory</code></a> to create an XMLWriter that only writes to memory, then <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.xmlwriter-output-memory.php" rel="nofollow"><code>outputMemory</code></a> to get the data that the XMLWriter has collected, and then append it to a file with normal <code>fopen</code>, <code>fwrite</code>, <code>fclose</code> calls.</p>
