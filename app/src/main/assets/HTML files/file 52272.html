<p>From my humble point of view:</p>

<p>1 - The truth is, you will avoid a serious amount of headaches with gems and dependencies if you stick with Linux or mac, if you never used before, believe me, it is worth it to get used to it and learn, you'll be more productive. Also, why not keeping it simple? the command line is your friend, with that and your favorite text editor, you can do anything, even <a href="https://github.com/nixme/pry-debugger" rel="nofollow">debugging</a> .</p>

<p>2 - I don't think there's like a 100% accurate guideline on this, I think you should do what feels more natural to you, it is important to know the basics on JavaScript, but that won't keep you from learning ruby, or rails.</p>

<p>3 - To be honest, never thought of it, but apparently <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/" rel="nofollow">yes</a>. Sorry, can't elaborate more on this one.</p>

<p>In conclusion: be patient, be persistent, surely it is a lot to absorb, but slowly things will fit together.</p>
