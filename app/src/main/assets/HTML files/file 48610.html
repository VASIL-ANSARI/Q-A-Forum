<p>I have investigated this issue. If you have the app you are trying to install already installed, the banner will not show. Uninstall the app and try again. Also remember to enable this chrome flag</p>

<p>chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks</p>

<p>Maybe we should ask Google to implement a similar banner that the one that is shown on Safari, it detects if you have the app installed and shows a 'Open' button instead of 'Install' button.</p>
