<p>It's as simple as adding a UIGestureRecognizer at some point in time, then removing that gesture recognizer when you no longer need it. In your case that could be in the -(void) cleanup method of your scene. There's no reason why gesture recognizers need to be global.</p>

<p>You should check out <a href="http://www.kobold2d.com" rel="nofollow">Kobold2D</a> (based on cocos2d), for which I created a <a href="http://www.kobold2d.com/display/KKDOC/KKInput+Gestures" rel="nofollow">super-easy wrapper for gesture recognizers</a>. With that all you need to do is to set the <a href="http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/api-ref/latest/Kobold2D/html/interface_k_k_input.html#a8e25606dc58ed28c5ebeaf0128094bcf" rel="nofollow">corresponding "enabled" flag</a> to YES and later to NO to start and stop gesture recognizers.</p>
