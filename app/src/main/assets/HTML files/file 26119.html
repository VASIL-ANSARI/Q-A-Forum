<p>First off, show us the stacktrace; it will show at what line in your code exactly you're getting your null pointer and what it was doing before that.</p>

<p>Also, show where and how you're initialising that soundpool. Is it a singleton class or is it declared in the activity? I use the following</p>

<pre><code>private static SoundManager _instance = null;
private SoundPool mSoundPool;
private HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; mSoundPoolMap;
private AudioManager  mAudioManager;
private Context mContext;
</code></pre>

<p>with the hashmap storing my sounds (and methods to play, pause, stop playing sounds).</p>

<p>Point is, show more code :) We can't see where things might be going wrong.
