<p>If you add <code>&lt;echoproperties/&gt;</code> after the <code>&lt;xmlproperty&gt;</code> line you should see the properties are loaded but not as you expect. They will be something like:</p>

<pre><code>BuildVersions.property=,,,
BuildVersions.property.name=major,minor,patch,revision
BuildVersions.property.value=1,0,0,93
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the properties are based off the node names, and in your case you have four instances of a "property" child node that are not unique. Your best bet may be to change the xml such as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;BuildVersions&gt;
    &lt;major&gt;1&lt;/major&gt;
    ....
&lt;/BuildVersions&gt;
</code></pre>
