<p>You can just loop over the permutations and write each of them to the file, like this:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
f = open('File.txt','w')
for key, value in dict.items():
    for i in itertools.permutations((str(counter-value))):
        print(i, file=f)
</code></pre>

<p>As it is a generator, the items are retrieved one-by-one so your memory won't be exhausted.</p>
