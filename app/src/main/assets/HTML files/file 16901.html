<p>I have found one <strong>undesirable</strong> workaround. I post it in hopes that it will get some creative juices going. The workaround is to turn off the translucency when the window is deactivated, and turn it back on when it is activated.</p>

<pre><code>d.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter()
{
    public void windowActivated(WindowEvent e)
    {
        d.setBackground(new Color(0, 0, 0, 0));
    }

    public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent e)
    {
        d.setBackground(Color.white);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't ideal because when you click off of the window it becomes opaque. However, it <em>does</em> prevent the window from disappearing forever.</p>
