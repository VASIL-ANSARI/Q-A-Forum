<p>It is related to this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5069099/when-a-class-is-inherited-from-list-xmlserializer-doesnt-serialize-other-att">When a class is inherited from List&lt;&gt;, XmlSerializer doesn&#39;t serialize other attributes</a></p>

<p>So, as pointed out in answer to that question, you have to change your FilterValues implementation in one of at least three possible ways:</p>

<pre>-implement IXmlSerializable
-remove inheritance from List
-use another serializer</pre>
