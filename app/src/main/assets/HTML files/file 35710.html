<p>You should only be registering for location updates once.  Try moving <code>lm.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER,0,0, ml);</code> to the last line of your constructor methods so it's executed only on startup.</p>

<p>Also, be aware that you may need to walk around outside for a bit for a GPS location to be returned, depending on your device.</p>
