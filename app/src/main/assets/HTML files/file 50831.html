<p>There is only <strong>one</strong> set of weights for each output neuron. Otherwise how would you compute the final classification given new point? Which weights would you use? The whole point of learning parametric models is to constraint model complexity (here - number of parameters, weights) and feed it with many training samples so (statistically) the best ones for the whole group can be learned. </p>

<p>The network can converge rapidly (although it does not mean that it should) as the problem is trivial. You can actually look at the data and tell the exact weights "by hand". For first neuron this is [1 1 1 1 1] and bias -2.5 (or any other between -2 and -3) and for the second one it is [0 1 0 0 1] and bias -1.5 (or anything between -1 and -2).</p>
