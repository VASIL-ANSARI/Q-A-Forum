<p>When you want to compare values, make sure to have <code>==</code> for "is equal to", or <code>!=</code> "is not equal to". When you have one <code>=</code> then you are setting the variable and will always evaluate as true. <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php" rel="nofollow">PHP Comparison Operators</a></p>

<pre><code>if($jack == "Not tall"){
  $jack = FALSE;
}
if(!$jack){
  // do whatever ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And when dealing with variables, always make sure you have the <code>$</code> in the front. This is very basic php stuff.</p>
