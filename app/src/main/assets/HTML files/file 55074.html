<p>You cannot do it like this. The overloads of the <code>sm()</code> method are statically resolved, i.e. at compile time (besides, <code>sm()</code> should take <em>pointers</em> to <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>). But the compiler only knows that <code>objects[j]</code> is an <code>A*</code>; it cannot resolve the call because there is no overload that takes a <code>A*</code> as input.</p>

<p>What you want is to dispatch the call based on the runtime type of <code>objects[j]</code>. This is what a call to a virtual function does. So, you should only have one <code>sm()</code> method, which should in turn call another virtual method of its argument.</p>
