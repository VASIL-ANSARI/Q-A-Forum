<p>I would suggest that you use space as a separator, otherwise there are too many possibilities if you don't specify how an allowed 'phrase' should look like.</p>

<p>To count word occurrences you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>Counter</code></a> from the <code>collections</code> module:</p>

<pre><code>import operator
from collections import Counter

d = Counter(' '.join(subjects).split())

# create a list of tuples, ordered by occurrence frequency
sorted_d = sorted(d.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)

# print all entries that occur more than once
for x in sorted_d:
    if x[1] &gt; 1:
        print(x[1], x[0])
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>3 Name
3 Company
2 Proposal
</code></pre>
