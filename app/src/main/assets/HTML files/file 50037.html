<p>Just draw your different stuff on different surfaces.</p>

<p>For example, create a <code>Surface</code> for your game window (let's call it <code>game_surf</code>), and draw your tanks and bullets etc. on that new <code>Surface</code> instead of the pygame main window (which is just another <code>Surface</code>).</p>

<pre><code># the main window
screen = pygame.display.init() 

# just a regular surface
game_surf = pygame.surface.Surface(width, height)

...
# in your main loop
    # or however you draw your sprites
    your_sprite_group.draw(game_surf)
</code></pre>

<p>Then blit it onto the screen</p>

<pre><code>game_surf.blit(screen, the_position)
</code></pre>
