<p>You have a couple of choice here. The best is probably to pass a configuration instance as a parameter to <strong>init</strong>. As Daniel Roseman points out above "Explicit is better than implicit". Alternatively you can set up a global variable that contains an instance of the Configuration and can be accessed where needed. But obviously global variables should be avoided. Lastly you can use a singleton pattern although this is little better than a global variable in many ways. The singleton is described here:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern</a></p>

<p>but basically it would allow you to create a new instance of the Configuration object wherever you need to use its information but because of the way it is created you will get back a reference to the same Configuration instance with the same internal data.</p>

<p>So something like:</p>

<pre><code>    def SingletonConfiguration():
    # implementation

    config = SingletonConfiguration()
    config.Setup()
    # Do any configuration ended of instance

   class UseConfig():
       def __init__():
           a = SingletonConfiguration() # will return same config instance as was
                                        # previously setup
           a.getconfig()
</code></pre>

<p>More info on the singleton in python can be seen here:</p>

<p>If you do not want to pass an instance of Configuration into <strong>init</strong> then a singleton is probably the way to go. Bare in mind though that it has similar problems to a global variable though. While it is not as visible in the global namespace any modification to any singleton instance will modify its value wherever it is used. So completely different parts of your application are now tied together and can interact in possibly bad ways in a way that is difficult to see and debug. If a relationship is needed between two parts of your program then it is far better to explicitly add it in as you would with a partner passed to <strong>init</strong> then to have it with a more concealed interface like this.</p>
