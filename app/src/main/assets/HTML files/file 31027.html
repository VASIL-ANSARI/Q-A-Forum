<p>As the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/o6yk87z" rel="nofollow">Java Generics FAQ</a> point out and you have experienced, that's not really possible with class methods.</p>

<p>The workaround given by the FAQ is to use a static method:</p>

<pre><code>public static &lt;A extends Bar, B extends A&gt; Foo&lt;A&gt; upcast(
        Foo&lt;B&gt; from, Class&lt;A&gt; target) { }
</code></pre>

<p>But I can only echo the concerns of the other commentators: you're setting yourself up for some severe maintenance headaches, especially since I can't envision an actual use case for this piece (in contrast to the FAQ example you're only working on the <code>Foo</code> object, not adding to it).</p>
