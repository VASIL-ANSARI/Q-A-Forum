<p>First of all I think you can get a more stable behavior if you create your textfield into the <code>viewDidLoad</code> method. This because <code>viewDidLoad</code> is called everytime you <em>create</em> the view controller, instead of <code>viewWillAppear:</code> that is called everytime the view will become <em>visible</em> (e.g. if you are coming back from the Notification Center). This can be a problem because you are creating a new istance of your <code>UITextField</code> everytime <code>viewWillAppear:</code> is fired, so you can expect to have duplicate <code>UITextField</code>s in your view.</p>

<p>Second, why are you adding the <code>UITextField</code> into <code>self.navigationController</code> if you need it only in the second view controller? You could add it into the main view of the second view controller.</p>

<p><strong>Third, and the most important,</strong> your code doesn't work because the <code>endEditing</code> method should be called from the view that is containing the <code>UITextField</code>. In your case, you are adding the textfield in <code>self.navigationController.view</code>, that is above <code>self.view</code> in your view hierarchy, so calling <code>[self.view endEditing:YES]</code> will do nothing. Instead, you can try to use <code>[self.navigationController.view endEditing:YES]</code> or, better, <code>[textField resignFirstResponder]</code>.</p>
