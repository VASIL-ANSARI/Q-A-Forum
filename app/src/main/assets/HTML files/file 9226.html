<p>You currently cannot run GM scripts on Newsfox pages, because Newsfox opens in a <em>chrome</em> URI (chrome://newsfox/ ...).</p>

<p>I'm not going to install Newsfox to see, but if it happens to load a page's content into an iFrame, then any scripts written <strong>for that page</strong> will usually fire on the iFramed content.</p>

<p>Information Current as of GM 0.9.5 and FF 4.0.1, but is not likely to change soon.</p>
