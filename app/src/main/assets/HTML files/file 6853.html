<p>You can selectively disable the CSRF token on a controller or individual action methods.</p>

<pre><code>class StatsController &lt; ApplicationController
  skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>I'm actually looking to do something similar, I'll have the iPhone use a different domain name and selectively disable the :verify_authenticity_token filter based on a couple of conditions.  This is only to hold us over until we can get our OAUTH2 implementation up and running.</p>
