<p>All of your settings for the web application will come from the web.config file - the app.config won't be used or deployed with the web app.  Most likely, that config is there because you are using Entity Framework and that's where the EDMX functionality stores it's connection string.  If you put the connection string in the web.config (and use the appropriate config transformations), you should be good.</p>
