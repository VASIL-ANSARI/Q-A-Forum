<p>Whilst you can slice the results, it may be more helpful to use something like <a href="http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/" rel="nofollow">typeahead</a> or <a href="https://select2.github.io/examples.html#data-ajax" rel="nofollow">select2</a> to fetch results based on what the user is entering with a separate ajax request.</p>

<p>Otherwise you may want to look into other ways of filtering down the results such as having a separate select box first to filter by results by first letter or similar</p>
