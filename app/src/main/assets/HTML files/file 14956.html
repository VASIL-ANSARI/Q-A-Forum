<p>The class <code>IntValue</code> you propose essentially boxes an integer... it encapsulates it in an object to that it can participate in an object[].  I would expect no performance <em>improvement</em> with that scenario, and depending on your implementation, it could be worse than compiler-implemented boxing.</p>

<p>Having said that, I agree with the commenters that your efforts are probably better focused improving other areas of your code.  There are very few scenarios where the boxing overhead will be the most important area of attention.</p>

<p>I did encounter a scenario (working with many numbers that could be int, float, or double) where the boxing mattered to user experience.  I solved that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4039694/generic-c-sharp-code-and-the-plus-operator/8812486#8812486">using expression trees</a>.</p>
