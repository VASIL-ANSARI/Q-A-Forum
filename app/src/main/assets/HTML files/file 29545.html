<p>Defining models in Django helps you to manipulate instances.</p>

<p>But, before, you have to create the table "skeleton" in your sqlite db</p>

<p>For this, you just need to synchronize the db with Django by doing :</p>

<pre><code>python manage.py syncdb
</code></pre>

<p>This has to be done one time only.</p>

<p>In the future, you will probably needs to make your models evolve (thus needing similar db evolutions), at this time South - or adhoc schema evolution queries - will be useful (<a href="http://south.aeracode.org/" rel="nofollow">http://south.aeracode.org/</a>) but as far as you're prototyping, you can just remove db and recreate it with good table by executing syncdb</p>
