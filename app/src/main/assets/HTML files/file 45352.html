<p>Yes, it is possible to capture form data on the POST as well as the file, though not as JSON, like other API calls.</p>

<p>Take a look at the form post in Fiddler.  You should see something like this on the text view tab:</p>

<pre><code>------WebKitFormBoundary9j1TS9WuwcTWV7OX
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="RecordTypeId"

120
------WebKitFormBoundary9j1TS9WuwcTWV7OX
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="RecordId"

1251857
------WebKitFormBoundary9j1TS9WuwcTWV7OX
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Tags"

------WebKitFormBoundary9j1TS9WuwcTWV7OX
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Resource"; filename="sampleUpload1.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

Sample upload file 1
------WebKitFormBoundary9j1TS9WuwcTWV7OX--
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, my form has a "RecordTypeId", "RecordId" and "Tags" field on the form. So you can read that data from the "provider.FormData", just like you did with the username.</p>

<p>So, each piece of the data that would have been in your JSON object, would show up in the form data.</p>
