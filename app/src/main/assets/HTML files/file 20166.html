<p>There is no such thing like cross-browser <code>background-position-y</code>. It simply doesn't work everywhere and therefore shouldn't be used. You have to set both parameters in <code>background-position</code>.</p>

<p>Please have a look at this thread: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14475055/css-background-position/14475199#14475199">background-position</a> and links I referred to in my answer</p>
