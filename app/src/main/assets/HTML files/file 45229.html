<p>Hmmm... applyBindings should be synchronous so it should be good to go after it's called.</p>

<p>Are you doing some AJAX call after this to actually load the data? If so, that's where you can add logic to maintain some kind of 'ready' boolean.</p>

<p>You could set a boolean to false, then immediately true after you call applyBindings, but I suspect there's something else going on if you're print screen is coming up empty.</p>
