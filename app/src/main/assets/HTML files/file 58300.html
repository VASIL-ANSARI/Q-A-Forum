<pre><code>                    startActivity(viewIntent);
                    dialog.dismiss();

 replace with below 
           dialog.dismiss();
           startActivity(viewIntent);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Is it because I'm dismissing the dialog after starting a new activity?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ans : Yes</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well Activity and Dialog are different.Activity has a Dialog so 
  without activity dialogs will not have any stand.(Only activity as has
  control over UI not dialog).When you startNewactivity all activity
  state is saved activity stack but stack cannot dialogs states since
  its not part activity UI.(Dialog can exists only present activity
  context). If any dialogs shown by any activity, before finishing or gettting saved to activity stack dialogs has to be removed from the UI. </p>
