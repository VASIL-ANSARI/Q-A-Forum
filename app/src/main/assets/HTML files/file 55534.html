<p>From the document I read sometime ago (same question with you).
The different between these 2 options is the size of APK file after all when you release. SVG will help you save size of apk.</p>

<p><code>
The initial loading of a vector graphic can cost more CPU cycles than the corresponding raster image. Afterward, memory use and performance are similar between the two. We recommend that you limit a vector image to a maximum of 200 x 200 dp; otherwise, it can take too long to draw.
</code>
Being drawn on view will have those 2 options having same RAM (memory) consumed. </p>
