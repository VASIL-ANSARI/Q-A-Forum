<p>Aggregate functions are useful to show, well, aggregate information per group of rows. If you want to get a specific row from a group of rows in relation to the other group members (e.g., the cheapest room per <code>room_n</code>), you'd probably need an analytic function, such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/functions155.htm#SQLRF00690" rel="nofollow"><code>rank</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT hotel_n, hotel_name, room_n, price
FROM   (SELECT hotel_n, hotel_name, room_n, price
               RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY room_n ORDER BY price ASC) rk
        FROM   hotel) t
WHERE  rk = 1
</code></pre>
