<p>As a professional developer, I have to point out this makes absolutely no sense. The code you write <em>is not</em> going to be understandable or meaningful in terms of "console output", unless you write toy code, or what you want is actually a live-reloading server environment, where you write html+js, and you want the browser to autoreload when you save updated files. In which case <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server" rel="nofollow">live-server</a> may already be all you need.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, what you need is a REPL like python or the like, then just <a href="https://nodejs.org" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> is literally what you want. But then that doesn't make the most sense because why on earth would you edit your source code in a REPL instead of using a code editor...?</p>
