<p>Well spotted.  I think there is an error in that tutorial.</p>

<pre><code>$client-&gt;setAuthConfig($KEY_FILE_LOCATION);
$client-&gt;setScopes(['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly']);
$analytics = new Google_Service_AnalyticsReporting($client);
</code></pre>

<p>Try and add the middle line above in your code.  You need to set a scope for it to work.  </p>

<p>Let me know if it works and I will email the dev team and get the tutorial corrected.    </p>
