<p>You return a pointer to a <em>local variable</em>. The variable <code>myArray</code> is like all other local variables, and will go out of scope once the function it was defined in returns. That will leave you with a stray pointer to data that no longer exists and lead to <em>undefined behavior</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>As an interesting side-note: Just <em>having</em> the stray pointer is in itself not UB, but attempting to dereference the pointer is what leads to the UB. So you <em>can</em> return a pointer to a local variable, as long as you don't use it (which is kind of pointless).</p>
