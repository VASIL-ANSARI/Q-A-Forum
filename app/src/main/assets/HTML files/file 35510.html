<p>You need to use <code>list()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$values($years, $months, $days) = $c-&gt;difference($diff);
</code></pre>

<p>Should be:</p>

<pre><code>list($years, $months, $days) = $c-&gt;difference($diff);
</code></pre>

<p>Or to use your current echo, just assign to the array <code>$values</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$values = $c-&gt;difference($diff);
</code></pre>

<p>It appears you are trying a hybrid of the two.</p>
