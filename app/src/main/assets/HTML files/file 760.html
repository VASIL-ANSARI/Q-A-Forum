<p>You should be able to set an expression on the subreport's visibility so that it does not show if there isn't a logo.</p>

<p>Here is the XML from an RDL I had handy:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Subreport Name="SubReport"&gt;
  &lt;ReportName&gt;SubReport&lt;/ReportName&gt;
  &lt;Visibility&gt;
    &lt;Hidden&gt;=Not Parameters!ShowLogo.Value&lt;/Hidden&gt;
  &lt;/Visibility&gt;
&lt;/Subreport&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This tests against a boolean parameter called ShowLogo, but you could just as easily test the value of another parameter (perhaps the length of a URL?).</p>

<p>To be clear, when specifying the expression for the "Hidden" property, you want it to evaluate to False when you want the element to display.  If your expression evaluates to True, that means that the element will be hidden.</p>
