<ul>
<li><p>Setting <code>EmitConformanceClaims</code> simply means that when the WSDL of the service is requested, the claims set by <code>ConformsTo</code> are emitted.  </p></li>
<li><p>The conformance claims  (<code>ConformsTo</code>) is declaring what specification your binding adheres to.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So setting <code>ConformsTo</code> sets your specification level, and <code>EmitConformanceClaims</code> allows you to output (or not) the level in your service description.  Obviously if you set ConformsTo to None, there is nothing to emit, so <code>EmitConformanceClaims</code> has no effect.</p>
