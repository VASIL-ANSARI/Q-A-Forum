<p>Simple data binding may be useful in the situation where you don't know the specific structure of the JSON that you are parsing and you need to handle it programmatically (maybe the structure is even defined in configuration, maybe not).</p>

<p>While you could also use the Tree Model for this, simple data binding may be easier.</p>

<p>Though, if the JSON structure is known at compile-time, it makes sense to just use full data binding (Java classes).</p>
