<p>'proper' is a pretty relative term.  I have seen a series of stored procedures, SSIS (microsoft), and third party tools.  THey each have some advantages</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stored procedures
Using a job to schedule a series of stored procedures that insert rows from one server to the next works.  I find sql developers more likely to take this path...it's flexible in design and good SQL programmers can accomplish nearly anything in here.  That said, it is exceedingly difficult to support / troubleshoot / maintain / alter (especially if the initial developer(s) are no longer with the company).  There is usually very poor error handling here</p></li>
<li><p>SSIS and other tools such as pentaho or data stage or ...google search it, theres a few.
This gives a more graphical design interface, although I've seen SSIS packages that simply called a stored procedures in order that may as well just been a job. These tools are really what you make of them.  They give very easy to see work flows and are substantially robust when it comes to error handling and troubleshooting ability (trust me, every ETL process is going to have a few bad days and you'll be very happy for any logging you have to identify what you want).  I find configuring a servers resources (multiple processors for example) is significantly easier with these tools.  They all come with quite the learning curve though.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I find SQL developers are very much inclined to use the stored procedure route while people from a DBA background are generally more inclined to use the tools.  If you're investing the time into it, the SSIS or equivlent tool is a better way to go from the future of your company standpoint, though takes a bit more to implement.</p>
