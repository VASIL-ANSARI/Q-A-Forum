<p>WinForms controls have handles because they are wrappers around Win32 controls. WPF controls are not (well, windows are, but the controls they host are not). The reason is that, after all, a WPF window is just a Direct3D rendering context, and all controls are just a bunch of triangles. So, they don't need to be actually registered to the OS, and therefore, they don't have handles (except windows and anything that inherits from <code>HwndHost</code>, of course, which <em>are</em> Win32 objects).</p>

<p>That's why there's such a sizeable interop layer between WPF and WinForms: WPF controls simply aren't Windows objects.</p>
