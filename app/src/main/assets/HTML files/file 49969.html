<p>I don't know a way to sort the items in the locals tab directly. But here is a workaround:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select all locals (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C) and paste them to a watch list (Ctrl-V).</li>
<li>Sort the watch list by (workaround again) cut and pasting them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that there is an "Autos" watch window. Maybe it's better suited for your needs, although you neither can sort entries there.</p>

<p>Finally you may have more than one (custom) watch window, see Menu / Debug / Window / Watch / Watch 1 .. 4. This may also be helpful organizing variables to watch.</p>
