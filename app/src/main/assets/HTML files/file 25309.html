<p>So right after I posted the bounty I thought of a non-ideal but robust way around this.</p>

<p>I realized I have the full HTML before and after I call insertHtml.  With these two HTML strings, I can safely identify the block of HTML that was inserted into via my insertHtml call.  So I can easily remove the HTML that was inserted and replace it with my original text again.  Here's my code snippet to do this in case that's not clear.</p>

<pre><code>String originalHtml = richTextArea.getHTML();
richTextArea.getFormatter().insertHTML(text);
String newHtml = richTextArea.getHTML();

int origLength = originalHtml.length();
int newLength = newHtml.length();
int startPos = -1;
int endPos = -1;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; origLength; i++) {
    if (originalHtml.charAt(i) != newHtml.charAt(i)) {
        startPos = i;
        break;
    }
}

for (int i = 0; i &lt; origLength; i++) {
    if (originalHtml.charAt(origLength - i - 1) != newHtml.charAt(newLength - i - 1)) {
        endPos = newLength - i;
        break;
    }
}

String finalHtml = newHtml.substring(0, startPos) + text + newHtml.substring(endPos);
richTextArea.setHTML(finalHtml);
</code></pre>

<p>So this isn't the cleanest solution but to my knowledge it should always work.  I'm calling getHTML, insertHTML, getHTML, and setHTML on the RichTextArea when only a single insert algorithm is needed.  I'd still prefer a direct solution if anybody comes up with a better one.</p>
