<p>First you're telling PHP to show all errors and strict standard infractions.  To ignore the Strict Standards (which are non fatal) change your error reporting level to</p>

<pre><code> // PHP.INI
 error_reporting=E_ERROR^E_PARSE

 //or better, inline with error_reporting()
 error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_PARSE);
</code></pre>

<p>The root of the error is PEAR's Mail Class definition.  I'm using a Mac Server also and PEAR.  It is the better solution for multiple emails, however, it will raise Strict Standard errors.  You can ignore.</p>

<p>You probably have this line of code after your send() call.</p>

<pre><code> if (PEAR::isError($mail_object)) {print($mail_object-&gt;getMessage());}
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer taking this line out and instead using try/catch/exception instead.</p>

<p>I would change your error reporting level with one of the error reporting modifications to your PHP.INI file or inline (best option).</p>
