<p>I have found out that the scroll value of the map viewport was being set by the browser in order to bring the map point into view. As I am moving the map by setting it's top and left positions, this is what was causing the issue.</p>

<p>The solution was to add the .scroll() event listener to the viewport and just set the scrollTop and scrollLeft values to 0 when the event is triggered</p>
