<p>You'll want to use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.kill.aspx">System.Diagnostics.Process.Kill</a> method. You can obtain the process you want using 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.getprocessesbyname.aspx">System.Diagnostics.Proccess.GetProcessesByName</a>.</p>

<p>Examples have already been posted here, but I found that the non-.exe version worked better, so something like:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ( Process p in System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessesByName("winword") )
{
    try
    {
        p.Kill();
        p.WaitForExit(); // possibly with a timeout
    }
    catch ( Win32Exception winException )
    {
        // process was terminating or can't be terminated - deal with it
    }
    catch ( InvalidOperationException invalidException )
    {
        // process has already exited - might be able to let this one go
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You probably don't have to deal with <code>NotSupportedException</code>, which suggests that the process is remote.</p>
