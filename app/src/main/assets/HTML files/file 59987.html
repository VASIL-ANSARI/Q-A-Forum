<p>Since all of your desired actions need <code>Previous_Balance</code> you must ask for it in any case:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    # never used, lets ask anyway
    Name = input("What is your name?  ")

    # we need this information at a minimum
    Previous_Balance = float(input("What is your previous balance?  "))
    Transaction_Code = input("Press W or w for Withdrawal, Press D or d for Deposit:  ")

    # if its a withdrawal/deposit, find the amount and account
    if Transaction_Code.upper() in "WD":
        # we never use this Account_ID ...
        Account_ID = input("What is your account ID?  ")
        Transaction_Amount = float(input("How much is the transaction amount?  "))
        if Transaction_Code.upper() == "W":
            Withdrawal_Process(Previous_Balance, Transaction_Amount)
        else:
            Deposit_Process(Previous_Balance, Transaction_Amount)
    else:
        # they've entered a bad code
        Process_Invalid_Code(Previous_Balance)
</code></pre>
