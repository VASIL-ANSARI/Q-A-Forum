<p>I don't think there is any way to detect key input using JSTL. As far as I know JSTL, it is a collection of these five types of tags:</p>

<p><strong>Core Tags:</strong> used for accessing variables, iterating objects, and (almost) all of the standard loops and if-else statements that you would expect in a programming language.</p>

<p><strong>Formatting tags:</strong> Dates, strings etc</p>

<p><strong>SQL tags:</strong> Database stuff</p>

<p><strong>XML tags:</strong> like core, but for xml</p>

<p><strong>JSTL Functions:</strong> Functions like <code>contains</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>split</code>, <code>substring</code> etc</p>

<p>You can read more about it here: <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/jsp_standard_tag_library.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/jsp_standard_tag_library.htm</a></p>

<p>Your best bet for creating a key listener, is javascript. Take a look at this post for more info: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10655202/detect-multiple-keys-on-single-keypress-event-on-jquery">Detect multiple keys on single keypress event on jQuery</a></p>

<p>For the other part of your question, I have found particularily two answers already existing on stackoverflow, to be most helpful:<br/>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3177733/how-to-avoid-java-code-in-jsp-files?rq=1">How to avoid Java code in JSP files?</a> <br/>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2188706/how-to-avoid-using-scriptlets-in-my-jsp-page">How to avoid using scriptlets in my JSP page?</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As mentioned in the comments, JSTL works on the server side of a web application. user input happens on the client side, and is therefore out of scope for JSTL. Javascript is the way to go.</p>
