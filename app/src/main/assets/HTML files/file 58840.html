<p>I believe you need to use a having clause AFTER your group by. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  idClient,nameMemb,min(OpenBal)as OpenBal,sum(open) as open,(min(openBal)+sum(open))as able,sum(re)as re ,sum(cr) as cr,sum(comPay)as comPay,(min(openBal)+sum(open)-sum(re)-sum(cr)+sum(comPay))as close
from 
  AddClient  
WHERE 
  strftime ('%m', date) = '10' 
group by 
  nameMemb 
having 
  close &gt; 0
</code></pre>
