<p>The "clean" way to do it would be to create an instance of <code>Competition</code> without committing it to the database, and repeat once more your cycle with the extra instance.</p>

<p>However, here you appear to be just producing a list, so it ought to be enough to do a much quicker addition to the final list:</p>

<pre><code>$competition_all = Competition::all();
$this-&gt;competition_games = array('Competition');

foreach ($competition_all as $competition_games) {
    $this-&gt;competition_games[$competition_games-&gt;name] = $competition_games-&gt;name;
}
$this-&gt;competition_games['name'] = 'Others';
</code></pre>
