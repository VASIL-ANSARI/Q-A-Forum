<p>You have right result in both examples.</p>

<p>If you use only <code>count</code> in select you always got a number as result of query. So your result from database is expectable.</p>

<p>In rails case you trying to get some set of records by <code>scope</code> with <code>count</code> in select statement. It's expectable to got empty set if you have <code>count</code> in your query.</p>

<p>Try <code>count_by_sql</code> method <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Base/count_by_sql/class" rel="nofollow">http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Base/count_by_sql/class</a>
to get number of records instead of empty set.</p>

<p>And use it without scope, but with class method:</p>

<pre><code>def self.unverified_with_no_associations()
  self.count_by_sql("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(accounts.id, accounts.email)) FROM accounts WHERE level = 0 AND id NOT IN
            (SELECT DISTINCT(account_id) FROM verifications) AND id NOT IN 
            (SELECT DISTINCT(account_id) FROM positions) AND id NOT IN
            (SELECT DISTINCT(account_id) FROM edits) AND id NOT IN
            (SELECT DISTINCT(account_id) FROM posts) AND id NOT IN
            (SELECT DISTINCT(account_id) FROM reviews) AND id NOT IN
            (SELECT DISTINCT(sender_id) FROM kudos) AND id NOT IN
            (SELECT DISTINCT(account_id) FROM stacks WHERE account_id IS NOT NULL)")
end
</code></pre>
