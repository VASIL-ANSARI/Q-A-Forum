<p>You have two issues in here, one of which is subtle, but still:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are writing the delete algorithm yourself for the elements rather than using <code>qDeleteAll</code>. It is better not to reinvent the wheel.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not removing the elements from the container, just delete them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, I would be writing something like this if I were you:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;QtAlgorithms&gt;

...

void stop() {
    qDeleteAll(server);
    server.clear();
}
</code></pre>
