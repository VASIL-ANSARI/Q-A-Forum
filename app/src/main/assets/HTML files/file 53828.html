<p>The solution is. It could be done, all via sql commands. So its very fast. Every step could be executed independently. But if you have a live system with traffic STEP 4 and STEP 5 should be executed in a transaction. </p>

<ol>
<li>Create a Table with named C with the same structure as A and B</li>
<li><p>Insert the data of B in C but with primary_key = NULL for auto_inc</p>

<p><code>INSERT INTO C (sql_id,date_time,cian) SELECT NULL, date_time, cian FROM B;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Insert the data of A in C  but with primary_key = NULL for auto_inc</p>

<p><code>INSERT INTO C (sql_id,date_time,cian) SELECT NULL, date_time, cian FROM A;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Delete Table A</p>

<p><code>DROP TABLE A;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Rename the Table C to A</p>

<p><code>ALTER TABLE C RENAME TO A;</code></p></li>
</ol>
