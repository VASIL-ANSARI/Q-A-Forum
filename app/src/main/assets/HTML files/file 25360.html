<p>Let me give you what I can - PyPy is several things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A fast implementation of Python using a Just-In-Time compiler (written in RPython)</li>
<li>The RPython JIT compiler compiler</li>
</ol>

<p>When the docs talk about translating the interpreter they are talking about generating a JIT compiler for Python out of the RPython implementation of the Python compiler.</p>

<pre><code>Python Compiler (Written in RPython)
    |--[RPython to JIT compiler compiler]--&gt; 
        PyPy (JIT'ed Python Interpreter)
</code></pre>

<p>The key thing to note is that "compiler compiler" is <em>not a typo</em>.  RPython is part of a toolchain used to <em>generate JIT compilers</em>.  Rather than writing a compiler for your language and then writing a JIT layer for your compiler (which can be difficult and time consuming) instead you implement your language in RPython and the RPython translation toolchain <em>writes you a JIT compiler for <strong>your</strong> language</em>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to think about this is to imagine that the PyPy team hadn't written their own JIT compiler compiler.  Imagine instead that <a href="https://github.com/topazproject/topaz" rel="nofollow">Topaz (JIT Ruby)</a> came first and that team had written a JIT compiler compiler in Ruby (we'll call it RRuby).  The PyPy team would have then written the PyPy compiler in RRuby (instead, since PyPy came first, the <a href="https://github.com/topazproject/topaz" rel="nofollow">Topaz</a> team is implementing their JIT Ruby compiler in RPython).</p>
