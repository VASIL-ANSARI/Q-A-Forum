<p>Portably, no. Realistically, an <code>atomic_int</code> is probably just <code>sizeof(int)</code> bytes of memory like a regular <code>int</code> on any modern C++ implementation. If <code>sizeof(std::atomic&lt;int&gt;) == sizeof(int)</code>, go for broke and just pass its address to <code>futex</code> and see what happens.</p>
