<p>Once I had same Issue when i was dealing with Fragments.
I was doing two things wrong.
1. I was adding new fragment with attached to root as true(in oncreateview)
2. I was providing same TAG to all the fragments but fragment with that tag was already popped up from backstace and i was trying to replace it.
I hope it helps</p>
