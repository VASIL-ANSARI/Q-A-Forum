<p>I quickly threw an example app together to prove what you were doing was right, you can check it out here: <a href="https://github.com/Bram--/customer_bill" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Bram--/customer_bill</a> which works fine.
Just make sure before you spin it up you have a Customer Bill &amp; CustomerBillLineItems:</p>

<pre><code>c = CustomerBill.create name: 'Name'
CustomerBillLineItem.create name: 'Line Item A', price: '1.00', customer_bill_id: c.id
CustomerBillLineItem.create name: 'Line Item B', price: '2.00', customer_bill_id: c.id
</code></pre>

<p>What versions are you using, is there anything else we're not seeing in the above code?</p>

<p>Hope the example helps, otherwise drop me a line.</p>
