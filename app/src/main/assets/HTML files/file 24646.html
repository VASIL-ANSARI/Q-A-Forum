<p>This is a known issue with windows for meteor : <a href="https://github.com/sdarnell/meteor/issues/7" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sdarnell/meteor/issues/7</a>. The one on meteor's github repo might also be related. I have it too! Hopefully they sort it out soon!. Just ctrl+c to stop your server before you edit code and get it back up after you're done.</p>

<p>Even if you start it after this sometimes you could also get an ADDRINUSE error, which is quite frustrating.</p>
