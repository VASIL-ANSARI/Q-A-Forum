<p>To install the Anaconda-1.9.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh, open Terminal and run </p>

<pre><code>/bin/bash Anaconda-1.9.0-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
</code></pre>

<p>The installer will ask a series of questions and install it in a prefix you determine. When you are done, close the Terminal and open it again. (This is so that your Terminal picks up the new PATH which points to the prefix/bin.)</p>

<p>When it is installed you should see something like the following in the Terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ python
