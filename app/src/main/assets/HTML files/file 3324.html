<p>No. "access modifier" is the official term for <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code> and <code>public</code>, whereas the term "access specifier" does not occur at all in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/j3TOC.html">Java language specification</a> and is AFAIK not something that is widely used.</p>

<p>"access modifier" is the official term for <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code> and <code>public</code> used in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/j3TOC.html">Java language specification</a>. "access specifier" is used synonymously in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/jdk/api/jpda/jdi/com/sun/jdi/Accessible.html">Java API doc</a>, but this is the first time I've noticed that. It's probably better to stick with the JLS term.</p>
