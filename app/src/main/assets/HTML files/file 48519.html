<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> You can't get exactly what you want. With IE11 you actually have a couple other challenges. You can't simply use the <a href="https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/" rel="nofollow">Fullscreen API</a> with <code>promise = element.requestFullscreen()</code> because IE will request permission from the user first, and the API lets you check for capability but not state. Also, multiple fullscreen applications can share the desktop in Windows 8 and 8.1, which is a bit counterintuitive.</p>

<p>However, if you can count on the web app probably being fullscreen, your "hackish" JavaScript solution probably is the best answer. Get the initial dimensions when the document loads and compare during key presses. As a side note, keep in mind that the user might not be using the software keypad just because he or she isn't in the dock. The user still needs to explicitly open the software keyboard.</p>

<p>If you had said "Android only", it would be an easy solution, but you already demonstrated you knew that in your question. If you wanted to use a desktop app, there is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.system.profile.hardwareidentification.getpackagespecifictoken.aspx" rel="nofollow">some MSDN documentation on a hardware token here</a> but again you specified that this wouldn't be simple enough. </p>
