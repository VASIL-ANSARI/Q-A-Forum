<p>You can use flag or counter to check if the background should change.
I made something like the page you mention about (<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/2ck8uste/4/" rel="nofollow">JsFiddle</a>). </p>

<p>On the code, i separate the content into 4 parts and use <code>fadeIn</code> and <code>fadeOut</code> for the transition between the contents.
May be this is what you wanted.</p>
