<p>You should try using <strong>onTouchListener</strong>. AFAIK,setEnabled(false) disables onClick, but it should leave the onTouchListener working. Just remember one thing, <strong>return false from the listener</strong> once your work is done(in order to consume the event allow other events after it to be fired)</p>
