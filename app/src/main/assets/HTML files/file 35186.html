<p>That's not quite how it works. <code>Comparable</code> is an <em>interface</em> that any class <em>may</em> choose to implement in order to indicate that instances of the class may be compared using the class' <code>compareTo()</code> method. So you can choose to implement this interface in any class you create yourself (however, you must write the code for <code>compareTo()</code> yourself, since Java doesn't know how to compare your objects in a meaningful manner). </p>

<p>Some built-in classes implement <code>Comparable</code> and others don't - there might be a list somewhere, but it would be way too long for an SO answer. If you are wondering about whether a specific class implements <code>compareTo()</code>, check its documentation (and see if the comparison does what you expect) or simply try to call that method. If there is a built-in or third-party class that does not implement <code>Comparable</code>, you need to create a <code>Comparator</code> instead in order to compare them. </p>

<p>A <code>Comparator</code> may compare anything you wish, because you are the one who decides how it should work.</p>
