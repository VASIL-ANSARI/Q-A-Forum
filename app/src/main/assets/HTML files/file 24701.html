<p>This is a basic logic problem:</p>

<pre><code>(a !=b) || (a != c) 
</code></pre>

<p>will always be true as long as b != c. Once you remember that in boolean logic </p>

<pre><code>(x || y) == !(!x &amp;&amp; !y)
</code></pre>

<p>then you can find your way out of the darkness. </p>

<pre><code>(a !=b) || (a != c) 
!(!(a!=b) &amp;&amp; !(a!=c))   # Convert the || to &amp;&amp; using the identity explained above
!(!!(a==b) &amp;&amp; !!(a==c)) # Convert (x != y) to !(x == y)
!((a==b) &amp;&amp; (a==c))     # Remove the double negations
</code></pre>

<p>The only way for (a==b) &amp;&amp; (a==c) to be true is for b==c. So since you have given b != c, the <code>if</code> statement will always be false.  </p>

<p>Just guessing, but probably you want </p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if controller_name != "sessions" and controller_name != "registrations" %&gt;
</code></pre>
