<p>You need to use several kind of techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li>Javascript loads via AJAX data from your server, best using JSON format. You should consider <a href="http://www.jquery.com" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a> or Sencha ExtJS to ease AJAX and JSON handling.</li>
<li>Than you can store the data localy using webstorages or indexedDB, depending on the complexity of your data. The more complex, the more happy you might be with indexedDB as it allows you to have indexes and some sort of accelerated filtering. If you use jQuery take a <a href="http://nparashuram.com/jquery-indexeddb/" rel="nofollow">indexedDB plugin</a> to ease your live.</li>
<li>To show, add, edit and in general manipulate your data offline, consider to build your forms, tables, make them sortable. jQuery can help you to build this up too. Although Sencha ExtJS has a very nice table configurator.</li>
<li>uploading data to your server needs some kind of synchronisation logics, best server side, to keep the control over the validation of data central. You can work with JSON as well, its easy to generate and to parse at server side, in any server-side language.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't have a favorite Javascript lib and you are new to all this, have a look at jQuery. It also might teach you the underlaying technologies. Sencha will only hide the technology from you, which is somehow "bad", as it keeps you blind and it can be hard or sometimes impossible to accomplish very complex tasks.</p>

<p>Actually what you need is to learn Javascript, as its the core of what people think is html5.</p>

<p>This answer is by far not a complete guide or tutorial, but hopefully it contains some hints for you! Wish you good start.</p>
