<p>You are attempting to fetch the element before the DOM tree has been created. Put your javascript at the end, before the closing body tag, and see if that works (Not tested. It still may not for the same reason).  </p>

<p>Better yet, look into <code>window.onload</code> to make sure the DOM is loaded before attempting to read from it. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191157/window-onload-vs-body-onload">window.onload vs &lt;body onload=&quot;&quot;/&gt;</a></p>
