<p>IMHO, the next step is for you to decide what profile of accelerometer values over a time period represent a "fall", in a way that minimizes false positives and false negatives. This will need to take into account the sort of device that is being used (tablet? phone? watch? glasses?) and how it is being used (phone in hand? phone in pocket? phone in purse?).</p>
