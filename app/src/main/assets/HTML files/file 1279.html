<p>You could try to use a JXTreeTable, from the <a href="http://swinglabs.org/" rel="nofollow">SwingX</a> package.</p>

<p>You would define then such an object with two columns (one for the tree, to other for the right aligned text), and it should work out fine.</p>

<p>To prevent it from looking like a table, though, I would recommend you to deactivate the header (setTableHeader(null)), and use their "packing" methods, to have the columns on optimal size.</p>
