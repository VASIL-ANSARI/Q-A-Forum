<p>I may not be able to exactly answer my question, but maybe provide help for others trying to do something similar to what I was doing. When I posted, I was under the impression that the ssh session had to stay open for the command to finish, but I don't think that is the case.</p>

<p>So what I was trying to do was start a remote ssh session via java, and run a shell script on the remote machine. The shell script could take up to 10-15 mins to complete. I tested a short timeout (5 secs) and the script continued to run after the session was disconnected... which is what I wanted.</p>
