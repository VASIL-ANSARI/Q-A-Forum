<p>A memory leak according to memcheck is any block of memory which was allocated during the program lifetime which is not freed by program exit. Because you're storing a pointer in the <code>hash_map</code>, this pointer is left unfreed when the <code>hash_map</code> is destroyed. You should either use a <code>shared_ptr</code> in the hash_map or use a collection which accepts a pointer and deletes it when the collection is destroyed.</p>
