<p>It sounds like the crux of your question lies in determining how Firebug displays your object. Firebug examines objects you passed to it, and chooses how it will display objects as a string based on what properties they have.</p>

<p>HTMLCollection is "array-like" so it has a length property, and stores its contents in properties named 0, 1, 2, etc. This makes it array-like and Firebug recognizes this, outputting the string representation of your object like it would an array.</p>

<p>In the case of Firebug, if it sees a <code>length</code> and a <code>splice</code> property, it will treat the object as array-like: </p>

<pre><code>var MyArrayLike = function(){
    this[0] = 1;
    this.length = 1;
    this.splice = function(){};
}
</code></pre>

<p>Firebug output:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; new MyArrayLike();
&lt;- [1]
</code></pre>
