<p>The best scenario for nested_form would be</p>

<ol>
<li>One to one relationship.</li>
<li>One to many relationship.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the above when you want to created both the parent and the child records at the same time
eg.
<strong>Profile</strong> has many <strong>ProfileImages</strong> and while creating profile we want to upload image. So the <strong>Profile</strong> form would be <code>nested_form</code> and the <strong>ProfileImage</strong> field_for would we inside the <strong>Profile</strong> form.</p>

<p>And with nested form you can also insert multiple records of the child with one nested_form </p>
