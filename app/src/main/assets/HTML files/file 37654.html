<p>Instead of IPAddress.Broadcast(255.255.255.255) provide your local network broadcast address. See the example below:</p>

<pre><code>IPAddress broadcast = IPAddress.Parse("192.168.1.255"); //replace the address with your local network.
IPEndPoint endPoint = new IPEndPoint(broadcast, 11000);
sendClient.Send(message, message.Length, endPoint);
</code></pre>

<p>IPAddress.Broadcast doesn't work in some network. </p>
