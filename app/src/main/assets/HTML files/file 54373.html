<p>The library you are using, groovy-hadoop, says it supports Hadoop <code>0.20.2</code>. It's really old. </p>

<p>But the <code>CountGroovyJob.groovy</code> code you are trying to run looks like it's supposed to run on versions <code>2.x.x</code> of Hadoop. 
I can see this because in the imports you see packages such as <code>org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Mapper</code>, whereas before version 2, it was called <code>org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Mapper</code>. </p>

<p>The most voted answer in the SO question you linked is probably the answer you needed. You have an incompatibility problem. The groovy-hadoop library can't work with your Hadoop 2.7.1.</p>
