<p>You can get a use from AVFoundation framework. It has AVAudioPlayer to play audio files and AVAudioRecorder to record.
You have to bear in mind that Recorder will record with the use of mic only.
So with the simultameously playing a audio file and recording it depends on how the mic will perceive the audio that is played. </p>
