<p>You shouldn't declare the <code>SpeechRecognitionProtocol</code> yourself (not sure you added this just for demonstration purposes or whether your actually have that in your code). <code>SpeechRecognitionProtocol</code> is already declared in <code>SpeechRecognitionService.h</code> and available to Swift - this is the one you need to use.</p>

<p>The object implementing that protocol is <code>ViewController</code>. Assuming your <code>initializeRecoClient</code> is a method of that class, the call would need to look like:</p>

<pre><code>micClient = SpeechRecognitionServiceFactory
              .createMicrophoneClient(recoMode!,
                                      withLanguage: language, 
                                      withKey: primaryOrSecondaryKey,
                                      withProtocol: self)
</code></pre>

<p>The SpeechSDK API didn't choose a particularly good name for that factory method.
The <code>withProtocol</code> argument doesn't take the protocol object itself (as the name suggests), but the object implementing the protocol (obviously).</p>

<p>P.S.: Not sure what SpeechAPI version you use, I had to implement those Swift methods to make ViewController conform to <code>SpeechRecognitionProtocol</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func onPartialResponseReceived(response: String!) {}
func onFinalResponseReceived  (response: RecognitionResult) {}
func onError                  (errorMessage: String!, 
                               withErrorCode errorCode: Int32) {}
func onMicrophoneStatus       (recording: Bool) {}
func onIntentReceived         (result: IntentResult) {}
</code></pre>
