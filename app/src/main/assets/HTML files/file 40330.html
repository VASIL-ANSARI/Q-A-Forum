<p>The <a href="http://bit.ly/1G0cBqX" rel="nofollow"><code>Physics.behavior</code></a> docs indicate that a <code>Behavior</code> object is returned when you call <code>Physics.behavior</code> (because it constructs a new one). So you need to keep a reference to the <code>Behavior</code> object you'd get back from the call you've put into your <code>world.add</code> array, then pass that reference to <a href="http://bit.ly/12sjySu" rel="nofollow"><code>world.remove</code></a> later. As it is now, you're making a new <code>Behavior</code> (separate from the one you made first) and immediately passing that brand new object to <code>world.remove</code>, which will basically do nothing.</p>
