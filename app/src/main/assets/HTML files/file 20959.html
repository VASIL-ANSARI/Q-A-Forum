<p>What you are looking for is <code>GROUP_CONCAT</code>, but you are missing a lot of details in your question to provide a good example. This should get you started:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(code), time 
FROM myTable 
WHERE user_id in (2, 3)
GROUP BY time;
</code></pre>

<p>Missing details are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is there an order required? Not sure how ordering would be done useing grouping, would need to test if critical</li>
<li>Need other fields? If so you will likely end up needing to do a sub-select or secondary query.</li>
<li>Do you only want results with multiple times? </li>
<li>Do you really want no separator between values in the results column (specify the delimiter with <code>SEPARATOR ''</code> in the <code>GROUP_CONCAT</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can add more fields to the GROUP BY if you want to do it by something else (like <code>user_id</code> and <code>time</code>).</li>
</ol>
