<p>Well, it turns out with the release of the Java Plug-in 1.6.0_24 in February 2011, copy and paste from the system clipboard was deemed a security hole and disabled.  You can copy and paste BETWEEN applets.  But if you try to use something from your main clipboard, it can't be copied in.  </p>

<p>So there are a couple of options for a workaround.  You can roll back to an earlier version of the plug-in.  That will work, but chances are all future releases will still keep copy and paste disabled, so you'd never be able to upgrade.  </p>

<p>The other alternative is to provide a custom java security policy file which enables access to the system clipboard again.  </p>

<p>First locate your local Java Security Policy file.  The file is named java.policy and should be in the lib\security folder of your Java installation.  On Windows 7, it can be found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\lib\security.
Copy this file to your home folder (ex. C:\Users\Kyle).
Rename the file to .java.policy (note the period at the beginning). 
Edit the file in a text editor.  Locate this line of text:</p>

<pre><code>// "standard" properies that can be read by anyone
</code></pre>

<p>Add the following line just below it like so:</p>

<pre><code>// "standard" properies that can be read by anyone
permission java.awt.AWTPermission "accessClipboard";
</code></pre>

<p>Save the file.
Close any open browsers and ensure that Java is not running before testing.</p>
