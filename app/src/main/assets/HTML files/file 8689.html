<p>Most likely with alot of hand rolled usage, especially if you want it to be unobtrusive. You're going to need to create something like <code>&lt;input data-validationgroup="group1"...</code> and then on the click action that your javascript code will then validate what you want. I would imagine jQuery Validate has some type of ruleset support but you'll have to figure that out.</p>

<p>You're going to have to do a similar sequence on the server side, and create ruleset type validation classes/blocks/methods that you interpret the submit action to the relevant ruleset. I'd look at a library like FluentValidation for this part.</p>

<p>To achieve what you want it, is is very extremely unlikely you will be able to achieve this using the DataAnnotations attributes on your model class.</p>
