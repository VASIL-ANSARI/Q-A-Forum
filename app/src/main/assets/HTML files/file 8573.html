<p>This might sound primitive but tables were designed for something like this only.
one solution is to have a table and put your images as background-image of the cells. (or put it inside and give it a height and width 100%) Its is easy to keep control over the cell size and margins/padding.. that is why they were so popular for structural stuff.</p>

<p>Before ruling the idea out, do note that (apart form the fact that i HATE to use tables for designing and positioning stuff, but do not hesitate to use it for what it was meant to be) making tables will reduce the amount of code to be written. use css to size the cells and table. use inline to put background image. no js functions wat-so-ever.</p>

<p>please drop a comment if you disagree of if i am missing something :)</p>
