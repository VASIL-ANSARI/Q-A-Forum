<p>DispatcherTimer is the regular timer.  It fires its Tick event on the UI thread, you can do anything you want with the UI.  System.Timers.Timer is an asynchronous timer, its Elapsed event runs on a thread pool thread.  You have to be very careful in your event handler, you are not allowed to touch any UI component or data-bound variables.  And you'll need to use the lock statement where ever you access class members that are also used on the UI thread.</p>

<p>In the linked answer, the Timer class was more appropriate because the OP was trying to run code asynchronously on purpose.</p>
