<p>You Should Use Alias in joining like this...</p>

<pre><code>   Select E.Name , U.Name,E.Age,U.Age
   From 
   TblEmployee E 
   inner join 
   TblUser U on E.EmployeeId = U.EmployeeId
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note : The above Query is only a Example So that you can go ahead</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  you can also do your column name what you want like this </p>

<pre><code>   Select E.* , U.*, E.Age as Employee Age ,U.Age as UserAge 
   /* you can specify some column by E.Name and if you do not want then simplye do E.* by doing thing every column of your that table will be selected */
   From TblEmployee E 
   inner join 
   TblUser U on E.EmployeeId = U.EmployeeId 
</code></pre>
