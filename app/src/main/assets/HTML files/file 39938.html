<p>If you just want to get the next number for a user, move your WHERE conditions into your ID-matching JOIN:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    *
FROM
    my_table AS [current]
    LEFT JOIN my_table AS [next]
        ON [next].ID = (
            SELECT 
                MIN(ID) -- get first ID
            FROM
                my_table 
            WHERE
                ID &gt; [current].ID  -- greater than the current
                and my_table.[User] = [current].[User] -- same user
                and my_table.[Date] = [current].[Date] -- same day
        )
</code></pre>
