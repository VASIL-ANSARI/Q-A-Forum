<p>Without seeing more of your code, I would say the usual way to "excuse a variable that hasn't been declared yet" would be by handling the possibility of a <code>NameError</code> exception.</p>

<pre><code>try: 
  # variable sword may or may not exist here..
  sword
except NameError:
  # handle this
</code></pre>
