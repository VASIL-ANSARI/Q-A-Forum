<p>I think it boils down to the design of your objects. Because lazy-loading can be enforced in the per-object level, you can take advantage of that fact when you think about session management.</p>

<p>For example, I have a bunch of objects which are data-rich and lazy loaded, and I have a grid/summary view, and a details view for them. In the grid-summary view, I do not use the lazy-loaded version of the object. I use a surrogate object to present that data, and that surrogate object is not lazy loaded.</p>

<p>On the other hand, once a user selects that record for viewing/editing, and you enter a multi-paged details view of the object, that's when we apply lazy-loading to the specific object. Data is now lazy loaded depending on which details are viewed only on demand. That way, the scope of my session being open for lazy loading only lasts as long as the details view is being used.</p>
