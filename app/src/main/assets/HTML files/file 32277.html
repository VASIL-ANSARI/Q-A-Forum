<p>Few things to note.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Activity expects the start time to be in milliseconds. If an input value greater than 1000 is given (ex 10 seconds i.e. 10000), the app shows the count down.</p></li>
<li><p>The following two lines are placed incorrectly.</p>

<pre><code>countDownTimer = new MyCountDownTimer(timeVal, interval);
text.setText(text.getText() + String.valueOf(timeVal / 1000));
</code></pre>

<p>They should be executed only when the count down is started. But in the given implementation, they are run both at start as well as stop.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As a result, a new MyCountDownTimer is created when the count down is stopped, and the countDownTimer.cancel(); is called in this new object rather than the original object. So the count down continues.</p>

<p>Since the setText is performed both on start and stop, the timeVal is appended to the output. That is causing "Times up0" observed.</p>

<p>The updated onClick method is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>    public void onClick(View v) {
        // get the name from edittext and storing into string variable
        long timeVal = Long.parseLong(editTime1.getText().toString());

        if (!timerHasStarted) {
            countDownTimer = new MyCountDownTimer(timeVal, interval);
            text.setText(text.getText() + String.valueOf(timeVal / 1000));
            countDownTimer.start();
            timerHasStarted = true;
            startButton.setText("STOP");
        } else {
            countDownTimer.cancel();
            timerHasStarted = false;
            startButton.setText("RESTART");
        }
    }
</code></pre>
