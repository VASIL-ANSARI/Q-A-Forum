<p>You can remove this error completely by saving your view state to a database and only cleaning within the duration you need to. This also sygnificantly improves the performance of your pages even shen using relatively small viewstates.</p>

<p>At the very least you can inherit from the Page class and add your own ViewStateLoad routen that check to see if it has expired and reloads the default state.</p>
