<p>That's because the current working directory of the script is not the same when called via cron. (I assume it is <code>/</code>, the root directory) </p>

<p>Change the <code>require_once</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>require_once __DIR__ . '/myincludefile.php';
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.predefined.php" rel="nofollow"><code>__DIR__</code></a> will always contain the directory where the current script is located - not the current working directory. ThatÂ´s why it is handy to build relative paths.</p>
