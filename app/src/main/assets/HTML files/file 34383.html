<p>Could you try and see if this works for you? </p>

<pre><code>def set_locale 
  @locale = extract_locale_from_accept_language_header
  I18n.locale = @locale 
end
</code></pre>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>After a lot of comments and the logs you paste it looks like you are getting the locale via routes. This is why you see in the log locale: en . But what you actually want to do is different, set the locale based on the headers and not the url. Remove the locale references from routes files and see if that works for you.</p>
