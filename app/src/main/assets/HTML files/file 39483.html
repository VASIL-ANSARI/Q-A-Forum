<p>If the input is consistently formatted, then why not something simple like:</p>

<pre><code>with open('input.txt') as input_file:
    questions = [line.split('\t', 2)[1].strip() for line in input_file]
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming the question part of each line in the <code>input.txt</code> file is always preceded and followed by a <code>tab</code> character, <code>questions</code> will contain a list of strings consisting of the questions.</p>
