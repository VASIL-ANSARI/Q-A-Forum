<p>The problem is that you are returning <code>null</code> from your route, which makes MVC never consider it a matching route. But a route cannot issue a 301 redirect on its own - for that, you need a controller. So, the solution is to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/36168395/181087">route to a controller and do the 301 from there</a>.</p>
