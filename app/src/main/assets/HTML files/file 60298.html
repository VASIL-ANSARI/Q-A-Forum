<p>Use a derived table to get the persons having atleast 2 distinct actions and join it to the original table to get the other columns in the result.</p>

<pre><code>select p.*
from person_log p 
join (select first_name,last_name
      from person_log
      group by first_name,last_name
      having count(*) &gt;=2 and count(distinct action) &gt;= 2) p1
on p1.first_name=p.first_name and p1.last_name=p.last_name
