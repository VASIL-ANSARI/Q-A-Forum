<h1 style="color:darkblue;">Ask Q&A User Manual</h1>

<h2 style="color:darkblue;">About the application</h2>

<p>Ask Q&A is a question and answer application for Android OS. This app provides a platform for software engineers and aspiring programmers to ask subjective questions related to some technology, software development or a domain of computer science whose answers may not be available through search engines as Google, Bing, etc. Any user who knows the answer to the question can answer the question posted on the app. This app also provides the facility to comment upon the question so as the users can clarify the meaning of the question by posting comments on that. On posting the answers, comments to a question, the notification will be sent to the recipient on all his devices where he is logged in ton the app.</p>

<p><b>Currently, features of commenting upon answers, editing and deletion of posted questions are not currently supported.</b></p>


<p>To ensure the validity of the question posted on the app, we use the concept of tags. A tag is predefined keyword related to a topic which a legit question must have. A question can have one or more tags. Tags make the search of the question faster for the user and also try to identify irrelevant questions. If a question cannot be assigned any of the tags defined in the app, then the question is considered as irrelevant and not allowed to post.</p>

<p>Any user can up vote or down vote a question, i.e., upvoting a question increases its priority to be shown first to all the users of the app and downvoting means that decreasing the priority of the question so that it is less likely to show itself to most of the users. A user can upvote or downvote a question once, i.e., if a user has already upvoted a question, then again upvoting the question will cancel his previous upvote instead and the same goes for downvote. If a user has upvoted a question previously and now attempts a downvote it, then his previous upvote is cancelled and his downvote is given to the question and vice versa.</p>

<p>Any user must login to the app to post questions, answers and comments and also to vote upon a question, otherwise he can see the questions and answers posted on them.</p>

<h2 style="color:darkblue;">How to use the application?</h2>

<p>The application takes few minutes after launching for initial setup. After this the app shows a list of all the questions posted on it as shown below.</p>

<li><p>The <b>Search</b> button is used for searching the question. On clicking the button, we see the following dialog box. On selecting the search parameter(Title, Body or Tags) we get to type in the search box and the questions are displayed whose search parameter matches the entered text. If we search by tags, then we can enter tags seperated by tags to find the questions matching atleast one of the tags.<p></li>
