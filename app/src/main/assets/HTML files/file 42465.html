<p>These are the steps,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a new class which is a subclass of <code>WKUserNotificationInterfaceController</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>From the storyboard, select your Dynamic Interface Scene for notification (if you have not created it, enable 'Has Dynamic Interface' in attribute inspector of your Static Scene ) and in Identity Inspector set custom class as created above.</p></li>
<li><p>Now modify your PushNotificationPayload.apns file contents as below,</p>

<pre><code>{
    "aps": {
        "alert": {
            "body": "New Transaction\n\n",
            "title": "Optional title"
        },
        "category": "newTransactionCategory"
    },

    "WatchKit Simulator Actions": [
                                   {
                                   "title": "Details",
                                   "identifier": "transactionDetailsButtonAction"
                                   }
                                   ],

    "Amount": "USD 20",
    "At": "Mc Donalds",
    "When": "Today",
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When a remote notification is received, this method will be called in your custom notification interface class and you will receive the custom keys in the dictionary 'remoteNotification' which you need to use to set the text of your labels here.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)remoteNotification withCompletion:(void (^)(WKUserNotificationInterfaceType))completionHandler {
    NSLog(@"remoteNotification Dictionary %@",remoteNotification);

    completionHandler(WKUserNotificationInterfaceTypeCustom);
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Last is debugging: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select your targets on the top and select Edit Scheme</p></li>
<li><p>Click on duplicate scheme at the bottom and give your custom name like 'NOTIFICATION-Mywatchkitapp' etc...</p></li>
<li><p>Then, select WatchKit Interface to Dynamic Notification, Notification Payload to your PushNotificationPayload.apns file and run for this target.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
