<p>That is strange. We use SpecifiedPickupDirectory for our test fixtures as well, to unit test email sending / receiving features. However, we keep the directory on the C:\ drive. Is the E:\ drive mapped to a network drive? Or is it local? Have you tried changing it to a location on C:\? Do you have the same problem?</p>
