<p>I have no experience with this. But on the zend lucene website they state that the currently supported lucene index version is 2.3. It might be the case that version 3.0.3 is not fully supported.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[1] The currently supported Lucene index file format version is 2.3 (starting from Zend Framework 1.6). </p>
