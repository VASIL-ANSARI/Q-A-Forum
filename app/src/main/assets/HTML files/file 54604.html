<p>I've had the exactly same problem and I just solved doing this code line (you have to have gcloud installed):</p>

<pre><code>gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file &lt;service-account file.json&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and then:</p>

<pre><code>$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=&lt;path_to_service_account_file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
