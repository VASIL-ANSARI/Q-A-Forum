<p>Your <em>Page C</em> doesn't know anything about exceptions in <em>Page B</em>. The exception that is thrown in <em>Page B</em> is handled there.</p>

<p>I guess the <code>$exception</code> you're seeing in <em>Page C</em> is a non-public member of this pages stack trace.</p>

<p>To have your <em>Page C</em> act as a generic error handler, you'd have to hand over the information about the exception. You could do this in a querystring param, but I doubt this will be an easy maintainable solution.</p>

<p>Maybe using a Master Page, providing a generic event handler could offer a better solution instead of a dedicated page but I haven't tried this.</p>
