<p>I can't think of any sane way to do what you want to do.  What I believe you should be doing is creating functions to do the drawing in the C# app and then exposing some messaging interface, such as a socket, that allows external apps to send messages that command the C# app to do what you tell it.  When the C# app receives messages of with message type DRAW_BUTTON, it draws the button, with whatever parameters were specified in the message it received.  </p>
