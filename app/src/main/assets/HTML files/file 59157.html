<p>For some reason NSSet is expected, but your NSManagedObject code has NSOrderedSet, which is a subclass of NSObject. Try to remove "Arrangment: Ordered" checkmark in your core data model and refactor those relationships to NSSet.
Not sure why this happens in iOS 10 but not in iOS 9 though.</p>

<p>P.S. Perhaps you should reconsider your Core Data model? It looks like your Open/Closed questions are going to change their status. If so, I would recommend to make one Question entity with <code>closed</code> bool or <code>status</code> int.</p>
