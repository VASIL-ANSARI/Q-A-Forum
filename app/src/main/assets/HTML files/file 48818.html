<p>There is padding/margin  between the button and the text, you need to look up at CSS file. There is two CSS files for bootstrap. </p>

<p>Find <code>btn-sm</code> in both CSS files. It will be inside one of them. However I see that you also have <code>btn btn-inverse</code> for button class. Do look at them.</p>

<p>If you want the corners of button to be more cursive, find the <code>border-radius</code> property.</p>
