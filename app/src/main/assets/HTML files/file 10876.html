<p><code>Encoding.Unicode</code> is UTF-16, not UTF-8. If you're sure your source string is encoded in UTF-8, use Encoding.UTF8 instead.</p>

<p>And returning a string doesn't have any sense. string are always encoded in UTF-16. You should worry about the encoding only when reading and writing your string.</p>

<p>When reading, use Encoding.UTF8.GetString to create a UTF-16 string from the binary data.</p>

<p>When writing, either use Encoding.GetEncoding(destinationEncoding).GetBytes to get the binary data and write it directly, or use the overload of your StreamWriter constructor (or whatever object you're using) to specify the encoding.</p>
