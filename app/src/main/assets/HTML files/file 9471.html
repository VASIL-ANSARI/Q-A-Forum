<p>I don't recommend your solution, because then if you want to ask the database "How often has Joe been in the top 10," you have to write 10 queries of the form</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Date FROM Top10 WHERE FirstPlace = 'joe'
SELECT Date FROM Top10 WHERE SecondPlace = 'joe'
...
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, how about a Rankings table, with fields: </p>

<pre><code>id
Date
Person
Rank
</code></pre>

<p>Then if you want the Top 10 list for a certain date, the query is</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Rankings WHERE Date = ...
</code></pre>

<p>and if you want to know someone's historical ranking, the query is</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Rankings WHERE Person = ...
</code></pre>

<p>and if you want to know all the historical leaders, the query is</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Rankings WHERE Rank = 1
</code></pre>

<p>The downside to this is that you might accidentally make two different people 8th place, and your database would allow the anomaly. But I have good news for you -- people might actually tie for 8th place, so you might actually want that to be possible!</p>
