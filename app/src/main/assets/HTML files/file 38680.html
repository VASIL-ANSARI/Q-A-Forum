<p>I always store data in a format that is readable by anyone.  It makes for data that is easier to transmit, use in multiple systems, avoids deprecation, etc.</p>

<p>When I store an image I store it in a PNG format instead of UIImage.  Why?  </p>

<ul>
<li>UIImage could change.</li>
<li>I may want to upload it to a server.</li>
<li>I may need to read the file on OS X.</li>
<li>I might want to make it transportable later.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to data, I like to think past just the here and now.</p>
