<p>Quote from <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf" rel="nofollow">N1256</a> 6.7.8 Initialization</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10 If an object that has automatic storage duration is not initialized explicitly, its value is
  indeterminate. If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly,
  then:<br>
  â if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a null pointer;<br>
  â if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero;<br>
  â if it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules;<br>
  â if it is a union, the first named member is initialized (recursively) according to these
  rules.</p>
  
  <p>21 If there are fewer initializers in a brace-enclosed list than there are elements or members
  of an aggregate, or fewer characters in a string literal used to initialize an array of known
  size than there are elements in the array, the remainder of the aggregate shall be
  initialized implicitly the same as objects that have static storage duration.</p>
