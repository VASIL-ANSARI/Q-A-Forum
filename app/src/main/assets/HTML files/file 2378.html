<p>You could use long-polling. Basically you send a request to the server, and it waits to return with a response. The server will hold the connection until data is available, and it will then return the response containing the data.</p>

<p>For examples of long-polling with Javascript (frameworks), see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/333664/simple-long-polling-example-code">this question</a>. Additionally, PerplexedLabs did a short tutorial/example of long polling with jQuery and PHP earlier in 2009. You can view it online at <a href="http://blog.perplexedlabs.com/2009/05/04/php-jquery-ajax-javascript-long-polling/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.perplexedlabs...javascript-long-polling/</a>.</p>
