<p>Mediatemple (dv) servers come with curl pre-loaded, but to use php's curl functionality you must have the php extension loaded in php.ini</p>

<p>You can check if it is enabled by creating a script like the following and viewing its output in the browser:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the curl extension is loaded then there will be an entry in the <code>phpinfo()</code> output titled "curl"</p>

<p>If there isn't, you need to edit your php.ini file. You should have this line somewhere (make sure it's not commented out) ...</p>

<pre><code>extension=php_curl.so
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards, restart apache. You should be able to do this on a mediatemple dv to restart apache:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/init.d/httpd restart
</code></pre>

<p>After apache comes back online, check the phpinfo() output again for the "curl" section. This should solve the most likely cause of your problem.</p>
