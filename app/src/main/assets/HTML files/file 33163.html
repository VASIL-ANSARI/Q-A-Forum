<p>From the docs for <code>DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Items dispatched to the queue run at high priority; the queue is scheduled for execution before any default priority or low priority queue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So code from different queues can still run concurrently, it's just that the higher priority queue is scheduled for execution before lower priority queues. Since the two queues may be setup in different threads, the two threads can run together. But it is quite possible that the higher priority queue (thread) will be given more opportunity to complete than the lower priority queue (thread).</p>

<p>It might be interesting to time how long (clock time) it take <code>task:</code> to run (try several iterations) and see if the higher priority queue gets done faster than lower priority queues.</p>
