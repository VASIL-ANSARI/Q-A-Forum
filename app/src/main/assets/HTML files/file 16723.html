<p>The problem was due to my WCF service calling back to SharePoint asking for user roles and permission levels. After a certain amount of hits, SharePoint stopped responding to WCF service, which in turn stopped responding to SharePoint, causing a big mess. </p>

<p>For now, i haven't done much to fix it other than making sure the servers are not too busy, it doesn't seem to cause a problem in production yet, as the problem only occurs under heavy load on production server.</p>
