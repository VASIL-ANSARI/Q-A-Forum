<p>I doubt you have access to the <code>/tmp</code> directory on the server. You probably have your own <code>tmp</code> directory and are just using the wrong path.</p>

<p>If that directory is inside the same directory this script is running this should work:</p>

<pre><code>$ret = file_put_contents('./tmp/mydata.txt', $data, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>.</code> before <code>/tmp</code> which means that file path starts in the same directory as this file.</p>
