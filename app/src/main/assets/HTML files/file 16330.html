<p>You really don't want to put the table in a scroll view. When the user scrolls on the table it will not move the underlying scrollview so you won't get the effect you are looking for.</p>

<p>Implement viewForHeaderInSection instead and pass in the view you want to display above the first row, or set tableViewHeader.</p>
