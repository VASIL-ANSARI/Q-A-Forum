<p>What you are doing is very similar to creating something like this:</p>

<pre><code>vector&lt;int&gt; MyInts;
vector&lt; vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator &gt; MyIntIters;
</code></pre>

<p>And then every time you add a new int to <code>MyInts</code>, you get the iterator and push that iterator in to <code>MyIntIters</code>.</p>

<p>You can't do this with a <code>vector</code> because the iterators could become invalid anytime you add a new int to <code>MyInts</code>.</p>

<p>So your whole structure is broken.  You need to come up with an entirely new design.  First I'd ask you why you want a vector of iterators (or pointers) to another vector.  Is it for sorting?  Indexing somehow?  Something else?  there's certainly a better way to do whatever it is you're trying to do.  <em>What</em> you're trying to do will help determine <em>how</em> to do it.</p>

<h2>EDIT:</h2>

<p>After reading &amp; rereading your update several times, it seems to me like you're trying to create a vector of gloms.  That is, a buffer of variable length that has structured data at the beginning and something else following it.</p>

<p>This is fairly tricky business, and it requires dynamic allocation.  You're not using dynamic allocation, though -- you push the objects in to the vector by value.  The pointers to those objects will change as the vector is resized and shuffled.</p>

<p>So if this is what you're trying to do, you need to change things around so that you create your glom using <code>new</code>, and push the pointer to the glom on to the vector.  This opens a whole pandora's box of trouble though.  How big do you make the buffers?  How do you parse the glom?  How do you handle deep copies, resizes, etc?  How do you properly deallocate the gloms without leaking like a sieve?  As I said, tricky business.  In my line of work we do this kind of thing all the time, and have a bunch of standard practices that we use.  These took a lot of effort &amp; a lot of testing with trial &amp; error to get right, and we still find problems.  If this is what you're doing, you might consider going another way.</p>
