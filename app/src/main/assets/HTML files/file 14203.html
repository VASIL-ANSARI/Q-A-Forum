<p>I Have found the right solution for this problem. What this code was doing is after six records it was refreshing the picker and this condition "if (pickerLabel == nil)" was becoming false Hence it was repeating the same records. I once I copied this lines of code in to else part as well its working fine for me.</p>

<pre><code> else{
                [pickerLabel setFont:[UIFont systemFontOfSize:14]];
                [pickerLabel setBackgroundColor:[UIColor clearColor]];
                [pickerLabel setLineBreakMode:UILineBreakModeWordWrap];
                [pickerLabel setTextAlignment:UITextAlignmentCenter];
                [pickerLabel setText:title]; 
                [pickerLabel setNumberOfLines:3];
      }
</code></pre>

<p>may it can be helpful to others who facing same problem like me.</p>
