<p>Functions are how you run some code somewhere else and return back to where you started.  Loops are how you run the same code again and again until some condition is met.</p>

<p>Here is some incomplete code to demonstrate.</p>

<pre><code>def some_function(x)
    puts "x is #{x} some function"
end

def another_function(x)
    puts "x is #{x} in another function"
end

def something_else(x)
    puts "x is #{x} in something else"
end

# I've left are_we_done undefined, it's the condition for
# stopping the loop.  I've also left get_x undefined.
while !are_we_done
    x = get_x

    if x &gt; 5
        some_function(x)
    elsif x &lt; 5
        another_function(x)
    else # x is 5
        something_else(x)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Teaching these fundamentals is beyond a Stack Overflow answer. I would suggest going through a tutorial like <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/" rel="nofollow">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a> to learn the fundamentals of loops and functions.</p>
