<p>Are you sure that you have the index of the name right?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stylecop.com/docs/SA1202.html">ElementsMustBeOrderedByAccess seems to be rule SA1202</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms244717.aspx">You should check the Microsoft documentation for rule suppressions, which explains the constructor syntax</a>.</p>

<p>OK, so it seems you are using a <a href="http://stylecopplus.codeplex.com/">StyleCop+</a> rule - meaning that it is a bit of a pain to find the appropriate suppression data.</p>

<p>I have found the information for the ID in the <a href="https://github.com/shuruev/StyleCopPlus/blob/master/StyleCopPlus/StyleCopPlusRules.xml">source XML</a> file for the rules, and, if I understand correctly, the category should be set to the full name of the class that exposes the rule, which is <a href="https://github.com/shuruev/StyleCopPlus/blob/master/StyleCopPlus/StyleCopPlusRules.cs"><code>StyleCopPlus.StyleCopPlusRules</code></a>.</p>

<p>Meaning that the minimal attribute declaration, in your case, would be:</p>

<pre><code>[SuppressMessage("StyleCopPlus.StyleCopPlusRules","SP0100:AdvancedNamingRules")]
</code></pre>
