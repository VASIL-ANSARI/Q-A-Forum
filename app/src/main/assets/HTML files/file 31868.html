<p>There is no equivalent to <code>rowid</code> in MySQL.  <code>rowid</code> represents the physical location of the record, and that information is not available in MySQL.</p>

<p>The following may be sufficient for what you want:</p>

<pre><code>select (@rn := @rn + 1) as rowid, keyword, value
from t cross join
     (select @rn := 0) const;
</code></pre>

<p>Although this query is not guaranteed to return the rows in physical order, in practice it would typically do so.  The <code>rowid</code> is just a sequential number in this case.</p>
