<p>Maybe something like this:</p>

<pre><code>;WITH CTE
AS
(
    SELECT
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY gps_id 
                     ORDER BY date2 DESC) AS RowNbr,
        person_gps.*
    FROM
        person_gps  
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    gps
    JOIN CTE
        ON gps.gps_id=CTE.gps_id
        AND CTE.RowNbr=1
WHERE EXISTS
    (
        SELECT
            NULL
        FROM
            client_gps
        WHERE
            client_gps.gps_id=gps.gps_id
            AND client_gps.client_id=2--Limit on some clientid
    )
</code></pre>
