<p>I think Because you are using 2 versions of same library. Use one of them and then build the project.</p>

<pre><code>compile 'jp.wasabeef:recyclerview-animators:1.2.2'
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code> compile 'jp.wasabeef:recyclerview-animators:1.3.0'
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using a RecyclerView 23.0.1 or below. (As this lib document)</p>

<pre><code>dependencies {
compile 'jp.wasabeef:recyclerview-animators:1.3.0'
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this will help you. Thanks...</p>
