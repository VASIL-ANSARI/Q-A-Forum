<p>The geocoder is just that - a geocoder. A Geocoder understands addresses - and tries to turn them into coordinates. </p>

<p>It does not understand business names. So the business name at the beginning of the string, will confuse the geocoder. </p>

<p>Don't try to pass business names to the geocoder. </p>

<p>Why are you even trying? The autocomplete data contains coordiantes. </p>
