<p>Check your geometry to see if you have UVs defined. If not, then the lack of UVs is likely the cause of your error message.</p>

<p>A mesh cannot have a texture applied if the mesh's geometry is missing UVs.</p>

<p>For <code>THREE.Geometry</code>, UVs are specified in the property <code>faceVertexUVs</code>.</p>

<p>For <code>THREE.BufferGeometry</code>, UVs are specified as a geometry attribute.</p>
