<p>The selector would be <code>img.guitarLogo:hover</code></p>

<p>But setting a background-color for an image will only affect the visible part <em>around</em> the image (if there is ANY), and <code>color</code> would only affect text (and there isn't any), so you will problably see no effect, even if it works.</p>
