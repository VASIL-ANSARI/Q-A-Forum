<p>In general, dispose of it when you're done with it, and don't worry about it.  </p>

<p>ADO.NET implements <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8xx3tyca.aspx" rel="nofollow">connection pooling</a> by default, so the connection is kept open behind the scenes so as to spare you the performance penalty of opening new connections all of the time.  </p>

<p>Another reason to close the connections in your code -- if you lose connectivity to your database server when you're not using the connection, you won't encounter an error, which could happen if you keep the connection open.</p>
