<p>Do you need to test for the absence of the method? As in, use Java reflection to ensure that the method does not exist? Then you need to have test2() and test3() defined.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can just have an empty body. The test will succeed, which it should as not performing an action is built in to the process. I'm not sure what you are trying to avoid by not having SKIP in your test report. There are any number of valid reasons for skipping tests, and you have given one of them.</p>

<p>If <code>ATest</code> only tests a class that does not implement test3() then use <code>@Test(enabled=false)</code> in its definition. That way, TestNG will never call test3().</p>

<p>Here is how I would redo what you have proposed:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class MegaTester {

    @Test
    public void test1() {
    ...
    }

     @Test
     public void test2() {
     ...
     }

     @Test
     public void test3() {
     ...
     }
 }

 public class ATest extends MegaTester {
     @Test
     public void test1() {
     // my own implementation of test1
     }

     // test2 from MegaTester will be called here

     @Test(enabled=false)
     public void test3() {}
 }
</code></pre>
