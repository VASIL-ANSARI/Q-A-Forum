<p>When the button is pressed, you initiate a load. When the load completes (some time later) the connectionDidFinishLoading: method is called. But until that happens, "goldRate" will be nil (because it is not yet initialized).</p>

<p>Set the label in the connectionDidFinishLoading: instead of where you have it, and the value will show up.</p>
