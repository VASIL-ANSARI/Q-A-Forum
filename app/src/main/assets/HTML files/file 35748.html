<p>Have a close look to your vertex shader with matrix multiplications applied. Notably those two lines:</p>

<pre><code>gl_Position = projection_Matrix * view_Matrix * model_Matrix * in_Position;
gl_Position = in_Position;
</code></pre>

<p>So you see it? Okay, look at the second line? What does it? It overwrites the gl_Position variable with the untransformed in_Position. Get rid of that and you should see matrices do their work.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Next problem here</p>

<pre><code>// Projection - simple perspective
projection_Matrix = Matrices.perspective(60, Display.getWidth() / Display.getHeight(), 0.1f, 100f);
projection_Matrix = Matrices.ortho(-1, 1, 1, -1, 0.1f, 100f);
projection_Matrix = new Mat4(1);
</code></pre>

<p>You should really settle for one matrix and stay with that. Right now you're just overwriting projecting_Matrix with a identity matrix.</p>

<p>In the calculation of the perspective matrix the division of display width and height will likely be an integer division with round-down. You have to cast the results of getWidth and getHeight to float first.</p>

<pre><code>projection_Matrix =
    Matrices.perspective(
        60,
        (float)Display.getWidth() / (float)Display.getHeight(),
        0.1f, 100.f );
</code></pre>

<p>However I doubt you really want the display size there. More likely you want the viewport size use for the aspect ration calculation. Also 0.1 for near and 100 for far are not optimal values. You should choose near as large as possible.</p>
