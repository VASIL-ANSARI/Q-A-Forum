<p>One of the options could be creating some kind of requests queue on client. Once user sorts two items, an item is added to the queue and starts executing. If another sort happens before the first call completes, it is put in the queue and will be executing after the first finishes.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>
You should for sure handle a case, when a synchronous request is performed. At this stage all ajax requests should be somehow stored in hidden field (just an idea) and process by server before the synchronous request itself.</p>
