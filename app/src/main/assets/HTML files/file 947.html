<p>Unfortunately ruby 1.8.x has poor unicode support.  It's being addressed in 1.9.  But in the mean time, libraries like this one (<a href="http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/4527" rel="nofollow">http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/4527</a>) are a good solution.  Using the linked library, your code would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>"unicode_string".each_utf8_char do |u| 
    render_unicode_letter(u)
end
</code></pre>
