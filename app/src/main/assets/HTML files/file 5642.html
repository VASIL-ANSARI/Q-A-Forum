<p>I don't know about Glassfish, but I can tell you how to do it with Tomcat.  The only difference should be the app server that you start inside IntelliJ:</p>

<ol>
<li>Under project settings, create a web module - that'll give you your /WEB-INF and web.xml</li>
<li>Under project settings, create an artifact that maps to your exploded WAR file.  Make sure that the JARs you need are added to the WEB-INF/lib; your .class files are copied to WEB-INF/classes; all necessary resources are put where you want them.</li>
<li>Set up Glassfish and tell it to deploy your exploded WAR artifact.  Give it the name of your web app as context root (e.g., "/foo").</li>
<li>Run the web app. IntelliJ will compile your code, create the exploded WAR artifact in the /out directory, and deploy to your app server.</li>
<li>You should see the app start under the URL <a href="http://localhost:4848/foo/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:4848/foo/index.html</a>, assuming you have an index.html welcome file in your web.xml</li>
</ol>

<p>JNDI set up is another matter.</p>
