<p>I'm not sure what exactly you are trying to achieve here, but I will tell you why the loop is stuck at 0.</p>

<p>It is because the url you are trying to access with Jsoup (e.g. www.google.com0) <strong>is not a valid url</strong>, and it will return a <code>404</code> response, which Jsoup will treat as a <code>http exception</code>, and hence the loop is stopped and the control goes to <code>catch</code> block to catch the exception.</p>

<p>If you really want to go from 0 to 29, below code will work for you:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I now see the problem. Change your code to this:</p>

<pre><code>try {
    int a = 0;
    boolean condition = true;
    while (a &lt; 30 &amp;&amp; condition) {

        try{
            doc = Jsoup.connect("http://www.google.com" + a).get();
        } catch(Exception jsoupE){
            continue;
        }

        Elements info = doc.select("td[valign=top]");
        if (info.first() != null) {
            System.out.println(info);
            condition = false;
            System.out.println(a);
        } else {
        a = a + 1;
        }
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
}
</code></pre>
