<p>Just a suggestion to get things working:</p>

<ol>
<li>There's no need to <code>$watch</code> both <code>score</code> and <code>ptsPossible</code> since the latter never changes after the value is loaded from its corresponding attribute value. You also have access to <code>scope</code> variables inside the <code>$watch</code> callback function.</li>
<li>That's unusual as I would've expected your <code>removeClass()</code> to work as well. You could instead try <code>removeAttr('class')</code> here in the meanwhile.</li>
</ol>
