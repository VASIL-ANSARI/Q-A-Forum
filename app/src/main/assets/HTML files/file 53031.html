<p>No, this is not a bug. This is by design instead. If you adhere to exact intervals from the starting time, you can end up with erratic roll-overs. If your app is quiet until shortly before the next 'fixed' rollover time, you'd get two new files closely together (one created at 5 seconds before the hour, the next at the hour, for example).</p>

<p>So for the interval types <code>S</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>H</code> and <code>D</code>, sparse logging will result in a new interval starting when the next log entry comes in. That way you still get a full duration before the next rotation.</p>

<p>An exception is made for <code>midnight</code> and the <code>W0</code> .. <code>W6</code> weekday rotations; just below the code you found it makes a precise calculation for the next midnight (of the correct weekday if needed) for the next rollover. That's because these intervals <em>do</em> imply a specific time in the day. And with <em>whole days</em> for logging to take place, a last-minute log entry before a rotation point is far less of a problem.</p>
