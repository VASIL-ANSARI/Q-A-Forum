<p>Let's create a table. (Get in the habit of including CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements in all your SQL questions.)</p>

<pre><code>create table runs (
  entry_id integer not null,
  run_num integer not null
    check (run_num between 1 and 3),
  run_time interval not null
);

insert into runs values
(1, 1, '00:59.33'),
(2, 1, '00:59.93'),
(3, 1, '01:03.27'),
(1, 2, '00:59.88'),
(2, 2, '00:59.27');
</code></pre>

<p>This SQL statement will give you the totals in the order you want, but without ranking them.</p>

<pre><code>with num_runs as (
  select entry_id, count(*) as num_runs
  from runs
  group by entry_id
)
select r.entry_id, n.num_runs, sum(r.run_time) as total_time
from runs r
inner join num_runs n on n.entry_id = r.entry_id
group by r.entry_id, n.num_runs
order by num_runs desc, total_time asc
</code></pre>

<pre>
entry_id  num_runs  total_time
--
2         2         00:01:59.2
1         2         00:01:59.21
3         1         00:01:03.27
</pre>

<p>This statement adds a column for rank.</p>

<pre><code>with num_runs as (
  select entry_id, count(*) as num_runs
  from runs
  group by entry_id
)
select 
  rank() over (order by num_runs desc, sum(r.run_time) asc), 
  r.entry_id, n.num_runs, sum(r.run_time) as total_time
from runs r
inner join num_runs n on n.entry_id = r.entry_id
group by r.entry_id, n.num_runs
order by rank asc
</code></pre>

<pre>
rank  entry_id  num_runs  total_time
--
1     2         2         00:01:59.2
2     1         2         00:01:59.21
3     3         1         00:01:03.27
</pre>
