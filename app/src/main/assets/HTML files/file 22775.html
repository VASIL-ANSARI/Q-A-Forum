<p>The browser is likely doing some work for you in decrypting it. Try using a tool like Fiddler (<a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/</a>) to grab network traffic outside the browser environment. Fiddler also allows you to decrypt HTTPS traffic, but it's not enabled by default.</p>
