<p>It looks like you're trying to identify the first matching state, and only perform your "else" condition when no state is found:</p>

<pre><code>var searchStates = function(state){
    for (var key in usStates) {
        if(usStates[key].name === state.toUpperCase()){
            alert(state + " is a valid US State" + "\n" + "The state tax is " +     usStates[key].taxAmount);
           userState.push(usStates[key].name, usStates[key].taxAmount, usStates[key].abbreviation);
            return; // stop once we've found a state
         }
    }
    // if we haven't stopped, that means we didn't find one
    alert(state + "is not a valid US State. Please try again.")

};
</code></pre>
