<p>If the variable is a pointer to an object, you use <code>*</code>. An exception is <code>id</code> (which has an implied *). Things like <code>NSRect</code> and <code>NSRange</code> are just structures wrapped around basic C variables.</p>

As long as you understand the rules behind it, I wouldn't worry about it too much - you will soon pick up which things are which.</p>
