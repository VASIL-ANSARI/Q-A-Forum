<p>First of all, I don't see a comma (,) after the first line in your final SELECT statement (after a.Combined), and secondly, I think it's really bad idea to also call the value of the STUFF statement the same - .. as a.Combined - try to use distinct names </p>

<p>So try this as your final <code>SELECT</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    a.ElementUID, a.Combined,   -- add a comma at the end of this line
    STUFF((SELECT CAST('' AS VARCHAR(MAX)) + e.Combined
           FROM #TempTable
           WHERE e.ElementUID = a.ElementUID
           FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE) AS Stuffed     -- use a distinct name here!
FROM #TempTable a
ORDER BY a.ElementUID DESC
</code></pre>
