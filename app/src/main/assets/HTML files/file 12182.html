<p>I've found that the streaming media playback is very finicky about the video files it likes to play.</p>

<p>If you can point your code to a different movie file and it works, then I would suggest either finding a different converter, or tweaking the settings related to the codec in yours and trying again. Or you could set it up to download the video the the SD and then play it from there.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I've had pretty good luck with Wondershare Video Converter Platinum. There is a free version I think, but I've ponied up the money for it once I tested it and found it to work for my needs. </p>

<p>Post the code that is inside your VideoOutput class also. That might help to shed some light on what is going on. </p>

<p>Also you should replace both instances of <code>getApplicationContext()</code> with <code>YourActivityName.this</code>. Using getApplicationContext() in this manner is prone to keeping copies of your context around in memory longer than they need to be. Plus your Activity already <em>is</em> a Context, so you don't need to get a new reference to a context with a larger scope.</p>
