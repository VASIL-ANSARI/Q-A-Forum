<p>You might have to use the live function with your events. When you destroy/re-add items that matched a raw event function when jQuery loaded (like .click or .submit) their events are gone once they are removed.</p>

<p>To get around this use .live which will apply the event to all existing and future-added elements that match your selector:</p>

<pre><code>$('a.changeForm').live('click', function(event){

$('.showForm').live('submit', function(event){   
</code></pre>
