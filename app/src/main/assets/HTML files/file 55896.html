<p>The process of validation ensures that a webpage is future proofed and will work in other versions of a web browser. It will also (to a certain extent) allow you to debug your work. For further reasons to validate see <a href="https://validator.w3.org/docs/why.html#why_pros" rel="nofollow">https://validator.w3.org/docs/why.html#why_pros</a>. It is not something you <em>have</em> to do. So, rather than <em>hack</em> the validator just don't validate. Not validating doesn't mean that your website is broken and won't work it just means that your website might use outdated tags or doesn't follow what is considered to be best practise.      </p>
