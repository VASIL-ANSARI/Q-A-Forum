<p>You violated here almost every rule of OOP. there shouldn't be variables like _query in your class. </p>

<p>What you really need is just these five lines:</p>

<pre><code>public function runQuery($sql, $bind_value = array()) {
    $stmt = $this-&gt;_pdo-&gt;prepare($sql);
    $stmt-&gt;execute($bind_value);
    return $stmt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>which have to <em>return</em> a statement, not set it as a class variable. </p>

<p>get() function is also useless and wrong and you better avoid it. If you really want a function to automate select queries, you have to look at the existing query builders, like AuraSQL.</p>
