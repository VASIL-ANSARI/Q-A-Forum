<p>All this calls belong to file-system component.  Which are then routed through the kernel to the actual hardware drives.  So there is no way to know just by looking at system calls.</p>

<p>What you need to do is to look for the open calls to see what file is being opened. The call will return a number,  called file handle.  This number is later used as a first argument to  read / write / close calls.</p>

<p>Things are even tricker for WIFI,  since you will have to monitor a whole bunch of socket calls as well as things like <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/sendto" rel="nofollow">sendto</a>.  Plus you'll need to cross reference the routing map.</p>

<p>Basically,  what you are trying to do is really hard to do on syscall level.  I used to do such things in the past by going a level deeper,  to the kernel and drivers.  There you are
much closer to actual hardware to see the context.</p>
