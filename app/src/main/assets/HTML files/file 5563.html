<p>Reply-to and return path are two distinct beasts. See the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2822.html" rel="nofollow">RFC</a>.</p>

<p>You can set Reply-to with:</p>

<pre><code>msg['reply-to'] = 'smith@acme.com'
</code></pre>

<p>The return-path is set by the MTA to the address that receives bounces. It is controlled by the server administrator, so unless you work for Google I don't think this is under your control.</p>

<p>Most of the time one is after "Reply-to"; if you really need to change the return path you must use a SMTP server under your control and google for how to do this for the specific MTA you are using - many will have a white list of users and/or hosts that can override the return path.</p>
