<p>You need to set the content size of the scroll view so that it knows how to scroll its subviews:</p>

<pre><code>[scrollView setContentSize:postTextView.frame.size];
</code></pre>

<p>The frame of the scroll view is just the space it takes up by itself on self.view. The content size is the size that all of the scroll view's subviews will take up inside of the scroll view.</p>
