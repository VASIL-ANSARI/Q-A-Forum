<p>You are confusing passing <em>a</em> reference and passing <em>by</em> reference.</p>

<p>It's true that parameters are passed by value, but that doesn't mean that you can't pass a reference type. The reference is passed by value, which means that the reference is copied to the stack, the object itself is not copied.</p>

<p>Passing by reference is used when you have to change the variable that you are passing in.</p>

<p>Just remove the <code>ref</code> keyword, and your code will work just fine.</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>As you are passing a value type into the method, it will be boxed, so the value is actually copied. You will be displaying the copy of the value, not the live value. Passing the parameter by reference doesn't help either, as you have to copy the value to make an object reference to it.</p>

<p>If you want to display value types, you would rather send in a function that can retrieve the value instead of the value itself:</p>

<pre><code>Dictionary&lt;String, Func&lt;object&gt;&gt; debugStrings = new Dictionary&lt;String, Func&lt;object&gt;&gt;();

public void addVariable(String index, Func&lt;object&gt; getValue) {
  debugStrings.Add(index, getValue);                        
}
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>debugPrinter.addVariable("myrotationvalue", () =&gt; this.Rotation);
</code></pre>
