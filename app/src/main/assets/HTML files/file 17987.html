<p>as i said make an activity layout which cover quarter area of screen, I added flag for activity <code>getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE, PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT);</code></p>

<p>it works :) to get access of launcher screen, even my activity is open. I notice another one thing i m not able to get click event on launcher, nor getting focus from my activity to launcher, it's just giving me touch event on launcher.</p>

<p>any one have idea over this, how can i get focus from my activity to launcher or any open application.</p>
