<p>If it's the amount of data you can fit in a field that you're concerned about, why not store the number as a varchar? To my knowledge, pretty much any database will let you go up to at least a varchar(255). If you need more than 255 digits in the number, you could encode it in base 64 to squeeze it down more. If my mental arithmetic is right, that gives you 255 characters * 6 bits per character = 1530 different bits to use. If you need more than that, I might suggest your permissions model is a little excessive.</p>

<p>That's assuming that you're trying to crowd the data into a smallish space in the database. Your question isn't entirely clear on what you're trying to solve for. On the other end of the spectrum, you could unpack the bits and save each bit to its own field or its own row. For example, user_permissions could be a table with two columns: user and permission, where each row is one permission granted to one user.</p>
