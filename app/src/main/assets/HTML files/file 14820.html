<p>The very last line in this post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10418680/adding-gradient-to-element-breaks-css-functionality-in-ie">Adding gradient to element breaks CSS functionality in IE</a> did the trick! Following are a few noteworthy observations for people that might face similar problem in the future.</p>

<ol>
<li>Of course, the IE filter gradient does not go very well with the ul
or li - meaning if the gradient is applied to an li the li gets the
gradient, but all its sub-items become hidden (or does not appear on
hover over the top level li).  </li>
<li>However, if the filter is applied on
an element internal to the li (for example a div inside the li),
then both the gradient and the drop-down work.</li>
<li>In my case, I wanted my top level li to increase in height on hover and have the sub-ul
    top start below where the top li ends. Since the filter was not
    working initially, the li was not getting filled with any background
    and hence there was a gap between the top level li and the sub-ul. I
    should have followed the best practice of having a default flat
    background, in case the filter did not work. When I did that with
    the filter commented out, the dropdown worked fine (no discontinuity
    between the top level li and the sub-ul).</li>
<li>The suggestion I followed initially and was happy about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10226159/drop-down-menu-doesnt-work-in-ie9">Drop down menu doesn&#39;t work in IE9</a> turned out to be a no-solution. Adding ms- or -ms or anything for that matter in front of filter essentially just comments out the filter line. </li>
</ol>
