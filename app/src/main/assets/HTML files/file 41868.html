<blockquote>
  <p>First off, why is aArgs initially ignoring the first argument in the arguments list?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the first argument is the value that <code>this</code> will be set to (<code>oThis</code>). We don't want to pass that as argument to the function later on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Secondly, why is fToBind taking the aArgs array and concatenating the rest of the arguments after? Wouldn't this create an array with args 1 to n concatenated with args 0 to n?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Note that those are different arguments sets. <code>aArgs</code> refers to the arguments passed to <code>.bind()</code>, while <code>arguments</code> refers to the arguments of the <em>bound function</em> <code>fBound</code>.</p>

<p>We want to pass both, arguments that have been passed to <code>.bind</code> and the arguments that have been passed to the bound function. I.e. we want</p>

<pre><code>var fBound = f.bind(null, a, b); // aArgs = [a, b];
fBound(c, d); // arguments = [c, d]
</code></pre>

<p>to be equivalent to <code>f(a, b, c, d)</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Basically it does everything so that the shim works like the <code>.bind</code> is expected to work. If you are confused by the implementation that you might needs to spend some more time to get a better understanding of <code>.bind</code>.</p>
