<p>After a little tweaking, the solution is</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Setter Property="Margin" Value="0,-10,0,-10"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You've got a 20 pixel margin to remove. But the <code>0</code> for Left and Right are critical, when you leave them blank you can see the defaults are negative (they stick out of the frame). There seems to be a difference in how that's rendered in the designer and on the device.</p>

<p>So there might be an underlying bug worth reporting here.</p>
