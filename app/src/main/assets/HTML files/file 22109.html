<p>Here, the root View is a LinearLayout but you try to cast it your custom class:</p>

<pre><code>DoubleTextItem item = (DoubleTextItem) inflater.inflate(R.layout.widget_double_text_item, layout);              
</code></pre>

<p>The standard advice is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All DoubleTextItems are LinearLayouts, but not all LinearLayouts are DoubleTextItems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning you cannot downcast objects from a LinearLayout to a DoubleTextItem, there are too many assumptions and Java won't let you do it.</p>

<p>If you want a DoubleTextItem in your layout you need to use:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;your.package.name.DoubleTextItem 
    ... /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(Also, calling inflate inside <code>onFinishInflate()</code> seems a little silly especially since you don't save the inflated item... If you want to inflate a different layout, don't inflate the first one.)</p>

<p>Overall it looks like you are trying to recreate the now deprecated <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TwoLineListItem.html" rel="nofollow">TwoLineListItem</a>, perhaps you can learn some pointers from it's <a href="http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.1.1_r1/android/widget/TwoLineListItem.java#TwoLineListItem" rel="nofollow">source code</a> (or just use the TwoLineListItem.)</p>
