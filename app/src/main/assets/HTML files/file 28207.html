<p>So each <code>Message</code> has a foreign <code>Topic</code> and <code>User</code> fields, and you'd like to persist the <code>Message</code> instances <em>before</em> you've assigned them to those foreign objects?</p>

<p>Yes, you can certainly leave your <code>topic</code> and <code>user</code> fields to be <code>null</code>.  You will need to mark them as <code>canBeNull=true</code> of course.  Then later you should be able to set the <code>topic</code> or <code>user</code> fields on the <code>Message</code> in question and then call <code>messageDao.update(message)</code> to update the database.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>After reading your comments I now understand.  Is there a way to just save the id fields onto a class instead of creating dummy objects that just have the id field set?  There answer is no unless you do raw SQL create statement yourself.  ORMLite needs to have a <code>Topic</code> field because that's what it is expecting.  If you just want the id then you can have a <code>int topic_id</code> field instead of <code>Topic topic</code> and do the topic association yourself.</p>
