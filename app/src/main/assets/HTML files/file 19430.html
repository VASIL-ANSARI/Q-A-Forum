<p>The way you are adding the annotations is fine.<br>
Not sure what your concern is and what you mean by "all the points at a single place".<br>
If you want pins/annotations at several places, you have to create a separate annotation object for each place.</p>

<p>Drawing a route connecting those locations requires creating an overlay (not an "annotation").<br>
You want to add an <code>MKPolyline</code> to the map for which you will specify the list of coordinates.  </p>

<p>To draw the polyline, you don't need to also add annotations at each coordinate (but you could if you want to).</p>

<p>Creating and adding an <code>MKPolyline</code> and its corresponding <code>MKPolylineView</code> is very similar to <code>MKPolygon</code> and <code>MKPolygonView</code>.  See this question for an example:</p>
