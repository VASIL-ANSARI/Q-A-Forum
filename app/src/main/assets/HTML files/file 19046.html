<p>Firstly, WOW, it's really awesome!</p>

<p>I see that it happens both on firefox and chrome.
When I changed the top/bottom/left/right for the triangles to 28-29px it was better positioned.</p>

<p>I think it has to do with the sizing method (or browser resizing bug - though I don't think so as it happens on both browsers), did you try converting the 'px' to 'em', as 'em' is meant to keep size proportions better.</p>
