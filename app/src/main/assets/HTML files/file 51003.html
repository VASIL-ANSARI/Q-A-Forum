<p>This question is similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/541487/implements-runnable-vs-extends-thread">this SO post</a> (q.v. Jon Skeet's highly upvoted answer), but I will give an answer anyway.  There are two ways to create a thread in Java.  The first way is to <em>extend</em> the <code>Thread</code> class directly, and the second is to <em>implement</em> the <code>Runnable</code> interface.  These two options are what Bloch is generally arguing over.</p>

<p>If you choose to extend the <code>Thread</code> class directly, then you are not free to extend any other class (since Java does not allow multiple inheritance).  This is a design limitation.  On the other hand, if you implement the marker interface <code>Runnable</code>, then you are still free to extend any other class you wish.</p>

<p>Philosophically, using the interface is generally considered better design, because it simply marks a class a something which <em>can</em> be run as a thread, without explicitly saying <em>how</em> it will be run.</p>
