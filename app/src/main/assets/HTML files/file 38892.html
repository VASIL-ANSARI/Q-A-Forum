<p>I am not sure what that plunker <strong>should</strong> show if it is working, so it's hard to tell you how to achieve it.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can tell you a little more about transclude though.</p>

<p>Actually, if you want to have a bit more control over element transclusion, then you probably want to handle it in the <code>link</code> function, which has the following signature</p>

<pre><code>link: function (scope, element, attributes, controller, transclude)
</code></pre>

<p>Then, inside your link function you can use the provided <code>transclude</code> function to do something with the element:</p>

<pre><code>transclude(scope, function(clone, scope) {
  element.append(clone);
});
</code></pre>

<p>The first argument is the scope that you want the transcluded elements bound to. </p>

<p><strong>Side note</strong>: the default functionality is a new (non-isolate) sub-scope of the controller in which the <strong>transcluding</strong> directive sits in. I.e. if you're using a directive with an isolate scope, then the transcluded content can't see it by default. You probably don't need to worry about this for this example though.</p>

<p>The second argument is a function, which takes the cloned element, and the new scope of that element. Inside this function you can append the <code>clone</code> to the directive's <code>element</code>, put it somewhere inside the template, before, or after, or just disregard it entirely.</p>

<p>Lastly, remember <strong><code>ng-transclude</code></strong> is a directive itself. Essentially <code>ng-transclude</code> is an out of the box implementation of the above (although it uses different a different scope as mentioned in the side note). As such, if you use the <code>transclude</code> function <strong>and</strong> you still have <code>ng-transclude</code> inside your template, then you will find two copies of the transcluded element. In other words, only use <code>ng-transclude</code> if you are not manually transcluding the content yourself.</p>
