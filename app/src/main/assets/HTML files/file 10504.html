<p>However, the best way to learn this stuff is by trial-and-error. HTML and CSS are unique in their forgiving approach to malformation/errors. This, along with the fact that no two browsers render HTML/CSS exactly alike, presents a certain ambiguity that even experienced HTML/CSS developers occasionally grapple with. </p>

<p>Still, learning this stuff is a blast, and really rewarding once you get a handle on it. Happy coding!</p>
