<p>JSON is simply a way to save or transfer data -- if you care about how it looks (e.g. how it's sorted), you are probably doing something wrong. If you want the array to be sorted in any way, do it once you have parsed the JSON back into actual data. Most programming languages (Java, for instance) come with easy-to-use tools to sort arrays.</p>

<p>As per Nizil's comment and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#reverse%28java.util.List%29" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, you can use the <code>reverse(List&lt;?&gt; list)</code> function from the <code>Collections</code> class in Java.</p>
