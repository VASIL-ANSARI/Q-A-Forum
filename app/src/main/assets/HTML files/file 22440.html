<p>1) Here you are declaring a local variable <code>someIVarObject</code>. You should have declared this within the interface or implementation of your class in curly braces, and should then assign it as <code>someIvarObject = ...</code>. An example:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation MyClass {
    SomeClass *someIvarObject;
}

- (id)init
{
    if(self = [super init])
    {
        someIvarObject = [[SomeClass alloc] init];
    }
    return self;
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>2) It is an assignment. There is a long history behind this idiom but it mostly comes down to handling the possibility that <code>[super init]</code> returns a different object than <code>init</code> was originally invoked upon.</p>
