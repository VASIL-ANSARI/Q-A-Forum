<p>First check your server allow non HTTPS request.
i had that type of issue and my server didn't allow me to do that.
it so then disable that and test.</p>

<p>Then check the response status.</p>

<pre><code>error: function(xhr, status) {
alert(xhr.status); }
</code></pre>

<p>let us know that is the outcome.</p>
