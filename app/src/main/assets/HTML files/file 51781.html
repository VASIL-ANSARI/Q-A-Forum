<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/esprima-six" rel="nofollow"><code>esprima-six</code></a> has been <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/unpublish" rel="nofollow">unpushlished</a> and is no more.</p>

<p>It's hard to track down what exactly has happened, but it seems that <code>esprima-six</code> was a module based on the <em>unofficial</em> <a href="https://github.com/jquery/esprima/tree/harmony" rel="nofollow"><code>harmony</code> branch</a> of the project that has been discountinoud in May 2015, <a href="https://github.com/jquery/esprima/issues/1172" rel="nofollow">following</a> the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/esprima/issues/111" rel="nofollow">deprecation of <code>esprima-fb</code></a> (a fork that added JSX syntax).</p>

<p>And now <code>esprima-six</code> is no longer needed, as <a href="http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2015/02/towards-ecmascript-6-with-esprima-2.html" rel="nofollow">Esprima 2.0 officially supports ES6</a>.</p>

  <p>What is the best way to get my project building again?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thlorenz/redeyed/pull/4#issuecomment-153238131" rel="nofollow">stance of Ariya Hidayat</a>, Esprima's maintainer, is that you should just <strong>switch to Esprima 2.x</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My project has the <code>esprima-six</code> npm module as a <em>transitive</em> dependency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that case, it's probably enough to update your direct dependency, they will have switched already.</p>
