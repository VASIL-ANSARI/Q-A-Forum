<p>How about this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM Table_1 AS t1
LEFT OUTER JOIN Table_2 AS t2
ON t1.firstname = t2.firstname
AND t1.lastname = t2.lastname
WHERE t2.firstname IS NULL AND t2.lastname IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>In my case, I get only John Smith back.</p>

<p>You basically do an <strong>outer join</strong> between the tables on the common fields - those rows that are present in both cases will have values for both <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code>.</p>

<p>Those rows only present in <code>t1</code> will not have any values for the second table <code>t2</code>.</p>
