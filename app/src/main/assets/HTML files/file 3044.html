<p>You're releasing some memory that's autoreleased. Without seeing any of your code it's difficult to say what exactly the problem is but it would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSString* aVar = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello %@", worldVariable];

...

[aVar release];
</code></pre>

<p>This wouldn't crash at the release statement (as the reference count would be at least one) but <em>would</em> crash at some later point in the run loop where the autorelease pool is "drained."</p>
