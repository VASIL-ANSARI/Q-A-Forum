<p>The only dereference shown in your code is</p>

<pre><code>*jobj = json_tokener_parse(buf);
</code></pre>

<p>so this must be the line 62 to which the error message refers.</p>

<p>You're telling the compiler to take the value of the pointer <code>jobj</code> (to which you never assigned a value, so there's error number 1) and in the space pointed-to by that value to store the value returned from <code>json_tokener_parse(buf)</code>. Trouble is, you've not told the compiler what a <code>struct json_object</code> is, so <code>jobj</code> is a pointer to a type which is incomplete - the compiler doesn't know how big it is, nor what components it's made of. I presume there's a JSON header file that you've neglected to <code>#include</code>.</p>

<p>The warning about line 68 is a separate but likely related problem, but the line which would be 68 (if my guess about 62 is correct) is a comment.</p>
