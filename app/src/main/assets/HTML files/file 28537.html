<p>The compiler (at least gcc) tells you all you have to know:</p>

<pre><code>x.c:66:17: warning: format â%lfâ expects argument of type âdoubleâ, but argument 2 has type âintâ [-Wformat]

printf("\n%lf value is %c",cond_var2+1,*(x+temp));
</code></pre>

<p>You switched the arguments, and you need to cast:</p>

<pre><code>printf("\n%d value is %lf",cond_var2+1,*(double*)(x+temp));
</code></pre>

<p>Note: there are more warnings, fix those as well...</p>
