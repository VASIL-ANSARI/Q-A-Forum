<p>If TeamID is a number, you don't need quotes around it.</p>

<pre><code>OleDbCommand command = new OleDbCommand("INSERT INTO Player VALUES ('" + TbFirstName.Text + "','" + TbLastName.Text + "'," + TbTeamID.Text + ")");
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I renamed the textboxes to reduce ambiguity.</p>

<p>While this is probably your first pass at this, you should really sanitize your inputs. At the bare minimum create a function to replace single quotes with a double single quote.</p>

<pre><code>protected string SanitizeSQL(string txt) {
   return txt.replace("'", "''");
}


OleDbCommand command = new OleDbCommand("INSERT INTO Player VALUES ('" + SanitizeSQL(TbFirstName.Text) + "','" + SanitizeSQL(TbLastName.Text) + "'," + SanitizeSQL(TbTeamID.Text) + ")");
</code></pre>
