<p>The default just means what the setting will be if you don't set it.</p>

<p>If you want to change the default, you change the libtorrent source file src/session.cpp (where the session_settings constructor is defined).</p>

<p>If you just want to change the settings for your session object, construct a session_settings object, set session_settings::suggest_mode to session_settings::suggest_read_cache then call session::set_settings() with your settings object.</p>
