<p>You can use <a href="http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/" rel="nofollow">media queries</a> in your CSS to add styles that will only be used if the webpage is being printed. In your case, I would use such styles to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the grey background to white</li>
<li>Add black outlines and white backgrounds to your textboxes</li>
<li>Change the text color to solid black</li>
<li>Adjust fonts to compensate for the printed page</li>
</ol>

<p>Media queries are normally used to change a website for smaller screens, but they're also perfectly applicable for changing it for print.
