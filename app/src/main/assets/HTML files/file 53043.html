<p>You may calculate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(waves)" rel="nofollow">envelop</a>e of you signal, filter it with low-pass filter if needed (noise) and find where envelope crosses the limit level.</p>

<p>To find envelope, you could try calculate Hilbert transform H(t) of your signal F(t) to make orthogonal signal (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_transform#Discrete_Hilbert_transform" rel="nofollow">How to find HT using Fourier transform</a>). Envelope is square root of  the sum of squares of source signal and orthogonal one.</p>

<pre><code>E(t) = Sqrt(F^2(t) + H^2(t))
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. There are probably more simple ways to evaluate envelope, see wiki links for Envelope.</p>
