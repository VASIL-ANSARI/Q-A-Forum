<p>If i understand your problem, I can see the 'form' action in html is "uploadAnswer" where as you posted the action method code for "SubmitData". </p>

<p>So what happens if you change "uploadAnswer" in Html.BeginForm("uploadAnswer") to Html.BeginForm("SubmitData"), are you able to hit the controller ?</p>

<p>Also for proper model binding, the name of html element and the property name of model should be same. So change html to: <code>&lt;input type="checkBox" name="AnswerA" id="AnswerA" /&gt;</code> (Assuming "AnswerA" is a property of your Questionaire model.</p>

<p>If you want to model bind to a collection, please take a look at <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETWireFormatForModelBindingToArraysListsCollectionsDictionaries.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9513385/creating-a-dropdown-in-mvc3-c-sharp-with-viewmodel-and-easy-model-binding-on-pos/9513747#9513747">here</a>.</p>
