<p>You neglected to convert the input to a numeric type.  Python input comes in string form.  Rather than</p>

<pre><code>X=list(input("please enter the first matrix X="))
</code></pre>

<p>you'll need to extract the individual elements to something numeric.  That said ... shame on you for not bothering to print the values causing the problem.  You wrote a triple-nested loop without checking the values you sent into it.  A simple</p>

<p>print X</p>

<p>Would show the basic problem.  This is a low-tech, but powerful debugging tool: if you have a sick patient, ask where it hurts; prod a few places.  Then you won't have to come to the emergency room (StackOverflow).  :-)</p>

<p>That said, let's get back to the input processing.  I expect that you'll want to take the matrix, one line at a time, grab the individual numbers, and convert them to floats.  Something like this ...</p>

<pre><code>in_line = input("please enter the first matrix X=")
value_list = in_line.split()
X = [float(x) for x in value_list]
</code></pre>

<p>You can reduce this to a single line, but this helps show you the stages.  Repeat this for each line in the matrix, and then make a list of those lists.  Do likewise for Y.</p>

<p>Does that get you unstuck?</p>
