<p>I would go for IronPython at the moment since there are plenty of books/information around for it (<a href="http://www.manning.com/foord/" rel="nofollow" title="IronPython In Action">IronPython In Action</a> is just getting finished up).</p>

<p>I would personally learn IronRuby because I prefer the way Ruby works over Python and since it's one of the same then choose which language you prefer.</p>
