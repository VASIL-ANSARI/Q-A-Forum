<p>If you want the actual date and time the function was executed, try <code>asctime()</code>. There is a good reference on how it's done <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/ctime/localtime/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>This will output something akin to <code>Sat May 20 17:36:17 2000</code>. If you want the time in seconds since the program started, have a variable such as <code>int startTime = time()</code> which holds the program start time in seconds from the Unix Epoch. Then, simply print <code>startTime - time()</code> to get the number of seconds since program start.</p>
