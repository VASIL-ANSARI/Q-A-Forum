<p>If you want to go the JMS route, a standalone JMS-compatible message broker (separate from your app server) would be a good choice.  Message brokers range from free open-source (like ActiveMQ at <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">http://activemq.apache.org/</a> or OpenMQ at <a href="https://mq.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">https://mq.dev.java.net/</a>), to large-scale commercial solutions (IBM's WebSphere MQ at <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/" rel="nofollow">http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/</a> is one of the largest).</p>

<p>Message brokers offer guaranteed delivery (provided the server's up and listening), and you can do quite a bit to ensure that the system is fail-safe including integrated backup broker servers and instant power backup.  Broker queues can eventually run out of room if your app server isn't picking up the messages, but you can assign huge queue depth (100's of GB) and have the server send alerts if the messages aren't getting processed and the queue reaches a certain percentage.</p>

<p>Your Java app would then run on a different server entirely, and would connect to the broker and pull messages off of the queue as fast as possible.  If the app server crashes or stops picking up messages for any other reason, the broker would just keep all messages in that queue until the app server begins picking them up again.</p>
