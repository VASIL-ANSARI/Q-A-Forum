<p>You are making things way too complicated in my opinion. Just create data access components for every data source type you have, and have them return business or domain entities that you define. Use the power of each data source to its fullest instead of trying to make them 'generic'.</p>

<p>Also, why treat a web service as a data source? It's a web service, already abstracted out. Just use it in your application layer and use its entities. </p>

<p>Bottom line: if it's too hard to do, then don't do it and keep it simple.</p>
