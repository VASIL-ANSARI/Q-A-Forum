<p>Ok, after I spent some time experimenting, I can say that the best way for a beginner to start using NDK in eclipse is first to go over this tutorial: <a href="http://marakana.com/forums/android/examples/49.html" rel="nofollow">http://marakana.com/forums/android/examples/49.html</a> and simply create the necessary files for the jni folder (but don't do anything else). Then you should read this <a href="http://mobilepearls.com/labs/ndk-builder-in-eclipse/" rel="nofollow">http://mobilepearls.com/labs/ndk-builder-in-eclipse/</a> and follow the steps. Then you are ready.</p>
