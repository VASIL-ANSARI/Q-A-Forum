<p>This may be overkill but you can use <a href="https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/wiki/Getting-Started" rel="nofollow">SignalR</a>.  This is a library specifically for real-time communication between the server and client.</p>

<p>You would upload the file using a regular action, then render a SignalR-page showing the parsing progress (the server sends the client regular updates as it parses).</p>

<p>See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh852586.aspx" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for a walk-through specifically about a progress bar.</p>
