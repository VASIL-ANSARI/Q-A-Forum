<p>When you write your json file all additional information is lost (in your case the <code>Integer</code> type you used. When you read it the JSONParser will automatically use <code>Long</code> when it encounters a number without decimal points. Try using <code>Long</code> in your reader. Note that the reader knows <strong>nothing</strong> about the writer. It can only read a file and interpret it as it sees fit.</p>

<p>So to answer your question:</p>

<pre><code>Long age =(Long) ob.get("age");
</code></pre>

<p>will work.</p>
