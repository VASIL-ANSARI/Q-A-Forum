<p>Your program prints "weird symbols" because <code>t1</code> is never initialized in the <code>printing</code> function.</p>

<p>Here you never read from file:</p>

<pre><code>void printing ()
{
    struct text t1;
    FILE *fp;
    fp=fopen(fname,"r");

    // Missing read from file

    printf("\nName: %c",t1.name);
    printf("\nAge: %d",t1.age);
    printf("\nAddress: %s",t1.address);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Further, this line:</p>

<pre><code>printf("\nAddress: %s",t1.address);
</code></pre>

<p>is wrong. You use <code>%s</code> which is for <code>char*</code> but <code>address</code> is a <code>char</code>. So you must use <code>%c</code>. The same applies for the <code>scanf</code> of <code>address</code>. </p>

<p>Maybe you really wanted <code>struct text</code> to hold strings!? If so you should have used a <code>char array</code>. Currently the struct can only hold char (i.e. a single letter for name and address). Maybe you really wanted to do:</p>

<pre><code>struct text
{
    char name[100];
    int age;
    char address[100];

};
</code></pre>

<p>and then use <code>%s</code> instead of <code>%c</code> for both <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>.</p>

<p>Also here you have some "strange" code:</p>

<pre><code>int main ()
{
    FILE *fp;
    int choice;
    struct text t1;

    // Why do you have the next to lines? Seems to be a mistake - remove them
    fp=fopen(fname,"a+");
    fread(&amp;t1,sizeof(t1),1,fp);
</code></pre>

<p>Besides that, your code lacks all kind of checks of return values. Always check the value returned by <code>fopen</code>, <code>fread</code>, <code>fwrite</code> and <code>scanf</code>.</p>
