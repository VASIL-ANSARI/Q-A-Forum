<p>I guess the problem is with the category class <code>UIBarButtonItem(WEPopover)</code> , which implements<br>
<code>- (CGRect)frameInView:(UIView *)v</code>. 
Somewhere along the way , the custom view is nilled , and not returned to the view hierarchy afterwards.<br>
If you try using a standard barButtonItem (no custom view) then the popover will display correctly, without hiding the item(but that's not a solution).<br>
Anyway, presenting from rect was the solution I used as well.</p>
