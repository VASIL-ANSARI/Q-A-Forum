<p>Not sure if you are using CocoaPods or not, but if so, I ran into the same issue today when updating. From what it appears, 'Facebook-iOS-SDK' and 'ParseFacebookUtils' was removed from the most recent update. Without going to in depth in your errors, it appears as though linker errors are occurring. In my Podfile, I simply added:</p>

<pre><code>pod 'Facebook-iOS-SDK'
pod 'ParseFacebookUtils'
</code></pre>

<p>If not using CocoaPods, it may help to make sure those two libraries are within your source code, clean, and rebuild.</p>
