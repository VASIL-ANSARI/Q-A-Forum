<p>Purely technically, you can edit an .htaccess file like any other using file editing functions like <a href="http://php.net/manual/de/function.fwrite.php" rel="nofollow">fwrite()</a>.</p>

<p><strong>But please don't even think about that option!</strong></p>

<p>Your PHP-code is responsible to manage the logged-in state, not your .htaccess file.</p>
