<p>The issue probably is that the built-in <code>PagerAdapter</code> implementations for <code>Fragment</code>s provided by Android assume that the items will remain constant, and so retain and reuse index-based references to all <code>Fragment</code>s that are added to the <code>ViewPager</code>. These references are maintained through the <code>FragmentManager</code> even after the <code>Activity</code> (and <code>Fragment</code>s) is recreated due to configuration changes or the process being killed.</p>

<p>What you need to do is to write your own implementation of <code>PagerAdapter</code> that associates a custom tag with each <code>Fragment</code> and stores the <code>Fragment</code>s in a tag-based (instead of index-based) format. You could derive a generic implementation of this from one of the existing ones after adding an abstract method for providing a tag based on the index alongside the <code>getItem()</code> method. Of course, you will have to remove orphaned/unused <code>Fragment</code>s added in the previous configuration from the <code>ViewPager</code> (while ideally holding on to it's state).</p>

<p>If you don't want to implement the whole solution yourself, then the <code>ArrayPagerAdapter</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-pager" rel="nofollow">CWAC-Pager</a> library can be used to provide a reasonable implementation of this with little effort. Upon initialization, you can detach the relevant <code>Fragment</code> based on it's provided tag, and remove/add it from the adapter as well, as appropriate.</p>
