<p>In my opinion you can consider the NIB/XIB as the owner of those objects. None of your classes own them. See <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/CocoaNibs/CocoaNibs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000051i-CH4-SW6" rel="nofollow">"Managing the Lifetimes of Objects from Nib Files"</a> in Resource Programming Guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From a practical perspective, in iOS and OS X outlets should be defined as declared properties. <strong>Outlets should generally be <code>weak</code></strong>, except for those from File's Owner to top-level objects in a nib file (or, in iOS, a storyboard scene) which should be <code>strong</code>. Outlets that you create should will therefore typically be weak by default, because:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Outlets that you create to, for example, subviews of a view controller's view or a window controller's window, are arbitrary references between objects that do not imply ownership.</li>
  <li>The strong outlets are frequently specified by framework classes (for example, <code>UIViewController</code>'s <code>view</code> outlet, or <code>NSWindowController</code>'s <code>window</code> outlet).</li>
  </ul>
