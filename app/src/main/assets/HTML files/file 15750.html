<p>Instead of putting the code in <code>viewWillAppear:</code> (where the actual pushing of the first view has not yet occurred), you should put it in <code>viewDidAppear:</code> (which is run when the first view has finished pushing and you can do any further tasks such as pushing a further controller)</p>
