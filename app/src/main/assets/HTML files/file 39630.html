<li>You can't make <code>li</code> element select your radios without using JavaScript. This element is static by design (presentation only). You can use labels to select a radio button, but to manage its states (and thus a visual representation thereof), you have to refer to JavaScript.</li>
<li>You don't have to use lists, you can just stack <code>labels</code> and radios, like in my forked code: <a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dPYaMj" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dPYaMj</a>. I've also cleaned it up for you and made it work a bit better with a little help of jQuery.</li>
<li>You have basically two options: you can use an <strong>image sprite</strong>, or <strong>icon fonts</strong> (there's plenty of free ones and some can be custom-made for your needs).</li>
