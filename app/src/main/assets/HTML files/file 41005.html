<p>Because you only have a single record in your <code>users</code> table, you can use a <code>cross join</code> to get your desired results;</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) as customer_name, 
       c.customer_email as customer_email,
       CONCAT(u.first_name, ' ', u.last_name) as seller_name, 
       u.seller_email 
FROM customers c cross join users u
WHERE c.user_level = 'customer'
      and u.user_level = 'seller'
</code></pre>
