<p>If you have option to use PHP, try to fetch the current week dates in the same format as saved in the database and query with that dates.</p>

<pre><code>$week_stard_date = date("ndy",strtotime('monday this week')); //22916
$week_end_date = date("ndy",strtotime('sunday this week')); //30616

select SCHDT from patinfo WHERE SCHDT BETWEEN $week_stard_date AND $week_end_date
</code></pre>
