<p>Two options:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) If your JSON does <strong>not</strong> contain both single &amp; double quotes, wrap the entire JSON in the quote type not being used.  </p>
  
  <p>(2) If you need to escape the quotes (ie, because both are in your JSON), then you need to escape the escape character.  That is, use double slashes:  <code>\\"y\\"</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(note that the second point applies to any string in R that has needs an escape character)</p>
