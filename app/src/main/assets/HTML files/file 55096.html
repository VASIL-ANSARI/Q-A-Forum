<p>In general, you want to avoid having any static reference to a <code>Context</code> anywhere in your application (this includes <code>Activity</code> classes, of course).  The only reference to a Context which MAY be acceptable is referencing the application context (as there is only one and it is always in memory while your app is alive anyway).</p>

<p>If you need a reference to the calling activity in one of your children, you'll need to pass the context as a parameter, or else use one of the child views methods to retrieve the context (such as <code>getContext()</code> for views and fragments).</p>

<p>More information that should help understand memory leaks and why this is important is here:

<p>As an example, in your code for calling <code>finish()</code>, you could safely change it to this:</p>

<pre><code>highscoreView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        if (v.getContext() instanceof Activity) {
            ((Activity)v.getContext()).finish();
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>To sum up, in order to fix your memory leaks, you'll need to remove the <code>static</code> keyword for all of your <code>Context</code> fields.</p>
