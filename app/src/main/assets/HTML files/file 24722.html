<p>Your second function neither returns anything nor sets up the value of the global variable (and <code>$blogok</code> is local to the function it's created in), hence it's practically useless. Perhaps you meant this:</p>

<pre><code>function public_blog()
{
  return get_blogs();
}

... 
$blogok = public_blog();
doSomethingElseWith($blogok);
</code></pre>

<p>Still, I see little purpose here for that intermediate function, unless you intend to do something with results of <code>get_blogs()</code> in it.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, what's purpose of this?</p>

<pre><code>$tomb[] = null;
return $tomb;
</code></pre>

<p>Here a single-element array is returned from a function (if no rows are found). But this result is not considered empty, and will probably introduce bugs in other parts of your code. It's better to replace this with either <code>$tomb = array();</code> or <code>$tomb = null</code>, depending on how it's used.</p>
