<p>Unfortunately, this is a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2008/09/10/vexing-exceptions.aspx" rel="nofollow">vexing exception</a> in the framework, and there's no way to avoid it (while still using the <code>HttpWebRequest</code> class). But, as High pointed out, this exception handling will take nanoseconds, while the web request itself will take milliseconds (at best), so don't worry about it.</p>

<p>The <code>WebException</code> object has a <code>Response</code> property that contains the response; when you handle the exception, it's important to dispose that <code>WebResponse</code> object (to avoid leaking connections).</p>
