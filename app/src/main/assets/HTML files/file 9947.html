<p>See section 2.12 of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html" rel="nofollow">App Store Review Guidelines</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apps that are not very useful, are
  simply web sites bundled as apps, or
  do not provide any lasting
  entertainment value may be rejected</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And section 12.3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apps that are simply web clippings,
  content aggregators, or a collection
  of links, may be rejected</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, the answer is: Yes, you can submit whatever you like. My guess based on the guidelines above, though, is that such an app is unlikely to pass the review process.</p>
