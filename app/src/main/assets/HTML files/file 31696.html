<p>The first problem is that you have used a dependency which does not exist to be more accurate the <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3a%22javax.servlet%22%20AND%20a%3a%22jstl%22" rel="nofollow">version does not exist</a>.</p>

<p>The message gives you the hint simply to delete the path from your local repository. The location in your local repository is <code>$HOME/.m2/repository/javax/servlet/</code> and there you will find a directory which only contains property files but no jar file. This directory can be deleted.</p>

<p>Apart from that you have to change your dependency version to one of the existing ones like 1.1.1 or 1.2.</p>
