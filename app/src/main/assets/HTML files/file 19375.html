<p>Ok, since nobody has left an answer, I will. The issue was the line</p>

<pre><code>connection.DataReceived += new SerialDataReceivedEventHandler(DataReceivedEvent);
</code></pre>

<p>being called during every tick of the timer in background worker. This would cause numerous instances of the event handler, which would eventually cause the background worker to lock up and report busy all the time. To correct this problem, I needed to put in</p>

<pre><code>connection.DataReceived -= new SerialDataReceivedEventHandler(DataReceivedEvent);
</code></pre>

<p>in order to avoid having numerous event handlers processing the data received event. This has resolved my problem.</p>
