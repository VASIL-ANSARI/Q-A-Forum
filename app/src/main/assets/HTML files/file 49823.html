<p>Thanks for your suggestions! The problem was actually due to the fact that my form tags were unknowingly straddling an open div element. Everything apart from the Awesomplete input ignored my bug and worked properly. Awesomplete is indeed an awesome replacement for datalist when it's working!</p>
