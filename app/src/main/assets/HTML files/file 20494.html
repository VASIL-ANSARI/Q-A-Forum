<p>The lifetime of a temporary which is bound to a <em>constant</em> lvalue reference or to an rvalue reference (since C++11) is extended to the lifetime of that reference. In the second case you do not have a reference on the left side of the assignment, but a value, so the lifetime of the temporary is not prolonged.</p>

<p>See 12.2/4 and 12.2/5 of the C++ 11 Standard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two contexts in which temporaries are destroyed at a different point than the end of the fullexpression. The first context is when a default constructor is called to initialize an element of an array [...]</p>
  
  <p>The second context is <strong>when a reference is bound to a temporary</strong>. The temporary to which the reference is bound or the temporary that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound persists for the lifetime of the reference <em>except</em>: [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What follows the <em>"except"</em> are situations that do not apply to this case.</p>
