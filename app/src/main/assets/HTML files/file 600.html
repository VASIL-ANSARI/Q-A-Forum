<p>There are a couple of options here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can create a "Complex Type" and map that to the procedure result.  However, you have to do that in your EDMX; it's not supported by the designer.  Read <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb738472.aspx" rel="nofollow">this article</a> for details. Note that Complex Types are not entity types <em>per se</em>, so this may or may not fit your needs. But you can find examples for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc716733.aspx" rel="nofollow">stored procs which use "Address"</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can change the visibility of your procedure to private, and then write a public interface for it in any manually-written partial class file which does the mapping that you want. Or just overload the procedure.</p></li>
</ol>
