<p>This code appears to be using Java Swing. That being said, you should use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/card.html" rel="nofollow"><code>CardLayout</code></a>. By associating an individual <code>Employee</code> with each "card", you'll be able to easily navigate (forward and backward) through the records.</p>

<p>This approach essentially delegates the "hard work" to the layout manager, which is how it should be.</p>
