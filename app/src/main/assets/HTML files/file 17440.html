<p>Both the Twitter and Facebook libraries are linking against the same SBJSON framework. Build both of them from code instead of using the static library. While doing this, remove the SBJSON reference from one of the SDK.</p>

<p>This is another reason why I hate building against static libraries. The problem will be un-solveable if you don't have the source code and the library maker didn't prefix his classes/methods.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the newly released Facebook SDK, version 3.1, where they finally prefixed SBJSON to FBSBJSON.</p>
