<p>You cannot do <code>Comparator x = new Comparator();</code></p>

<p>What you can do is </p>

<pre><code>   Comparator x = new Comparator(){ 
       // some implementation code here
   };
</code></pre>

<p>That is something else (it includes the definition of an anonymous subclass of Comparator).
It is more or less just a shorthand for declaring a new class that implements Comparator and making an instance of it and the same time.</p>

<p>And, yes, you can do that with all interfaces or non-final classes (don't need to be abstract).</p>
