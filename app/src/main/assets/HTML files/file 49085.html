<p>You say that you do not have control on the HTML and how it is generated, but if in the end you have a plain HTML document, and you can use JavaScript (even more simple with jQuery that you have tagged in your question), you can still re-factor it on client side by manipulating the DOM.</p>

<p>You should be able to walk through the DOM, insert hidden anchors here and there (e.g. every couple of words), and detect the upper-most anchor within the screen at each user scroll, so that you can record that anchor as "last viewed user position".</p>

<p>Of course your method of insertion must be consistent and reproducible on all devices, so that it re-factors the DOM exactly the same way, and the anchors are placed in the exact same position every time. So do not use random ids for anchors. E.g. you could use a prefixed counter, and just need to make sure it does not collide with pre-existing id's.</p>
