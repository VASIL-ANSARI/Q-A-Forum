<p>Yes, some of your user agents could be wrong (maybe some old ones, deprecated) and the site, if there is no problem on using only one user-agent, you could add that to <code>settings.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>USER_AGENT="someuseragent"
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to remove or disable the randoming user-agent also from <code>settings.py</code></p>
