<p>Your list object is not thread-safe. I am assuming you are using a re-entrant timer as well. Your code will be executing in a new thread every 10 milliseconds, which presumably causes the List&lt;> to be changed each time.</p>

<p>Try changing the time/tick (to maybe 100ms) and see if your problem goes away. You should also use a <code>ConcurrentBag&lt;T&gt;</code> in place of the list, which will support concurrent adds and iterations. Though I am going to add as an editorial comment, what you are trying to do in your code does not make sense to me.</p>
