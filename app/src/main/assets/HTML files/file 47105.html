<p>This is because of the xAxis <code>minRange</code> behavior (<a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#xAxis.minRange" rel="nofollow">docs</a>) which governs the minimum range the axis should show. This is defaulting to 5 in your case which explains why it tries to maintain a wider axis even when you are losing points. Set the minRange to something lower (eg 1) and you won't have any issues!</p>

<pre><code>xAxis: {
    minRange: 1,
    categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun']
},
</code></pre>
