<p>Short answer: Nothing. The <code>()</code> can be used if you want to pass in some constructor args but 
in your case since you don't have any, you can skip <code>()</code>.</p>

<p>For eg. <code>()</code> is useful here.</p>

<pre><code>  Foo foo = new Foo(someBar){Prop1 = "value1", Prop2 = value2};
</code></pre>

<p>but if you are trying to call the parameter-less constructor, it's optional</p>

<pre><code>  Foo foo = new Foo {Prop1 = "value1", Prop2 = value2};
</code></pre>
