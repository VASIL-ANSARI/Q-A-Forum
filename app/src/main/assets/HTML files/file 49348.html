<p>The options passed to <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> can include more than just push remote notification data.  A partial list, off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>remote notification data</li>
<li>local notification data</li>
<li>URL used to open app from a link or another app</li>
</ul>

<p>The specific delegate methods for those activities are invoked if the app is already running*.  If the app is being launched due to one of those mechanisms, the relevant data is passed in <code>options</code>.  The keys are used to tell you which kind of event triggered the launch and which kind of data is in <code>options</code>.</p>

<p>*Handling background processing of remote notifications is a special case.  Even if the app is being launched to handle them, the specific delegate method is called.</p>
