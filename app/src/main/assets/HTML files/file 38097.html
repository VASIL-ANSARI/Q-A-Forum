<p>You could</p>

<ul>
<li>save the JSON and parse it again later (you would have to do a lot of parsing)</li>
<li>save the data you parse from the json
<ul>
<li>in sharedpreferences (only if small amount of data)</li>
<li>in a local sqlite db (probably cleanest approach with best user experience, but a lot of work since you have to create a class that does all the db CRUD operations)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It depends on your data. For user preferences I would use SharedPreferences, for larger amounts a local DB. Also you could create some objects to store the data you need, maybe as signletons or something, and parse the stored JSONs everytime you start the app.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html" rel="nofollow">the google docs on data storage</a> for reference. </p>
