<p>Yes, it is. The first line of every HTTP request contains the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html" rel="nofollow">method</a> (or verb) and the URI for which the request is made. No special restrictions are placed on the URI based on the choice of method, so POST requests may be made for a URI that includes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string" rel="nofollow">query string</a>.</p>

<p>From PHP you can access the parameters in the query string normally through <code>$_GET</code> and <code>$_REQUEST</code>. Parameters passed as part of a submitted form are accessible as always through <code>$_POST</code> and <code>$_REQUEST</code>.</p>
