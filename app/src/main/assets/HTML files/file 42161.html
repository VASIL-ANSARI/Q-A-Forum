<p>Here's my attempt, just for the challenge:</p>

<pre><code>^(?!\d*?(\d+?)\1)\d{6,15}$
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://regex101.com/r/iB9oP9/4" rel="nofollow">Demo</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>(?!\d*?(\d+?)\1)</code> part will make sure there are no groups of repeated digits by matching a group of digits and trying to match the same digits immediately after. If it finds one, the match fails.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to allow two same consecutive digits, replace <code>(?!\d*?(\d+?)\1)</code> with <code>(?!\d*?(\d{2,}?)\1)(?!(\d)\2*(\d)(?:\2|\3)*$)</code>. This will then make sure there are more than 2 different digits by matching a series of one digit, then a different digit followed by a series of a combination of both digits. If it reaches the end of the string it forces the match to fail.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But it'll be probably more maintainable to just do it the conventional way, without regex.</p>
