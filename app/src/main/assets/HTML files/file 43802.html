<p>We create object of classes declared in other source code files with the way you have already followed:</p>

<pre><code>Solution object_class =  new Solution();
</code></pre>

<p>Provided that the Solution class is declared in a source code file in the same project (console application as I can infer from your post), you don't have to mark the <code>Solution</code> class as a public. Otherwise, you should mark it as a public. Actually, you have to do so in case of this class is going to be used outside of your current project.</p>

<p>Your problem, I think is about namespaces. You might have declared this class inside a folder. Anyways, the way to solve this is to right click on the name of the <code>Solution</code> and then click resolve references.</p>
