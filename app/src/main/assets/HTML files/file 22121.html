<p>You have to do it manually. <code>x</code> conversion specifier performs a conversion from an <code>unsigned int</code> and it requires an argument of type pointer to <code>unsigned int</code>. For example with a cast:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int test;
int result;

sscanf("0xfff6","%x", &amp;test);
result = (int16_t) test;
</code></pre>
