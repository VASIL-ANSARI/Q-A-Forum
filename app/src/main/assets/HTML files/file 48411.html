<p>I see the same behaviour of being able to visit the / route but all other pages return a 404 when I first setup Laravel sites.</p>

<p>In your apache config file httpd.conf or httpd-vhosts.conf you need to enable the directives that can be placed in the .htaccess file.</p>

<p>Here is an example of my VirtualHost configuration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin admin@gmail.com
    DocumentRoot "C:/www/laravel_authority-controller_app/public"
    ServerName authoritycontroller.www
    ErrorLog "logs/AuthorityController.www-error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/AuthorityController.www-access.log" common
    &lt;Directory "C:/www/laravel_authority-controller_app/public"&gt;
    #
    # Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
    # or any combination of:
    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
    #
    # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
    # doesn't give it to you.
    #
    # The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
    # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options
    # for more information.
    #
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI

    #
    # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
    # It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
    #   AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
    #
    AllowOverride All

    #
    # Controls who can get stuff from this server.
    #
    Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The key entry for your issue is <code>AllowOverride All</code>. This should be enough to get the website working but you can also include <code>options</code> and <code>Require all granted</code> if they are consistent across the entire website.</p>
