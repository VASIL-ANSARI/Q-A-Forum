<p>Well, I can at least provide an 11 solution; use Pivot:</p>

<p>The only 10g option I can think of offhand (I'm decent with SQL, but not an expert) is to fill a table variable and then select individual rows out of that table for your final result. Ugly and likely fairly slow, but could get the job done. </p>
