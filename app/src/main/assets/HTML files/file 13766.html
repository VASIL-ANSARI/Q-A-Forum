<p>This occurs because the user is only defined in the child portal, but the request to the ASHX occurs (from DNN's perspective) in the parent portal.  When DNN receives the request, it sees that you've "switched portals," no longer have a valid identity, and removes your authentication information.  This doesn't occur for super users because they <em>do</em> have a valid identity across both portals.</p>

<p>To fix this issue, you need to add a querystring parameter to your request with the portal ID.  This let's DNN disambiguate the request and keep your authentication intact:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    url: '/DesktopModules/MyModule/ashx/GetStatesForRegions.ashx?portalId=' + &lt;%:PortalId%&gt;,
    ....
});
</code></pre>
