<p>No, because under the hood it's a 1-n-1 association. That is, <code>A</code> has zero, one, or many <code>AB</code> junction records, and <code>AB</code> always has one <code>B</code> (and always one <code>A</code>).</p>

<p>So we're dealing with the rules of 1-n associations. There is no way to enforce a 1 - <strong>1</strong>..n association (i.e. a parent must have at least one child), at least not in DDL. Consequently there is no way to enforce 1..n - 1..m associations. It's always 0..n - 0..m. Only by business logic you can enforce mandatory associations.</p>
