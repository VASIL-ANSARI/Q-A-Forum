<p>The problem with your CSS code is that "navfont" was not in apostrophes or quotation marks so therefore, it was being treated as a value rather than a string. Furthermore, the URL you provided isn't surrounded with the apostrophes/quotations and was also not counted as a string.
As well, you need to declare the font being used for "nav" to correctly display the font.</p>

<p>CSS</p>

<pre><code>@font-face {
    font-family: 'navfont';
    src: url('fonts/Franchise-Free-Bold.otf');
}
nav{
    font-family: 'navfont';
}
</code></pre>
