<pre><code>INSERT INTO table_2 (id,name,salary)
SELECT id,name,salary
FROM dbo.table1
</code></pre>

<p>When you doing INSERT operation using SELECT it is best practice to explicitly mention the column names in <code>INSERT INTO</code> and <code>SELECT</code> statement, just to make sure right data lands in the right columns. </p>

<p>Once you have transfered the data then you can use <code>Delete</code> or <code>Truncate</code> commands to delete the data in table1. keeping in mind you can limit the number or rows being deleted using delete command with a <code>WHERE</code> clause. </p>

<p>If you want to delete all the records in table1 just use <code>Truncate</code> command. which is much faster and logs fewer logs and you cannot use WHERE Cluase with truncate. It also resets the Identity column in you table. </p>
