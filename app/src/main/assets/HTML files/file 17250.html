<p>In short, reads from volumes are non-buffered and must be of whole sectors.  A buffer size of 4096 achieves this.  The error message is misleading because asynchronous I/O and non-buffering tend to go together.  Some details:</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363858%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">CreateFile docs</a>:</p>

<p>Volume handles can be opened as noncached at the discretion of the particular file system, even when the noncached option is not specified in CreateFile. You should assume that all Microsoft file systems open volume handles as noncached. The restrictions on noncached I/O for files also apply to volumes.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc644950%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">File Buffering docs</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>File access sizes, including the optional file offset in the OVERLAPPED structure, if specified, must be for a number of bytes that is an integer multiple of the volume sector size. For example, if the sector size is 512 bytes, an application can request reads and writes of 512, 1,024, 1,536, or 2,048 bytes, but not of 335, 981, or 7,171 bytes.</li>
<li>File access buffer addresses for read and write operations should be physical sector-aligned, which means aligned on addresses in memory that are integer multiples of the volume's physical sector size. Depending on the disk, this requirement may not be enforced.</li>
</ul>
