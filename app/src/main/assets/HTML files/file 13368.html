<p>To keep device from entering 'power save mode', try to use wifi lock of type <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager.html#WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF">WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF</a>
It's not public available until android 3.1.<br/>
but you can still use it by hard-coding, the value of WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF is 3(int).<br/>
I tried it on a pre-3.1 device. It works like a charm! good luck!</p>
