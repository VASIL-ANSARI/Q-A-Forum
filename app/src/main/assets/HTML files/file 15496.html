<p>I don't really see a point in this, sorry. Maybe that's because of how i work with error codes in C. Basically i define error values as a part of the interface of a single module. The error <em>value</em> between modules do collide, i.e. i don't care if two modules have the same numerical value for their different error codes. To get strong type-checking for different enums i usually wrap them into a struct. But i never really care about making error codes unique for each function which is what your approach seems to be about.  </p>

<p>Again, this is my specific, but i never really felt the need to do otherwise. Error codes defined for the whole module usually fit to be passed between procedures that implement this module. Now what if your approach could actually be mapped on a module boundary instead of the function? :)</p>
