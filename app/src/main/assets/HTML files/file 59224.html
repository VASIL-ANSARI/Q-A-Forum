<p>You can use a <code>ReconnectingClientFactory</code> if you're using Twisted. <a href="https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python/blob/master/examples/twisted/websocket/echo_variants/client_reconnecting.py" rel="nofollow">There's a simple example by the autobahn developer on github</a>. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an implementation of an <code>ApplicationRunner</code> that comes pre-built with this functionality but it doesn't look too difficult to implement on your own. <a href="https://github.com/isra17/autobahn-autoreconnect/blob/master/autobahn_autoreconnect/__init__.py" rel="nofollow">Here's an <code>asyncio</code> variant</a> which should be straight forward to Twisted. You could follow <a href="https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-python/issues/295" rel="nofollow">this issue</a> as it seems there is a desire by the dev team to incorporate reconnecting client.</p>
