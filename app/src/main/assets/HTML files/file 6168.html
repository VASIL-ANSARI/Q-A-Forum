<p>You need to get the view of your linearlayout and set it's background color.</p>

<p>First you need to assign your LinearLayout an ID in your xml. Then in your button's onclicklistener, do this.</p>

<pre><code>LinearLayout ll = (Linearlayout) findViewById(R.id.layoutid);
ll.setBackgroundColor(); //I think this is what it's called
</code></pre>

<p>I forget exactly what goes in the setBackgroundColor function, you'll have to look that up.</p>

<p>You should really go through all the hello android tutorials before trying to do stuff on your own like this. Where you haven't even tried anything before coming for help.</p>
