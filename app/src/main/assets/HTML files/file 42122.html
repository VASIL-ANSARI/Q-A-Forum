<p>I've reached some degree of success by re-setting everything and following the developer guide again to setting up bluetooth.</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn bluetooth debugging off on wear device</li>
<li>Turn ADB debugging off on wear device</li>
<li>Revoke debugging authorization on wear device (not sure if necessary)</li>
<li>Turn bluetooth debugging off on wear app on handheld</li>
<li>kill the adb server (adb kill-server)</li>
<li>Restart adb server (adb server restart)</li>
<li>Turn ADB debugging on on wear device</li>
<li>Turn bluetooth debugging on on wear device</li>
<li>Turn bluetooth debugging on on wear app on handheld</li>
<li><p>enter adb forwarding commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub</li>
<li>adb connect localhost:4444</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pray</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These steps have mostly worked for me.</p>
