<p>It turns out that the reason that I could not do what I wanted was that none of the performance counter types provide for automatically calculating a running average.  (the "average" counters, calculate an average based upon that moment in time, like "bytes per second").</p>

<p>I wanted a running average.  So, I used the RawFraction performance counter type.  </p>

<p>There was one problem with that method:  The formula divides the result by 100 to produce a percentage, and I wanted a raw number (average operations completed per second).</p>

<p>So, I incremented the denominator of the fraction by 100 for every 1 operation (offsetting the percentage calculation).</p>

<p>My result:  I can now display how long it takes, on average, for my service to complete a task.  If my service isn't busy, the average remains constant so that you can see the long-term trend of my service's performance.</p>
