<p>I would use two design patterns in your case. The first one would be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern" rel="nofollow">Facade pattern</a>. Use the facade pattern to simplify the interface of the web services your application has to deal with. Make sure you only need to change the implementation of the facade when the webservice contract changes. Convert the objects from the service into objects under your control and call functions with names and parameters that fit your domain and abstraction level.</p>

<p>The second design pattern would be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern" rel="nofollow">Adapter pattern</a>. In your case, you should determine if you can decide on a common interface for both web services. So, if the 10% difference between the two services can be converted into one interface (of objects and/or functions) you use in your application.</p>

<p>The facade would use adapters to convert the 10% difference into common objects and functions. After that, the facade uses the common objects and functions, as well as the other 90% of the web services, to supply a proper abstraction layer for your application.</p>

<p>If there are additional customers in the future, you'll most likely only need to add or modify an adapter.</p>
