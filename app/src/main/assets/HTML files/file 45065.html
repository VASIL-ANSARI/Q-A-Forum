<p>I personally recommend you use .php files only for your website. In general .html files are used for templating and they only set up the 'view' of the page. By default, .html web pages can not use PHP code unless you set up the server to do so (For example using a .htaccess file as explained <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11312316/how-do-i-add-php-code-to-html-files">here</a>)</p>

<p>It's really just as Bonner said, asking how long is a piece of string. The answer can differ depending on what you are doing. Based on what you are working on I still recommend you use .php as the file extension for your project.</p>
