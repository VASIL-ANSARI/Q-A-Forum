<p>The typical thing to do is to check if the user needs login in <code>applicationDidFinish...</code> and then to set the <code>window.rootViewController</code> to the login VC if they need it and the starting VC if they don't</p>

<p>On correct login, the app should set the window rootViewController to whatever you want to start the app.</p>

<p>The VC stack should be a clean representation of what you want on there -- so either a login flow or the app, but not both.</p>
