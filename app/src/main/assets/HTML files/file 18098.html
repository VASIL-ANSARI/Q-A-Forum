  <p>EDIT: due to some confusion, i want to clear this up. for the String
  dir i am entering files/text.txt. it wont work. how do i fix this?</p>

<p>What is the path of the class? (the class that contains readSpecificFromJar()) If the <code>.class</code> file and the <code>.txt</code> file are both in the same directory, then you should make it like this:</p>

<pre><code>dir = "text.txt";
</code></pre>

  <p>EDIT 4: by the way, the package that holds the method for reading from
  the jar is IO. as in the class io is inside the package IO. all of my
  files such as images and txt are in the package files. just thought id
  clear that up. i tried moving the txt file to the package of the io
  class, and that worked, but if its in any other package, even if i
  include the package name in the dir it wont work. any ideas as to why?</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>dir = "../files/text.txt";
</code></pre>

<p>I believe this would work if your structure is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>   javaApp.jar
        |
   _____|_____
  |           |
files         IO
  |           |
  |           |
text.txt   io.class
</code></pre>
