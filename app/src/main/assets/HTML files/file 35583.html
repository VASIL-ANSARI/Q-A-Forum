<p>When each element in the Songs array is used in some fashion (i.e. rendered in an {{each}} loop), every song will have its own controller instantiated. So you could have a listing of songs and each song could have its own properties (like <code>isPlaying</code>) or you could write <code>action</code> handlers to respond to user interaction <code>play</code> or <code>pause</code>. </p>

<p>Your <code>SongController</code> would exist for each of the songs in the array. </p>

<pre><code>App.SongController = Ember.ObjectController.extend({
  isPlaying: false,
  actions: {
    someAction: ...
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't need these properties or for the action to be handled on this controller, you could leave off the itemController. </p>
