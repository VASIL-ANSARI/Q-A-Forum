<p>I solved the problem and now I'm finally able to share the answer to my question. 
The file descriptor which has to be turned to raw mode is the standard input of the parent process, not the slave end of the pseudo terminal device:</p>

<pre><code>new_term_settings = slave_orig_term_settings;
cfmakeraw(&amp;new_term_settings);
tcsetattr(0, TCSANOW, &amp;new_term_settings);
</code></pre>

<p>This way the parent process passes all user input untouched to the child, who already knows how to deal with those special characters and parses them accordingly.</p>
