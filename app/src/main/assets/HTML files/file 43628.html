<p>Use a dictionary with the keys as the class names and the value as a dictionary with student names as the keys and a list to store their scores as the value. Then use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">json</a> module to <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.dump" rel="nofollow"><code>json.dump()</code></a> the data to a file. When you want to add a new score: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.load" rel="nofollow"><code>json.load()</code></a> the file, add the score like you would with a normal dictionary, and dump the <code>json.dump()</code> the data back into the file. First read the documentation and try to do this on your own. If you get stuck, comment on my answer with the specific problem you are having and a pastebin to the code in question. Good luck!</p>
