<p>You can do cross-database queries by specifying the databasename and the schema + table name.</p>

<pre><code>Select * 
From Customers b
Where bactive = 'True'
and exists
(Select 'x' from 
database1.dbo.Customers A
where a.dtcreated &gt; @startdate
and a.key = b.key)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sorry but i'm a bit confused by the example querys and example output. But using this technique you can count any way you like</p>
