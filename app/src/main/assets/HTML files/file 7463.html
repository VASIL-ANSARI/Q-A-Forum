<p>I think you're confusing concepts. Instead of setting the <code>Content</code>, which is data, set the <code>Template</code>, which is the visual representation of the control:</p>

<pre><code>var tabItem = new TabItem
      {
      DataContext = listDesk,
      Header = headerText,
      Template = this.FindResource("MyTabitemContentTemplate") as ControlTemplate

      };
</code></pre>

<p>Moreover, chances are there is no reason to do this in code. You could be doing it entirely in XAML.</p>
