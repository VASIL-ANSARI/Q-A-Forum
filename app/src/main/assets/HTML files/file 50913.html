<p>If the debugger doesn't reach the main entry point, then the most likely culprit I can think of is <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/ctors#static-init-order" rel="nofollow">static initialization fiasco</a>, which is consistent with the behavior you describe: works on one system, fails on another.</p>

<p>Without seeing any code, we are just throwing arrows in the dark.</p>

<p>C vs C++:</p>

<p>Static initialization fiasco applies to C++ only, but keep in mind that libraries, even libraries linked to a C program can contain C++ code (not necessarily exposed as an interface).</p>

<p>Be sure to check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518415/is-there-any-way-a-c-c-program-can-crash-before-main">Is there any way a C/C++ program can crash before main()?</a> .</p>

<p>@JohnBollinger had an excellent comment: check if a simple program (compiled with the same compiler &amp; flags) runs. We sometime get absorbed on where we think the problem is, that we can easily miss things like this. </p>

<p>Another thing you can do is to use <code>ldd</code> to see if the correct libraries are linked to your program.</p>
