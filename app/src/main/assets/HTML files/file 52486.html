<p>That is not possible. Resources are read-only at runtime. You are welcome to download the image to <a href="https://commonsware.com/blog/2014/04/07/storage-situation-internal-storage.html" rel="nofollow">internal storage</a> and use it from there. </p>

  <p>I will also need to get a list of all drawables programmatically when app starts</p>

<p>For the ones you download to internal storage, use standard Java file I/O to list the files in your chosen directory (e.g., <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/File.html#listFiles()" rel="nofollow"><code>listFiles()</code> on the <code>File</code></a> pointing to that directory).</p>

<p>For any actual drawable resources that you want to look up dynamically, that's not really recommended. That being said, you can <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3221787/115145">hack in some reflection</a> to make it work.</p>
