<p>I've setup my functions like yours and everything seems happy.</p>

<p>The problem may be a race condition. The <code>sails.io</code> script is loaded at the bottom of the body (make sure you place your scripts under that). If you <code>console.log()</code> anything before the scripts loads, you will get undefined errors.</p>
