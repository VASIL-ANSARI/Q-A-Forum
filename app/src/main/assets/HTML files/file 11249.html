<p>Within your installation project, you need to identify a key file in the Project Output group that you have referenced.</p>

<p>To resolve the issue, right-click on the appropriate project output that you have added to the installation program, expand the <code>KeyOutput</code> node, and click in the <code>(Files)</code> box and click the <code>...</code> button. </p>

<p>If there is nothing in there, then you should probably remove that output from your installer.</p>
