<p>It seems it has border and box shadow on focus: Try adding below to css</p>

<pre><code>.search:focus {
    border: none;
    -webkit-box-shadow: none;
    box-shadow: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also check if any other classes are getting appended after you delete text(e.g in case of angular ng-dirty)</p>
