<p>If your input consists only of capital letters, then the letter was already provided if and only if you reach the end of your inner loop, <em>i.e.</em> if the letter is not found in the alphabet because it has already been replaced by <code>_</code>. One way to check for this is to check if <code>i</code> equals 26 after your inner loop. A slightly cleaner way would be to use a boolean to indicate if you did break out of the inner loop.</p>

<p>Now if your input can be any character, it would be best to use a separate array to keep track of the letters already provided instead of replacing letters in <code>alphabet</code>. You could have:</p>

<pre><code>const char alphabet[26] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
int count[26] = {0};
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>if (letter == alphabet[i]) 
{
    ++count[i];
    break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>to keep track of exactly how many times each letter was provided.</p>
