<p>Looks like you're on an Linux/Unix box and you're not root ... which means you don't have <em>permission</em> to put things in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> (or a lot of other places).</p>

<p><strong>Update for comments:</strong></p>

<p>Since OS X is (under the hood) FreeBSD Unix, there is still the basic concept of 'root'. Your admin account is <em>capable</em> of doing root-type things, but it doesn't automatically escalate privileges (which is a Good Thing). The command you are looking for is <code>sudo</code>, which provides temporary root privileges. To do it for a single command (the most normal case), simply prefix the command with <code>sudo</code>, e.g. <code>sudo python setup.py install</code>. You will probably be prompted to supply your password again (not <em>root</em>'s password, but your own) and then the command will be executed. <code>sudo</code> will only prompt you the first time (or every N minutes) for a password.</p>

<p>I noted <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TA25121">here</a> that in 10.5 and later, <code>sudo</code> will only work if your admin account has a password. If it doesn't, then you will have to set one before this will work.</p>

<p>If you have a whole bunch of stuff you need to do as root, try <code>sudo /bin/bash</code> (or you shell of choice), which will give you a new shell (as a child process of the other shell) which has <em>full root privileges</em>. <strong>Note Well:</strong> if you are not use to living at a root-prompt, this is not a great idea. One slip of the keyboard and you can nail your system to the outhouse wall. So be careful out there!</p>
