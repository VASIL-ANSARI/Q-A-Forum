<p>I've found that one of my earlier solution was a fix after all.</p>

<p>Most likely the fix was adding the schemaLocation attribute to the import lines in the XSD's and WSDL. This was needed because the company I was making this service for changed their company name, rendering the Namespaces unreachable. My guess is that in this case you <em>need</em> to add a reference to the original XSD if this is the case. I had a local copy, so I pointed to that version of the XSD. This way Visual Studio was able to create a proxy class even for the complex types.</p>

<p>What was wrong was the way I tested it. Everytime I ran a test request and debugged, I was testing an old version of my service, not the updates I've been putting in. Rookie mistake I guess, unfortunately it took me a few hours to realize that. Lesson learned: Make sure you have a reliable local testing environment on which you can debug correctly.</p>

<p>Please let me know if what I think was the solution is wrong or if there's anything else I'm missing. Might be helpful for me or others running into similar problems.</p>
