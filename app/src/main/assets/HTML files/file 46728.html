<p>You have two styles causing trouble on <code>#slide1_container</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#slider1_container{
    position: absolute;
    float: right;
    top: 50px;
    left: 40%;
    width: 60%;
    height: 900px;
    background: #333;
    overflow: hidden;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>There is no point in floating and absolutely positioning something. But either one will cause issues with the next elements in your layout. If you absolutely position something, you remove it entirely from the layout flow. So, to subsequent elements it effectively has no height (so your footer appears at the top). If you float the element, you have to "clear the float". One way to do this is to use a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/" rel="nofollow">clearfix</a> on a container element. You also need to remove <code>position:absolute</code> from your footer. </p>

<p>Your logos and colors are looking good...if you learn some basic CSS layout techniques, especially <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position" rel="nofollow">how the various values for position really work</a>, you will save yourself frustration and time in building your site.</p>
