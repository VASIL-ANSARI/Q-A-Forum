<p>I don't think the stack initialization was the problem.  He was supposed to be looking for a hard-to-find memory leak, but he decided to do the initialization change instead on thousands of C files.</p>

<p>Although, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninitialized_variable" rel="nofollow">mentioned on wikipedia</a>, "uninitialized variables [are] a frequent cause of bugs".  You eliminate the potential for use of uninitialized variables if you take care of it at declaration.  But doing that conversion to a few thousand files probably wasn't the most efficient way to find and solve the real problem.</p>
