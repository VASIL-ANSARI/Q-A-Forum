<p>There are two parts to Firebase's Java offering, each with different dependencies:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/quickstart.html" rel="nofollow">Firebase Java client library</a></strong> - Use this to access the Firebase realtime database. </p>

<p>The docs lean a bit towards Android, but it works great in Java and languages that can call out to Java (e.g. Groovy)</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/android/guide/user-auth.html" rel="nofollow">Firebase Simple Login library</a></strong> - This makes auth easier, but you can handle auth yourself if you prefer.</p>

<p>This library is Android only. In general, authentication usually ends up with a bunch of platform specific tricks. This library focuses on the Android set of those tricks.</p>

<p>It sounds like you want auth in libgdx. Can you expand your question to include a bit more about your expected use case? </p>
