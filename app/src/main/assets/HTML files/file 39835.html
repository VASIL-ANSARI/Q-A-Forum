<p>This is your constraint:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE question
    ADD CONSTRAINT CK_question check (((question like '%indicator semnification%') and
                                      (picture in(null))) or
                                      (question not like '%indicator semnification%')
                                     )
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is probably the <code>picture in (null)</code>.  This will never return true.  Try this:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE question
    ADD CONSTRAINT CK_question check (((question like '%indicator semnification%') and
                                      (picture is null)) or
                                      (question not like '%indicator semnification%')
                                     )
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you are using MySQL, you can express constraints, but they are not implemented.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The above fixes the logic in your version.  I think the logic you really want is:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE question
    ADD CONSTRAINT CK_question check ((question not like '%indicator semnification%') or 
                                      (picture is not null)
                                     ) ;
</code></pre>

<p>Or, equivalently (when <code>question</code> is not null):</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE question
    ADD CONSTRAINT CK_question check (not ((question like '%indicator semnification%') and 
                                           (picture is null))
                                     ) ;
</code></pre>
