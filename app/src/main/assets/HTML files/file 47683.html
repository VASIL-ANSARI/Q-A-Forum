<p>It looks like you are using it as a statement and not as an assignment</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15977031/java-ternary-without-assignment">From what SO says it is not possible to do so</a></p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13891841/why-cant-i-throw-an-exception-while-using-the-ternary-operator">Also from another SO Articel, that says you canÂ´t throw an exception in the ternary statement</a></p>

<p>I think you need to go back to an if-else clause like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (!f.exists()) {
   try {
      f.createNewFile();
      printFile();
   } catch(Exception e ) {
      System.out.println("Error in creating file");
   }
} else {
   printFile();
}
</code></pre>
