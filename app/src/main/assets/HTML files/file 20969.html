<p>Well.  You are right that Roles.IsUserInRole(role) can be used to customize pages for different roles.  So it's not all about restricting access to pages and directories.</p>

<p>If you're asking how to accommodate new roles created by user administrators, and how to have the pages adapt to these new roles ... well, I think the term for what you're talking about is "dynamic roles".  If you want a system where the users decide who can access what and create new roles with different access, you need a system that supports dynamic roles.  </p>

<p>I've seen a lot of attempts to hand-code such a system, and I have yet to personally see one that was done well.  Some systems that do exactly that and do it well are commercial CMS (content management systems).  If you have an actual need for such a system, you might want to look at some of them.  </p>

<p>ASP.NET's built-in role management is neat stuff, but it's really meant for a static role situation, where there are (say) "Payables Clerks", "Receivables Clerks" and "Managers" and, while people may change roles, the roles themselves and what people in them need to do don't change much.</p>
