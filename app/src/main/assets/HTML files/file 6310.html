<p>You've got a few issues here.  </p>

<p>Mainly, you can't have the same index twice.  'name' can be the index once and only once, so you're 'desired' output is impossible.</p>

<p>Also, this statement is pretty problematic</p>

<pre><code>foreach($idList as $id)
{
    $arr[] = array_merge(array(), array('name' =&gt; $id));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The use of $arr[] = $x  is like a push.  It adds a new element to the back of the array, numerically indexed.</p>

<p>Your use of array_merge is unnecessary.  array_merge returns the second argument merged over the first argument.  You are just trying to add a single new element.  Also, is that exactly the line you used or did you use <code>array_merge($arr, array('name' =&gt; $id));</code> ???</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($idList as $id)
{
    $arr[] = array('name' =&gt; $id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you will get:</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [0] = Array
    (
        [name] =&gt; first
    )
    [1] = Array
    (
        [name] =&gt; second
    }
 ....
</code></pre>

<p>And so on.  I'm not sure if this is exactly what you want, but what you proposed in the first place isn't possible.</p>
