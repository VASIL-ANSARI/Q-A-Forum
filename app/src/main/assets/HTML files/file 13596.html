<p>The obvious solution would be to give it an index of 2 instead of 3.</p>

<p>That said, the documentation for the <code>insertString:atIndex</code> method make it sound like your original code should have worked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new characters begin at anIndex and the existing characters from
  anIndex to the end are shifted by the length of aString.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the '8' character was at index 3, it sounds like your 0 should have been placed there and the 8 shifted one place to the right, producing the desired '08'</p>
