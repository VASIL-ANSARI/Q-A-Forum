<p>I'm not sure what it is you are trying to do but here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every header file should include all headers that you are going to use for that file or class.</li>
<li>Every cpp file that corresponds to a particular header file should include ONLY that header file.</li>
<li>Your main.cpp should include all headers that you are using for your program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your code should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// main.cpp
#include "second.h"
#include "employee.h"

int main(){
//code
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your other files:</p>

<pre><code>//second.h

//includes here
void function();
//---------------------------------------------

//second.cpp
#include "second.h"

void function(){ //code }

//---------------------------------------------

//employee.h

//includes here

class employee{
public:
     void payment();
//ctor, dtor, and other declarations
}

//---------------------------------------------

//employee.cpp

#include "employee.h"

void employee::payment(){ //code }

//rest of methods
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, there will be build problems if you include the same header more than once in the same program. So for all header files, you should implement this guard:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef __MYCLASS_H__
#define __MYCLASS_H__

//includes

class MyClass{
//declarations
}

#endif
</code></pre>
