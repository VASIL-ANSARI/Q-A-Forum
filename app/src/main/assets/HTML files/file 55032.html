<p>All pages are stateless. Properties only live while the page is rendered and once the response is returned to the user the page state is gone.</p>

<p>To solve this, in the propertys setter you need to persist the value in a user-specific location. The global Session may be a good place - or a user Cookie. Then in the propertys getter you need to read from the storage you used.</p>

<pre><code>public string PassLogedUser 
{ 
    get 
    { 
        return Session("PassLogedUser") ?? "anonymous";
    } 
    set 
    {
        Session("PassLogedUser", value);
    } 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the master page prerender event you need to set the <code>LogedUser.Text = PassLogedUser;</code></p>
