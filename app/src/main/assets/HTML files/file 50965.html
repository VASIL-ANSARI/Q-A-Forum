<p>The <code>ConfigProto.device_filters</code> field is currently ignored by TensorFlow, although it is intended to support your use case in future. If you want to achieve the same end of running ops on <code>/gpu:1</code> and <code>/cpu:0</code>, you can do that as follows, using "soft placement":</p>

<pre><code>with tf.device("/gpu:1"):
  # Build your model in this with context. All nodes will get the
  # device "/gpu:1".

with tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True)):
  # Execute your mode in this with context.
  # Soft placement will use /gpu:1 for GPU-compatible ops, and /cpu:0
  # for CPU-only ops.
</code></pre>
