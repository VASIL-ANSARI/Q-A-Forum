<p>You could a couple different things here. </p>

<p>You could create a View that  shows your Car Content Type and then expose various fields to the user as filters for search. Here's an example: <a href="http://www.cae-nyc.org/schools" rel="nofollow">http://www.cae-nyc.org/schools</a> - it happens to be mashed up with a Google Map - but the search fields on the left are Views filters.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>Take a look at the Faceted Search Module - <a href="http://drupal.org/project/faceted_search" rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/project/faceted_search</a></p>
