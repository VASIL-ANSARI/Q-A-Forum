<p>You need to create a javascript image with it's src set to your array value</p>

<pre><code>        var img = new Image();
        img.src = imageArray[0];

        ctx.drawImage(img, 100, 30);
</code></pre>

<p>Without doing that you're trying to ask the canvas to draw a string of "1.png" for example which is not what you're after here!</p>
