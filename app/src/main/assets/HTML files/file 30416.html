<p>You don't really have to delete the message and add it. Once the message's <code>visibility timeout</code> period (50 seconds in your case) has expired it will automatically appear back in the queue. This way, your <code>DequeueCount</code> logic would also work as the same message is dequeued and enqueued again.</p>

<p>Please note that Windows Azure Queues are best-effort FIFO ... so it is not always necessary and that messages will be picked on the basis of the time they were added. You could do a few things: </p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the number of retries (currently you have 10, you can reduce it to 5) or </li>
<li>Check for actual exception. If the process failed because of incorrect credentials, it will fail the next time and next time after that. There's no point retrying that message. You could just move that message into a poison queue so that you can inspect the message later.</li>
</ul>
