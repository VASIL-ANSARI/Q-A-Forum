<p>The answer is that it depends whether you have references to it or not.</p>

<pre><code>var d = document.createElement('div');
otherElement.appendChild(d);
otherElement.removeChild(d);
// still have reference to d, it will exist, event listener remains even if it won't be fired.
</code></pre>

<p>If you no longer have a way to access it, the element will be garbage collected along with the  listeners (for all browsers > IE6).</p>
