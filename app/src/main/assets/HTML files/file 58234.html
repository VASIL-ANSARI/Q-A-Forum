<p>There are many ways to do this.  But one is to use <code>cross apply</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select c.name, j.james_count  
from company c cross apply
     (select count(*) as james_count
      from [user] u
      where first_name = 'James' and u.parent_company_id = company_id
     ) j
where james_count &gt; 0;
</code></pre>

<p>The more natural way is to simply use a <code>join</code> and <code>group by</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select c.name, count(*) as james_count
from company c join
     [user] u
     on u.parent_company_id = c.company_id and u.first_name = 'James'
group by c.name;
</code></pre>
