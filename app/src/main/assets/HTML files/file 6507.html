<p>If you perform any redirects in your code without specifying the endReponse parameter of Response.Redirect, the redirect will call thread.Abort(), but there will still be code to execute. This code gets orphaned since the thread is gone and you get the exception. For reading:</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br />
Another possibility would be an unhandled server level exception that <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/919789" rel="nofollow">causes the w3wp.exe process to crash or recycle itself</a>. This would be the external cause you alluded to that would cause the thread to abort but attempt to continue running code. To determine if this might be the case, you would have exceptions in your System Event Log. They're very generic, but they'll clearly list w3wp.exe (so you can use that as a filter). If this turns out to be the case, you'll need to install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=28bd5941-c458-46f1-b24d-f60151d875a3&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">IIS Debug Diagnostics</a> and set up some crash monitors to catch what is going on at the moment of the crash. Since it happens outside of the actual page lifecycle, normal exception handling gets bypassed.</p>
