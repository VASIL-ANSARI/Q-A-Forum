<p>In Java, a char is just a 16-bit integer. When casting ints (which are 32-bit integers) to chars, you are keeping the 16 least significant bits of the int, and discarding the upper 16 bits. This is called a <strong>narrowing conversion</strong>. Java characters are represented as members of the Unicode character set. The Unicode value of <a href="http://www.grogllc.com/unicodetable.html" rel="nofollow">'B' is 66</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>int ascii = 66;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The integer value 66 is assigned to <code>ascii</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>char character = (char) ascii;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>character</code> stores the first 16 bits of the integer <code>ascii</code>. Storing 66 doesnt exceed 16 bits so the char variable gets it right</p>
