<p>You're comparing "April 31st" with May 1st. There <em>is</em> no April 31st, so it's rolling over to May 1st anyway. (Okay, it would make more sense to just throw an exception, but hey... that's far from the worst piece of API design in <code>Calendar</code>.)</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend using <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> to parse string representations of date/time values, instead of doing it yourself. Aside from anything else, <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> "knows" that months are 0-based in Java... which is the basic bug you've fallen foul of. The code would also be a lot more readable, I suspect.</p>

<p>Do you really need to keep the collection as a collection of strings anyway? If they're <em>just</em> dates, convert it to a collection of some date type (ideally using Joda Time or Java 8's <code>java.time</code> package). If they're something like log entries which have a date but also other information, convert them into a representation of that first. Either way, you've then got a collection which more naturally represents the information it holds.</p>
