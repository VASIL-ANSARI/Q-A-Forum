<p>You can do this with joins and aggregation:</p>

<pre><code>select s.student_id, s.student_name, c.class_name,
       avg(case when sc.subject = 'Math' then sc.score end) as Math,
       avg(case when sc.subject = 'Physics' then sc.score end) as Physics,
       avg(case when sc.subject = 'Chemistry' then sc.score end) as Chemistry
from students s join
     scores sc 
     on sc.student_id = s.id join
     classes c
     on sc.class_id = cl.id
group by s.student_id, s.student_name, c.class_name;
</code></pre>
