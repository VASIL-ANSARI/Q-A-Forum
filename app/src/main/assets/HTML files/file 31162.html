<p>Maybe I don't understand your question, but in the <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/JavaGuide4" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> you see how to create a login form and actually perform the authentication. Only after that happens does the email session value exist. If that value is in the session, then the user must have logged in with the proper credentials and must have been authenticated.</p>

<p>Of course, if User A knows the credentials of User B, nothing can help that.</p>

<p>If instead you are concerned about <em>authorization</em>, deciding who can see what upon authentication, then you can do a lot of things including leverage OAuth support in Play proper or a plugin like <a href="https://github.com/leleuj/play-pac4j" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.</p>
