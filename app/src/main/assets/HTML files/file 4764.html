<p>First of all, the dates formatting in JRE is known for incorrect behavior for many locales (invalid Polish, Czech and Russian long dates, invalid Polish short date; And this are just examples of what I know for sure). So I wouldn't trust this source of information much.</p>

<p>If you want to implement your own long date formatting logic, here is what I would do:</p>

<pre><code>String spanishDatePattern = "{0,number,00} {1} {2,number,####}";
String spanishLongDateMonthNameNovember = "de noviembre de";

Object[] arguments = { new Integer(date.getDate()),
                       spanishLongDateMonthNameNovember,
                       new Integer(date.getYear()) };
String formattedDate = MessageFormat.format(spanishDatePattern,
                arguments);
</code></pre>

<p>In this case you will need 13 messages per language (12 month ~names and 1 pattern). Not that much, I believe.</p>

<p>Of course this was just an example, in reality you would probably need to also add logic to resolve month names (having keys with name ending with month number, i.e. longDateFormatMonthName.0=January?).</p>
