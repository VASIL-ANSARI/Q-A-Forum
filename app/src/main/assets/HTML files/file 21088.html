<p>SQLite has a command <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang_update.html" rel="nofollow">UPDATE OR REPLACE</a> that combines updating and inserting, but this is only for the common case where you want to avoid inserting a duplicate.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang_delete.html" rel="nofollow">DELETE</a> command does not have the functionality you want.</p>

<p>SQLite does not have any control flow statements, so your best bet is to execute both DELETE/UPDATE statements:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM MyTable
WHERE jobid = ?
  AND statusCode &lt; ?;

UPDATE MyTable
SET statusCode = ?
WHERE jobid = ?;        -- does nothing if record was deleted
</code></pre>
