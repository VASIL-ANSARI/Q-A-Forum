<p>IE stores localStorage as XML, and disallows any character that doesn't match the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Char" rel="nofollow">Char production in XML 1.0</a>; i.e., you can store "any Unicode character, excluding the surrogate blocks, FFFE, and FFFF".</p>

<p>Per specification, this is a bug: there should be no restriction on what can be stored in localStorage (any ECMAScript string should be possible), though this bug has existed since IE8. (In IE8 previews it was possible to corrupt the localStorage backing-store by storing one of the disallowed characters, as when it attempted to parse the XML file it got a parse error!)</p>
