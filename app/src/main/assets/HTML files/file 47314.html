<p>As your resource name is :return instead of :returns that Rails decided to add the _index to any collection nested underneath. This change has been done from rails 3 onwards.</p>

<p>So the new rails 3 route should be:</p>

<pre><code>shipping_price_store_return_index_path
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to avoid the <code>_index</code> then either you can use <code>resources :returns</code> or you can make it <code>resource :return</code>.</p>
