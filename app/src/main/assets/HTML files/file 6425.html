<p>I quite did not understand the whole logic behind your class structure. Why you are not connecting students directly into a class? And how a class can have many levels. I mean if you have Math1 and Math2, those are different classes, right? Or do you have Math1,2,3? </p>

<p>Well, anyway, here's the solution if you want to use current assosiations, I hope it suites your needs:</p>

<pre><code> Class Student      
 ...
 def available_classes
    Class.find(:all, 
      :include =&gt; {:levels =&gt; {:students_levels =&gt; :student}}, 
      :conditions =&gt; ["students.id = ?", self.id])
  end
</code></pre>

<p>And sorry, this is still in Rails 2.x format...</p>
