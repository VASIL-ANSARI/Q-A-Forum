<p>it depends on how you read the input . for this example , I'd use <code>getchar() -'0'</code> </p>

<pre><code>char input = getchar();
int num = input -'0'
</code></pre>

<p>if input represents a digit ['0'-'9'] , <code>input - '0'</code> will give the represented number , since characters are basically numbers and glyphs that corresponde them  </p>
