<p>This query replaces each of the spaces with a dot (.) so you can see them</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  REGEXP_REPLACE(PROJECT_CTY_ST_ZIP,
                 '([[:space:]])',
                 '.') spaces_or_now_dots
  FROM PAYMENT
</code></pre>

<p>This query finds the ones that have one or more spaces.</p>

<pre><code>  SELECT PROJECT_CTY_ST_ZIP
  FROM PAYMENT   
  where REGEXP_LIKE(PROJECT_CTY_ST_ZIP,
                 '[[:space:]]'
                 )
</code></pre>

<p>I have not considered the cases of spaces in the beginning and end, because you have already taken care of them.</p>
