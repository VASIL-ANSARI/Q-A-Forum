<p>There's a bit more to this to support iOS6 correctly. The iOS 6 Release Notes sketch things out:</p>

<p>This bit might be useful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For compatibility, view controllers that still implement the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method do not get the new autorotation behaviors. (In other words, they do not fall back to using the app, app delegate, or Info.plist file to determine the supported orientations.) Instead, the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method is used to synthesize the information that would be returned by the supportedInterfaceOrientations method.</p>

<p>But you should also take a look at Session 236 from WWDC 2012 - The Evolution of View Controllers.</p>
