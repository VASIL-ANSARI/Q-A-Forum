<p>If you are POSTing to the server the variable will not be in GET.</p>

<pre><code>$stringRecieved = $_POST["toSubmit"];
</code></pre>

<p>Incidentally, it is usually a good idea to provide a wrapper and test that POST is actually being used; it's usually a good idea to sanitize input, and it's usually a good idea to make sure that access is coming from a valid source, none of which your PHP seems to be doing yet.</p>
