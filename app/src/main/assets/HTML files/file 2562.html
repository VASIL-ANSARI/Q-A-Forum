<p>You're not showing the whole code, so the simplest solution would be:</p>

<pre><code>data = data[1] + data[0]
</code></pre>

<p>If you insist on using <code>struct</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from struct import pack, unpack
&gt;&gt;&gt; unpack('&lt;H', '\x12\x13')
(4882,)
&gt;&gt;&gt; pack('&gt;H', *unpack('&lt;H', '\x12\x13'))
'\x13\x12'
</code></pre>

<p>Which first unpacks the string as a little-endian unsigned short, and then packs it back as big-endian unsigned short. You can have it the other way around, of course. When converting between BE and LE it doesn't matter which way you're converting - the conversion function is bi-directional.</p>
