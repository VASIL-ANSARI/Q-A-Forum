<p>If you want to change the tool tip that shows up when hovering over the chart you can set this when setting up the chart by using</p>

<pre><code>tooltip:
{
  formatter: function()
  {
    return (/some html that returns what you want/);
  }
},
</code></pre>

<p>Also you can interact with the chart after it's loaded by doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>var chart = $('#name-of-your-chart-div').highcharts();
</code></pre>

<p>Hope i've understood your question correctly.</p>

<p>Also a great place to look is the Highcharts API: <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts" rel="nofollow">http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts</a></p>
