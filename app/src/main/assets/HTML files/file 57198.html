<p>You were calculating the wrong range. Your start is 24 hours ago, end is within 25 hours ago, you should have start as 25 hours ago and end as 24 hours ago.</p>

<pre><code>start = timezone.now().date() - relativedelta(hours=+25)
end = timezone.now().date() - relativedelta(hours=+24)
list = Entry.objects.filter(startdate__gte=start, startdate__lte=end)
</code></pre>

<p>Other things that are problematic in your code, you shouldn't using <code>timezone.now().date()</code> to calculate the time range, because your field is <code>DateTimeField</code> and you are dealing with hours, so <code>date</code> is clearly not granular enough(even though it's still sort of working using <code>date()</code>, but the concept is wrong):</p>

<pre><code>start = timezone.now() - relativedelta(hours=+25)
end = timezone.now() - relativedelta(hours=+24)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, please <strong>always</strong> state your problem clearly in the body of the question, like you were having empty queryset, it will make others easier to judge what problem do you have.</p>
