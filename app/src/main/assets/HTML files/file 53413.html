<p>I don't know if <code>.slim.js</code> is a standard name extension for javascript library, but for jQuery, it is a build without some extensions, just check the beginning of the file:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-ajax,-ajax/jsonp,-ajax/load,-ajax/parseJSON,-ajax/parseXML,-ajax/script,-ajax/var/location,-ajax/var/nonce,-ajax/var/rquery,-ajax/xhr,-manipulation/_evalUrl,-event/ajax,-effects,-effects/Tween,-effects/animatedSelector,-deprecated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typically you have no <code>ajax</code> support (<code>jQuery.ajax</code> is not defined), no effects, and the deprecated method are removed.</p>

<p>Concerning requireJS, as far as I know if you require <code>jquery</code>, the only file "included" will be <code>jquery.js</code>, so you would have to explicitely require <code>jquery.slim</code> in order to get <code>jquery.slim.js</code> file included, which is not what you want.</p>
