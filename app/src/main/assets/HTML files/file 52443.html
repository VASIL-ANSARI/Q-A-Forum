<p><code>C&amp; var2(var1);</code> and <code>const C&amp; tmp(var1);</code> do not call any special member functions. You're declaring <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2765999/what-is-a-reference-variable-in-c">references</a> - aliases for the referenced objects/variables (yes, changes made to <code>var2</code> are actually made <strong>through</strong> <code>var2</code> to <code>var1</code>).</p>

<p>Concerning lifetime extension, that applies to <strong>binding rvalues to <code>const&amp;</code></strong>. <code>var1</code> is an lvalue and its lifetime is fixed to its scope.</p>

<p>To the second example, you can't return a reference (even to <code>const</code>) to a local variable. An alias doesn't change that. All that the caller will get is a dangling reference.</p>
