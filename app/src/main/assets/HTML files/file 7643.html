<p>I would use NSFetchedResultsController to watch over the A objects.  Use your fetched results to populate the section titles.  Then when you are looking to populate your "data rows", you can find your current A object (by using <code>[[fetchedResultsController fetchedResults] objectAtIndex:indexPath.section]</code> or something similar) and extract the B objects from it with <code>A.BOjbects</code>, which returns the NSSet of all B objects associated with the A object.  After doing that, you can filter or sort the list as you please before placing them in the rows</p>
