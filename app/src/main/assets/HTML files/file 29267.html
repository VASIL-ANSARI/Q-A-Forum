<p>Why use the canvas to resize images? Modern browsers all use bicubic interpolation â the same process used by Photoshop (if you're doing it right) â and they do it faster than the canvas process. Just specify the image size you want (use only one dimension, height or width, to resize proportionally).</p>

<p>This is supported by most browsers, including later versions of IE. Earlier versions <a href="http://css-tricks.com/ie-fix-bicubic-scaling-for-images/">may require browser-specific CSS</a>.</p>

<p>A simple function (using jQuery) to resize an image would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>function resizeImage(img, percentage) {
    var coeff = percentage/100,
        width = $(img).width(),
        height = $(img).height();

    return {"width": width*coeff, "height": height*coeff}           
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Changed <code>image</code> to <code>img</code> to match function args. ^)^</p>

<p>Then just use the returned value to resize the image in one or both dimensions.</p>

<p>Obviously there are different refinements you could make, but this gets the job done.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong></p>

<p>Paste the following code into the console of this page and watch what happens to the gravatars:</p>

<pre><code>function resizeImage(img, percentage) {
    var coeff = percentage/100,
        width = $(img).width(),
        height = $(img).height();

    return {"width": width*coeff, "height": height*coeff}           
}

$('.user-gravatar32 img').each(function(){
  var newDimensions = resizeImage( this, 150);
  this.style.width = newDimensions.width + "px";
  this.style.height = newDimensions.height + "px";
});
</code></pre>
