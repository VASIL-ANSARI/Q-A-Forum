<p>No, each cell does not have its own instance (you can validate this simply by breakpointing your constructor). There's nothing magic going on here; you are the one who instantiates the renderer, so how could there be X * Y instances?</p>

<p>If you're confused about why this is safe: the returned component is used to render the cell, but then is free to be used by the next call to <code>getListCellRendererComponent</code>.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/ListCellRenderer.html#getListCellRendererComponent-javax.swing.JList-E-int-boolean-boolean-" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return a component that has been configured to display the specified value. That component's paint method is then called to "render" the cell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the component is only used to do the <code>paint</code>, and then not used further.  This is why it's safe to use a singleton component (i.e. return the same component every time).</p>

<p>There is no need to define a singleton/static renderer.</p>
