<p><strong>I can now confirm that :</strong> 
the behaviour only happens on my 2.2 device. And it can be reproduced.
It works fine (the animation finishes properly when rows are updated in the bg) on Android 4.1 device and it can be reproduced.</p>

<p><strong>My current solution to this is</strong>
Since I want to support 2.2 devices. I create listener to this animation. when <code>anim</code> is finished I make the update to db. Also I block UI for the duraiton of anim (it is around 300ms so its fine)</p>

<p>NOTE - this does look like Android SDK problem</p>

<p><strong>As for the update problem and using forceLoad</strong>
In my content provider implementation I had to add this inside my query method : </p>

<pre><code>cursor.setNotificationUri(getContext().getContentResolver(), uri);
</code></pre>

<p>which is registering this uri to ContentResolver. now it works fine without using forceLoad</p>
