<p>I noticed that on Mac OS X and maybe even iOS, when you connect to a new Wi-Fi network, it will try to contact <code>www.apple.com</code>. This is being done to check if the internet connectivity is available. If it's not available, the Captive Network Assistant will pop-up, showing you the authentication page, or sometimes when I'm in Starbucks, an advertisement. </p>

<p>Following your question, since Apple themselves is doing it this way, I think you could check for HTTP response code, look for something in the HTML markup (slightly discouraged though) or trying to connect to a known server (Reachability). </p>

<p>For a corporation practicing well-documented projects, I am quite sure they won't be changing things without making sure that your app, once deployed will continue to work. </p>
