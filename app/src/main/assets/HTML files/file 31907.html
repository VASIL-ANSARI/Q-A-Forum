<p>The <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2#Libraries_to_use_the_Web_Service" rel="nofollow">Documentation of the MusicBrainz Web Service</a> mentions a java library that can be used: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/musicbrainzws2-java/" rel="nofollow">musicbrainzws2-java</a>.</p>

<p>I don't have experience with that particular library, but these libraries tend to provide an API to transparently request entities from MusicBrainz. Choosing the right end point and parsing is done by the library.</p>

<p>You are not the first one trying to use the MusicBrainz Web Service with Java ;-)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/musicbrainzws2-java/wiki/Usage_Search#Example" rel="nofollow">wiki of the library</a> has some examples on how to use it to search.</p>
