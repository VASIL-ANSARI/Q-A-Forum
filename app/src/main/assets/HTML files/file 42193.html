<p>First question:</p>

<p>Yes. The toggling looks just fine. You do not have to create two separate location manager instances. </p>

<p>According to Apple documents on CoreLocation
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/LocationAwarenessPG/CoreLocation/CoreLocation.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/LocationAwarenessPG/CoreLocation/CoreLocation.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The significant-change location service provides accuracy thatâs good enough for most apps and represents a power-saving alternative to the standard location service. The service uses Wi-Fi to determine the userâs location and report changes in that location, allowing the system to manage power usage much more aggressively than it could otherwise.</p>

<p>Second question:</p>

<p>You can use Apple's energy diagnostics instruments to see at what desiredAccuracy level GPS chip is powered up. Our most recent investigation suggests that the GPS chip is powered when the desiredAccuracy or distanceFilter value is less than 100 meters. Energy usage values that instruments provides are very coarse for me to draw any direct co-relation between desiredAccuracy and battery usage. However, according to the popular wisdom, not turning on the GPS chip when you can is a good proxy for energy savings. </p>
