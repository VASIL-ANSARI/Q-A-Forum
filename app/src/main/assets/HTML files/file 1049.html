<p>I've had some experience setting up comms between CE devices and a PC, and have used custom interfaces using winsock (thwacking some bytes back and forwards) and have tried SOAP. In Windows CE 5.0, the Microsoft provided SOAP server took our device down somehow every couple of hours or so. I spent many weeks trying to work out what was wrong, thinking it was something I'd done wrong. So, I prefer to stick to winsock now because at least I've got a chance of knowing what's going on and can fix it.</p>

<p>Also, CE devices aren't always the quickest performers depending on what hardware you've got. Web-services take up some overhead and time converting data to XML, and this may be a performance hit you are or are not able to afford.</p>
