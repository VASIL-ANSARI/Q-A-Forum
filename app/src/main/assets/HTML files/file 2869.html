<p>You <strong>can</strong> instantiate a class with protected constructors from within the class itself - in a static constructor or static method. This can be used to implement a singleton, or a factory-type thing.</p>

<p>An abstract class cannot be instantiated at all - the intent is that one or more child classes will complete the implementation, and those classes will get instantiated</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>if you call <code>ProtectedConstructor.GetInstance();</code> instead of <code>new ProtectedConstructor();</code>, it works. Maybe protected constructors can't be called this way? But protected methods certainly can.</p>
