<p>If you have already built it, there isn't too much wrong with the architecture aside from being a little too enterprisey. Starting from scratch on a system like this though, I'd probably leave out SQL and the middleware.</p>

<p>The loss of consistency in NoSQL data stores isn't as complete as you suggest. Aside from the fact that many of them do support transactions and can be set up for immediate consistency on particular queries, I suspect some of your requirements are simply an artefact of designing things relationally. Your concern seems to be around operations that require updates to multiple records - Is a listing really multiple records, or just set up that way because SQL records have to have a flat structure?</p>

<p>Also, if search and view are handled outside of MySQL, you have effectively set up an eventual consistency system anyway.</p>
