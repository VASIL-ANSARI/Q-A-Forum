<p>you can't write </p>

<pre><code> document.location.href="{{ path('ymtest_Delete'"+types+", {'id': "+id+"}) }}";
</code></pre>

<p>you are mixing twig functions and javascript functions.
Twig will be parsed and compiled on backend
Javascript will be executed on your client side after the html page is received</p>

<p>You will have to generate and assign each url type to a javascript variable.</p>

<p>a more elegant way to do that would be to store your url and messages in data attributes</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a class="Right btn btn-danger" data-url="{{ path('ymtest_EditMusician', {'id': artist.id}) }}" data-message="Are you sure you want to delete this type ?" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you can now bind your event click with javscript and retrieve your data attributes values. No more javascript tests</p>
