<p>I think the returned value for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb760527%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">TBN_DROPDOWN</a> is not correct -- you are returning <code>1</code> which maps to <code>TBDDRET_NODEFAULT</code> meaning "The drop-down was not handled", you'll need to return <code>TBDDRET_DEFAULT</code> or <code>TBDDRET_TREATPRESSED</code>.</p>
