<p>Well this is probably because the <code>IS_AUTOINCREMENT</code> attribute is not relevant for an Oracle database.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be easier if all JDBC drivers where really compliant with the specification, but this is generally not the case. As stated in the API specification, the <code>Resultset.getString("IS_AUTOINCREMENT")</code> should at least return an empty string when it cannot be determined whether the column is auto incremented or not.</p>

<p>If you want to emulate this behavior, I suggest you use the following piece of code:</p>

<pre>
String isAutoincrement = "";
try {
    isAutoincrement = rset.getString("IS_AUTOINCREMENT");
} catch (SQLException sqle) {
    log.warn("IS_AUTOINCREMENT attribute could not be retrieved", sqle);
}
</pre>

<p>If you intend to develop a database agnostic application, you should also consider using this tip for other attributes such as "REMARKS" or "COLUMN_DEF" for example. More generally, your code should be really defensive, because JDBC implementations are really different from one vendor to another.</p>
