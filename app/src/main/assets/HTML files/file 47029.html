<p>The XSLT file doesn't know that you want to use <code>xml.xml</code>. Rather, the XML file knows that you want to use <code>xslt.xslt</code>.</p>

<p>Add this line as the 2nd line to your <code>xml.xml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="xslt.xslt" type="text/xsl" ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, note that Chrome doesn't like using XSL with <code>file://</code>-style URLs. Either use a non-Chrome browser or use <code>http://</code> URLs.</p>
