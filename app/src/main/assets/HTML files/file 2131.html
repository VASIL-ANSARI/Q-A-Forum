<p>There are a number of plugins out there that handle this style of In-Field Labels.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/infield/" rel="nofollow">In Field Labels</a> -- I wrote this one, and it uses positioning to move the label over (or under via z-index) the input area. It has the added benefit of not disappearing completely even after the field has focus. It only hides fully when the user starts to type.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/labelify/" rel="nofollow">Labelify</a> -- Never used it, but it follows your approach of swapping out actual text values.</li>
</ol>
