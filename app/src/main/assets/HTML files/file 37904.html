<p>1)Elegancy. So you want to tag certain "classes" of code to always call some default convenience methods? Here's the relationship I see:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In human terms I would "delegate" a task to always be done by person1 because his role is "defined" when working with "me." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does creating a objective-c protocols for delegates help? I'm reminded of pretty Python decorators but can't quite translate it.</p>

<p>2)Did I read BTL's right that you were trying ...finally blocks to indiscriminately run the common-calls?</p>
