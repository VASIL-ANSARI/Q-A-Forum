<p>I'm not all too familiar with Swift but what could be causing your error is the <code>methodArguments: [String: AnyObject]</code>. In the function that works, Swift knows that all objects in the dictionary are String objects, but in the second function, their types are <code>AnyObject</code>.</p>

<p>If all of the key/value pairs are actually strings, change your parameter to <code>methodArguments: [String: String]</code> and see if that works.</p>
