<p>This should work. Create a derived view to calculate the Quantity per user and per company. Then get the max of then Quantity and then join the max back to the the calculation of the quantity. </p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.company, 
       t.user, 
       t.quantity 
FROM   (SELECT MAX(t.quantity) max_quantity, 
               t.company 
        FROM   (SELECT  
                       COUNT(t.user) quantity, 
                       t.company 
                FROM   ticket t 
                GROUP  BY t.company) t) maxq 
       INNER JOIN (SELECT t.user, 
                          t.company, 
                          COUNT(t.user) quantity 
                   FROM   ticket t 
                   GROUP  BY t.company, 
                             t.user) t 
         ON maxq.max_quantity = t.quantity 
            AND maxq.company = t.company 
       INNER JOIN company p 
         ON p.company = t.company 
ORDER  BY t.quantity DESC
