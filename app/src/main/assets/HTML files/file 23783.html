<p>I thought you said that the input is like the first string, comma separated.
Does this not work? All you have to do is remove the unwanted characters (against a blacklist) </p>

<pre><code>        var input = "Name, Ag-e, Gender, Birth Place, Rac+e";
        var splitInput = input.Split(',')
            .Select(i =&gt; 
                i.Trim()
                .ToLower()  
                .Replace(' ','_'));
        var output = string.Join(" ", splitInput.ToArray());
</code></pre>
