<p>something like this would do it, plus you have to execute the sql at some point</p>

<pre><code>$questions = array(
 "question1"   =&gt;   "What is 2+6?",
 "question2"   =&gt;   "What color is the sky?",
 "question3"   =&gt;   "What number is betwee 6 and 8?",
 "question4"   =&gt;   "How many letters are there in the English alphabet?",
 "question5"   =&gt;   "How many hours are there in a day?",
 "question6"   =&gt;   "Are you a human or a bot?"
);
$answers = array(
 "answer1"   =&gt;   "8",
 "answer2"   =&gt;   "blue",
 "answer3"   =&gt;   "7",
 "answer4"   =&gt;   "26",
 "answer5"   =&gt;   "24",
 "answer6"   =&gt;   "human"
);
$x = 0;
$sql = 'INSERT INTO
 administrator_instructions
  (question, question_naswer)
 VALUES'
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; count($question); $i++) {
  if($i){
    $sql .= ','
  }
  $sql . = "('" . $question[$i] . "','" . $answer[$i] . "')";

}
mysql_query($sql);
</code></pre>

<p>mysql support some batch inserts with this syntax (this not SQL standard)</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO TABLE(col1,col2) VALUES(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)
</code></pre>

<p>I also find it would be easier to have the array like this</p>

<pre><code>$questions_answers = array(
  array('q' =&gt; 'How are you?', 'a' =&gt; 'Good')
);
</code></pre>
