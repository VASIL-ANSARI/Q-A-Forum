<p>The problem with using <code>ActionLink</code> is that this method calls <code>UrlPathEncode</code> when creating URL. What this means is that razor directive <code>{{}}</code> with get encoded. Angular will not be able to evaluate it. What you will have to do is create this URL separately and then decode it. For example I have something like in one of the pages for our project.</p>

<pre><code>@{
var url = Url.Action("Index", "Home", new{id="{{id=lastLatency}}"});
url = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(url);
}

&lt;a data-ng-href="@url"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It is very important that you use <code>ng-href</code> attribute to set the URL.</p>
