<p><strong>doInBackground</strong> is not a part of ui thread. So you can't do anything about ui, for your example starting a new screen is a ui job but you're calling it in a backthread and this causes crash. So just move your startActivity block to onPostExecute. Also, finish() closes your entire screen. One last thing, your catch block just catches JSONExceptions and this is not enough in your case. If you change it to just Exception then you'll see the exception log in logcat.</p>
