<p>The asynchronous NSURLConnection are meant to run inside a runloop. So you have two choices: use the main thread/main runloop or spawn another thread and start a separate runloop there. In the later case, you'd need to use <code>[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop]</code> instead of <code>[NSRunLoop mainRunLoop]</code>.</p>

<p>I recommend going for the main thread/main runloop. The asynchronous NSURLConnection is very efficient, it's no problem having a lot of them run on the main thread. You won't notice any performance problems unless you do very expensive stuff in the delegate methods.</p>

<p>So simply run your code on the main thread and everything should be fine.</p>
