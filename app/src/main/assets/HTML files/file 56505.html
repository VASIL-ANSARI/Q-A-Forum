<p>I know nothing about Yii internals but I can answer for mysql and PDO.</p>

<p>First of all, for the <code>decimal</code> type you cannot get anything but string, as it's the very point of this data type.</p>

<p>For the rest, to make PDO return int and double values with corresponding types from mysql, you have to make sure that <strong>both</strong> <a href="https://phpdelusions.net/pdo#emulation" rel="nofollow">mysqlnd-based driver is installed and emulation mode is turned off</a>. Given that, PDO will return you proper data types from a prepared statement.</p>
