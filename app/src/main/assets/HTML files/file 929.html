<p>If you are using jQuery, you should be attaching events via it's own <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Events">event mechanism</a> and not by using "on" properties (onclick etc.). It also has its own event triggering method, aptly named '<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Events/trigger#typedata">trigger</a>', which you should use to activate the form submission event. </p>
