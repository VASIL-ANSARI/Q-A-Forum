<pre><code>(CASE WHEN UpdatedCode &lt;&gt; 'LSE' THEN LEFT(Investment_Codename, 2)) AS [Country Code]
</code></pre>

<p>I think I understood your question. The above checks to see if UpdatedCode is NOT LSE, if it isn't it will take the Investment Code name, and present the first 2 characters. E.g. GB.</p>
