<p>One thought would be to use "InputStream" as the object you pass to your processing code.  I believe the HttpClient (or equivalent) class for reading data via HTTP gives you some sort of stream to read on the response.  For testing, you could just substitute a different type of stream to read from, such as a local FileStream.</p>
