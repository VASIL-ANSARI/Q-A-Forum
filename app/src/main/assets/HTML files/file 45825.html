<p>This code offers a nice illustration to why programming to interfaces is a good thing. You keep using this declaration pattern:</p>

<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Character&gt; characters = new ArrayList&lt;Character&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to make <code>characters</code> a linked list, you would have to make changes in two places. If you used interface name for the declaration, like this</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Character&gt; characters = new ArrayList&lt;Character&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>the rest of your code would continue working, but you would be able to make a single change to convert to <code>LinkedList</code>:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Character&gt; characters = new LinkedList&lt;Character&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Same goes for the declaration of your <code>pattern</code> variable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is too slow and uses too much memory </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it does! Long linked lists take significantly more memory, so it's impractical to use them for character-by-character representations. Generally, conversions of strings to character lists is practical only when you deal with a small number of short strings. In other situations you would be better off with <code>String</code> objects, or <code>StringBuilder</code> objects if you need mutability.</p>
