<p>It is well known that <a href="http://superpowered.com/android-marshmallow-latency" rel="nofollow">the audio pipeline in Android 6 has been completely rewritten</a>. While this improved latency-related issues in most cases, it is not impossible that it generated a number of undesirable side-effects, as is usually the case with such large-scale changes.</p>

<p>While your issue does not seem to be a common one, there are a few things you might be able to try:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Increase the audio thread priority</strong>. The default priority for audio threads in Android is <code>-16</code>, with the maximum being <code>-20</code>, usually only available to system services. While you can't assign this value to you audio thread, you can assign the next best thing: <code>-19</code> by using the <code>ANDROID_PRIORITY_URGENT_AUDIO</code> flag when setting the thread's priority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase the number of buffers</strong> to prevent any kind of jitter or latency (you can even go up to 16). However on some devices <a href="http://heatvst.com/wp/2013/11/30/high-performance-low-latency-audio-on-android-why-it-still-doesnt-work/" rel="nofollow">the callback to fill a new buffer isnât always called when it should</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14842803/low-latency-audio-playback-on-android?rq=1">This SO post</a> has several suggestions to improve audio latency on Anrdoid. Of particular interest are points 3, 4 and 5 in the accepted answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check whether the current Android system is low-latency-enabled</strong> by querying whether <code>hasSystemFeature(FEATURE_AUDIO_LOW_LATENCY)</code> or <code>hasSystemFeature(FEATURE_AUDIO_PRO)</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
