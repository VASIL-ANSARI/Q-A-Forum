<p>That is because in your "looping code" you create a new JTable each time.</p>

<p>Instead you want to create the table once and add data to your TableModel inside the loop. So the structure of your code should be something like:</p>

<pre><code>String[] columnNames = { "Id", "Date", ... };
DefaultTableModel model = new DefaultTableModel(columnNames, 0);

for (...)
{
    ...

    if (matched row found)
    {
        ...

        Object[] row = { val_0, val_1, ...};
        model.addRow( row );
}

JTable table = new JTable( model );
...
</code></pre>
