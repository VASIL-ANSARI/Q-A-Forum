<p>I have managed to fix this.</p>

<p>I created a setup_load_paths.rb a few weeks ago when bundler stopped working for some reason. This meant that the gemfile was being loaded everywhere, except by passenger. This messed up the call to YAML::ENGINE.yamler = "syck" which seems to be what mucked up the saving of the object.</p>

<p>I removed the setup_load_paths and everything is working nicely now.</p>
