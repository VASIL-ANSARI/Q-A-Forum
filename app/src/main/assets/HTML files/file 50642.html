<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it bad to have arguments like bool throwException on public methods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply because it is not the convention of the design guidlines for .NET apps. That does not mean you <em>can't</em> do it, it just means that if you follow design conventions, then other programmers will thank you. Of course, this may not be relevant to your situation - but it might be in future. So get used to it now.</p>

<hr>

<p>For completeness, the right way to do this is to have 2 versions of your method. <code>DoSomething</code> would throw an exception if it doesnt work. <code>TryDoSomething</code> would return a boolean, and <em>not</em> throw an exception if it fails.</p>

<p>Your code would look like</p>

<pre><code>Function TryShapeSelected(ByRef oShape As Object) As Boolean
    'Detect if a shape is selected
    Dim bOk As Boolean
    'Test if shape is selected (using Try Catch if necessary)
    'bOk = True/False     '
    Return bOk
End Function

Function ShapeSelected(ByRef oShape As Object) 
    'Detect if a shape is selected
    'Test if shape is selected (using Try Catch if necessary)    
End Function
</code></pre>
