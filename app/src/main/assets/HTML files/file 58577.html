<p>It sounds like you're looking for pagination. This has more to do with your server than your client. </p>

<p>A typical way to implement pagination, is to have your server accept offset and limit parameters for a collection resource. </p>

<p>So for example, say you had a collection of items on your server that you could retrieve with</p>

<p><code>GET myapi/items</code></p>

<p>You would introduce the offset and limit query parameters to specify which page you wanted out of your collection. </p>

<p><code>GET myapi/items?offset=50&amp;limit=25</code></p>

<p>Then you would program your API client accordingly to make use of the values.</p>

<p>You can roll your own paging mechanism on the server, or you can use something that fits with the language and / or framework you're using, which is probably a better way to go about this (best not to re-invent the wheel). For example, I'm using Spring, so use the paging features of spring-data. </p>
