<p>Google for tests vs. Specs. Some good reads pop up:</p>

</ul>

<p>My opinion is, that specs read more 'natural' and feel more like true specifications of the functionality of the code when compared to mini-test et.al.</p>

<p>Rspec is a good example of a DSL, specifically written to write tests that make sense when read, even for people less technically inclined.</p>

<p>But in the end, use whatever makes you feel more comfortable. A test written is almost always better then no test written, because you feel uncomfortable using the testing framework</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>After rereading your question, you seem to specifically ask about mini-test specs. It is an addition to minitests which adds rspec-like syntax to minitest. Everything above still applies.</p>
