<p>From the page for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb907979(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>EnumerableRowCollection&lt;TRow&gt;</code></a> there 
are several extension methods which specifically take and return an <code>EnumerableRowCollection&lt;TRow&gt;</code> from this I assume that there are <code>DataTable</code> specific implementations for these methods that can not be used when simply using an <code>IEnumerable&lt;DataRow&gt;</code></p>

<p>I also found this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/erickt/archive/2007/11/06/what-is-this-enumerablerowco" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> which states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order for LinqDataView to work without using IQueryable (which we didnât want to do for performance reasons), we have to hold on to the implementation class. As long as are working with a EnumerableRowCollection instance instead of a âsomethingâ which implements IEnumerable we can capture each LINQ operator into a state bag which allows us to recreate the effects of the LINQ query in a DataView.</p>

<p>I had thought that LINQ-To-Objects covered any use of LINQ with IEnumerables and anything else meant IQueryables were used but I guess that is not the case. <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code> also implements <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> but it has <em>many</em> more IQueryable specific extension methods available than <code>DataRowCollection&lt;TRow&gt;</code></p>
