<p>You can try this query in any given SQL Server database:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    name,
    create_date,
    modify_date
FROM sys.procedures
WHERE create_date = '20120927'  
</code></pre>

<p>which lists out the name, the creation and the last modification date - unfortunately, it doesn't record <strong>who</strong> created and/or modified the stored procedure in question.</p>
