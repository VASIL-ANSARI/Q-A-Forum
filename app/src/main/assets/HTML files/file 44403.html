<p>The following should work:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    date_trunc('MONTH', date) as start_date, 
    date_trunc('MONTH', date) + INTERVAL '1 MONTH - 1 day' as end_Date, 
    COUNT(id) AS recordcount 
FROM DEPOSIT_EVENT 
GROUP BY 1,2
</code></pre>

<p>This gets the start of the month and the end of the month for each date, then does a <code>GROUP BY</code> on both of these. I added in the third field <code>recordcount</code> just to show that you could also get a count of records within that time period in the same query.</p>
