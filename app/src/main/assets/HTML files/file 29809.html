<p>As you do not have a newline in your string, python will buffer it. You have to explicitly flush the output after each character like this:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import time

def ScrollingText(s):
     s=str(s)
     for letter in s:
          print(letter, end="")
          sys.stdout.flush()
          time.sleep(.05)
     print("")     # newline at the end
</code></pre>

<p>For better performance, I/O is usually buffered, that is, python will collect the data you print until it can send it out as a large block (this also goes for file I/O by the way). By calling <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.flush" rel="nofollow">flush()</a> on sys.stdout (which is the file object where print writes to by default), you force python to send your data to the operating system (and that will send it to your terminal).</p>
