<p>It's crashing inside the Dalvik VM.  I'm not able to decode the stack trace (private verizon build).  A fault address of 0000000b doesn't sound like a null pointer dereference... maybe a data structure inside the VM got corrupted?</p>

<p>Has this been run on a variety of devices and only this one has a problem?  Do you know if other people with the same device have this issue?  I'm wondering if something got corrupted, and uninstall/reinstall of your app would help.</p>
