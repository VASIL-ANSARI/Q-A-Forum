<p>Your exception is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>NoClassDefFoundError</code>: <strong>Could not initialize class <code>org.hsqldb.Trace</code></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which doesn't mean that it cannot find  the class <code>org.hsqldb.Trace</code> in your classpath, it means that <strong>the class could not be initialized</strong> for some reason. </p>

<p>It generally means that a <code>RuntimeException</code> was thrown while either trying to assign a value to a <strong>static field</strong> or while trying to execute some code in a <strong>static block</strong>.</p>

<p>For example we will get such issue in the next cases:</p>

<pre><code>class Trace {

    static MyClass foo = MyClass.newInstance(); // If it fails while calling newInstance

    static {
        SomeClass.init(); // If it fails while calling SomeClass.init()
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>
