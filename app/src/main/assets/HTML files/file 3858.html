<p>In Ruby, only blocks can be closures, class bodies (as well as module and method bodies) cannot be closures. Or to put it another way: only blocks create a new nested lexical scope, all others (module bodies, class bodies, method bodies and script bodies) create new top-level scopes.</p>

<p>So, you will need a block. Normally, this would mean using some form of <code>eval</code>, but here you can just use <code>define_singleton_method</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>class TestingSingletonMethodsWithVariable
  METHODS = %w(a b c d)

  def initialize(favorite_method)
    METHODS.each do |method_name|
      if favorite_method == method_name
        define_singleton_method method_name do
          puts "#{method_name} its my favorite method"
        end
      else
        define_singleton_method method_name do
          puts "#{method_name} its not my favorite method"
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

t = TestingSingletonMethodsWithVariable.new('b')
t.a
t.b
t.c
t.d
</code></pre>
