<p>Here are a couple of definitions:</p>

<p>1)A tree is called a <b>flow equivalent tree</b> if and only if for each pair of nodes (u, v) maximal flow between these two nodes in a tree is the same as in the original graph(and this implies that the cost of the minimum cut is the same).</p>

<p>2)A tree satisfies a <b>cut property</b> if and only if for each pair of nodes (u, v) the minimum cut in this tree is the same as in the original graph(not just the cost is the same, but two subsets are the same too).</p>

<p>So the question is: What is A Gomory-Hu tree? There are two common definitions:<br>
1)A flow equivalent tree.<br>
2)A flow equivalent tree that satisfies cut property.</p>

<p>Even though it is not documented what definition is used in this library, it seems that they used the first one. So it is only guaranteed that the cost of the cut is the same, not the cut itself. If you need to find the cut itself, you can use <code>maxflow</code> method for a fixed pair of nodes. </p>
