<p>it's work fine for me in my firefox. do you have tried to debug what happen on your side. I have test this code in IE8 + firefox + chrome.  I hope it's will work fine for you.</p>

<p>if this code doesn't work on your side then try </p>

<pre><code>window.location.replace(url)
</code></pre>

<p>as your comment it's look like you have used Anchor so tried this one.</p>

<pre><code>$("#myanchor").click(function(e){
e.preventDefault();

// redirect code here
});
</code></pre>
