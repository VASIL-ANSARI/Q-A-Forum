<p>I'm not familiar with the ajax upload toolkit you mentioned.  But your question doesn't really explain where you're stuck, but what you're trying to accomplish.  You're able to upload to the server, but are you able to return the correct JSON?</p>

<p>Once you get that part working, it looks like that toolkit allows you to set a <code>OnComplete</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>onComplete: function(id, fileName, responseJSON){},
</code></pre>

<p>which would allow you to take the <code>responseJSON</code> and populate your table as you see fit.  For example (albeit not the greatest):</p>

<pre><code>onComplete: function(id, fileName, responseJson){
    $(responseJson).each(function(){    
        $('#yourTable').append('&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + this + &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;')
    });
}
</code></pre>
