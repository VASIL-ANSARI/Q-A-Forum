<p><strong>Rx</strong> stands for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609" rel="nofollow">.NET Reactive Extensions</a>, linked from your <a href="http://tx.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">second link</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Reactive Extensions (Rx)...</p>
  
  <p>...is a library to compose asynchronous and event-based programs using observable collections and LINQ-style query operators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://tx.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Tx</strong></a> seems to be an library written on top of Reactive Extensions, which allow you to query and monitor logs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Query] as if all the events were in a database, except no database is involved, the query happens directly on raw logs/traces or real-time sessions </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your confusion with Java seems to come from searching the web on <code>RXTX</code>, which is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rxtx">serial and parallel communications library for Java</a>, not really relevant to the subject at hand. :-)</p>
