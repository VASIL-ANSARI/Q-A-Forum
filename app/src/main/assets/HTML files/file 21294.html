<p>My guess would be that when they generate child divs, they're generating them with the same ID scheme.  Thus, either of them can generate child divs just fine by itself, but when both of them are included, there is ID collision.  The answer is to modify the child generation code to, for example, include the id of the parent div as the first portion of the id of the child div.</p>

<p>Alternately, if you dont' need them for other portions of the javascript, leave the child div ids out entirely.  In general, I find that it's better to avoid the id attribute in generated nodes, and instead use classes or the like.</p>
