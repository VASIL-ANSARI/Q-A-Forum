<p>Just for fun - but this would work, but only with a datetime datatype in SQL Server: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT CAST((FLOOR(CAST(GETDATE() AS FLOAT))) -0.0006944444 AS DATETIME)
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you yesterday 23:59:00</p>

<p>In SQL Server the DATETIME datatype is internally handled like a float, so by casting it to float and flooring it, it returns the value for datetime wich just contains the date portion. Then I subtract the float number equivalent to a minute and cast it back as a datetime</p>

<p>A more correct way would however properly be to use the appropiate functions, so:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DATEADD(MINUTE, - 1, DATEADD(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, 0, GETDATE()), 0))
</code></pre>

<p>This calculates the current date without time portion and then subtracts one minute.</p>
