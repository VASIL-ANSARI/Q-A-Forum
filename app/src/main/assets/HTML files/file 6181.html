<p>With <code>free</code>. You must first free the memory pointed at by the <code>arr[i]</code> entries, and then finally free the memory pointed at by <code>arr</code> (which holds those entries). You can't do it the other way around, because freeing memory means you may no longer use the values that were in that memory.</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
    free(arr[i]);
}
free(arr);
</code></pre>
