<p>Your background color is getting drawn, unfortunately it is being drawn "under" the gradient background which is why you can't see it. As long as you're only nesting these two tables the simplest solution is probably to just draw your gradient on <code>PdfPTable.BASECANVAS</code> instead of <code>PdfPTable.BACKGROUNDCANVAS</code>.</p>
