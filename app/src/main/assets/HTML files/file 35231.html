<p>Render is used to display a certain view file. You do not need to add a createUrl() before it. Just pass the controller/action you want to render, if you are rendering from a controller often you can just pass the view file name. So</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;render('view', array('model' =&gt; $model)); // here view would be the view file (view.php) that relates to the model instance. 
</code></pre>

<p>The Yii booster widget you are using is asking for a specific url that you can pass as a route. In short, I think you're using render incorrectly. It is used for displaying a view file with a layout.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>createUrl() - Creates a relative URL for the specified action defined in this
  controller.</p>
  
  <p>createAbsoluteUrl() - Creates an absolute URL for the specified action
  defined in this controller.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need createAbsoulteUrl() if you want a full URL.</p>
