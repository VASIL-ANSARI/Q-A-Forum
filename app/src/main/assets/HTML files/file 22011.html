<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft solves the "public key bloat" problem by using a hash of the
  strongly-named assembly's public key. These hashes are referred to as
  public key tokens, and are the low 8 bytes of the SHA1 hash of the
  strongly-named assembly's public key. SHA1 hashes are 160 bit (20
  byte) hashes, and the top 12 bytes of the hash are simply discarded in
  this algorithm.</p>
