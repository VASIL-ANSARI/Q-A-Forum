<p>Dictionary is, by design, inherently unsorted.  If you sort the dictionary values, then convert it back to a Dictionary, you'll end up with an unsorted collection again.  </p>

<p>That being said, the error is occuring because you're trying to call <code>OrderBy</code> with a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3fcwy8h6.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>KeyCollection</code></a>, which isn't a sortable type.</p>

<p>You may want to consider some other collection, such as a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7fta44c.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>SortedDictionary&lt;T,U&gt;</code></a>.  This will require writing a custom comparer to maintain the sort, however.</p>
