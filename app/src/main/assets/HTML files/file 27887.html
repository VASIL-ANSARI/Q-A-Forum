<p>I don't think there is one function to do this, so you'll have to write your own. I'd recommend chopping off the start of the string first and then using <code>truncate</code> to handle the end. Something like this might do what you want:</p>

<pre><code>def truncate_beginning_and_end(str, beginning, length, separator)
  first_space_before_beginning = str[0..beginning].rindex(separator)
  str_without_beginning = str[(first_space_before_beginning + 1)..-1]
  truncate(str_without_beginning, length: length, separator: separator, omission: '')
end
</code></pre>
