<p>Not quite enough information to really give you a good answer... but the white line on the top and left of the page sound like the natural margin appended to the body tag.  If you add this to your css it should remove that:</p>

<pre><code>body {
margin: 0px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the background image "reaching the sides" will be primarily dependent on the image's dimensions relative to the viewing screen resolution and browser size.  These factors are out of your control so be cautious where you're using an image in the background of your designs.</p>
