<p>Your <code>&lt;Name&gt;</code> element node contains two child nodes: a text node and a CDATA node.</p>

<p>The <code>Value</code> of an element node is all values of its child nodes concatenated.</p>

<p>If you want the value of the text node, you need to get the <code>Value</code> of the text node, not the element.</p>

<p>Note that it's quite unusual to distinguish between text nodes and CDATA nodes when reading an XML file. The author of the file should be able to use whichever they like.</p>
