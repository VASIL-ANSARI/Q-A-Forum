<p>In case anyone has the same problem and comes across this, I figured out a solution simply by subclassing UIButton. Then, I just modified layoutSubviews so that the titleLabel bounds equaled the button's subviews, and it no longer cut off the top part of the font. Not sure if it's the best way, but it works.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)layoutSubviews
{
    [super layoutSubviews];
    self.titleLabel.bounds = self.bounds;
}
</code></pre>
