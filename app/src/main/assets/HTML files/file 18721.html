  <p>how does pGuess know to get its value from playerGuess</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't. The value of <code>playerGuess</code> is given <em>to</em> the function by the function call, not taken from the variable by the function.</p>

<p><code>guess(playerGuess)</code> means "Call the guess function. Pass the value of <code>playerGuess</code> as the first argument.</p>

<p><code>function guess(pGuess){</code> means "This is the guess function. Assign the value of the first argument to the local <code>pGuess</code> variable when it is called".</p>
