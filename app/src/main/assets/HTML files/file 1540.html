<p>I highly doubt the problem is in the code you posted. You'd need to show us the rest of the class. However some hints:</p>

<p>a) may happen due to alignment (no, it shouldn't do it at both places the same, read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment" rel="nofollow">data alignment</a>)</p>

<p>b) may happen if you pass a pointer of this structure to some GL calls that expect some kind of ordered alignment</p>
