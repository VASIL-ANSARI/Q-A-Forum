<p>You don't have three categories listed in your example.</p>

<p>I presume there is another column called catC?</p>

<p>Anywho, if you want your records with the highest number of "categories" in the beginning of the result set. You can accomplish that like so </p>

<pre><code>Order by convert(case when catA=1 then 1 else 0 end, int) + convert(case when catB=1 then 1 else 0 end, int) + convert(case when catC=1 then 1 else 0 end, int) desc
</code></pre>

<p>However there is probably a better way to structure your table than catA, catB, and catC for a category based table.</p>
