<p>The problem is that children elements do NOT rotate WITH "transform: none;" property or WITHOUT it.</p>

<p>The parent element is rotated, so unrotated child seems to be rotated too. </p>

<p>So your possible solutions may be: </p>

<ol>
<li>inverse children element rotation (for ex, if the parent has
rotate(45deg), then child must have rotate(-45deg) )</li>
<li>Use absolute position, so that children overlaid their parents, but were
not contained in them</li>
</ol>
