<p>Yum is broken because a python problem.  You can use the rpm utility to reinstall python, or to manually install zlib-devel.</p>

<p>Yum ins't a requirement for installing packages.  It just makes it more convenient.  You can manually download any rpm package for CentOS.  I prefer to find what I need using <a href="http://rpm.pbone.net" rel="nofollow">this search engine</a>.</p>

<pre><code># Find a download url for zlib-devel rpm on rpm.pbone.net for
# centos6 and download to your server:
wget ftp://ftp.pbone.net/mirror/ftp.centos.org/6.8/os/x86_64/Packages/zlib-devel-1.2.3-29.el6.x86_64.rpm

# Install the rpm package
rpm -i ./zlib-devel-1.2.3-29.el6.x86_64.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, you may be told you are missing dependencies.  Yum handles that for you automatically.  But yum is broken :-(  So download each of those dependency packages and install them the same way.  Then try to install zlib-devel again.</p>

<p>You can re-install the python rpm package as well, using rpm from the command line.  Check which python version is on your server using <code>rpm -q python</code> or some variation.  Then download the rpm package for python, and installing it manually.    </p>
