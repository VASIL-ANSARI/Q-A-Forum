<p>You should just have the one instance. If you call play() and then call it again before the first call has finished playing, it doesn't stop the first one - both sounds will now be playing. You can call play() as many times as you like.</p>

<p>The id that play() returns is used to identify the instance of the sound that is playing, so it will be different for every call to play(). You can then use the id in other methods (like stop() for example) to control just that one instance of the sound.</p>
