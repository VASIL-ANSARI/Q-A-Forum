<p><strong>Following solution if you want to run them in your browser, not just with php.exe</strong></p>

<p>You can define a new host in your hosts file, e.g. test.intern for your localhost, than in your apache httpd.conf set up a virtual host (with e.g. your desktop as destination), and you can run your php file in your browser with your new host as url:</p>

<pre><code>test.intern/yourPhpFile.php
</code></pre>

<p>Detailed manual you can find here:</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> Starting it with doubleclick may be a little tricky, but I just found a solution here: <a href="http://forum.wampserver.com/read.php?2,62530,112860" rel="nofollow">http://forum.wampserver.com/read.php?2,62530,112860</a></p>

<p>They do it by creating a shortcut from their browser on their desktop, and add some startparameters to it, so that it directly navigates to <code>host/youPhpFile.php</code>, but I don't think you really want to do this.</p>
