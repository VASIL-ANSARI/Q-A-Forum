<p>Imagick needs to be activated in your php.ini file and in your case you need the correct imagick.dll file to go with it.
This can be a frustrating business as you need the correct .dll to go with the php version and it has to be compiled with the correct version of something - can not remember exactly what now.</p>

<p>It is also not very well supported and I find very frustrating to use. I recomend you stick with exec( ) and the command line.</p>
