<p>I'm not sure I fully understand the problem, but two patterns are best practices:</p>

<ol>
<li>Always go through a controller, which fills the model, stores it in the request, and dispatches to a view which displays the data in the model. That's the MVC pattern</li>
<li>Always redirect after a successful non-idempotent request (i.e. a POST, if you respect the HTTP protocol). That's the post-redirect-get pattern.</li>
</ol>

<p>So what it means is that you should have:</p>

<ul>
<li>request 1 goes to a servlet. </li>
<li>servlet gets data to be displayed in the form and stores it in the request, then forwards to the JSP</li>
<li>the JSP displays the form</li>
<li>the form is submitted to a servlet (request 2)</li>
<li>servlet stores the data in the database, which generates an ID for the created data</li>
<li>servlet redirects to a URL like <code>/product?id=&lt;generatedId&gt;</code> or <code>/product/&lt;generatedId&gt;</code></li>
<li>browser sends a request to this URL (request 3). This request goes to a servlet</li>
<li>servlet gets the data identified by the ID, from the database. It stores the data into the request, and forwards to a JSP</li>
<li>the JSP displays the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, you could choose to redirect to some other page, like the list of products for example. </p>

<p>If what bothers you is to use the request to store data when forwarding from the servlet to the JSP, then that shouldn't bother you: it's the only clean way to do it. The data will be scoped to the request only, and be garbage-collected when the request has been processed.</p>
