<p>You can cast ContextMenuInfo to AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo for ListView than change its content accessing to adapter (your own implementation).</p>

<pre><code>AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo contextMenuInfo = (AdapterView.AdapterContextMenuInfo)menuInfo;
        MyAdapter adapter = (MyAdapter)getListView().getAdapter();
adapter.remove(contextMenuInfo.position);
</code></pre>
