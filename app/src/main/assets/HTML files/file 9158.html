<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'd write your query this way, for readability:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT distinct(watchedItems.id)
FROM globalItems INNER JOIN
     watchedItems ON globalItems.aid = watchedItems.aid LEFT JOIN
     bidGroups ON bidGroups.bidGroupID = watchedItems.bidGroupID
WHERE
    watchedItems.processRunning = 0
AND (watchedItems.bidGroupID IS NULL
     OR (watchedItems.bidGroupID IS NOT NULL
     AND bidGroups.bidGroupQty &gt; 0)
);
</code></pre>

<p>The answer to whether you need to check <code>watchedItems.bigGroupID IS NOT NULL</code> is <strong>no</strong>, you do not have to as the join condition already covers that.</p>
