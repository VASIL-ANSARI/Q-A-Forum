<p>Your layout seems ok to me. I'd try replacing the <code>ToggleButton</code> for another <code>ImageButton</code>, just to make sure android does not add some padding automatically as it does with <code>CheckBoxes</code>. Also, double check that neither <code>player_shuffle_on</code> nor <code>player_shuffle_off</code> pngs have been accidentally saved with a transparent padding.</p>

<p>By the way, there's no need for two <code>LinearLayouts</code>, you can have just one horizontal <code>LinearLayout</code> as your root view.</p>
