<p>IE 7 and 8 do not properly support CSS media queries: <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=media" rel="nofollow">http://caniuse.com/#search=media</a></p>

<p>I do see you note that you are using respond.js to get around this limitation.  But as @sdcr pointed out above, this file is missing from the requested path.   </p>

<p>I also note the following error on your linked page: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uncaught Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery</p>
  
  <p>bootstrap.min.js:6 (anonymous function)</p>
</blockquote>
