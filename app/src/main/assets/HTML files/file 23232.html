<p>The thing to remember is objects are passed by reference so when you are reassigning values to a reference it only will destroy the object is there are no other references to it. </p>

<p>The new operation resolves before the assignment in each of these cases so a reference is maintained to the component throughout the chain, the reference that exists within each of the newly created objects.</p>
