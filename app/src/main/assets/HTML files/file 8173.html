<p>You can't write XSLT code that tests if something has been clicked because the XSLT code runs to completion before the user gets a chance to click anything. You need to write XSLT code to generate HTML/Javascript code that responds to what is clicked. The best way of tackling this is to write an HTML/Javascript page that does what you want by hand; then you know what the output of your XSLT transformation needs to be. And it's much easier to write a program if you know what you want its output to be!</p>
