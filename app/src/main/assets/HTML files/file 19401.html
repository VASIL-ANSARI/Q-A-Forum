<p>I would suggest using a sub-query, and then selecting from that query. With the outer select, you order by the number of employees and then limit it to <code>1</code>. This will give you the <em>top</em> department, but also has the flexibility to be modified to give you a list of the <code>x</code>-number of top departments.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Dep_Name FROM (
    SELECT
        d.Dep_Name, COUNT(*) AS `count`
    FROM
        Departments d
        JOIN Employees e ON e.Dep_id = d.Dep_id
    GROUP BY
        d.Dep_id
) AS q

ORDER BY `count` DESC
LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Per a comment by @Dems, you can actually handle this <em>without</em> a sub-query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    d.Dep_Name
FROM
    Departments d
    JOIN Employees e ON e.Dep_id = d.Dep_id
GROUP BY
    d.Dep_id
ORDER BY
    COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1
</code></pre>
