<p>You're calling <code>accept</code> before starting the threads. <code>accept</code> will block until a connection is made, so that's why you're seeing the behavior you do. If you want to listen on multiple ports, you will need to[1] create a thread for each <code>ServerSocket</code> and then either start a communication thread when the <code>accept</code> returns or process the connections one by one in the thread doing the listening.</p>

<p>[1] This applies only if you are using <code>ServerSocket</code> directly, which you probably should be using while learning. The <code>java.nio</code> package and its subpackages contain classes for use with multiplexing non-blocking I/O that can be used to, e.g., listen on multiple sockets in the same thread.</p>
