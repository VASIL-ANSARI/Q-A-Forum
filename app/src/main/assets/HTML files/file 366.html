<p>Quoted printable expands 8 bit characters to "={HEX-Code}", thus making the messages longer. Maybe you are just hitting this limit?</p>

<p>Have you tried to break the message at, say, 70 characters? That should provide space for a couple of characters per line.</p>

<p>Or you just encode the email with Base64 - all mail client can handle that.</p>

<p>Or you just set Content-Transfer-Encoding to 8bit and send the data unencoded. I know of no mail server unable to handle 8bit bytes these days.</p>
