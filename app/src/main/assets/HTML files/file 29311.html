<p>It is not the private method of <code>Object</code> that is called but the module method in <code>Kernel</code>. You can check which method is called with <code>set_trace_func</code> as described in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9453985/30344">answer to a similar question</a>:</p>

<pre><code>irb(main):001:1&gt; set_trace_func proc { |event, file, line, id, binding, classname|   printf "%8s %s:%-2d %10s %8s\n", event, file, line, id, classname if id.to_s == 'method_missing' }
=&gt; #&lt;Proc:0x0423d278@(irb):1&gt;
irb(main):002:0&gt; Object.method_missing :test
c-call (irb):4  method_missing   Kernel
c-return (irb):4  method_missing   Kernel
NoMethodError: undefined method `test' for Object:Class
    from (irb):4
    from :0
</code></pre>

<p>As some commenters pointed out in MRIs newer than 1.8.7 this behaviour has changed: <code>method_missing</code> has been removed from <code>Kernel</code> and the private instance method from <code>Object</code> was moved to <code>BasicObject</code> which is the new superclass.</p>
