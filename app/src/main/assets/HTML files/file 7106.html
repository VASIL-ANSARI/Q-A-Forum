<p>How about you generate an array (1,2,3,4,5,6,...) and sort it randomly, then read the array elements one at a time.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you use a random number generator and make sure it only gives you numbers you haven't seen before, you can only call it a limited number of times.</p>

<p><em>sorting randomly</em> will depend on what language you're using.</p>
