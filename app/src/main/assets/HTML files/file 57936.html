<p>You build the other project as a normal rails project.  The thing to understand about Rails 5 api mode is that you cannot have normal html stuff as part of it.  The entire rendering pipeline (assets and such) is missing.  Rails 5 api mode is fast because big parts of the environment are just plain gone.</p>

<p>What you want to do is have 2 projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>admin</li>
<li>api</li>
</ul>

<p>And figure out a way to share your model logic across them.  </p>

<p>If you use devise for authentication this is particularly tricky since devise adds things into your user model that you cannot have in an api project.  Here's how I got around it:</p>

<pre class="lang-rb prettyprint-override"><code>If Rails.application.class.parent_name == "admin"
  # devise crap goes here
end
</code></pre>

<p>How exactly you easily share a directory of models across 2 git repos?  I have no good answer.  I have a rake task which sync's things manually by copying them from the canonical source to the destination but that's a hack.</p>
