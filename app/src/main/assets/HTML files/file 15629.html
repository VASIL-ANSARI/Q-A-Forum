<p>What data types are being passed around?</p>

<p>Based on your previous question, the data type you are using in Oracle is a <code>DATE</code>.  An Oracle <code>DATE</code> does not have a time zone associated with it.  Unless you are storing a time zone in a separate column that you're not mentioning, that implies that somewhere else in the stack, a <code>DATE</code> is being read from Oracle (or written to Oracle) with a time zone implied.  Whatever component of the stack is implying a time zone would then be the culprit.</p>

<p>From an Oracle perspective, the best option is to use a <code>TIMESTAMP WITH [LOCAL] TIME ZONE</code> data type so that Oracle knows the time zone.  You can then in PL/SQL convert a timestamp in one time zone to a timestamp in another time zone.  So you could always get the data in IST or always in GMT/UTC or always in Us/Eastern.  </p>
