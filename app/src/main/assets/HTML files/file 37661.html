<p>You can use technique explained in this thread : <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/407729/determine-if-a-sequence-contains-all-elements-of-another-sequence-using-linq">Determine if a sequence contains all elements of another sequence using Linq</a></p>

<p>Use the same to check if list of <code>&lt;record&gt;</code>'s child contain all criteria you want to check. Implementation in your case is about like this :</p>

<pre><code>var criteriaArray = new string[]{ "abc", "xyz" };
var filteredData = 
        from c in Busnumber.Descendants("record")
        where !criteriaArray.Except(c.Elements().Select(o =&gt; (string)o))
                            .Any() 
        select new
        {
           Busnumber = (string)c.Element("Busnumber")
        };
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to change where clause to check only child elements starting with "st" :</p>

<pre><code>where !criteriaArray.Except(c.Elements()
                             .Where(o =&gt; o.Name.LocalName.StartsWith("st"))
                             .Select(o =&gt; (string)o))
                    .Any() 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE :</strong></p>

<p>I'll try to explain, I assumed you already carefully read the question I linked above. This snippet <code>subset.Except(superset).Any()</code> checks if subset contains element that isn't contained in superset.</p>

<p>So this one <code>!subset.Except(superset).Any()</code> checks if subset doesn't contain element that isn't contained in superset. In other words, subset only contain elements that is also contained in superset. In different words, superset contains all element of subset. So this is what you want; check if child of record node (the superset) contains all member of criteriaArray (the subset).</p>
