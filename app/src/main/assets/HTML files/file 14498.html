<p>According to the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/test/mock/MockContext.html" rel="nofollow">API</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A mock Context class. All methods are non-functional and throw UnsupportedOperationException. You can use this to inject other dependencies, mocks, or monitors into the classes you are testing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to extend MockContext and write the corresponding method implementation if you want to use that method.</p>
