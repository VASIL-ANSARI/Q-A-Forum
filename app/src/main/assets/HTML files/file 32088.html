<p>Pack your sublists into a list of lists, and unpack them using the "splat" operator <code>*</code>.  This will allow you to iterate as many loops as you need at only one level of nesting.  </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; B = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&gt;&gt;&gt; mylists = [A, B]
&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import product
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in product(*mylists):
...     print x
(1, 'a')
(1, 'b')
(1, 'c')
(2, 'a')
(2, 'b')
(2, 'c')
(3, 'a')
(3, 'b')
(3, 'c')
</code></pre>
