<p>You can't access a full path like that, the interpolation only goes one level deep. You can do something like this though:</p>

<pre><code>$obj_access = $obj;
foreach($obj_path as $path_item)
{
   $obj_access = $obj_access-&gt;$path_item;
}
var_dump($obj_access); // Display object images
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at your JSON though, I don't think this will help fix whatever problem it is you are trying to solve however.</p>
