<p>While I don't think this is a bad idea, one alternative would be to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1zk39146.aspx" rel="nofollow">Rectangles</a> and have an onclick function consisting of a series of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/22t27w02.aspx" rel="nofollow">Rectangle.Contains(Point)</a> to find out if the point clicked by the mouse is contained in any of the clickable areas.</p>

<p>E.G.</p>

<pre><code>Rectangle R1 = new Rectangle(/*Passed Variables*/);
Rectangle R2 = new Rectangle(/*Passed Variables*/);
//...
OnClick(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
 {
 If (R1.Contains(e.Location))
  {
   //Stuff
  }
 else
 {
  If (R2.Contains(e.Location))
   {
    //Stuff
   }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a larger list of Rectangle objects, though, you could always use an array of Rectangles and a for loop for a more efficient way of checking if the clicked location is inside any Rectangle.</p>
