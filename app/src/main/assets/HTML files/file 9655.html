<p>There have been a lot of structural changes in rubygems that has caught a lot of people by surprise. It has introduced incompatibility problems with a number of common applications and frameworks.</p>

<p>You may need to roll back to a version of rubygems that works with your system, such as 1.6.0:</p>

<pre><code>gem update --system 1.6.0
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, you may want to investigate <a href="http://gnuu.org/2011/06/01/slimgems-a-drop-in-replacement-for-rubygems/">slimgems</a> which is a 1.3.7 fork of rubygems that is intended to remedy these compatibility issues.</p>
