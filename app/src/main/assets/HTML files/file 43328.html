<p>The problem here is that you've defined <code>T</code> twice.  You've made both the class and the method generic, and given both of them a generic argument with the same name.  </p>

<p>Your field is defined outside the method, and as such <code>T</code> in that context only refers to the <code>T</code> declared as the class' generic argument.</p>

<p>The parameter <code>value</code> is declared in a location where the method's generic argument is in scope, and since that method's <code>T</code> is "closer" than the <code>T</code> declared at the class level, it "wins" when trying to resolve the type of that variable.</p>

<p>So now you have a parameter of type <code>T</code>, and a <code>Dicitonary&lt;T, T&gt;</code>, and yet <em>the type of that parameter is still different from the generic arguments of the dictionary</em>.</p>

<p>And easy way to make this clear would be to go to either generic argument and use visual studio's "rename" feature to rename the type (to just <code>T2</code> or something) and you'll see which <code>T</code>'s change and which don't.  After doing this the error message will also make sense as these different types will actually be displayed differently in the error message.</p>

<p>As for a fix, just make the method not be generic.</p>
