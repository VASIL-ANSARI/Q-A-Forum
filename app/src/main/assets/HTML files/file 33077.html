<p>You can simply make sure it's in the page source before using any of the methods above.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>str1 = 'id="'+some_id+'"'
str2 = "id='"+some_id+"'"
page_source = driver.page_source
if str1 in page_source or str2 in page_source:
    try:
        my_var = driver.find_element_by_id(some_id)
        # do the action
    except:
        # do something else
</code></pre>

<p>This should significantly reduce the number of times that you attempt to find an element which is not in the DOM (false-negative). Of course, if the element is dynamically added to the DOM on the client side (using Javascript), then you might revoke an attempt to find it when it's actually there (false-positive).</p>

<p>So you should make a careful inspection of the web-page before you choose to apply this method...</p>
