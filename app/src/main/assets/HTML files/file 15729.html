<p>Since holding a system service object has very little ongoing cost, I recommend holding onto it in a data member. Whether you get one in <code>onCreate()</code> or lazy-initialize it if/when needed is up to you.</p>

<p>Note that <em>using</em> a system service object may have significant costs. Holding a <code>LocationManager</code> instance is cheap; using GPS (e.g., via <code>requestLocationUpdates()</code>) is not cheap.</p>
