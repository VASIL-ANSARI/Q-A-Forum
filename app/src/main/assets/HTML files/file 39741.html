<p>Both the <code>Activity</code> and <code>View</code> class implement the <code>KeyEvent.Callback</code> interface which methods you can use to handle keyboard actions. When you'll catch particular key event use <code>HorizontalScrollView#executeKeyEvent</code>. You can call this function yourself to have the scroll view perform scrolling from a key event, just as if the event had been dispatched to it by the view hierarchy.</p>
