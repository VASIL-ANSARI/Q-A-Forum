<p>My first comment would be to avoid using JavaScript to change the angle brackets. Bypassing this is as simple as disabling JavaScript in the browser. Almost all server-side languages have some utility method that converts some HTML characters into their entity counterparts. For instance, PHP uses htmlentities(), and I am sure .NET has an equivalent utility method. In the least, you can do a regex replace for angle brackets, parenthesis and double quotes, and that will get you a long way toward a secure solution.</p>
