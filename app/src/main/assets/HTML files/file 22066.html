<p>It looks like you're accessing the images array at indexes 0..200, but it contains only three elements.  Either set <code>numberOfViews = 3;</code>, or index into the array like this:</p>

<pre><code>ImageView.image = images[i%3];
</code></pre>

<p>The modulo index will cause you to add each of the three images in a repeating sequence and still let you test with a larger number of scrollView subviews.  I doubt that your crash is about memory with only 200 images, unless they are super-huge ones.</p>
