<p>You should consider Custom Post Types (<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types" rel="nofollow">http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types</a>).</p>

<p>In this case, you could create a new type : country, that contains the post title (Name of country) and you could add 2 custom fields : population (text field), and flag (image field).</p>

<p>Then, you could add as many countries as you want, just like Posts.</p>
