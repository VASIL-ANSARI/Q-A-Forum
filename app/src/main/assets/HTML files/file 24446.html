<p>Use <code>.stop()</code> method before every animate method. If it is called on an element, the currently-running animation (if any) is immediately stopped.</p>

<p>See the work <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/wG4Pp/" rel="nofollow">Fiddle</a> here.</p>

<p>For better optimised code, Try removing <code>.stop()</code> and see where it get messed up and leave where it required. I have added <code>.stop</code> before animation method for the sake of easiness. </p>
