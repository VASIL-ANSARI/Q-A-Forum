<p>The <code>do...while</code> block generates a point in the square with corners (&pm;1, &pm;1) until the point fits into a circle of radius 1 centered in the origin. The expected number of iterations is the ratio of areas, which is the constant 4 / &pi;, or O(1) in big-O-notation.</p>

<p>As for how the process is related to Gaussian distribution, it's an application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform#Polar_form" rel="nofollow">Box-Muller transform</a>. <a href="http://www.taygeta.com/random/gaussian.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is another page with a bit of explanation which also contains your piece of code.</p>
