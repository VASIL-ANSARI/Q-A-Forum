<p>You can't do this with a <code>WebClient</code>. You will need to manually generate the <code>multipart/form-data</code> request. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3274968/send-multipart-form-data-content-type-request/3275002#3275002">Here's an example</a> which could be easily adapted. You will just need to insert the file contents at the parameter you like. In this example I used a <code>StreamWriter</code> but if your file is binary you would probably want to directly write to the request stream.</p>

<p>The idea is to achieve <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1867.html">RFC 1867</a>. </p>

<p>If you don't want to go this route and those values are not very big you could probably pass the additional parameters at the request string and continue using <code>UploadFile</code> method. Of course the target url must be capable of reading those values from the query string.</p>
