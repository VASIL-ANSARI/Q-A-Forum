<p>The error is coming because your method signature is different than the actual ones. You should use the exact method signature for overriding (Either you should use auto-complete feature provided in Xcode or refer the documentation)</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiresponder/1621142-touchesbegan" rel="nofollow">Touches Began</a>:</p>

<pre><code>override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, 
         with event: UIEvent?)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Swift 3 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621435-supportedinterfaceorientations" rel="nofollow">supportedInterfaceOrientations</a> is no longer a method, it's a computed property, so it's signature becomes:</p>

<pre><code>override var supportedInterfaceOrientations : UIInterfaceOrientationMask
{
}
</code></pre>
