<p>You could use something similar to the <a href="http://redflavor.com/reddit.cf.algorithm.png">Reddit algorithm</a> - the basic principle of which is you compute a value for a post based on the time it was posted and the score. What's neat about the Reddit algorithm is that you only need recompute the value when the score of a post changes. When you want to display your front page, you just get the top n posts from your database based on that score. As time goes on the scores will naturally increase, so you don't have to do any special processing to remove items from the front page.</p>
