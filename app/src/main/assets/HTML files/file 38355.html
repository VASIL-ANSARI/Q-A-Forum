<p>If you want to retain specific date formatting in your <code>_source</code> document, you'll need to pass the date into the <code>.field</code> as a <code>String</code>.  Since you've said the <code>System.out.println()</code> prints it in the format you want, you simply need to change to:</p>

<pre><code>...
   .field("creation_time", date.toString())
...
</code></pre>

<p>In any event internally, ES stores the timestamps in GMT.</p>
