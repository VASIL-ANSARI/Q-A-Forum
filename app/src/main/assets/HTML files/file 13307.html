<p>You will have to use off-screen rendering. <code>libcinder</code> seems to be just a wrapper for <code>OpenGL</code>, as far as graphics go, so you can use <code>OpenGL</code> code to achieve this.</p>

<p>Since <code>OpenGL</code> does not have a native mechanism for off-screen rendering, you'll have to use an extension. A tutorial for using such an extension, called Framebuffer Rendering, can be found <a href="http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_fbo.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You will have to modify <code>renderer.cpp</code> to use this extension's commands.</p>

<p>An alternative to using such an extension is to use <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/" rel="nofollow"><code>Mesa 3D</code></a>, which is an open-source implementation of <code>OpenGL</code>. <code>Mesa</code> has a software rendering engine which allows it to render into memory without using a video card. This means you don't need a video card, but on the other hand the rendering might be slow. <code>Mesa</code> has an example of rendering to a memory buffer at <code>src/osdemos/</code> in the Demos <code>zip</code> file. This solution will probably require you to write a complete <code>Renderer</code> class, similar to <code>Renderer2d</code> and <code>RendererGl</code> which will use <code>Mesa</code>'s intrusctions instead of <code>Windows</code>'s or <code>Mac</code>'s. </p>
