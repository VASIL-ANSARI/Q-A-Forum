<p>Please elaborate your question. If you just need a good container have a look at the STL (Standard Template Library) std::vector. It's part of the C++ standard and comes with your compiler.</p>

<p>If you want to learn how to write a custom class, please try to be more precise in your question.</p>

<p>Also consider the wealth of beginner tutorials available on the net, for example:</p>

<p>Here is a little example on how to write a custom class with one member function calling the other and accessing a private data member (note that inside a member function you can refer to any other member directly):</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Example
{
  private:
    int some_private_stuff;

  public:
    Example();
    void function_a();
    void function_b();
};

Example::Example(){
  some_private_stuff = 1;
}


void Example::function_a(){
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "this is function a" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  some_private_stuff = 2;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "changed private_stuff to " &lt;&lt; some_private_stuff &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

void Example::function_b(){
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "this is function b" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  function_a();
}

int main() {
  Example e;
  e.function_b();
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
