<p>Your co-worker is incorrect when they assert that your method is creating a new data structure.</p>

<p>If you look at the API for <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#asList-T...-"><code>Arrays.asList()</code></a>, it says that it</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns a fixed-size list <strong>backed by the specified array.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no reason to write your own code to iterate over the array when you can just wrap a <code>List</code> around it, and use its built-in methods.</p>
