<p>Your array</p>

<pre><code>char** myArray;
</code></pre>

<p>is not really an array. It is a pointer. Until you assign it, it points nowhere. Any dereferences of it produce undefined behavior.</p>

<p>Dereferencing the undefined pointer is precisely what you do here:</p>

<pre><code>myArray[0] = (char*)"Foo";
</code></pre>

<p>Since the pointer does not point to a valid block of memory, this does not work. What you need to do to make it work is assign <code>myArray</code> first. For example, you could do it with <code>malloc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>char** myArray = malloc(2 * sizeof(char*));
</code></pre>

<p>Your code is going to work now. In order to avoid memory leaks, add <code>free(myArray)</code> to the end of <code>doStuff</code> function.</p>
