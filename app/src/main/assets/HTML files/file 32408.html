<p>I tested this out, and no, the variables are the same. The example also compiles for me.</p>

<p>The error is here:</p>

<p>Your while loop goes on, as long as !stopReq is true, that means stopReq is false.
And after 1 sec you set stopReq to false - this changes nothing. If you set it to true, !stopReq will become false and your loop will end.</p>
