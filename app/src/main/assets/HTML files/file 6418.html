<p><code>count</code> is part of the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/AssociativeContainer.html">associative container requirements</a><sup>(1)</sup>.  </p>

<p>Every associative container is required to provide it as part of its interface, even if the result is always zero or one as is the case with <code>std::set</code>.</p>
