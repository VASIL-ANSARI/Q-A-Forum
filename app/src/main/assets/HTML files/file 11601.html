<p>I would not do that if the program files you update on the client machine are often or continuously running -in particular if they are server or daemon programs.</p>

<p>On Linux distributions, the package manager (i.e. <code>dpkg</code> on Debian) does a good job for upgrading programs (even for daemons). Can't you use it?</p>

<p>Writing inside a running program binary is error-prone.</p>
