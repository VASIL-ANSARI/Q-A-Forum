<p>So, I've Added 1200 Objects to a start scene And at firts start(right Profiler) there were working separate small scripts, at second start(left Prifiler) was working big script... </p>

<p>Result: </p>

<ul>
<li>Some simple scripts - 23.03ms (standalone) latency</li>
<li>Large script - 23.6ms (standalone) latency

</ul>

<p>Result: </p>

<ul>
<li>Some simple scripts - 63ms(android) latency</li>
<li>Large script - 67ms (android) latency

</ul>

<p>Difference is 4ms at 1200Objects. </p>

<p>For my game As I see - difference in performance is not the reason to wory about, because at my game scene there will be maximum 50 objects.</p>
