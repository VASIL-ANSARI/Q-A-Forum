<p>On your example.</p>

<p>The array is not an array of characters, it is an array of strings.</p>

<p>Well, actually, a string is an array of characters.</p>

<pre><code>//Let's say:
string s = "This is a string.";
//Therefore:
s[0] = T
s[1] = h
s[2] = i
s[3] = s
</code></pre>

<p>But based on your example,</p>

<p>I think you want to Split the text. (with SPACE as delimeter).</p>

<p>You can use the Split function of the String.</p>

<pre><code>string s = "This is a string.";
string[] words = s.Split(' ');
//Therefore:
words[0] = This
words[1] = is
words[2] = a
words[3] = string.
</code></pre>
