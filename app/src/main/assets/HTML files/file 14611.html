<p>Perhaps you could break up the web service class into <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/071509-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">partial classes</a> - this would at least allow you to break up this big service into smaller parts. Aim for each partial to have a single responsibility.</p>

<p>You could also refactor the service so that the service endpoint contains just the 80 web methods but all the code that each function used to contain is now encapsulated in an appropriate class</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<pre><code>public myWethodToLogSomething(string something)
{
  //connect to db
  //save, do something
  //close connection
}
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>public myWethodToLogSomething(string something)
{
  //move all the code out of the web service itself
  LogClass.Log(string)
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the 80 webmethods are just stubs for calls to the classes that do the work = each class is manageable and you don't break the service contract with your clients.</p>
