<p>I think you can guess who i'm(from my nickname)</p>

<p>the o_engine_get_factory, o_engine_get_storage ,o_database_operation_context </p>

<p>are three different concept:</p>

<p>o_engine_get_factory: is the "connection factory" based on the protocol you use, now is just supported the orient "remote"</p>

<p>o_engine_get_storage: is the factory for the o_storage that is the low level interface for an orient db instance.</p>

<p>o_datebase_operation_context: is the high level interface with the database, is used for manage the documents and client side transaction!</p>

<p>the actual implementation of the protocol is inside the o_storage_remote.c and o_query_engine_remote.c and i think you have to have a look to the second one to try to discover something about the problem!</p>

<p>what you test can you give some code example so i can reproduce/debug !!</p>

<p>tnks bye</p>
