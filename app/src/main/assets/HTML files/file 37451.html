<p>There is no concept of position in a Stack, you have only the <em>top</em> of the Stack (also called the head). If you wish to view a Stack where the elements are numbered similar to an array that is fine, you just have to remember that the only element you can interact with directly is the head. </p>

<p>Example: here is a Stack that contains 4 elements </p>

<pre><code>0 | A | // head
1 | B | 
2 | C |
3 | D |
   --- 
</code></pre>

<p>You can typically perform three operations on a Stack: push(), pop(), and peek(). push() takes a value that becomes the new head of the Stack: push(5) would place the element 5 on top of the Stack. pop() removes the top element of the Stack: pop() would remove the previously added element 5 from the Stack. peek() looks at the value on top of the Stack without removing it. For the below operation, you only need push() and pop().</p>

<p>If you wanted to delete the element at position 2, you would have to move the elements at positions 0 and 1 to some temporary storage (ideally another stack), remove the element at position 2, then move the elements from positions 0 and 1 back onto the top of the Stack. </p>
