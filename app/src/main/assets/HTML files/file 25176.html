<p>I would need to double check your view code, but it looks like the file input for the upload is probably called <strong>ReceiptImage</strong> - if so that will be reset on the submit when MVC does its Model update magic. AFAIK the file upload doesn't need to be the field name of the image, try setting the Id of the file input control to something different and see if it overwrites the value still.</p>
