<p>for the same reason UIView is subclassed with controls and text layout views in UIKit: because the existing implementations don't do <em>everything</em>, and custom implementation or members are needed (at times).</p>

<p>however, you might subclass UILabel in this case, if you needed to do something specific, or reuse an implementation and subclassing were a good solution.</p>
