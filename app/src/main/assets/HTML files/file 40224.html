<p>You might consider uploading directly from the client to S3 via Ajax. This would nearly completely take your server out of the mix.</p>

<p>This is a well documented concept elsewhere online.</p>

<p>Amazon S3 now has notifications for newly created objects.</p>

<p>You could drop the upload notifications into an Amazon SQS queue. You could then use a gem like Fog to create a background worker to pull events off the queue to create or update records in the database to reflect the newly completed upload.</p>

<p>Regardless of the solution, if you're uploading big files, it's likely your local network's upload speed that is the bottleneck.</p>
