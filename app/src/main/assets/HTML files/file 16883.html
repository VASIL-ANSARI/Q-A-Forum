<p>There is a very simple and well known RNG algorithm, "Multiply-with-Carry", that could be easily implemented on all platforms that I know of. It has the properties that you are requesting; it is up to you to decide whether it's randomness would be adequate.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation#Computational_methods" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An example of a simple pseudo-random number generator is the Multiply-with-carry method invented by George Marsaglia. It is computationally fast and has good (albeit not cryptographically strong) randomness properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is the dead-simple implementation in C#, which you will have no trouble adapting to other languages:</p>

<pre><code>static int m_w = 1337;      // Choose initialization value, must not be zero
static int m_z = 123123;    // Choose initialization value, must not be zero

int GetRandom() 
{
    m_z = 36969 * (m_z &amp; 65535) + (m_z &gt;&gt; 16);
    m_w = 18000 * (m_w &amp; 65535) + (m_w &gt;&gt; 16);
    return (m_z &lt;&lt; 16) + m_w;  /* 32-bit result */
}
</code></pre>

<p>The initial values of m_w and m_z is the seed.</p>
