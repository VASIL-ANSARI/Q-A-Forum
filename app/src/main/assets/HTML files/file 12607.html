<p>Based on two other questions, namely <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1693011/how-to-determine-return-address-on-stack">How to determine return address on stack?</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4390659/c-return-address-of-function-mac">C: return address of function (mac)</a>, i'm confident that you are not overwriting the correct address. This is basically caused due to your assumption, that the return address can be determined in the way you did it. But as the answer to thefirst question (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1693011/how-to-determine-return-address-on-stack">1</a>) states, this must not be the case.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check if the address is really correct</li>
<li>Find a way for determining the correct return address, if you do not want to use the builtin GCC feature</li>
</ol>
