<p>You need to escape your quotes <em>inside</em> your quoted echo'd statement, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    echo "&lt;form action='?tab=4' name='toedit5' method='get'&gt;";
    echo "&lt;input value='text' onblur='edit(\"toedit5\")' /&gt;"; // escaped..!
    echo "&lt;/form&gt;";
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It helped me to think about it like this when I was starting out: how does your browser know if the second single quote in <code>onblur='edit('toedit5')'</code> is closing your <code>onblur</code> statement or  opening up the parameter? In this example, your browser will pair up the first 2 quotes it sees and assign that to the <code>onblur</code> attribute, i.e.: <code>onblur='edit('</code> only!</p>

<p>Using the code above, I inspected a quick PHP page I created in Chrome's developer tools and was able to see the following (form available for inspection):</p>
