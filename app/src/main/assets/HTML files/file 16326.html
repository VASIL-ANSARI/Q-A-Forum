<p>Aren't you by any chance saving the image in the UI thread, just right during your onPause() call? If yes, you should move the image saving part into the <code>AsyncTask</code> and provide some kind of boolean flag or mutex to prevent similar AsyncTasks from being started while the previous image is still being saved or when it's already saved.</p>

<p>Be careful with using contexts and internal class data just in case your <code>AsyncTask</code> outlives your other classes and make sure it does not touch anything that does not belong to it.</p>
