<p>The difference between single quotes and backticks is important here. You have quoted your column name instead of using backticks. It should be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table_name_here WHERE `Date` LIKE 'Jan%2014'
</code></pre>

<p>The backtick character (see the <code>Date</code> column in the query above) allows you to indicate it's a name rather than a string. In this case, if you didn't have these, you would get an error because <code>Date</code> is a reserved word. The backtick allows you to use reserved words for table and column names.</p>

<p>Where as the single quote means it's a string. In the case of your query, you were essentially searching for any records where the string <code>'Date'</code> contains the string <code>'January 2014'</code> which isn't possible and will always return zero results.</p>

<p>Your code should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$monthYearString = $month . "%" . $year;
$query_current = "SELECT * FROM {$table_omsaetning} WHERE `Date` LIKE '{$monthYearString}'";
echo $query_current;
</code></pre>
