<p>I realized what I was doing thanks to this article <a href="http://www.itworld.com/development/379646/aspnet-mvc-5-brings-attribute-based-routing" rel="nofollow">http://www.itworld.com/development/379646/aspnet-mvc-5-brings-attribute-based-routing</a>. I was mixing up the order, when I had everything else correct. Then I was missing the param names being identical, when everything else was correct. So I kept having minor issues when trying to find the problem out. I also switched to MVC5's attribute routing, and like it much more. </p>

<p>So this is my code that is now working:</p>

<p>RoutConfig</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();



        routes.MapRoute(
           name: "ProfileRoute",
           url: "Profiles/{userId}",
           defaults: new
           {
               controller = "Profile",
               action = "Index",
           }
       );

        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "Default",
            url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
            defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
        );
</code></pre>

<p>The controller code</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize]
[RoutePrefix("settings")]
[Route("{action=index}")]
public class SettingsController : ZenController
{       
    [Route("{id:int}")]
    public ActionResult Index(int id)
    {


        return View(model);
    }

    [Route("GetSite/{sitename:alpha}")]
    public ActionResult GetSite(string sitename)
    {

        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks again everyone! Happy coding!</p>
