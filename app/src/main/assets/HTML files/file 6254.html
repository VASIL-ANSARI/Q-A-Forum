<p>If you only wish to install rails 2, then specify the version you want when installing the gem</p>

<pre><code>gem install rails-2.3.5
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to maintain different versions of rails, then you probably also want to maintain different versions of ruby. In that case, <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/" rel="nofollow">rvm</a> is your friend.</p>
