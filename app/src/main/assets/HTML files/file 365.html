<p>In Urlmon.dll, there's a function called <code>FindMimeFromData</code>.</p>

<p>From the documentation </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MIME type detection, or "data sniffing," refers to the process of determining an appropriate MIME type from binary data. The final result depends on a combination of server-supplied MIME type headers, file extension, and/or the data itself. Usually, only the first 256 bytes of data are significant. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, read the first (up to) 256 bytes from the file and pass it to <code>FindMimeFromData</code>.</p>
