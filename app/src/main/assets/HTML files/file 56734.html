<p>It isn't very clear, though from the code you posted I see you're attempting to use multiple <code>form</code> tags. Well, while it is possible, ASP.NET WebForms wasn't designed that way. If you insist to use multiple forms then only one of them MUST have the <code>runat="server"</code> attribute. 
But you better switch to other approach, such as <code>asp:UpdatePanel</code> if you need such functionality.</p>
