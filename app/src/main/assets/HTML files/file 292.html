<p>This may not be the best solution but you could set a global boolean variable that would be accessible to both methods that would just specify if the last action was HoverIn or HoverOut. You could use this boolean variable to determine if the code should run or not. </p>

<pre><code>if (bWasHoverIn){
   ...
}
</code></pre>
