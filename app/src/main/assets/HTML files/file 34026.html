<p>Using an OpenFileDialog control to allow the user to select the video from the disc. Insert the control into the form, is called OpenFileDialog.</p>

<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        openFileDialog1.ShowDialog();

        string file = openFileDialog1.FileName;

    }
</code></pre>

<p>You can also add a filter in case you want to search only for certain type of files</p>

<pre><code>openFileDialog1.Filter = "Video Files (.avi)|*.avi|All Files (*.*)|*.*|Music Files (.mp3)|*.mp3";
</code></pre>
