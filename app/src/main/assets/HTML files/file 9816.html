<p>Yes, it is about scope. When the callback gets called, it will be using the last value of <code>i</code> rather than the value of <code>i</code> when you add the listener. The anonymous function that you're building is a closure that captures the <code>i</code> variable without evaluating it, <code>i</code> won't be evaluated until the callback is called and by that time, <code>i</code> will be 3.</p>

<p>The usual closure busting solution should work:</p>

<pre><code>function create_listener(i) {
    return function() {
        console.log(i);
    };
}
//...
google.maps.event.addListener(marker[i], 'mouseover', create_listener(i));
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use a self-executing function instead of a separate <code>create_listener</code> but that might be too noisy.</p>
