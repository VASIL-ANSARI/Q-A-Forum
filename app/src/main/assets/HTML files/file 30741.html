<p>That's not the correct way to use wsgi. WSGI is a standard interface for python applications to manage requests.
You can read about it <a href="http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>I suggest you start out with some framework that will handle this for you, though.
For example <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">django</a></p>
