<p>I think @BrianBall is correct. Rewrite your class so that your list properties are simple getters/setters and initialize the lists in your constructor.</p>

<pre><code>public class ShipmentViewModel
{
  public ShipmentViewModel()
  {
    TrackingNumbers = new List&lt;ShipmentTrackingNumber&gt;();
  }

  public List&lt;ShipmentTrackingNumber&gt; TrackingNumbers { get; set; }
  // and so on
}
</code></pre>
