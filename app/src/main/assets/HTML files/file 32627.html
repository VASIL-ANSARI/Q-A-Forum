<p>If I understand the problem correctly, you have two unit circles centered at <code>(distance, 0)</code> and <code>(-distance, 0)</code> (that is, one is slightly to the right of the origin and one is slightly to the left). You're trying to determine if a given point, <code>(x, y)</code> is within both circles.</p>

<p>The simplest approach might be to simply compute the distance between the point and the center of each of the circles. You've already done this in your previous code, just repeat the computation twice, once with the offset distance inverted, then use <code>and</code> to see if your point is in both circles.</p>

<p>But a more elegant solution would be to notice how your two circles intersect each other exactly on the <code>y</code>-axis. To the right of the axis, the left circle is completely contained within the right one. To the left of the <code>y</code>-axis, the right circle is entirely within the left circle. And since the shape is symmetrical, the two halves are of exactly equal size.</p>

<p>This means you can limit your darts to only hitting on one side of the axis, and then get away with just a single distance test:</p>

<pre><code>def circle_intersection_area(num_darts, distance):
    if distance &gt;= 1:
        return 0

    in_circle = 0
    width = 1-distance   # this is enough to cover half of the target

    for i in range(num_darts):
        x = random.random()*width    # random value from 0 to 1-distance
        y = random.random()*2 - 1    # random value from -1 to 1
        d = math.sqrt((x+distance)**2 + y**2)  # distance from (-distance, 0)
        if d &lt;= 1:
            in_circle += 1

    sample_area = width * 2
    target_area = sample_area * (in_circle / num_darts)

    return target_area * 2 # double, since we were only testing half the target
</code></pre>
