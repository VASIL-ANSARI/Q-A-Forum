<p>I want to konw where your tableâs data come from ? what your method just is save static infomation into database,meanwhile this is the problem of your application modified everyday. if the data in the tables(table of html) can diviede into diffrent table( table of database ) and persist into databaseï¼ then you can dynamically organize and display tables(table of html) with different tableâs ( table of database ) data . I hope what i  say can help you .</p>
