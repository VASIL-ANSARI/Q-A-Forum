  <p>Or, What's the Important dll files that needed to work any Qt application ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, the Qt modules that you are using. If you use QtSql, you need to have the corresponding dll, but it goes the same way for any module. As for a simple core application, you would need to have the QtCore dll, respectively. I could continue the enumeration, but I believe you see the pattern how it goes.</p>

<p>Going even a bit further, you would need to specify your dependencies in the <code>LIBS</code> variable if you happen to use qmake. That is also a place where you would already need to be aware of your direct dependencies.</p>

<p>It would be usually the single library name, but in complex cases, you can always read the documentation of the project. The main point is the fact that you need to get aware of this without debugging. The latter would be more like an after-thought.</p>

<p>There are no "hidden dependencies". Since you are coding the project, you know the dependencies that you use. You will need to ship them.</p>

<p>There are some odd and rare cases when issues come that you would not be aware of, like missing dll for a different machine having a distinct VS/MSVC setup. In that case, it is better not to ship all the dlls for each possible end machine, but the end machine is supposed to install redistributable packages.</p>

<p>In rare cases when the above does not suffice, you can check the error message. If that is still unclear, you can use introspection tools for debugging the issue, like dependency walker.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: this answer goes as broad as the question is.</p>
