<p>Did you compiled the client from source or just got it in binary form?</p>

<p>I suppose you got it already compiled, so it's a library naming difference between Xamarin and MS .net, there is no System.Web.dll (but nearly all the classes exists inside the System.Web namespace but they are on other libraries).</p>

<p>The solution is to download the client's source code, inside Xamarin Studio in your same solution add a new Android Library project, add all the code files from the client to that project, add any necessary reference and reference that project in your main project, in this way the correct libraries will be linked (if no class is missing, as I said there are barely all, but not all).</p>
