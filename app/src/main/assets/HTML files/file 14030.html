<p>The tool you want to use is <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.auth.html" rel="nofollow">Zend_Auth</a> which is quite easy to use when you get the hang of it.</p>

<p>Checking if a user is logged in can be as simple as:-</p>

<pre><code>$auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance();
if($auth-&gt;hasIdentity()) $loggedIn = true;
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://akrabat.com/zend-auth-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">Rob Allen's excellent tutorial on getting started with Zend Auth</a>.</p>

<p>The method I use is to set up a user class that looks after authorisation and access control and inject it into my application as an <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.actionhelpers.html" rel="nofollow">Action Helper</a>, so that in any of my controllers I can just do:-</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;user-&gt;checkSomething();
</code></pre>

<p>The authorisation part needs to affect all the parts of your site which you don't want public and each affected controller needs to check that the user is logged in. For access control, that is done on a per role/per resource basis depending on how fine grained you need to be.See <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.acl.html" rel="nofollow">ACL</a> and <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.auth.html" rel="nofollow">AUTH</a> in the manual.</p>
