<p>The MEMORY (or HEAP) table engine supports only the fixed-row format.</p>

<p>As a result a <code>VARCHAR(255)</code> column is stored like a <code>CHAR(255)</code>: it consumes 255 bytes in each row, even if it contains only 10 characters, plus a few bytes for meta data (e.g. for storing the length). If the column is in UTF-8, it consumes 3 bytes per character, i.e. 3*255 per row, plus meta data.</p>

  <p>MEMORY tables use a fixed-length row-storage format. Variable-length types such as VARCHAR are stored using a fixed length. </p>
