<p>Assuming an <code>int</code> is 4 bytes and you have 8 bit bytes, then <code>int</code> is 32 bits wide.  Subsequently a <code>signed int</code> (if negatives are represented in 2's complement) has a range of -2147483648 to 2147483647 while <code>unsigned int</code> has a range of 0 to 4294967295.</p>

<p>The value 4294967296 in binary is <code>1 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000</code>.  This is 33 bits.  So 4294967296 is too big for this type.</p>
