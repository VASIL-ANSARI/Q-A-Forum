<p>I could imagine that this is for a reason: If you create only one instance of <code>LiteralControl</code> for a particular value, you might only be able to add this object to the collection once, depending on the <code>Controls</code> container it goes into. Some collections do not allow the same, unique object to be in it twice or more; therefore the need to create many unique instances, even if some of them have the same value:</p>

<pre><code>pcShowByCategory.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl("&lt;/br&gt;"));
pcShowByCategory.Controls.Add(new LiteralControl("&lt;/br&gt;"));
</code></pre>

<p>In any case, that code doesn't look particularly nice to my eyes.</p>
