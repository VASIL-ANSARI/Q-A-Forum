<p>You're correct to do Inlines</p>

<pre><code>        textBlock.Inlines.Add(new Run
                           {
                               FontFamily = new FontFamily("Comic Sans"),
                               Text = "Your text"
                           });
        textBlock.Inlines.Add(new Run
        {
            FontFamily = new FontFamily("Tahoma"),
            Text = " is different"
        });
</code></pre>

<p>One possible other solution if you already know what the text will be (you know that there will be two portions of text) is to have some pre-canned xaml ready to go and use the XamlReader.Parse method</p>
