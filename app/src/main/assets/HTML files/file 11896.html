<p>Since it's Windows, I suggest looking into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5z4bw5h5%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">_set_se_translator()</a> Windows API. It allows to handle Structured Exception with C++ <code>catch</code>.</p>

<p>There are other possible ways, such is installing your handlers, but this one allows uniform exception handling as if they were C++ exceptions with minimal programming effort.</p>
