  <p>Is there a way to refresh the cursor?</p>

<p>Call <code>restartLoader()</code> to have it reload the data.</p>

  <p>I don't want to have to create a new Cursor each time a checkbox is checked, which happens a lot</p>

<p>Used properly, a <code>ListView</code> maintains the checked state for you. You would do this via <code>android:choiceMode="multipleChoice"</code> and row <code>Views</code> that implement <code>Checkable</code>. The objective is to not modify the database until the user has indicated they are done messing with the checklist by one means or another (e.g., "Save" action bar item).</p>

  <p>I'm also unsure of how calling restartLoader() several times would work, performance-wise, especially since I use onLoadFinish() to perform some animations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't call it several times. Ideally, call it zero times, by not updating the database until the user is done, at which point you are probably transitioning to some other portion of your UI. Or, call it just once per requested database I/O (e.g., at the point of clicking "Save"). Or, switch from using a <code>CursorAdapter</code> to something else, such as an <code>ArrayAdapter</code> on a set of POJOs you populate from the <code>Cursor</code>, so that the in-memory representation is modifiable in addition to being separately persistable.</p>
