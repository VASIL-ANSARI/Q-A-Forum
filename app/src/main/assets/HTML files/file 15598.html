<p>No, unfortunately it's not possible. There was a trick with:</p>

<pre><code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"prefs://"]];
</code></pre>

<p>but it was opening only the preferences (not straight to bluetooth settings) and it's disabled in iOS 5.1. So your only chance is to make a really good help screen (with nice graphics and animations maybe) that explains the user how to enable the bluetooth.</p>
