<p>SQLite does not support joins in UPDATE statements (only in subqueries, but this would not make sense here).</p>

<p>Even if joins were supported, they would be implemented the same way (and have the same performance) as your query.</p>

<p>To speed this query up, the lookup of <code>tableB</code> rows by their <code>col3</code> value needs to become faster.
For that, create an index on the <code>col3</code> column.</p>
