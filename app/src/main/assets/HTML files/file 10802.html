<p>You should need to worry about whether the item is checked since you are enumerating the <code>CheckedItems</code>, so you can just set the <code>Checked</code> property:</p>

<pre><code>else
{
    item.Checked = false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, just a side note, you might want to consolidate your message asking whether the user wants to delete the checked items; it will get very annoying to continually click 'Yes' if several items have been checked.</p>

<p>Better would be a single dialog simply asking "Are you sure you want to delete the selected items?" to catch an accidental button click.  If the user isn't sure which items they've selected, they can always cancel the delete and make sure.</p>
