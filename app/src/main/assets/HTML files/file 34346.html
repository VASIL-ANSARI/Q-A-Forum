<p>Tail recursion is not the difference here. In fact, Ruby does not do anything to optimize tail calls. </p>

<p>The difference is that the naive algorithm recursively calls itself twice each time it's called, giving O(2<sup>n</sup>) performance, which means the runtime goes up exponentially as N increases. The tail-call version runs in linear time.</p>
