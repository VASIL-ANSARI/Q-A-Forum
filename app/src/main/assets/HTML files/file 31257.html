<p>No, you can't change the CheckJNI setting once your app is running, and there is no way to set it per-app.</p>

<p>However... I'm not aware of any situations where CheckJNI false-positives.  If it's flagging a problem, there really is a problem, and if you don't fix it there's a chance your app will break in the future even if it seems to be working okay now.</p>

<p>If you need help tracking it down, post a question with the logcat output showing the failure report and the code at the point of the failure.  You should have a complete backtrace from the native abort, from which you can get the line number (see e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2314273/get-function-names-from-call-stack/2480465#2480465">this post</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20001153/android-how-to-analyse-the-native-heap-dump/20012337#20012337">this post</a> for more info about <code>addr2line</code>).</p>
