<p>Xcode has refactoring for C and Objective-C built in.  Just select what you'd like to refactor, choose "Refactor..." from either the menu bar or the contextual menu, and you'll get a window including the available refactorings and a preview area.</p>

<p>Xcode doesn't currently have a public plug-in API; if there are specific types of plug-ins you'd like Apple to enable, file enhancement requests in the <a href="http://bugreport.apple.com/" rel="nofollow" title="Bug Reporter - it's not just for bugs!">Bug Reporter</a>.  That way Apple can count and track such requests.</p>

<p>However, there are third-party tools like <a href="http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html" rel="nofollow" title="Accessorizer">Accessorizer</a> and <a href="http://rentzsch.com/code/mogenerator" rel="nofollow" title="mogenerator: Core Data codegen"><code>mogenerator</code></a> (the latest release is <a href="http://rentzsch.com/code/mogenerator_v1.10" rel="nofollow" title="mogenerator 1.10"><code>mogenerator 1.10</code></a>) that you can use to make various development tasks faster.  Accessorizer helps you create accessor methods for your classes, while <code>mogenerator</code> does more advanced code generation for Core Data managed object classes that are modeled using Xcode's modeling tools.</p>
