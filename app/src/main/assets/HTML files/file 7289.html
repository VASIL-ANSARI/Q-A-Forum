<p>You could use <code>source_location</code> to find the beginning of the method you're looking for, then parse the file from that point until the end of the method. You could examine each line of the file starting from the start of the method, incrementing a counter when you find the start of a block and decrementing it when you reach the end of a block, until the counter reaches 0.</p>
