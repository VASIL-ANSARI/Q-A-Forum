<p>Yours is a classic <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem" rel="nofollow">XY Problem</a> where you ask for a specific solution to solve a wrong way to do something. </p>

<p>The key is that you <strong>should</strong> use <code>repaint()</code>, but that you should either store a collection of Rectangles and draw them in a for loop in your <code>paint</code> or <code>paintComponent</code> method (if using Swing), or else draw them to a BufferedImage and draw <em>that</em> in the painting method. Don't forget to also call your super paint or paintComponent method. </p>
