<p>you can check out the Google IO Session entitled 'The world of ListView'.</p>

<p>It explains very nicely how to prevent inflating the same view again and again, and how to reuse a particular view if it has been already inflated earlier.</p>

<p>Here is the link.</p>

<p>You can either download the .pdf file or view the video.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
