  <p>but it seems that android has a sleep mode where everything is paused except the background services and a deep sleep mode that turns off everything even the CPU.</p>

<p>AFAIK, there is only one sleep mode, corresponding to what you describe as "deep sleep". Certainly, from an SDK developer standpoint, either the device is awake, asleep, or off.</p>

  <p>So I wonder if there is there a way to control the time before getting into a deep sleep mode.</p>

<p>Not really. You control how long the screen is on via the Settings app. How long before the device falls asleep after that will range from milliseconds to centuries depending upon what is going on with the device (e.g., is anything holding a <code>WakeLock</code>).</p>
