<p>The attribute <code>gamesCompleted</code> belongs to the <code>Player</code> object. When the user chooses to play again you do:</p>

<pre><code>numOfGames++;
</code></pre>

<p>But this increments the local variable <code>numOfGames</code>, which is not related to <code>gamesCompleted</code>. If you search for where you use <code>gamesCompleted</code> you will see that you never change its value.</p>

<p>You could write a method to increment the number of games completed by that user. And call it instead of doing <code>numOfGames++</code>. </p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>public void incrementGamesCompleted() {
    this.gamesCompleted++;
}
</code></pre>
