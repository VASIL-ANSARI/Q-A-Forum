<p>I have found the solution.</p>

<p>After creating a banner, you just have to change the bannerÂ´s delivery options.
In my case, I added <strong>"delivery limitation"</strong> type <strong>"Site Page URL"</strong> mode <strong>"contains"</strong> and then I just set a team name to the browser so it shows up only in that team's page!</p>
