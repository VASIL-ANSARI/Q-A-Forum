  <p>The program I'm using it on works perfectly fine;</p>

<p>For some definition of works. Your program has at least 2 bugs.</p>

  <p>When I typed "backtrace full" gdb gave me this: ... What exactly does this mean? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's hard to tell without knowing which commands you used <em>before</em> reaching this point. Most likely you did <code>next</code> until you returned from <code>main</code>, and thus landed in <code>_start</code> (which is the routine that calls <code>main</code>, and which is where the execution of any program usually starts).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is ../sysdeps/i386/elf/start.S:65? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>_start</code> routine is part of GLIBC, and is defined in <code>sysdeps/i386/elf/start.S</code> source file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how can there be no locals, when clearly I have declared wordcount and len? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are <em>not</em> inside <code>main</code>, so whatever locals are present in <code>main</code> is irrelevant: they are only active while <code>main</code> is executing, and it's not (either not yet, or not any longer).</p>
