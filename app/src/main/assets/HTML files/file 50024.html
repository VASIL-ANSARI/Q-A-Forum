<p><code>#pragma warning (disable : 4146) // VS2012 unary minus operator applied to unsigned type</code></p>

<p>I didn't try to dig up what ill advised option someone added somewhere in the solution hierarchy to convert that unsound warning into a nasty error.  Locally in the source code, in the several places where an <code>unsigned</code> or a <code>std::size_t</code> is correctly negated, the <code>#pragma</code> is quite reasonable as a comment to make it clear to any human code reviewer or MS compiler that negating an unsigned really was intentional.  </p>

<p>I tested, that <code>#pragma</code> really does convert it all the way down from error to silent.  </p>

<p>As a matter of project style, the compiler version in the comment on a warning disable tells only which compiler/version triggered the decision to add the <code>#pragma</code>.  It is not intended to give any hint at how broad or narrow (other compilers or versions) the issue might be.  </p>

<p>If I were in control of all aspects of this, I might decide that the command line option turning this warning into an error is so ill advised that it would be better to fix the command line than the source code (and worth all the extra effort to find the place whatever stupid option was injected into the command line).  But in fact, I have no influence over that command line.  I <strong>can</strong> make the final decision on what to do in these source files to compensate for bad decisions regarding the command line.  I <strong>can't</strong> influence whatever I might consider to be bad decisions regarding the command line.</p>
