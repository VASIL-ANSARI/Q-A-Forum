<p>I ultimately decided what I want to achieve would be near impossible, because upon rotating the device the popover would relocate so different UI would lie underneath it, and navigating in this popover could resize the popover as well. So I decided if it's an iPad running iOS 7 then it just gets a solid background color.</p>

<p>But if it's an iPad running iOS 8, then I support the native <code>UIBlurEffect</code> API which is really nice. :)</p>
