<p>Ok, answering my own question.</p>

<p>When splash is set in VM Options: -splash:path-to-image.
The in JavaFX I was able to close it like this:</p>

<pre><code>//Get the splashscreen
final SplashScreen splash = SplashScreen.getSplashScreen();

//Close splashscreen
    if (splash != null) {
        System.out.println("Closing splashscreen...");
        splash.close();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this is somewhat helpful to others also! ;)</p>
