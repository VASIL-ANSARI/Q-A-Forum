<p>Consider using</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef ORA_PROC
    #include &lt;apparently_evil_include_file.h&gt;
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>to suppress the include that is including the evil thing,
as a possible workaround.</p>

<p>It effectively hides the include from the Pro*c preprocessor, while letting it be there for the compiler.</p>

<p>You could also do some research on <a href="https://support.oracle.com/CSP/ui/flash.html" rel="nofollow">metalink</a>.</p>
