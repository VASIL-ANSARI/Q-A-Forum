<p>I assume 'MovieTitle' does not accept null values in your model. If that's true, please change your where clause to following.</p>

<pre><code>var entriesQuery = from entry in excel.Worksheet&lt;VEntry&gt;(0)
                                  where entry.MovieTitle != string.Empty
                                  select entry;
</code></pre>
