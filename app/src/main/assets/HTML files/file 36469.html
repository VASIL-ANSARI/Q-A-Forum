<p>You have set the second parameter ($assoc) of <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php" rel="nofollow">json_decode()</a> to true, which means it's going to return an associative array instead of an object.  You then tried to reference the object style.  If you are setting the second parameter to true, you need to use the associative array style to access the stream content. It would be:</p>

<pre><code>$json_decoded['stream']
</code></pre>

<p>If you set the $assoc parameter to false (or do not specify the parameter) then you can reference it as an object:</p>

<pre><code>$json_decoded-&gt;stream
</code></pre>

<p>If you do <a href="http://au1.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php" rel="nofollow">var_dump</a> on the $json_decoded variable you will see what it looks like. This is a good way to see what you are working with.</p>
