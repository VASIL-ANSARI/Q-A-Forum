<p>So you are saying, after a user successfully logs in, you want to redirect them to some action located in another controller called <code>ProfileController</code>?  </p>

<p>If that's what you're after than it's pretty simple. After you authenticated the user in your login method you simply throw a <code>return RedirectToAction("Index", "Profile");</code> in there and you should be good to go. Here is an example that does just that. It's a little more convoluted but I commented everything so you can understand. There are more than a couple redirects in there for different reasons.   </p>

<pre><code>[AllowAnonymous]
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Login(Models.AccountViewModel vm, string returnUrl)
    {
        //first make sure they filled in all mandatory fields
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            //try to find the user by the credentials they provided
            var user = await UserManager.FindAsync(vm.LoginModel.Username, vm.LoginModel.Password);
            //if user is null then they entered wrong credentials
            if (user != null)
            {
                //if user has confirmed their email already
                if (user.EmailConfirmed == true)
                {
                    //attempt to sign in the user
                    await SignInAsync(user, vm.LoginModel.RememberMe);

                    //if the return url is empty then they clicked directly on login instead of trying to access
                    //an unauthorized area of the site which redirected them to the login.
                    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl))
                        return RedirectToLocal(returnUrl);

                    //returnUrl was empty so user went to log in first
                    else
                    {
                        //lets check and see which roles this user is in so we can direct him to the right page
                        var rolesForUser = UserManager.GetRoles(user.Id);
                        //users can be in multiple roles but the first role dictates what they see after they sign in
                        switch (rolesForUser.First())
                        {
                            case "Normal_User":
                                return RedirectToAction("Feed", "Account");
                            default:
                                //user is not in any roles send him to the default screen

                                break;
                        }
                    }
                }

                    //user has not confirmed their email address redirect to email confirmation
                else
                {
                    //resend confirmation
                    await SendConfirmationEmail(user.Id);

                    //redirect user to unconfirmed email account view
                    return RedirectToAction("UnconfirmedAccount", "Account", new { Email = user.Email, UserId = user.Id });
                }

            }
            else
            {
                //add errors to the view letting the user know they entered wrong credentials. Code will fall through and return
                //the view below with these errors
                ModelState.AddModelError("", "Invalid username or password.");
            }

        }

        // If we got this far then validation failed
        return View(vm);
    }
