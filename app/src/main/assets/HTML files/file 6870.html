<p>For the first part of your question, maybe the following links are useful for understanding when to use EJB and JPA and when to use them together:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4639101/database-table-access-via-jpa-vs-ejb-in-a-web-application/4639182#4639182">Database table access via JPA Vs. EJB in a Web-Application</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4639535/ejb-3-or-hibernate-3/4639967#4639967">EJB 3 or Hibernate 3</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As for the second part, I assume you're referring to <code>Bean Validation</code>? In Java EE 5 there isn't quite anything like that. What it does have is a system for attaching validators to input fields in the web layer; the JSF validators. This surely is "server side validation".</p>
