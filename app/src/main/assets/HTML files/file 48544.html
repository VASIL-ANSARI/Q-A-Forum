<p>Probably not the answer you're looking for, but just as a test (because I'm curious):
- declare i as final, and assign it a 0 value.
- remove the increment statements for i.</p>

<p>If you're getting the same answer then:
1. You have i declared somewhere else as 2.
2. You've discovered a bug.</p>

<p>Also, does the issue occurs if you declare i as Integer instead of int? 
There's something to be learned here.. </p>
