<p>For sorting than many elements, your best shot is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort" rel="nofollow">Merge Sort</a>. It's usually the algorithms used by databases. Even though is not as fast as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" rel="nofollow">Quick Sort</a>, it uses intermediate storage so you don't need huge amounts of memory to perform the sort.</p>

<p>Also, as pointed by sje397 and Scott in the comments, Merge Sort is highly parallelizable.</p>
