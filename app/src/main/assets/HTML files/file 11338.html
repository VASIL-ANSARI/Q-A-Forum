<p>The best way to stop a thread in Python is to politely ask it to stop. The best way to pass new data to a thread is with the <code>Queue</code> module.</p>

<p>Both are used in <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/05/18/code-sample-socket-client-thread-in-python/" rel="nofollow">the code in this post</a>, which demonstrates socket communication from a Python thread but is otherwise relevant to your question. If you read the code carefully you'll notice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using <code>threading.Event()</code> which is set by a method call from outside, and which the thread periodically checks to know if it was asked to die.</li>
<li>Using <code>Queue.Queue()</code> for both passing commands to the thread and receiving responses from it.</li>
</ol>
