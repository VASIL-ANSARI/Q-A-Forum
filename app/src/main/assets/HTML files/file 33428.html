<p>MySQL should be running the "min" subquery only once for each group.  Putting the value in a separate variable shouldn't really affect performance.</p>

<p>If you want to optimize the performance of this query, then create an index on <code>tab1(reg, lang, queue)</code>.  This index will allow direct lookups for values without going through the "index merge" step.</p>
