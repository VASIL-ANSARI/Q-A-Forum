<p>The compiler needs the right classpath in order to compile calls to a library (compile time dependencies)</p>

<p>The JVM needs the right classpath in order to load the classes in the library you are calling (runtime dependencies).</p>

<p>They may be different in a couple of ways:</p>

<p>1) if your class C1 calls library class L1, and L1 calls library class L2, then C1 has a runtime dependency on L1 and L2, but only a compile time dependency on L1.</p>

<p>2) if your class C1 dynamically instantiates an interface I1 using Class.forName() or some other mechanism, and the implementing class for interface I1 is class L1, then C1 has a runtime dependency on I1 and L1, but only a compile time dependency on I1.</p>

<p>Other "indirect" dependencies which are the same for compile-time and run-time:</p>

<p>3) your class C1 extends library class L1, and L1 implements interface I1 and extends library class L2: C1 has a compile-time dependency on L1, L2, and I1.</p>

<p>4) your class C1 has a method <code>foo(I1 i1)</code> and a method <code>bar(L1 l1)</code> where I1 is an interface and L1 is a class that takes a parameter which is interface I1: C1 has a compile-time dependency on I1 and L1.</p>

<p><strong>Basically, to do anything interesting, your class needs to interface with other classes and interfaces in the classpath. The class/interface graph formed by that set of library <em>interfaces</em> yields the compile-time dependency chain. The library <em>implementations</em> yield the run-time dependency chain.</strong> Note that the run-time dependency chain is run-time dependent or fail-slow: if the implementation of L1 sometimes depends on instantiating an object of class L2, and that class only gets instantiated in one particular scenario, then there's no dependency except in that scenario.</p>
