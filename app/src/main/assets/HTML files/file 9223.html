<p>I'm guessing SQL Server doesn't know how to translate Reverse into a T-SQL command, so you're getting an exception.  You'll probably need to pull the results of the query down from the database, <strong>then</strong> reverse it.</p>

<pre><code>var News = (from news in db.News                   
               select new 
               {
               ID = news.NewsID,
               kort = news.Short
               }).AsEnumerable().Reverse();
</code></pre>
