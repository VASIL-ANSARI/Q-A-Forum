<p>The problem is that your css definition </p>

<pre><code>left: 20%
</code></pre>

<p>seems to be getting overridden. Possibly as a result of <code>bounce</code> issuing <code>left: 0</code> and then not properly caching the previous value of <code>left</code>. What ensues is <code>left: 0</code> being cached as the proper value and the element getting shot to the left when all is said and done.</p>

<p>What I would suggest is locking this functionality. This will prevent the error, and also will prevent the gaming of the button.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
  var lockMouseover;
  $("#button").mouseover(function(){
    if( typeof lockMouseover == "undefined" ){
     $("#button").effect( "bounce", {times:3}, 300 );
      lockMouseover = setTimeout( function(){ var un; lockMouseover = un;}, 950 );
    }
  });
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>I tested this on your jsbin and it worked.</p>
