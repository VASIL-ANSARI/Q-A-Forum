<p>I understand that your exercise it to make you think about what's a general stack ("core stack function") and what's a perticular implementation of it.  </p>

<p>So the alternative of having your abstract class:  </p>

<pre><code>class StackADT
{
 public:
     ...  // pure virtual core function 
};  // &lt;= allways ;  at end of class ;-) 
</code></pre>

<p>would lead to having <code>StackArray</code> as a concrete implementation:  </p>

<pre><code>class StackArray : public Stack ADT {
    ... // you can leave the rest as it is:  the functions will override the virtual ones.  
};
</code></pre>

<p>What's the purpose of all this ?  Well, you could perfectly imagine implementing a <code>StackLinkedList</code> or <code>StackReallocArray</code>.  The advantage is that the difference is only at creation.  Once a stack is created,  the code using it is the same, whatever implementation is used.  </p>

<p>Another approach could be to use templates to generalize on the content of the stack.  And yet another would be to use <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack/?kw=stack" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;stack&gt;</code></a>, but I think that this is not (yet) the goal of your exercise.</p>
