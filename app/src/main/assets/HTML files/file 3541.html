<p>Your DataStorage class needs some corrections:</p>

<pre><code>public class DataStorage 
{
    ArrayList&lt;Account&gt; staffMembers = new ArrayList&lt;Account&gt;();      
    ArrayList&lt;Account&gt; students = new ArrayList&lt;Account&gt;();  

    // Default constructor
    public DataStorage() {
    }

    public void addStaffMember(Staff aAcc) 
    {
     staffMembers.add(aAcc);
    }

    public void addStudentMember(Student aAcc)
    {
     students.add(aAcc);
    }

    public Student getStudentById(String id)
    {
    }

    // More retrieval methods
}
</code></pre>

<p>You will usually want to hava more retrieval methods (get by department, name, id). Some will return a single item and some a list. If you are only interested in retrieving accounts by id, you could use a Map instead of a list. The truth is that to support all retrieval methods, you would need a relational database of some kind. If you are looking for a naive solution, keep the ArrayList and iterate through all members to find the ones you are looking for.</p>
