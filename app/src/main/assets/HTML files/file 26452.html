<p>Obviously, the curves are not identical, and therefore the distance function must not be 0 (otherwise, it is not a distance by definition).</p>

<p>What IS "relatively large"? The distance probably is not infinite, is it?</p>

<p>140 points in time, each with a small delta, this still adds up to a non-zero number.</p>

<p>The distance "New York" to "Beijing" is roughly 11018 km. Or 1101800000 mm.</p>

<p>The distance to Alpha Centauri is small, just 4.34 lj. That is the nearest other stellar system to us...</p>

<p>Compare with the distance to a non-similar series; that distance should be much larger.</p>
