<p>As far as I know, i't not possible to manipulate TWTweetComposeViewController more than adding an image, a link and an initial text. Apple is very clear on this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although you may perform Twitter requests on behalf of the user, you
  cannot append text, images, or URLs to tweets without the userâs
  knowledge. Hence, you can set the initial text and other content
  before presenting the tweet to the user but cannot change the tweet
  after the user views it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that preselecting the user account it's not against it, but on the class reference I don't see a way to change the account. It's completly up to the user.</p>

<p>I have a problem similar. I'm trying to fetch which account was used after the tweet. TWTweetComposeViewController seems to remember which was the last account used to tweet. If anyone knows...</p>
