<p>The return value of each is measuring different things.</p>

<p>It would be prudent to pay attention to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa258269%28v=sql.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">DATEDIFF</a> docs here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns the count (signed integer) of the specified datepart boundaries crossed between the specified startdate and enddate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which leads to the following 2 second interval:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT datediff(minute, '9/10/2012 5:14:59 AM', '9/10/2012 5:15:01 AM') 
</code></pre>

<p>returning 1 because it crosses a minute boundary. I suspect that you did not take this behaviour into account.</p>
