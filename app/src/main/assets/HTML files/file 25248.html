<p>You cannot have new Python programs started through bash run on the same interpreter, each program will always have its own.  If you want to limit the number of Python programs running the best approach would be to have a Python daemon process running on your server and instead of creating a new program through bash on each request you would signal the daemon process to create a thread to handle the task.</p>
