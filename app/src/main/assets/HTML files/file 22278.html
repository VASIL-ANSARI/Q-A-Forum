<p>You cannot open a directory behind an URL like a local directory. You will need to enable DirectoryListing in your webserver configuration and then parse the HTML page provided by the webserver when the URL is accessed. You could use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html" rel="nofollow">HttpURLConnection</a> to load the website then.</p>
