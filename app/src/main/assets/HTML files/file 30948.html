<p>It looks like the root problem was that your Apple-supplied Python was somehow brokenâit was there enough for Homebrew to find it and set up the environment to use it, but not there enough to actually runâas in <code>/usr/bin/python</code> doesn't exist, and therefore <code>/usr/bin/env python</code> finds nothing when run in an environment without the Homebrew stuff added.</p>

<p>You really ought to figure out how you did that, and then fix it. That might require updating or repairing OS X. (I don't actually know how to do that anymore in 10.8 or 10.9, but that's a great question for <a href="http://superuser.com">SuperUser</a>.) All kinds of other things can break if your Apple Python is broken, including everything from OS services to random bits deep inside some Homebrew port.</p>

<p>Creating a symlink from <code>/usr/bin/python2.7</code> to <code>/usr/bin/python</code> will sort of work, but it's really not right. <code>/usr/bin/python</code> is a special stub executable that can be used (depending on global settings and environment-variable flags) to run any of the Python versions in <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</code> (normally that's 2.7, 2.6, 2.5, and a partial 2.3), while <code>/usr/bin/python2.7</code> is a stub executable that just runs the 2.7 version. You might get away with it, but I wouldn't unless you really have no choice.</p>
