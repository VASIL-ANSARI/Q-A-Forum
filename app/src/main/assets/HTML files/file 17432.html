<p>You use the ASP.NET tag: I suspect you are running the application under an identity without its own profile, and it is using the default regional settings stored in the registry under 'HKEY_USERS.Default\Control Panel\International`.  </p>

<p>These aren't necessarily the same as the regional settings of an interactive user.</p>

<p>You can do one of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add a <code>&lt;globalization&gt;</code> element to your web.config.  This is probably the best solution, as it makes your app independent of the regional settings of the hosting server.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Control Panel to set the regional settings you want for the current user and for the default user profile.  The exact steps depend on the Windows version you're using.</p></li>
</ul>
