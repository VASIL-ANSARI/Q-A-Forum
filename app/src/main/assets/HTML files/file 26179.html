<p>The first argument of <code>Kernel#open</code> is <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Kernel#open-instance_method" rel="nofollow"><strong>not supposed</strong></a> to work with a <code>File</code> object but rather with a <code>String</code>Â object representing a <em>path</em>. The fact that it is working for some machines is not the proof of it being valid or a suggested way of using <code>open</code>.</p>

<p>You should definitely keep using:</p>

<pre><code>open(file.path) { |f| get_mime_type(f) }
</code></pre>
