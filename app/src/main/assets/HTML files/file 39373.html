<p>Such a choice of a doctype string has nothing to do with support to HTML5 features. Either a browser supports those features, or it does not.</p>

<p>The doctype string affects the mode of the browser, <a href="https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/quirks-mode.html" rel="nofollow">quirks mode</a> vs. standards mode. But the mode mainly affects interpretation of CSS. Although some HTML issues are affected, too, the XHTML 1.0 doctypes <em>when specified literally as per XHTML 1.0 recommendation</em>, trigger standards mode just as the HTML5 doctype does.</p>

<p>Besides, wrapping a block element inside an <code>a</code> element works in quirks mode, too. It is a browser tradition to ignore old HTML rules on what may or may not be included in an <code>a</code> element; HTML5 just makes this a rule.</p>
