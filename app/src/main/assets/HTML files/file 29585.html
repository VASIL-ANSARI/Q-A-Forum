<p>I've found one possible solution here, which is working, albeit a bit wonky.</p>

<p>If I chain all of these together in requestAnimationFrame callbacks, then it works as expected:</p>

<pre><code>window.requestAnimationFrame(function()
  {
    // apply class 1
    window.requestAnimationFrame(function()
    {
      // apply class 2
    });
  });
</code></pre>

<p>I don't particularly like this solution, but it is a solution.  Anything better out there?</p>
