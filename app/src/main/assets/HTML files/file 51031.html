<p>Seems like you have to download the whole video before you can begin playback. It can also be because of your server not AVPlayer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>when you serve videos on a site using plain HTTP â known as
  progressive download â the position of the header becomes very
  important. Either the header is placed in the beginning of the file or
  itâs places in the end of the file. In case of the latter, youâll have
  to download the whole thing before you can begin playback â because
  without the header, the player canât start decoding.</p>
