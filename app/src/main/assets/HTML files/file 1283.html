<p>I think you are missing some quotes:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `modified` FROM `Blog` WHERE `modified` &gt; '2010-01-08 16:01:01'
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to select some other fields apart from just the modified field. You could start with this until you know which fields you want:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `Blog` WHERE `modified` &gt; '2010-01-08 16:01:01'
</code></pre>
