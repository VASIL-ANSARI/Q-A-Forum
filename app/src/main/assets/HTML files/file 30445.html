<p>Rather than setting the SelectedValue in the tag in the front end, try checking the validity of TruckID in the Page_Load of the code behind file and set selected value there.</p>

<p>For instance, here I'll check if TruckID is not Null.  If it has a value then I set the selected value to TruckID, otherwise, I'll set the selected value to the first item in ddlTrucks assuming the first item is a default selection.</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if(!IsPostBack)
        ddlTrucks.SelectedValue = TruckID != Null ? TruckID : ddlTrucks.Items[0].Value;
}
</code></pre>
