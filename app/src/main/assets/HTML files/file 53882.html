<p>After I asked this question, I found by the help of the releated section on SO, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20518424/building-portable-class-library-project-in-build-server-fails?rq=1">SO: Building Portable Class Library Project in build server fails</a>.</p>

<p>This sounds to me to be a much better way of keeping the profiles updated. At least check if there are any updates next time I get a related problem.</p>
