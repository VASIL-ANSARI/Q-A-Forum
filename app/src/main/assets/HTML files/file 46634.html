<p>Soo i think ur main answer is already done. You simply say that your code is heavy and you have afraid of getting unneeded resets of the TimeStamp right?
Right. soo if that is your problem you can simply fixe him by hadding on the user that loggins a Cookie With the timestamp and the Id of the user Encrypted (I normaly encrypt the password and add the encrypted password on the cookie soo it gets impossible to the user to change the cookie Id and know the other user Encrypted password) but taht is not the case.</p>

<p>The real fix:
You just need to have a table on a database, and add the User Id and the Timestamp of that user soo when he loggins you can check the timestamp, if you want to Execute scripts on user Action if that is what you really need, you need to make 1 php file with the actions and a token on the GET example: </p>

<p>actions.php?token=231sfa231dasdasd&amp;action=Username</p>

<p>Soo the page will get a blank page with the username only of the current user.
You can make this interactive by Adding some Javascript Code and make it refresh himself when it changes aswell.</p>

<p>Not sure if i helped you but if i do tell me. Thanks</p>
