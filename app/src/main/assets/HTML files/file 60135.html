<p>You can dynamic_cast the raw pointer; something like</p>

<pre><code>Derived* t = dymanic_cast&lt;Derived*&gt;(sp_00.get())
</code></pre>

<p>And you'll get NULL if it can't be cast, or a valid pointer if it can.  That said, this requires RTTI to be built in, which will make your binary bigger, and needing to do this at all is a sign that your design isn't right.</p>
