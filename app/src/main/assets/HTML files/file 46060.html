<p>The PHP version you build is not the active/used one.</p>

<p>You need to find out, in which folder your new PHP build lives and execute the binary over there. It seems PHP is build in the <code>misc</code> folder and not installed to the runtime folder. You might also alias it.</p>

<p>PHP should go into the runtime folder, e.g. <code>${OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR}/app-root/runtime/php5/bin/php</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>A quick glance at your scripts reveals:</p>

<ul>
<li>you define <code>export OPENSHIFT_RUNTIME_DIR=${OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR}/app-root/runtime</code> in <code>/misc/common.sh</code>. </li>
<li>you need to check, that PHP lands in runtime folder (is it in misc?)</li>
<li>no alias for PHP, e.g. <code>alias php='${OPENSHIFT_RUNTIME_DIR}/php5/bin/php'</code>.</li>
</ul>
