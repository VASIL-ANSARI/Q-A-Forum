<p>I believe that what you expect is parallax in fullscreen. Like in my sample here:</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/protron/hLHTP/embedded/result/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/protron/hLHTP/embedded/result/</a> (full source <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/protron/hLHTP/" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>

<p>I started my copying they <a href="http://stephband.info/jparallax/demos/target.html" rel="nofollow">target demo</a> and then (inside the CSS) I set the margins to "0" for <code>parallax-port</code>:</p>

<pre><code>.parallax-port {
    position: absolute;
    top:0px; bottom:0px; left:0px; right:0px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's about it. Then I changed the images to the one in their <a href="http://stephband.info/jparallax/" rel="nofollow">parallax homepage</a>, and changed their cordinates to get a sampler similar to the page you showed (but obviously the images are not big enough for a big screen).</p>
