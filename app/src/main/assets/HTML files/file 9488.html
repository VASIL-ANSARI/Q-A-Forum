<p>Handle the key stroke event for the date picker.</p>

<p>Drop a dateTimePicker on a form.  Add a KeyDown event.</p>

<p>The code below essentially disables the arrow keys for the date time picker.  </p>

<pre><code>private void dateTimePicker1_KeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
{
     e.Handled = true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure what you want to do, but handle the event however you choose and then mark it as handled.</p>
