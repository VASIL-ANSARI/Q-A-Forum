<pre><code>var min = listOfKvps.OrderBy(kvp =&gt; kvp.Key).First();
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to do it with a single <em>O(n)</em> pass through the sequence, rather than requiring an <em>O(n log n)</em> ordering, then you could do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>var min = listOfKvps.Aggregate((agg, kvp) =&gt; (kvp.Key &lt; agg.Key) ? kvp : agg);
</code></pre>

<p>(Of course, the second version is much less readable/intuitive than the first, even if it does have better theoretical performance. It would make more sense to use some sort of <code>MinBy</code> method: either write your own, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4205670/to-get-a-keyvaluepair-from-a-list-of-keyvaluepairs-with-the-minimun-value/4205710#4205710">use the version from Marc's answer</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/morelinq/" rel="nofollow">use the version from MoreLINQ</a>.)</p>
