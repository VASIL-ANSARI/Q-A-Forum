<p>I have finally solved the above issue where the processing of the "Do While" would stop looping at various places. In a few cases it would run for 2 minutes or more. The problem was that my "While" statement "while (finalCalc > temp2);" was not comparing the values of the two NSDecimalNumbers, but comparing pointer addresses. After a fair amount of research and testing the correct coding for the while statement is "<strong>while ([finalCalc compare:temp2] == NSOrderedDescending);</strong>" I have tested this multiple times are it works perfectly. My original code would compile without errors or warnings.</p>
