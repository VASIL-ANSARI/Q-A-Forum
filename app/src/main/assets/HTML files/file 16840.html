<p>It sounds like you have <code>JDK_HOME</code> defined as a user variable and <code>PATH</code> defined as a System variable, or vice versa - <code>echo %PATH%</code> should not contain unresolved variables like <code>...;%JDK_HOME%</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure that the <code>%JDK_HOME%\bin</code> path is on your PATH variable, unresolved, even if you have to put the path in explicitly.</p>
