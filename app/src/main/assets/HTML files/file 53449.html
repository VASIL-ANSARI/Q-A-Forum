<p>This is multithreaded and it may wait forever may not.
In your case you were lucky that _myclassAdmin.stop(); were executed after MyClass has started executing and executed wait();</p>

<p>I ran the program after changing the method stop() name to stop1() it were waiting forever. </p>

<p>To get consistent behavior do one thing, put a 1 sec sleep between two method call in main like:</p>

<pre><code>MyClassAdmin _myclassAdmin=new MyClassAdmin();
Thread.sleep(1)
_myclassAdmin.stop();
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the execution will always halt.</p>

<p>Also, when a thread calls wait() it releases the monitor associated with it, so any other thread can aquire that lock and issue a notify() / notifyAll() to wake up waiting threads. This is expect</p>
