<p>To avoid doing all of the hard work, there is already an option to deserialize a JSON object into a .NET object that you can work with, an example with your piece of code;</p>

<pre><code>public class RootObject
{
    public string FavsGTS { get; set; }
    public string FavsGPICS { get; set; }
    public string FavsRNS { get; set; }
    public string FavsPIS { get; set; }
    public string FavsIsOns { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>While you simply deserialize it by;</p>

<pre><code>RootObject gamertag_sample = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;RootObject&gt;(jsonstr);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course if you pass it an array of RootObject, you'll need to replace <code>&lt;RootObject&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;RootObject[]&gt;</code> and so on with the type.</p>

<p>As far as I understood this was the only problem you were seeking for a solution or have I missed something?</p>

<p>EDIT:
With dynamic object you can create any value entry you wish, you'll need to go through a series of tasks to do so before however.</p>

<pre><code>// this would contain your key,value for the generated instance.
// {example_key, "value"} would result later in myObject.example_key (returning "value")
var expandoObj = new ExpandoObject();
var eoCollection = (ICollection&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;)expandoObj;
// add your key value pairs here
eoCollection.Add(new KeyValuePair&lt;string, object&gt;("example", "example value"));

dynamic myDynamicObject = expandoObj;
// myDynamicObject.example will return "example value", and would result in json:
//    "example":"example value"
</code></pre>
