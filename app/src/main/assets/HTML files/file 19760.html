<p>Here are a couple methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is no _Layout.cshtml in Orchard. The equivalent would be Document.cshtml in your Theme. You can do what Freeman suggested, but in Document.cshtml</p></li>
<li><p>You can use one of the existing Facebook modules on the Orchard gallery. There is at least one module there that implements the Like button, so you can attach the "like" buttons to your parts and the module will take care of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags for you. </p></li>
</ol>
