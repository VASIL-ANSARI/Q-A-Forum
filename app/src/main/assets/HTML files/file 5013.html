<p>As far as I know, you can give a default value to lag() :</p>

<pre><code>  SELECT Book_Type, 
         (lag(sold_in_Dollars, 1, 0) OVER(PARTITION BY Book_Type ORDER BY Month) + lag(sold_in_Dollars, 2, 0) OVER(PARTITION BY Book_Type ORDER BY Month))/2 AS expected_sales
    FROM your_table
GROUP BY Book_Type
</code></pre>

<p>(Assuming Month column doesn't really contain JAN or FEB but real, orderable dates.)</p>
