<p>Presuming the elements are already in the order you want them, you can do it like: </p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; elementNamesList = elmentnames.Take(15).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p><code>.Take(15)</code> is the first 15 elements. From index 0 to 15 is actually 16 elements, so you can change that to <code>.Take(16)</code> if that's what you meant.</p>
