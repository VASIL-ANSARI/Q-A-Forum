<p>It has little to do with starting the UI from within the EDT or not (although you should cause that can cause lots of other weird and interesting issues) and more to do with the fact that you've called <code>setVisible</code> before you've established the contents of the UI.</p>

<p>This is possibly an example of a race condition between the system trying to get the EDT up and running and the OS calls responding before it's established.</p>

<p>In either case you SHOULD start the UI from within the EDT and call <code>setVisible</code> last.</p>

<p>Swing can be lazy about updating the UI, this is actually a deliberate design choice as well as a good idea.  You don't always want  the UI updated after each and every change you make (like adding/removing components), so it hands over some of the control to the developer to decided when it's best to <code>revalidate</code> container hierarchy and request <code>repaint</code>s</p>

<p>I would also avoid using a <code>Thread</code> to update the state of the UI as this could cause dirty paints as Swing uses a passive rendering approach (painting when it feels it's required) and consider using a Swing <code>Timer</code> which updated from within the EDT OR use a <code>BufferStrategy</code> and employ a active rendering approach, which you can then control</p>
