<p>You need to pass in a <code>limit</code> parameter:</p>

<p><code>limit : This is the number of individual objects that are returned in each page. Note that this is an upper limit, if there are not enough remaining objects in the list of data, then less than this number will be returned. Some edges have an upper maximum on the limit value, for performance reasons. We will return the correct pagination links if that happens.</code></p>
