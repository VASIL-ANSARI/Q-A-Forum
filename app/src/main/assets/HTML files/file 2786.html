<p>Lowering the priority doesn't mean that the thread will always be the last one picked to get a time slot. If the lower priority thread hasn't got a time slot for a while, it will be more likely to get one. That way lower priority threads will run slower, but not completely stop.</p>

<p>Also, if the main thread is waiting for something, like for example waiting for the disk drive to return data, the other threads can run in that void. If the main thread does a lot of disk I/O, there will be a lot of holes to run other threads in.</p>

<p>If the CPU has more than a single core, the load will be more evenly distributed between threads. No matter how high priority a thread has, it will still only run on one core.</p>
