<p>There was a bug fix introduced into Breeze 1.4.14 ( this fragment below is from the release notes).</p>

<ul>
<li>D2610 - Handle casing correctly for unmapped properties.  Previously unmapped properties would not go thru the registered namingConvention when registered late. <em>Note: this could be a breaking change if you were counting on the previous 'errant' behavior</em>    </li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is that you have a 'DefaultIngredientCode' property declared in the <em>javascript</em> constructor of your entity class.  Since this name is NOT camelCased it does not roundtrip properly. If you change this property to 'defaultIngredientCode' your code should work properly.  NOTE: this is a client side change NOT a server side change.</p>
