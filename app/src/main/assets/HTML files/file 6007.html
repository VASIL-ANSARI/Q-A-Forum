<p>What are you using to generate your maps?  I'm making use of the GMap2 API in a project of mine from about 8 months back, and it looks like I just had to call 'GDirections(map{{div}});' on, well, the map div in order to get it to display a route between two locations, and adjust the level of zoom appropriately.</p>
