<p>Your question is too complicated to understand and respond to in one try.  But I'll throw out some preliminary ideas.</p>

<p>Yes, <code>argument_groups</code> are just a way of grouping arguments in the help.  They have no effect on parsing.</p>

<p>Another recent SO asked about parsing groups of arguments:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31519997/is-it-possible-to-only-parse-one-argument-groups-parameters-with-argparse">Is it possible to only parse one argument group&#39;s parameters with argparse?</a></p>

<p>That poster initially wanted to use a group as a parser, but the <code>argparse</code> class structure does not allow that.  <code>argparse</code> is written in object style.  <code>parser=ArguementParser...</code> creates one class of object, <code>parser.add_arguement...</code> creates another, <code>add_argument_group...</code> yet another.  You customize it by subclassing <code>ArgumentParser</code> or <code>HelpFormatter</code> or <code>Action</code> classes, etc.</p>

<p>I mentioned a <code>parents</code> mechanism.  You define one or more parent parsers, and use those to populate your 'main' parser.  They could be run indepdently (with parse_known_args), while the 'main' is used to handle help.</p>

<p>We also discussed grouping the arguments after parsing.  A <code>namespace</code> is a simple object, in which each argument is an attribute.  It can also be converted to a dictionary.  It is easy to pull groups of items from a dictionary.</p>

<p>There have SO questions about using multiple subparsers.  That's an awkward proposition.  Possible, but not easy.  Subparsers are like issueing a command to a system program.  You generally issue one command per call.  You don't nest them or issue sequences.  You let shell piping and scripts handle multiple actions.</p>

<p><code>IPython</code> uses <code>argparse</code> to parse its inputs.  It traps help first, and issues its own message.  Most arguments come from config files, so it is possible to set values with default configs, custom configs and in the commandline.  It's an example of naming a very large set of arguments.</p>

<p>Subparsers let you use the same argument name, but without being able to invoke multiple subparsers in one call that doesn't help much.  And even if you could invoke several subparsers, they would still put the arguments in the same namespace.  Also <code>argparse</code> tries to handle flaged arguments in an order independent manner.  So a <code>--foo</code> at the end of the command line gets parsed the same as though it were at the start.</p>

<p>There was SO question where we discussed using argument names ('dest') like <code>'group1.argument1'</code>, and I've even discussed using nested namespaces.  I could look those up if it would help.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another thought - load <code>sys.argv</code> and partition it before passing it to one or more parsers.   You could split it on some key word, or on prefixes etc.  </p>
