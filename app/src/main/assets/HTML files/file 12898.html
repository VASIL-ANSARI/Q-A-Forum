<p>The easiest way to do this, and im pretty sure the GMAIL app is making use of it, are shapes.</p>

<p>Just create a custom <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html#Shape" rel="nofollow">shape</a>, in your case a rectangle shape with rounded corners and a solid color, and assign this drawable then to the background property of your textview.</p>

<p>A shape is defined in xml.
You will assign it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextView
   ...
   android:background="@drawable/my_awesome_shape" /&gt;
</code></pre>
