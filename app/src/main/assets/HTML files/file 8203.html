<p>You are making things more complicated than they're worth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a dedicated object should be tasked with rendering them to the screen...</p>

<p>When you have a task that needs doing it's weird to say that "an object is tasked" with doing the thing.  Functions do things.  Objects encapsulate data.  A function should be tasked with rendering them to the screen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who or what should own the context in this situation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing "owns" the context.  Or, if you like, the canvas owns the context, but I don't know why you would take the context and put it somewhere; I would expect that to be more confusing than just passing it around.</p>

<p>EDIT: Glancing at your code, you've made the Pong closure "own" (have a reference to, that is) the context, which seems reasonable enough.  I don't really see what problems you anticipate with that approach.  I don't agree, however, that you should pass it into the constructor of <code>Ball</code> etc.  I think it's a lot more straightforward to pass it to the various <code>draw()</code> methods.</p>
