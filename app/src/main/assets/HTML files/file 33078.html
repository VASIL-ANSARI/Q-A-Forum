<p>First, there is a circular dependency between the two structures, but -</p>

<p>There is no problem with that when there is forward declaration (e.g. <code>struct dentry;</code> before the definition of struct <code>super_block</code> and vice versa) as both structs use pointers to the other structs and the size of the pointers is known anyway. Using fields of each structure will require its definition beforehand.</p>
