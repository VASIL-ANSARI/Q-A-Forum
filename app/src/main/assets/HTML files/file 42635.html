<p>Your notion of the two ways of creating id's is not correct:</p>

<p><code>+@id</code></p>

<p>You use it whenever you are setting <strong>your own</strong> id to an element. </p>

<p><code>@android:id</code> </p>

<p>You use it when you are setting an id of an element that is <strong>already predefined</strong> in android's framework</p>
