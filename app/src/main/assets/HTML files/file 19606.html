<p><code>dateComps</code> as you calculate it, does not contain a day or month so that <code>setWeekday</code> is just ignored and <code>itemDate</code> is a date on the first January 2012 (which was a Sunday).</p>

<p>To compute the next Saturday, you can proceed as described in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DatesAndTimes/Articles/dtCalendricalCalculations.html" rel="nofollow">Adding Components to a Date</a> of the "Date and Time Programming Guide":</p>

<pre><code>NSCalendar *calendar = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar];

// Weekday of "reminderTime":
NSDateComponents *weekdayComponents = [calendar components:NSWeekdayCalendarUnit fromDate:reminderTime];

// Number of weekdays until next Saturday:
NSDateComponents *componentsToAdd = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
[componentsToAdd setDay: 7 - [weekdayComponents weekday]];

NSDate *itemDate = [calendar dateByAddingComponents:componentsToAdd toDate:reminderTime options:0];
</code></pre>
