<p>To "connect" two scrollable container's scroll event, you can do something like</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('div1').onscroll = function(e) {

  var x = ? /* do your calculation to find the right 'scrollTop' for the 2nd div, according to your logic */

  document.getElementById('div2').scrollTop = x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a simple <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/VdNPs/" rel="nofollow">jsfiddle demo</a> with two <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and an <code>onscroll</code> event handler attached to the 1st one. In the handler function, we calculate the proportion of the height to the scroll position and set the target <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s scroll position so its height has the same proportion to it. The result is that regardless of how much content is in each container, the 2nd <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s scroll position is synchronised with the 1st one. </p>
