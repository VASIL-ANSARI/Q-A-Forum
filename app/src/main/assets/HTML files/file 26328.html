<p>To play next song you need to override <code>setOnCompletionListener</code> for your <code>MediaPlayer</code></p>

<pre><code>myMediaPlayer.setOnCompletionListener(new OnCompletionListener() {           
   public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer player) {          

   player.stop();
   player.reset();
   player.setDataSource(/*  go to your next target*/);
   player.prepare();
   player.start();
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>but if you want to prepare next song and still didn't finish previous, I think you need two <code>MediaPLayer</code> instances.</p>

<p>As I know Android has about 32 channels for audio stream so no worries, just be sure that you stop on finish each mediaplayer </p>
