<p>I lost a lot of time to this trying to figure out what the issue was. In the end I created custom assembly loader to replace the default one.</p>

<p>When I set a break point on this I could see I had a stale assembly in the temporary files which was preventing the correct routes to load.</p>

<p>It now all works out of the box with no extra code as I thought it should!</p>
