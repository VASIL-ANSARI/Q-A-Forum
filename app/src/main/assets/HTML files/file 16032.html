<p>I am not going to write your applet for you, but I'll give you some steps to get you started:</p>

<p>In your init:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set a timer, that calls the refresh method every time. </li>
<li>Set a global counter to 0</li>
</ul>

<p>In your refresh method:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increase the counter by 1 (possibly mod 360 to keep it in the 0-359 range)</li>
<li>Call the repaint method</li>
</ul>

<p>In your paint method:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turn the Canvas the number of degrees the counter is on (possibly
using an AffineTransform object)</li>
<li>Paint your image/square/shape/anything</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck :)</p>
