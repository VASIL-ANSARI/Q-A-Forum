<p>It seems that there is a general issue with this. So I found this solution:
Instead of iterating with pointers, use a regular iterator, and then use these formulation.
    PointIndicesPtr pi_ptr(new PointIndices); 
    pi_ptr->indices = cluster_indices[i].indices; 
    //now can use pi_ptr as input</p>
