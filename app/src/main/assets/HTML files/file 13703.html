<p>There is not built-in way. You should do this on the application level. You can retrieve time using javascript and send this result to server where you can obviously know what time is it. Now compare these results. </p>

<p>The result will be accurate up to the network latency. </p>

<p>If you just want to know the time zone difference it is good enough. If however you want to know the network latency you can estimate it: send client time from client to server, send server time from server to client, take in consideration the time zone offsets. The rest is the client->server->client latency. Divide it by 2 - this is the first estimation of one-way latency. Better estimation requires more statistics.</p>
