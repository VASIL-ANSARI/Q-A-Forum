<p>You would have to use a custom solution for something like this. You won't be able to change the actual native scrollbar height. The plugin you referenced is more along the lines of the route you need to go to acheive the desired results.</p>

<p>Another solution you could implement would be to show the number of results via some other visual method, and not the scrollbar. If you are showing 75 of 100 elements, you could make a fixed div span 75% across the screen.</p>
