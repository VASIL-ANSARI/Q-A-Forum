<p>No it's not.  Replace as many of the <code>[]</code> usages as you can by simple pointer arithmetic to iterate the arrays in question. Abstract out invariant expressions into local variables.</p>

<p>However, the first question is, does your profiler show that this code is a bottleneck in the context of your entire app.  If not, why bother micro-optimizing this?</p>

<p>EDIT: loop micro-optimization - prefer the second as no array indexing required (mult versus add)</p>

<pre><code>int ints[100];
int i;
int *pi;

for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; ++i)
{
  printf("%d", ints[i]);
}

for (pi = ints; pi &lt; ints + 100; ++pi)
{
  printf("%d", *pi);
}
</code></pre>
