<p>You just need to hash what the user typed in exactly the same way that you hashed the password when you stored it. Then, if the hashed password from the database matches the hashed password that the user just typed in, they typed the correct password.</p>

<p>Usually there is a random salt involved so if multiple people use the password "password" the hashed password won't look the same in the database. That has nothing to do with your current question, but should definitely be something you look into before you consider your "storing passwords" solution complete.</p>

<p>Here's an example of some code you might use:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] passwordBytes = Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(userTypedPassword);
//
// This is where you'd normally append or prepend the salt bytes
//
var hasher = System.Security.CryptographySHA256.Create();
byte[] hashedBytes = hasher.ComputeHash(passwordBytes);
</code></pre>

<p>Now it depends on how the hash is stored in the database, if it's just binary data you can compare the byte arrays. If it's stored as a base64 string, you can convert the bytes:</p>

<pre><code>var hashedString = Convert.ToBase64String(hashedBytes);
</code></pre>

<p>...and then do a string comparison between the stored string and <code>hashedString</code>.</p>
