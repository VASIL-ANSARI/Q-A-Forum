<p>I would consider sending a key code to the server. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/AWTKeyStroke.html#getKeyCode%28%29" rel="nofollow"><code>KeyStroke.getKeyCode()</code></a>. This is an integer value.</p>

<p>There are many examples on the Internet of how to send an <code>int</code> from a client to a server (e.g. <a href="http://www.java-forums.org/new-java/5112-send-read-int-client-server-app.html" rel="nofollow">send/read int in a client/server app</a>). Take a look and pick one that matches your use case.</p>
