<p>You may want to load your program into <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" rel="nofollow">Dependency Walker</a> on the XP machine to see what binary is trying to link to msvcrt!_except_handler4_common.</p>

<p><code>msvcrt.dll</code> is a system DLL and is not part of the Visual C++ 2008 (or 2010 - it's not clear which you're using) runtime libraries. VC++ 2008's runtime DLL is named <code>msvcr90.dll</code>, so I'd guess that there's some indirect dependency on msvcrt.dll. You'll need to figure out what binary is trying to use that export from <code>msvcrt.dll</code> and determine if it's even compatible with WinXP or how it can be made compatible.</p>

<p>Note that since <code>msvcrt.dll</code> is a system DLL, it's under Windows' system file protection feature so it generally cannot be updated/modified except by service packs and system updates. </p>

<p>Just for comparison:</p>

<ul>
<li>a machine running WinXP SP3 here has <code>msvcrt.dll</code> version 7.0.2600.5512 - it does not have the <code>_except_handler4_common</code> entry point.</li>
<li>another machine running Win7 SP1 x64 has a 32-bit <code>msvcrt.dll</code> version 7.0.7600.16385, and it does have that entry point.</li>
</ul>
