<li>Probably so. Without seeing more of your class it's impossible to say for certain. But as a rule of thumb, I try to avoid having fields or properties that are disposable (I assume that's how it is, since if it were a local variable, you could use <code>using</code>). It's too hard to manage them, unless your class is also <code>IDisposable</code> and you clean it up in your <code>Dispose()</code> method.</li>
<li>You could refactor these lines into their own method, e.g. <code>DisposeDb()</code>.</li>
