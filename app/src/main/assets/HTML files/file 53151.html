<p>The premise of <code>dynamic_cast</code> is that it uses RTTI (presumably every implementation uses the same underlying data structure to support <code>dynamic_cast</code> and RTTI - the type info has to live somewhere and different representations for the two use cases makes no sense) to make sure that the cast you're attempting is to the correct type at runtime. If the from-class is non-polymorphic, the type information wouldn't be available to the compiler to do the type checking (to decided to return 0 or the converted pointer).</p>
