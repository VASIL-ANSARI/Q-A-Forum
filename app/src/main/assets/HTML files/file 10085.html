<p>As ou can see yourself, <code>sox_open_mem_read</code> is defined like this :</p>

<pre><code>SOX_API sox_open_mem_read(
    LSX_PARAM_IN_BYTECOUNT(buffer_size) void  * buffer,     /* Pointer to audio data buffer (required). */
    size_t                                      buffer_size,/* Number of bytes to read from audio data buffer. */
    LSX_PARAM_IN_OPT sox_signalinfo_t   const * signal,     /* Information already known about audio stream, or NULL if none. */
    LSX_PARAM_IN_OPT sox_encodinginfo_t const * encoding,   /* Information already known about sample encoding, or NULL if none. */
    LSX_PARAM_IN_OPT_Z char             const * filetype);  /* Previously-determined file type, or NULL to auto-detect. */
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to specify the <code>filetype</code> in order to indicate which codec you want <code>libsox</code> to use. Depending on the case, some codec are headerless and libsox can't predict which format it will be.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you may not decode your data properly (if you expect to have some data with a header) leading libsox to confusion.</p>
