<p>There's no element which has 'submit' name. You're submitting two things,  indicated by the <code>name</code> attributes: "password" and "log in". <code>$_POST['...']</code> contains both of them.</p>

<p>If you'd like the function <code>test()</code> to be called upon submit, regardless of what is entered, you'd better add a hidden input field and check for its existence in PHP.</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;input type="hidden" name="some_name"&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>PHP:</p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_POST['some_name']))
{
   test();
} 
</code></pre>
