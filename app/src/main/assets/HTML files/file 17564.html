<p>ID's should be unique.. Using the ID selector - it will only select the first element found with that ID - hence the event handler is only bound to the first button
For your code you can change it to</p>

<pre><code>$("button[name^=id_]").click(function() {
</code></pre>

<p>or change your id's to class and use class selector</p>
