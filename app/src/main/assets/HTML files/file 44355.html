<p>In short, Adaptive Payments doesn't support the notion of authorizing and capturing later.  Further, if the sender goes over to the PayPal website and approves the payment, the payment is going to complete immediately &mdash; regardless of what you set <code>actionType</code> to.  <code>actionType=CREATE</code> is primarily useful for implicit payments -- e.g., those payments where the API caller and the sender are the same party, or payments where you are using a preapproval that the sender has previously approved.</p>
