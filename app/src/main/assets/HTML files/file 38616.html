<p>use GUI.depth=10 before drawing your chat window, and GUI.depth=5 after everything should appaer on top now.</p>

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<p>Set this to determine ordering when you have different scripts running simultaneously. GUI elements drawn with lower depth values will appear on top of elements with higher values (ie, you can think of the depth as "distance" from the camera).</p>

<p>if you dont want to do this.. determine order of drawing. Whatever gets drawn last is on top. </p>

<p>I understand at this stage it may be hard to do this, but its best to have one OnGUI active in your whole game/app. Having more than one deteriorates performance.</p>

<p>edit: to include scene renders on top of the GUI, you render your scene to a seperate camera (without gui) and have this camera render to texture. this texture can then be used in your gui by using for instance GUI.DrawTexture.</p>
