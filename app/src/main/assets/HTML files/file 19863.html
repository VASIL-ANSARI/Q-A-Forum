<p>Assuming you're planning on combing a list of files that exist locally on an RT machine, and not somewhere in that cloud (otherwise we woudln't have to worry about the WinRT doc mod process), You could easily use the Application Data Container provided to each app to store very thin data (key value pairs fit very well).</p>

<p>In this way you would store a future delete date for each file that needed to be persisted, so that the next time it was raised for deletion, before the deletion process occurs, the app checks the App Storage Data. Then you wont need to worry about the permissions of the files you're iterating over, when you're only trying to make sure they don't get deleted from your process.</p>

<pre><code>Windows.Storage.ApplicationDataContainer localSettings = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings;

// Create a setting in a container

Windows.Storage.ApplicationDataContainer container = 
   localSettings.CreateContainer("FilesToPersist", Windows.Storage.ApplicationDataCreateDisposition.Always);

StorageFile file = fileYouWantToPersist; 

if (localSettings.Containers.ContainsKey("FilesToPersist"))
{

   localSettings.Containers["FilesToPersist"].Values[file.FolderRelativeId] = DateTime.Now.AddDays(30);
}

// Read data from a setting in a container

bool hasContainer = localSettings.Containers.ContainsKey("FilesToPersist");
bool hasSetting = false;

if (hasContainer)
{
   hasSetting = localSettings.Containers["FilesToPersist"].Values.ContainsKey(file.FolderRelativeId);
    if(hasSettings)
    {
         string dt =    localSettings.Containers["FilesToPersist"].Values[file.FolderRelativeId];
         if(Convert.ToDateTime(dt) &lt; DateTime.Now)
         {
             //Delete the file
         }
    }
}
</code></pre>
