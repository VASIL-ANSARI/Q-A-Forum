<p>It will be very slow to loop through all permutations of the colors within tolerance: let's say that you have a tolerance of <code>+/- 5</code>, that would require checking 1331 different colors (<code>11 reds * 11 greens * 11 blues</code>).</p>

<p>It is much faster just to change your condition <code>red == 183</code> to something like <code>Math.abs(red - 183) &lt; tolerance</code> or <code>(red &gt;= 183 - tolerance || red &lt;= 183 + tolerance)</code> (similarly for other channels).</p>
