<p>RSS readers only read RSS feeds. RSS feeds are XML documents with a certain standard, so to parse RSS feeds, only a certain number of standards need to be parsed. For more information see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" rel="nofollow">RSS - Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that RSS feeds are XML documents, but not every XML document is a RSS feed.</p>

<p>Reading your questing it looks like you have a variety of different XML documents with their own structure, to parse these you don't really have any other option but to build custom parse logic for each of these.</p>
