<p>I have tried to reproduce your problem. (Just the Hash algorithm)
It seems that this line is not right</p>

<pre><code>plainTextBytes.CopyTo(plainTextWithSaltBytes, salt.Length);  
</code></pre>

<p>Instead you should use </p>

<pre><code>plainTextBytes.CopyTo(plainTextWithSaltBytes, saltBytes.Length);  
</code></pre>

<p>However this gives me an exception not a false on reader.Read.<br>
So it's possible that the problem is something different. 
You should try in debug to stop the program before the reader. 
Read and check the values of @username and @password.<br>
With that info, using your preferred MySql Manager, check if the User table contains exactly the values in the parameters.</p>
