<p>After a long time, I fixed my problem!
I discovered that it works if i <strong>write the following code</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;div ng-include="'posts/testPost.html'" class="ng-binding"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Don't ask me for the theory part behind this, because I haven't still understand completely how it works.</p>
