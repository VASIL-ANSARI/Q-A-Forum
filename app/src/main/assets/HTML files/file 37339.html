<p>It looks like your problem is here:</p>

<pre><code> etResultPrice.setTag(currentOrderedProductItem);
</code></pre>

<p>If you tried to remove the TextWatcher and it still has problems, it references the Tag and if you don't reset your tag properly with a recycled view, you will have problems. In particular, it looks like you are trying to reset it, but not doing it properly because when views are recycled, they should go in order. That means that when you scroll back up, your lines:</p>

<pre><code> expected "3" -- actual "12"
 expected "4" -- actual "11"
 expected "5" -- actual "5"
 expected "6" -- actual "6"
</code></pre>

<p>On "expected "4' -- actual "11" " - your logic for reseting the Tag must be wrong because it should be recycling "14" - so it's not the recycling that is a problem, it's the logic you are using to perform the recycling. Your code is assuming this is item #11 like in the initial scroll instead of recognizing that it should be #4.</p>

<p>Probably somewhere with this: when you create a view, you do this:</p>

<pre><code> view.setTag(h);
</code></pre>

<p>But in your logic, you also do this:</p>

<pre><code>h.etResultPrice.setTag(h.orderedProductItem);
</code></pre>

<p>This appears recursive and could be out of sync if you have something wrong in your view holder.</p>
