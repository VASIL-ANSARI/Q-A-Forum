<p>My intial thought (other than I've not seen this) is that an exception is potentially quite a large object (containing the stacktrace) and I'd prefer <em>not</em> to store a lot of them.</p>

<p>I would instead build a list of the erroneous parameters/arguments as exceptions occur, and upon completion of the loop, throw a custom exception populated with this list (if the list has more than 0 elements). That would seem a more manageable way of handling this scenario.</p>

<pre><code>public void myFunction() throws CustomException {
    List&lt;MyError&gt; errors = new ArrayList&lt;MyError&gt;();
    while(stuff) {
        try {
            DoSomething() // throws an exception
        }
        catch (Exception ex) {
            errors.add(new MyError(some, stuff, of, mine, ex));
        }
    }
    if (errors.size() &gt; 0) {
       throw new CustomException(errors);
    }
}
</code></pre>
