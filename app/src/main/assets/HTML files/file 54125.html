<p>Where to start... first don't parse the <code>InnerHtml</code> into a document each time. This is not only highly inefficient, but also unreliable as the <code>InnerHtml</code> may have more than one element, which is invalid as HTML or XML document (single rooted). And fragments are not documents anyways.</p>

<p>I'd use XPath to find and select elements, check for specific patterns or extract values from the parsed (main) document. There are plenty of resources for that, just search for <code>XPath HtmlAgilityPack</code> here on SO or in Google (I'm not posting links since these may become invalid at any time).</p>

<p>Possible XPath to select the <code>td</code> nodes with the same constraint you have defined:</p>

<pre><code>//tr[contains(@class,'notranslate')]/td
</code></pre>
