<p>I don't understand why you opted for this choice. Anyways, your need can be achieved in few lines only. First add a class to your formpanel(If not any). For e.g. <code>cls: 'form-panel'</code> </p>

<p>In controller, take the reference of xtype of the container which contains the form. Say for example <code>formContainer: 'formcontainer'</code></p>

<p>Now you can catch the formpanel with this line in controller: </p>

<p><code>this.getFormContainer().element.down('.form-panel');</code></p>

<p>Tell me it helps you or not.</p>
