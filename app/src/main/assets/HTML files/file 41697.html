<p>This is not possible using javascript running inside the browser. You will not be able to do anything outside the browser.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You could run a Node.js server though that runs on localhost and does your file operations you desire. You could build a API so your html page that you load in the browser calls your serverscript to do your file operations. </p>

<p>Do you understand what I mean?</p>
