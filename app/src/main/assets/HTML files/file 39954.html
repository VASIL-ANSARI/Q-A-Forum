<p>You can either add a navigation bar to the screen, or if you really do not need that, you can move the top of the <code>tableview</code> down by 20 points to adjust for the status bar.  In iOS7+ the status bar is put over the screen.  It is part of the OS design, where prior versions would move everything down.</p>

<p>As stated in a comment below, the status bar might not always be 20.0f.  You could check programmatically on <code>viewWillAppear</code> and adjust the tableview frame accordingly.  To get the status bar height programmatically you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarFrame.size.height
</code></pre>

<p>As some answers have posted, you could edit the content inset of the tableview but I do not recommend this because when you scroll the content, it will still go underneath the status bar.</p>
