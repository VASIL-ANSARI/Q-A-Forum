<p>If I'm not mistaken the problem lies here:</p>

<pre><code>model = new QStandardItemModel(max_files, 1, this);
</code></pre>

<p>You try to create a <code>QStandardItemModel</code> passing your <code>Form</code> instance <code>this</code> as a parent, the form was created on the main thread, this call apparently happens on another thread (the edits you made were not enough, it is still unclear if <code>RbObject</code> inherits <code>QThread</code> but you could check that yourself) and thus the error message. </p>

<p>Why not call the function on the main thread? Instead of doing this</p>

<pre><code>f-&gt;show();
entered_ui = 1;

// Geting the Files from Directory
f-&gt;my_setCFGFromDirectory();
</code></pre>

<p>in a different thread, make a slot/signal pair for the <code>Form</code> class, put this code in the slot and fire the connected signal from <code>RbObject45000::exec()</code>. It is not correct to do UI manipulation from a non-UI trhead.</p>
