<p>Your <code>Person</code> class has several properties including <code>weightInKilos</code>, <code>heightInMeters</code>, and <code>employeeID</code>.</p>

<p>You can, of course, set each property individually. As a convenience, you can provide special "helper" methods that make it easier to set several properties in one call. This is completely optional. Whether you choose to add these extra methods is strictly a matter of personal taste and style.</p>

<p>One consideration for such "helper" methods is where to draw the line. Which properties should be parameters to such methods? What happens if you later add another property? Do you update the "helper" methods to take another parameter and then update all code calling those methods?</p>

<p>In many cases it's better to just set each one individually. One guideline I use for deciding on whether to create such a "helper" method is if the object requires a certain set of properties to be set to be valid. If there is such a case then I usually create a special <code>init</code> method that takes the required properties as parameters. Then all of the optional ones can be set individually.</p>
