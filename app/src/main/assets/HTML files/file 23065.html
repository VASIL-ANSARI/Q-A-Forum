<p>Altough I have little experience with wav devices in c#, I would think your problem is related to not closing the device when your program closes.</p>

<p>You need a call like </p>

<pre><code>WavMethods.waveOutClose(m_pWavDevHandle);
</code></pre>

<p>somewhere before your application exits (it's obviously not needed if the waveOutoOpen call failed)</p>
