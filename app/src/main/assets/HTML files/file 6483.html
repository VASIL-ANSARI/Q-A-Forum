<p>The <em>only</em> way to create a <code>Tutor</code> for an existing <code>User</code> is to use a <em>stored procedure</em>; <em>not</em> a stored procedure that is wired up to the Tutor entity through mappings, but a separate one that can be called explicitly from the code.
<br> 
Ideally it would be a SP that takes a UserId as a parameter, inserts a new row into the table using that UserId, and then returns a complete Tutor object so that it can be used immidiately.</p>
