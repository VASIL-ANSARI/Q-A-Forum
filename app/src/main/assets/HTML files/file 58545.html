<p>I am not sure if you are required to use an array or not, but if you are free to use whatever data structure you like I would recommend a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html" rel="nofollow">TreeSet</a>. This data structure implements SortedSet which means as the objects are added they are sorted already for you. Then you can use methods such as</p>

<ul>
<li>first() - to return the lowest value</li>
<li>last() - to return the highest value</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you could remove those highest and lowest elements or use these methods after that</p>

<ul>
<li>ceiling(int) - highest number lower than given int</li>
<li>floor(int) - smallest number higher than given int</li>
</ul>

<p>Lmk if you need more help or just need an implementation for an array.</p>
