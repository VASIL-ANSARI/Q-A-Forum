<p>I found the issue. The package name is hardcoded in the pre-compiled .so files. So instead of using a custom package name like com.XXX.XXX one has to put the SerialPort (and other implementing classes) in a top-level package directly under the /java folder. The package name should be exactly android_serialport_api -- just like in the library sample.</p>
