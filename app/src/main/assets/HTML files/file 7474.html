<p>This (as usual) is explained in the <a href="http://c-faq.com/aryptr/pass2dary.html">c faq</a>. In a nutshell, <strong>an array decays to a pointer only once</strong> (after it decayed, the resulting pointer won't further decay).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An array of arrays (i.e. a
  two-dimensional array in C) <strong>decays
  into a pointer to an array, not a
  pointer to a pointer</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easiest way to solve it:</p>

<pre><code>int **array; /* and then malloc */
</code></pre>
