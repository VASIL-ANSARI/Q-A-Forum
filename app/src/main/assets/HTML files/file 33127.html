<p>For your first question, I think what you are looking for is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body onload="myFunction()"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will execute your function, once your  element has been loaded.</p>

<p>The enter key is usually bound to a  object, but in your instance you don't have one - and even if you did, you don't want a POST or GET to happen. To get around this, simply bind a method to your function that will execute your Ajax call.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input id="password" name="password" type="password" maxlength="50" size="25" onkeydown="if (event.keyCode == 13) document.getElementById('btnSearch').click()"/&gt;
</code></pre>
