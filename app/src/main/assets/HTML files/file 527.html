<p>If you are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven" rel="nofollow">Maven</a> user, typically the assembly plugin do what you want, or potentially the shade plugin, and in some cases a combination.</p>

<p>With the assembly plugin you put a manifest file in your project with any necessary settings, although the defaults are usually quite good. Building is then done with</p>

<pre><code>mvn assembly:assembly
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you have more special things to deal with, one of the other goals. All JAR files to include, are picked up by Maven's dependency resolver. If you use the shade plugin, it is typically part of the install goal, and in one particular project I'm doing now I do</p>

<pre><code>mvn install
mvn assembly:single
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>assembly:single</code> goal is to work around lifetime issues, in this case in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework" rel="nofollow">Spring</a> application.</p>
