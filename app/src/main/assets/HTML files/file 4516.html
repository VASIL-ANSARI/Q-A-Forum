<p>Regular expressions are strings. So you can do anything you want to build them: concatenate them (using + operator), interpolation (using % operator), etc. Just concatenate the variables you want to match with the regex you want to use:</p>

<pre><code>begin_tag + ".*?" + end_tag
</code></pre>

<p>The only pitfall is when your variables contain characters that might be taken by the regular expression engine to have special meaning. You need to make sure they are escaped properly in that case. You can do this with the <code>re.escape()</code> function.</p>

<p>The usual caveat ("don't parse HTML with regular expressions") applies.</p>
