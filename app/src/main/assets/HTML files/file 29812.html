<p>I don't think you really want to run this query:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE 2_1_paidused SET Active=0 WHERE NumberRenamed IN ('40,41')
</code></pre>

<p>You possibly want to use <strong>two</strong> parameters:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE 2_1_paidused SET Active=0 WHERE NumberRenamed IN (?, ?)
</code></pre>

<p>... and then call <code>execute()</code> with a two-item array.</p>
