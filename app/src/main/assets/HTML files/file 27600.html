<p>The events parameter is simply the first parameter passed to the event handler/method. Just pass that on:</p>

<pre><code>auditFileUpload.bind("select",  function(events) { uploadSelectfunction(events, "CSV"  
</code></pre>

<p>In the original version uploadSelectfunction is simply a pointer to a function that happens to take one argument. That events argument is defined inside the select event.</p>

<p>If you put an inline method instead (as you have done) you need to accept the events parameter, and pass it on to your code.</p>
