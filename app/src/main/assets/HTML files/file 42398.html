Too late for the original poster I'm sure, but for future readers here's your solution.</p>

<p>If you're using jquery you need to set a longer timeout value for your async request to complete.  This <a href="https://mashupweb.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/you-should-always-add-timeout-to-you-ajax-call-in-jquery/" rel="nofollow">blog entry</a> provides one method of doing this.  In your case you're not logging in, but the example should give you what you need.  Quoting the post...</p>

<pre><code>function SuccessFunction(data, status) {

          var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(data.d);
          if (obj.Success == âtrueâ) {
              writeConsole(âlogging inâ);
              $.ajax({
                  type: âGETâ,
                  url: â&lt;% Response.Write(url); %&gt;?â + obj.UserNameAndPassword,
                  dataType: âjsonpâ,
                  complete: function() {
                      $.mobile.changePage(â#successâ, { transition: âfadeâ });
                  },
                  timeout: 5000 // sets timeout to 5 seconds
              });
          }
          else {
              $(â#popupFailâ).popup(âopenâ, { transition: âfadeâ });
              writeConsole(âlogin failure â);
          }
          return;
      }
</code></pre>

<p>...I recommend finding a way to centralize this value rather than sprinkling it arbitrarily throughout your scripts.  Be careful not to pick a timeout that is too short in constrained environments. Your development experience is almost always better then the experience in the wild.</p>
