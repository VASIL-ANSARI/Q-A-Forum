<p>You could have an array and <code>push()</code> stuff you need, but when the string is made, it won't change anymore.</p>

<pre><code>var array = ['whatever',i,'there are ',i,' dogs in the yard.'];
array.push('more stuff');
array.push('even more stuff');
var string = array.join('')
//string = 'whatever[whatever "i" is during join]there are[whatever "i" is during join]dogs in the yard.more stuffeven more stuff'
</code></pre>
