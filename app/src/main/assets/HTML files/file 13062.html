<p>It seems like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition" rel="nofollow">Race Condition</a>. To avoid this you should synchronize an access to the shared variables.</p>

<ul>
<li>If CheckSuccess is a field - try out marking it by <code>volatile</code> keyword.</li>
<li><p>If <code>CheckSuccess</code> is a property (which will be translated to a method call) you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c5kehkcz%28v=VS.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">lock() statement</a>:</p>

<pre><code>private static readonly object stateLock = new object();
lock (stateLock)
{
    // access a shared variable here
    CheckSuccess  = false;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If <code>CheckSuccess</code> is a property of UI control and you want changing it from a worker thread - you should use special techniques to push changes from a worker to the UI thread, it depends on which framework you are using WinForms of WPF.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong>
Also if you have multiple threads reading a value and few threads writing (basically reads more often than writing) you may find useful <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.readerwriterlock.aspx" rel="nofollow">ReaderWriterLock</a></p>
