<p>There's a few things there that look wrong to me.</p>

<p>1  This isn't needed since the binding will do that for you.  If you put a breakpoint here, you should see that dayView.Collection and e.NewValue are already the same.</p>

<pre><code>dayView.Collection = e.NewValue as AppointmentCollections;
</code></pre>

<p>2  This also isn't needed.  I think this is probably the main culprit since you're changing the DataContext to where "DayOneAppointmentCollections" no longer exists.  </p>

<pre><code>dayView.DataContext = dayView.Collection;
</code></pre>

<p>3  In SetupControl be sure to unsubscribe from the old collection.</p>
