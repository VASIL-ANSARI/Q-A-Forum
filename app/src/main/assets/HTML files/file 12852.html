<p>Use a StringReader to read the input string, a StringBuilder to write the mail content.</p>

<p>Read <code>x</code> chars into a char array, append this array to the StringBuilder, rinse, repeat until there isn't anything to read anymore.</p>

<p>However this will break words. Which means you probably need to refine this process by finding the last index of a space character. StringReader supports <code>mark()</code> and <code>reset()</code>, use this. </p>
