<p>I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish, but it looks like you want to call two different interface methods, each named <code>init</code>, and each passed view(s) of any sub-type. Would this suit your needs?</p>

<pre><code>public interface BaseFragmentPresenter
{
    void init(View view);
    void init(View view, View relativeView);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>View</code> will allow you to pass in a view of any type.</p>
