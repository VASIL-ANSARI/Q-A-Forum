<p>While creating index of model for elasticsearch use tokenizer on index which will fulfil your requirement. For. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>tokenizer: {
              :name_tokenizer =&gt; {type: "edgeNGram", max_gram: 100, min_gram: 3, side: "front"}
           }
</code></pre>

<p>this will create tokens of size from 3 to 100 of your fields and as side is given as front it will check from the starting.
