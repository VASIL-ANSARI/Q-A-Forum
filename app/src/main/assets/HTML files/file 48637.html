<p>You could use any number of permutation values. The reason powers of two are preferred is, because it is cheaper to compute the modulus of N^2. </p>

<p>The reason for that is:</p>

<pre><code>value % (N^2)
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>value &amp; (N^2 - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>And it is much cheaper to compute a bitwise &amp; instead of a %.</p>

<p>For example in your code you could write this:</p>

<pre><code>int v = perm[(x + perm[y % 256]) % 256];
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>int v = perm[(x + perm[y &amp; 255]) &amp; 255];
</code></pre>

<p>Both give you the same result but the second method is faster.</p>

<p>Of course any power of two can be used for this. I think the reason for choosing 256 is that it is a good balance between variety of pseudo random numbers and low memory consumption.</p>
