<p>The <code>libs</code> folder should be a subfolder of <code>app</code>. Instead you have it buried in <code>app/src/main</code>. Note that you already have a dependency for the <code>libs</code> folder if you put it in the correct place.</p>

<p>When you use a file manager or the command line to move files to your Android Studio project, you sometimes need to synchronize the folder structure by right clicking in the Project pane and clicking Synchronize in the popup menu.</p>
