<p>But here you are submitting the form using normal postback. So, when user clicks on "Send", page will postback and server side code i.e, send email and database insertions gets executed. If it is AJAX page, after user clicks on submit link, then innerHTML property of the link can be changed to "Please wait" and after receiving response from server, change back to "Send".</p>
