<p>I think, in a majority of cases like this, you'll probably want to put your logic in the getter.</p>

<p>If <code>condition X</code> can change whether it's true or false at any time, the value of your property should update to reflect this no matter when it's read, then you should put you logic in the getter.</p>

<p>The other option will only update the property when it's set, so if you set the property, and then <code>condition X</code> changes at some point, followed by a read of your property, then the value of the property that is returned does not truly reflect the state of <code>condition X</code>. However, there <em>might</em> be some cases where you want this behavior.</p>
