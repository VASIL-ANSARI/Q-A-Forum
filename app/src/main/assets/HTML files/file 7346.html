<p>Ok so we finally got to where we could see some code, so note this:</p>

<pre><code>MySqlConnection objMyCon1 = new MySqlConnection(); 
objMyCon1.Open(); 
</code></pre>

<p>What is objMyCon1 supposed to open?  You haven't given your object any information about what it's supposed to do.  It's a MySqlConnection, sure, but it needs to know where your database is before it can connect.</p>
