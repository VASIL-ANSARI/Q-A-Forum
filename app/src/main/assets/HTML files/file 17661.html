<p>That's not the correct way to add a viewController's view hierarchy to a window.</p>

<p>In iOS 4 and above you should set it as the <code>rootViewController</code></p>

<pre><code>externalWindow.rootViewController = externalViewController;
</code></pre>

<p>It's also probably worth noting that you are not actually loading the viewController from a storyboard.</p>
