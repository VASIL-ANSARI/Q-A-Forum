<li>Download it. I would suggest <a href="http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/" rel="nofollow">ASIHTTPRequest</a> for that task.<br>
parse the RSS-feed. you can do so by normal XML-parsing, or you use a specialized parser. <a href="https://github.com/mwaterfall/MWFeedParser" rel="nofollow">MWFeedParser</a> would be one option.  </li>
<li>Save the dates. either by using CoreData, or <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/EventKitProgGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009765" rel="nofollow">Event Kit Framework</a></li>
