<h1>Updated Answer:</h1>

<p>As described in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12606867/1366033">answer</a>, The problem is, your browser always wants to scroll your anchor to the exact top of the window. If you set your anchor where your text actually begins, it will be occluded by your menu bar. </p>

<p><em>Instead</em>, set the <code>padding-top</code> for the container to the amount offset you want, and the <code>margin-top</code> for the container to the <strong><em>opposite</em></strong> of the padding-top. Now the container's block and the anchor begin at the exact top of the page, but the content inside doesn't begin until below the menu bar.</p>

<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>section {
    padding-top: 60px;
    margin-top: -60px;
}
</code></pre>
