<p>I think your inheritance model is backwards. It sounds like you want "Item" to be the "leaf" subclass, but you say "ParentItem inherits from Item".  Item should actually inherit from ParentItem and so on.</p>

<p>In terms of OO design, it really depends how the arrays "in the background" will be used. Are these unique lists for each class instance? Are they static lists who are actually shared amongst all your class instances or among just one type of class instances? If it's the former, having an internal member variable to store these arrays for each instance makes sense. If it's the latter, you're really talking about, in classical OO terms, static member variables. That can be achieved by attaching the static member to the Constructor object as a normal attribute (and accessed as such), instead of on the prototype or assigned to "this" in the constructor. An example:</p>

<pre><code>function A(name) {
this.name = name;
}

A.prototype.doStuff = function() {
 A.staticList.push(this.name);
};

A.staticList = [];

var x = new A('foo');
var y = new A('bar');

x.doStuff();
y.doStuff();

A.staticList; // contains ['foo', 'bar']
</code></pre>
