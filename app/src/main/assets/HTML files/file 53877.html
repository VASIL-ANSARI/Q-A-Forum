<p>Although this is not a complete answer to your question, the problem probably lies in the fact that you're not doing anything with the array returned by the method. You're simply discarding it right away. If you change your code to</p>

<pre><code>ctrl = new Controller();
Configuration[] config = ctrl.tbl_bus("bustype", "CUS");
</code></pre>

<p>you will be able to reference the array later on.</p>

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(config.Length);
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use it to set any properties you like.</p>
