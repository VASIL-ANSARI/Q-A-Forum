<p>If you want to know how much RAM your application can use looks at <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getMemoryClass%28%29" rel="nofollow">ActivityManager.getMemoryClass</a>. </p>

<p>There is this limitation on the memory an application can have so that an application cannot steal all memory from other applications. Basically your app shouldn't be able to kill other applications. At least as long as you don't use the option "large heap size" in your app. </p>

<p>The limitation per application is like 16 (on G1) to 48 MB. It depends heavily on the total RAM of your device how much your memory your app can have. The 48 MB for example apply for 1GB RAM.</p>

<p>A method for getting the current memory usage of your app is to look at logcat. It will say something like</p>

<pre><code>GC_CONCURRENT freed 1109K, 12% free 10115K/11463K, paused 5ms+2ms
</code></pre>

<p>meaning your program takes uproughly 11 MB of RAM.</p>
