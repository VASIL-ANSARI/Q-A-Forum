  <p>One simple approach could be to create all this three component to accept an User object and implement in this way:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>public class FirstComponent {
  private User user;

  public FirstComponent(User user) {
    this.user = user;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this way, we need to create ALL the component after the user is setup, and not when they are needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is just not true. This simple approach is what dependency injection is all about. The trick is to chose the right scope for your <code>User</code> object. </p>

<p>Basically whenever you create a class and you write a <code>new</code> somewhere add the Object you wanted to create as an Argument to the constructor. An exception would be Containers like a <code>List</code> or an <code>Array</code>. This way all the Dependencies are gone. </p>

<p>The problem is that you might end up with a ton of <code>Singleton</code> Objects and to avoid that you can create <code>Builder</code> classes that steer the way through Object creation. </p>

<p>This way the creation process is independant from the class logic and the classes will be way easier to unit test with mocked objects.</p>
