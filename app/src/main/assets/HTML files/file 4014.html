<p>You can use <code>LIMIT</code> in a <code>DELETE</code> request if you are using MySQL ^^</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry it's not enough</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MySQL-specific LIMIT row_count option to DELETE tells the server the maximum number of rows to be deleted before control is returned to the client. This can be used to ensure that a given DELETE statement does not take too much time. You can simply repeat the DELETE statement until the number of affected rows is less than the LIMIT value.</p>
