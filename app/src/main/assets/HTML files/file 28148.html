<p>The query would wind up looking something like this (keep in mind, though, that you'll have to change your field names to match since they look a little mangled):</p>

<pre><code>var locations = from c in Customers
                join ca in CustomerAddresses
                on new { c.CustomerAddressId, 0 } 
                    equals new { ca.CustomerAddressId, ca.PrioritySeq }
                select new Location
                {
                    CustomerNumber = c.MasterCustomerId,
                    City = ca.City,
                    State = ca.State,
                    Country = ca.Country,
                    AddressLocCode = ca.AddressLocCode,
                    AddressStatus = ca.AddressStatus
                };
</code></pre>
