<pre><code>password = test123


if password == raw_input('What is the password?'):
    print("Acces given")
else:
    print("Acces forbidden")
</code></pre>

<p>else need to be exactly below if statement. So, you need to unindent else, like i did. Python is about indentation, every thing in one indentation is   ranked same. So, in your case the else statement resides inside if. and the rule is you can't have else without if. So, it is giving error.</p>
