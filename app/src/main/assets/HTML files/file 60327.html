<p>I got this to work. I checked my previous app, which used jQuery for the AJAX calls. When I replaced <code>fetch</code> with <code>jquery-ujs</code>, it worked! I saw my problem was that it had not been sending the session cookie with the request. I researched how to do this with <code>isomorphic-fetch</code>, and found the <a href="https://github.github.io/fetch/#Headers" rel="nofollow">github/fetch</a> documentation. When I structure my request like this, it works:</p>

<pre><code>fetch('/my_resource.json?param=someparam', {
  'credentials': 'same-origin'
})
</code></pre>

<p>Gotta send the cookies.</p>
