<p>You can use roles to indicate which users are teachers and which are headmasters, so that teachers have rights to add students, but I wouldn't use the role provider for the teacher/student relationship. Instead, create a relationship in the database that connects students to teachers, and set up code in your the web page for viewing students so that if the current user is a teacher, only students tied to the current user are accessible.</p>
