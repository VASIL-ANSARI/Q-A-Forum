<p><strong>ANSWERED</strong></p>

<p>I auto answered with some investigations...</p>

<p>It's seem to be the Eloquent request...</p>

<p>I did a mistake. I tried to update the primary key, but primary key with "13" or "14" doesn't exists in my DB.</p>

<p>But I tried to use Eloquent after correcting this mistake, but it doesn't works again...</p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>I change that by :</p>

<pre><code>DB::table('cronEvent')
  -&gt;where('state_id', $state-&gt;id)
  -&gt;update(array('h' =&gt; 10));
</code></pre>

<p>I used the Query Builder Instead of the Eloquent, and it's works !</p>
