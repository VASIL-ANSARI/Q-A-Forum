<p>Such a program would be composed of three parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acquire the questions</li>
</ul>

<p>The questions would have to be in a file with something like</p>

<pre><code>What is the capital of Arkansas? Little Rock
</code></pre>

<p>Put them all in a text file, one per line. Read them in to an array of strings, like in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13035743/4759917">this answer</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Print out random questions from the array and accept inputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't forget to split it into the question and answer based on the location of the <code>?</code>. This means you'll need only one ? per question. If the answer meets the answer after the ?, increment your correct counter. Either way, increment your total counter.</p>

<ul>
<li>compare the results</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end, give the user a report of how many they got right or wrong.</p>

<p>Each of these are simple problems you can tackle one at a time, until you have your complete solution. :-)</p>

<p>When you're done, look at the </p>
