<p>Non technical answer (eg, not writing all your code for you)</p>

<p>You've currently got the code that says <code>$max = (page number-1) * length of page</code></p>

<p>-if page = 1, then max = 0, so there is no data for page 1</p>

<p>-for page 2, you'd have 1 page length of stuff</p>

<p>-for page 3, you'd have 2 page lengths of stuff</p>

<p>clearly - this isnt what you meant. What you meant to do was select the number of rows from end of previous page, to the end of the current page. MSSQL is less good at this</p>

<p>firstly</p>

<p>you need a min and max. to show from</p>

<p><code>$min = (page number -1 * pagelength)+1</code>
(eg not the same record at end of one page and the beginning of the next)
<code>$max = page number * pagelength</code></p>

<p>if page length was 5, a page view might be min record 21, and max 25</p>

<p>you can then use SQL like
<code>SELECT  *
FROM    ( &lt;your query here&gt;
        ) AS RowConstrainedResult
WHERE   RowNum &gt;= $min
    AND RowNum &lt; $max
ORDER BY RowNum</code></p>

<p>your current select statement only gets a blog id - so its going to be a rather boring page but.. thats your call - but hopefully you get the idea.</p>

<p>You would also need to know the number of records, as you'd need to decide if there are more pages after all.</p>
