<p>Because its prototypical inheritance.</p>

<p>The following would work:</p>

<pre><code>myClass.prototype.age = 22;

var myobj = new myClass();
window.alert(myobj.age);
</code></pre>

<p>In your example you are adding properties to the class prototype. You only see these when you instantiate an object of that class.</p>

<p>To achieve what you want, just rely on an expando property:</p>

<pre><code>myClass.age = 22;

window.alert(myClass.age);
</code></pre>

<p>If its helpful, think of the first sample as declaring a public property on a class in C#. You can only access it when you instantiate. </p>

<p>The second example is like declaring a public <code>static</code> property on a class in C#. You don't need to instantiate it to access it.</p>

<p>EDIT FOR COMMENT</p>

<p>To access the age from within a method in the class, use this <code>this</code></p>

<pre><code>myClass.prototype.GetAge = function(){
    alert(this.age);
}
</code></pre>
