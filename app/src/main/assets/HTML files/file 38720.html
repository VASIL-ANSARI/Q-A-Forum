<p>I could be off-base, but might it be best to use an Observer/Subscriber pattern in this case? If you did that, you could return each document that is ready to the subscriber when it's ready and not worry with building a List of any kind at all. If the caller wants a List or to store some document, it's up to the caller. Otherwise, you just go get the next document and let the subscriber worry with whatever it wants to worry with.</p>
