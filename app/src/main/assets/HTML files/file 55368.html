<p>You don't <em>debug</em> in the Chrome console. You <em>do</em> debug in the Chrome debugger. And if you are stopped at a breakpoint in the debugger, you can use the console to change the value of any in-scope variable by assigning to it.</p>

<p>For instance, open dev tools and run this code, reading the comments:</p>

<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function foo() {
  var bar = 42;
  // Normally, you don't have to use a hardcoded breakpoint like
  // the one that follows, you can set a breakpoint from within the
  // debugger just by navigating to the line of code and clicking in
  // the left-hand gutter. But in Stack Snippets the easiest way to
  // do one is to use the debugger statement:
  debugger;
  // Now, when stopped on the breakpoint, type this in the console:
  // bar = 67;
  // ...and press Enter.
  // Then hit the arrow button to allow the script to continue
  console.log(bar); // ...and this will log 67 instead of 42.
}
foo();</code></pre>
