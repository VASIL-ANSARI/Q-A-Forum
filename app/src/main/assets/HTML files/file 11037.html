<p>Your syntax is incorrect. Which column has to be <code>LIKE \'%".$s."%\'</code>? Say that column is <code>colname</code>. Your query should be:</p>

<pre><code>$sql = "SELECT * FROM test WHERE colname LIKE \'%".$s."%\'";  
</code></pre>

<p>Looking back over your code you're also doing something /really weird/. That PHP there is being executed /before the javascript ever is sent to the client/. PHP runs serverside, JS runs clientside, so JS can't pass parameters to PHP.</p>
