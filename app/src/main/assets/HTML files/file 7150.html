<p>The problem is that you are trying to launch using only the Java part of the launcher, while the wiki page describes the arguments for the native part of the launcher (eclipse.exe or any name you want).</p>

<p>The launcher.ini describes how to setup the Java process (memory size, vm location, arguments to vm, etc.). So, it makes sense that you pass refernece to the launcher.ini to the native launcher.</p>
