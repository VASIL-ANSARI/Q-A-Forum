<p>Been through this exactly. You will experience that glitch no matter what you do. Reason being how <code>AVQueuePlayer</code> works. It loads the next item when the previous ends. So if your videos are big, you may also see that blank screen for 2-3 seconds. One solution is what you mentioned, i.e. using two <code>AVQueuePlayer</code>. But as you said its not working for you, and even if you make it work, it will be clumsy. </p>

<p>A better and clean solution is <code>AVMutableComposition</code>. It may look complex at first but its fast and one time task. You create a composition of all of your videos and play it in a simple <code>AVPlayer</code>. And in your case, I assume you just have to play it, so you don't even have to export it.</p>

<p>To know how to use <code>AVMutableComposition</code>, go through this <a href="http://blog.scottlogic.com/2014/11/10/Video-Stitching-With-AVFoundation.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>. It will explain with exact code you need.</p>
