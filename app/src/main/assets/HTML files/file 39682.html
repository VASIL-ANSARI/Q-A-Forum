<p>Once I also wondered you question, and have read source code of quite a lot of CRXs. But finally I found they all use the same approach: construct HTML with JS, and inject to page via content_script. Unlike the "popup" for browser_action, there seems no way to store HTML to a .html file and include to the page.</p>

<p>And one more thing, if you want to use XHR to request a .html in your CRX, it might fail because of the CORS policy. CRX has special origins like <strong>chrome-extension://...</strong>, that's obviously cross origin with <strong>http</strong> or <strong>https</strong>.</p>
