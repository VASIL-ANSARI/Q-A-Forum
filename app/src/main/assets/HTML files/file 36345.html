<p>Its a delimited string/file. Flat file systems use this feature to seperate data, ie into columns. They usually go by /n (new line) for each row. Not a Java guy so Im hoping someone else can explain it with code. You would break up the fields and add them to your database. Hope it helps at least a bit. </p>
