<p>Solution: Feri got the right answer (but opted not to submit his solution as an answer). By unloading the Common project, and then reloading it, the problem went away. All references to the namespace were corrected, and everything works smoothly again. However, the problem seems to come back whenever I close/reopen VS. Unloading/reloading the project fixes it each time though. </p>
