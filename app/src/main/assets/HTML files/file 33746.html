<p>You have missanderstanding in working with pointers.
It's should be:</p>

<pre><code>*image = imageInDict;
</code></pre>

<p>Also you download image asynchroniously, and yours variable located in function call stack is already destroyed, when you try assign value to it. You should better use <code>UIImageView*</code> or some other objective-c class that have <code>UIImage*</code> in properties instead <code>UIImage**</code></p>
