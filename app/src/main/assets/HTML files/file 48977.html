<p>It's part of the JSLint specification. The exact reason I'm not sure (you'd have to ask the jslint devs). If you use the "assume a browser" option it will add common globals for you but <code>window</code> <a href="http://www.jslint.com/help.html" rel="nofollow">isn't one of them</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>browser</code></p>
  
  <p><code>true</code> if the standard browser globals should be predefined. This option will reject the use of import and export. This option also disallows the file form of the 'use strict' pragma. <strong>It does not supply <code>self</code> or <code>window</code>; you will have to request these aliases of the dreaded global object yourself.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(my emphasis)</em></p>

<p>You'll have to add</p>

<pre><code>/*global
window, self
*/
</code></pre>

<p>...to tell JSLint about them.</p>
