<p>In C++11, use <code>nullptr</code>. </p>

<p>It is true that they are both correct and equivalent in this case, since both are <em>null pointer constants</em> as specified by paragraph 4.10/1 (<code>NULL</code> is usually <code>#define</code>d to be <code>0</code>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <em>null pointer constant</em> is an integral constant expression (5.19) prvalue of integer type that evaluates to
  zero or a prvalue of type <code>std::nullptr_t</code>. A null pointer constant can be converted to a pointer type; the
  result is the <em>null pointer value</em> of that type and is distinguishable from every other value of object pointer or
  function pointer type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, <code>nullptr</code> is recognized by the type system as <strong>the</strong> pointer literal of type <code>nullptr_t</code> and as a special null pointer constant, so its semantics are clear both to you and to the compiler. <code>NULL</code>, on the other hand, is just a macro that is known to expand to zero.</p>
