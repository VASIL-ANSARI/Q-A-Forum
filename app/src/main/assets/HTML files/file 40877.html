<p>If you could run arbitrary code for an arbitrarily long amount of time when closing the page, that could be an opportunity for abuse. I wouldnât be surprised if older browsers supported it, but new browsers stopped supporting it for security reasons.</p>

<p>If you want to prompt someone whether they really want to exit the web page, you can use <code>onbeforeunload</code>, returning a prompt message:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body onbeforeunload="return 'I\'ll miss you!';"&gt;
</code></pre>
