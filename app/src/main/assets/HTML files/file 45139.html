<p>I found what was wrong<br>
in my SMS class, i'm reading a url using HttpClient which should return a json.
in some cases it returns an empty string and because i'm parsing the string using <code>JObject.Parse</code> , exception will be thrown. </p>

<p>when an exception in JSON parsing (in Newtonsoft.Json) is thrown, almost it results in this error: <code>Unable to find assembly 'Newtonsoft.Json, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed'</code></p>

<p>it was my mistake not to surround that section of code in try/catch<br>
thanks</p>
