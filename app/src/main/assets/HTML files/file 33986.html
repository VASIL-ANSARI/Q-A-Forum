<p>First, you should be checking the result that you get back from <code>kill()</code> -- if you get 0 back, the operation succeeded. If you get -1 back, though, check the global variable <code>errno</code> to see what the problem was.</p>

<p>If the signal is being sent successfully, the only thing you can do is make sure that you're sending the signal that you intend. As @Till points out in a comment, sending <a href="https://major.io/2010/03/18/sigterm-vs-sigkill/" rel="nofollow">SIGKILL instead of SIGTERM</a> will be more effective because the OS handles the former and the target process <em>cannot</em> ignore it.</p>

<p>In any case, realize that interacting with other processes is usually an asynchronous process -- the target process probably won't be terminated by the time <code>kill()</code> returns no matter what you do.</p>
