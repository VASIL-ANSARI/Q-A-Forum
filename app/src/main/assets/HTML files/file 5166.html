<p>Not too familiar with AdWhirlView, but is it possible you need to set a frame for that as well? <code>CGRectMake(0,0,320,50);</code> or something?</p>

<p>Otherwise, you might want to play with the autoresizeMasks of the two views.  I know for certain you can have a MKMapView with sibling views, and they all work fine.</p>
