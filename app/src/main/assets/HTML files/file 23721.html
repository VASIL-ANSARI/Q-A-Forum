<p>Because each time you set <code>Username</code> and <code>Password</code> you're creating new variables that fall immediately out of scope (depending on what <code>Some coding goes here</code> actually is/does). Create some higher level scoped variables and store the values there, but even then you would be overwriting the same values each time, hence ending up with the last credential set only - so, use a collection to store them in.</p>

<pre><code>var credentials = new List&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;();

credentials.Add(new KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;(
  node.FirstChild.InnerText, node.LastChild.InnerText)
);
</code></pre>

<p>If you're doing something with the queried values <em>within</em> the loop then I could stand corrected, but it's not clear <em>where</em> you expect to use these (e.g. reusing tightly-scoped variables might be perfectly valid if such is the case).</p>
