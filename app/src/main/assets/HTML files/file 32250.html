<p>If you are using SQL Server, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT vehicle_make, num_of_services 
FROM (SELECT vehicle_make, COUNT(service_name) as num_of_services,
             max(COUNT(service_name)) over () as max_num_of_services
      FROM StartingTable
      GROUP BY vehicle_make
     ) st
WHERE num_of_services = max_num_of_services;
</code></pre>

<p>This uses a window function to calculate the maximum.  Mixing aggregation and window functions looks a bit strange at first, but this calculates the maximum of the count -- which is exactly what you are looking for.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Another way to do this is perhaps even simpler, if you only want one row:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT top 1 vehicle_make, COUNT(service_name) as num_of_services
FROM StartingTable
GROUP BY vehicle_make
ORDER BY COUNT(service_name) desc
</code></pre>
