<p>The truth is there is no point of doing that, the only way I can hardly think is to loop all <code>window</code> or scope objects and check some kind of equality with the current object, something like </p>

<pre><code>this.do = function () {
    for(var key in window) {
        if(this === window[key]) {
           alert(key);
        }
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>In order to work call it after you assign it.</p>

<pre><code>var FOO = new Validator();
FOO.do();
</code></pre>

<p>Another issue that can come up is that an instance (a reference) can be stored in various variables so maybe will not get what you expect.</p>
