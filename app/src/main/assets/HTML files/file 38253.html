<p>You don't need to read what your program outputed to know the correct answer count. Just use a variable instead.</p>

<pre><code>int correctCount = 0;

int ans1 = Convert.ToInt32 (Console.ReadLine ());
if (ans1 == 36) {
    ++correctCount;
    Console.WriteLine ("Correct.");
}
else if (ans1 != 36) {
    Console.WriteLine ("Incorrect. Try again.");
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>This way you will know how many answers are correct without relying on the output.</p>

<p>BTW: I strongly urge you not to use <code>goto</code> for your program flow as it can lead to multiple headaches.</p>
