<p>For tic-tac-toe, each node in the game tree can have at most 9 children, as there are at most 9 possible moves. To my understanding, it would be an unusual approach to explicitly represent the entire game tree to evaluate it. A more straightforward approach would be to have the game board represented. When searching the game tree, nodes are evaluated by actually changing the board state, doing the evaluation and then undoing the hypothetical move again. What you describe as your approach is the basic version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" rel="nofollow">Minimax algorithm</a>, which exactly corresponds to hypothetically performing the move to be evaluated, continuing in a recursive manner, where at each level of the tree the perspective of the players is exchanged.</p>
