<p>There is no built-in way to tell where a ClickOnce application is installed. The folder names are random, and they change every time an update is installed. What are you trying to accomplish? When you say you can't change the ClickOnce app, does that mean you don't own it and/or can't make <em>any</em> changes to the code base for it? If you could, you could have it write a file somewhere (LocalApplicationData) where the second application could find it. If you just want the second application to run the ClickOnce application, use process.start with IE and the installation URL of the ClickOnce application (this is what happens when you click on the shortcut to run a ClickOnce application).</p>
