The string encrypted would be 32-bytes<br>
The encrypted data would be  32-bytes<br>
The Base64 encrypted data would be 44-bytes  </p>

<p>The provided Base64 encrypted data is be 64-bytes<br>
The provided encrypted data is be 48-bytes<br>
There are an extra 16 bytes in the encrypted data  </p>

<p>Examing the encrypted data there are an additional 16 bytes prepended to the encrypted bata prior to Base64 encoding.</p>
