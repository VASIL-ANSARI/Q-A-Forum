<p>This error means that you have exhausted your memory pool. Stress testing can do this. Even if you raise the PHP limits, you only have so much memory to allocate on your server. You said your server is 32 bit, meaning you have a maximum of 4GB of RAM plus your swap file. 500 connections could easily overwhelm a server that small.</p>
