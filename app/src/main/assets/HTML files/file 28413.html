<p>Java doesn't allow overriding of static methods. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2223386/why-doesnt-java-allow-overriding-of-static-methods">Why doesn&#39;t Java allow overriding of static methods?</a></p>

<p>The only thing you can do is hide a static method in a subclass. Hiding means it is not dependent on what type of object it is called, but on what type of class. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html</a></p>

<p>Now the problem is, your subclass method has formally the same signature but because of the generic types it is not hiding it. <code>Collection&lt;? extends ArithmeticExpression&gt;</code> is neither the same nor a subtype of <code>Collection&lt;? extends Expression&gt;</code> practically preventing correct, unambigous hiding. As Ayobi pointed out, the compiler rule was introduced to ensure backwards compatability: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1998544/method-has-the-same-erasure-as-another-method-in-type">Method has the same erasure as another method in type</a></p>

<p>Can't try it for myself right now but the error should disapear whenn both have the same generic types. Although I have no idea why the error doesn't occur in Java 5. I guess they introduced that compiler rule in a later version because they didn't notice it before.</p>
