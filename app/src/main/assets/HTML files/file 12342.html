<p>You will need to use the FindControl method on the containing control if you already have all of the labels as controls within the container. </p>

<pre><code>Label toUpdate = (Label)myTable.FindControl("Label1_1");
toUpdate.Text = childOne;
</code></pre>

<p>If the label controls don't already exist you will need to create and add them dynamically (in which case the Id would be need to be unique).</p>
