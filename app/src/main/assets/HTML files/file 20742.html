<p>The require_once method you are using is not for external URLS. There is a distinction between local files and external files. You are trying to require a external file. For an external file (in this case a webpage) you could use curl (<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php</a>)
or file_get_contents (<a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php</a>)</p>

<p>if the file is on your local disk, require+once the filepath on your disk to it.</p>

<p>require('/home/content/13/10377813/html/components/com_jumi/views/application/view.html.php')</p>
