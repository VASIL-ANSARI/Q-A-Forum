<p>Yeah, you're trying to read in the image as a file -- don't do that since files don't exist within a Jar file. Instead read it in as a resource.</p>

<p>Something like so:</p>

<pre><code>public JPanelWB(String resourceName){
   try {
       // backgroundImage = ImageIO.read(new File(resourceName));
      backgroundImage = ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(resourceName));
   } catch (IOException ex) {
       new JDialog().add(new Label("Could not open image."+ex.getMessage()));
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But note that resource path is different from file path. The resource path is relative to the location of your class files.</p>
