<p>If you are only needing this for images and need to track transforms, then I would suggest using only canvas for this.</p>

<p>Insert a canvas element inside that div instead of the images, and paint onto it the images you need with the respective transform (translate, rotate etc.). From there it's simply to call <code>toDataURL()</code> to save everything as a single image.</p>

<p>Note that <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" rel="nofollow">CORS</a></strong> restrictions applies (images must be loaded from same server as page, or given permission to be used outside CORS by the hosting server - one exception are images uploaded through a input field).</p>

<p>There exists many examples on SO for how to setup a canvas and draw images with rotation/transforms.</p>
