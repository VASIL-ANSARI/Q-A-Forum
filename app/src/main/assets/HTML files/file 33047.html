<p>First, the search time in the Datastore does not depend on the number of entities that you store, only on the number of entities that you retrieve. Therefore, if you need to find one relationship object out of a billion, it will take the same time as if you had just one object.</p>

<p>Second, the list approach has a serious limitation called "exploding indexes". You will have to index the property that contains a list to make it searchable. If you ever use a query that references more than just this property, you will run into this issue - google it to understand the implications.</p>

<p>Third, the list approach is much more expensive. Every time you add a new relationship, you will rewrite the entire entity at considerable writing cost. The reading costs will be higher too if you cannot use keys-only queries. With the object approach you can use keys-only queries to find relationships, and such queries are now free.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>If your relationships are directed, you may consider making Relationship entities children of User entities, and using an Object id as an id for a Relationship entity as well. Then your Relationship entity will have no properties at all, which is probably the most cost-efficient solution. You will be able to retrieve all objects owned by a user using keys-only <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queries#Python_Ancestor_queries" rel="nofollow">ancestor queries</a>.</p>
