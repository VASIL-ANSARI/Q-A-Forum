<p>The first published standard for C was C89 (ANSI X3.159-1989).  It defined <code>strcpy</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>char *strcpy(char *s1, const char *s2);
</code></pre>

<p>Before, that, try looking for the first version of "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie, which was the de facto standard from its publication in 1978 to 1989.  I would not be surprised if <code>strcpy</code> predates this.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/" rel="nofollow">http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/</a>, Version 7 UNIX, released in 1979, defined strcpy as </p>

<pre><code>char *strcpy(s1, s2)
char *s1, *s2;
</code></pre>

<p>I wasn't able to find <code>strcpy</code> in the documentation for Version 6 UNIX, which was released in 1975, but its "C Manual", written by Dennis Ritchie, contained an example function </p>

<pre><code>copy(s1, s2)
char *s1, *s2
{
    while(*s2++ = *s1++);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Its "C Tutorial", written by Brian Kernighan, instead contained this version:</p>

<pre><code>strcopy(s1, s2)
char s1[ ], s2[ ]; {
    int i;
    for( i = 0; (s2[i] = s1[i]) != '\0'; i++ );
}
</code></pre>

<p>This suggests that the modern version of <code>strcpy</code> originated somewhere between the release of V6 UNIX in 1975 and the publication of K&amp;R C in 1978.</p>

<p>Notice that even at this early time, we already see stylistic differences between the two principle authors of C: Kernighan put the opening bracket of functions on the same line as the parameter declaration, while Ritchie preferred to put it on a new line by itself.</p>
