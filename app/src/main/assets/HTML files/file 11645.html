<p>From the looks of your JSON data, it looks like your <strong>deserializedData</strong> should already be a <strong>JKArray</strong> filled with <strong>JKDictionary</strong> objects.</p>

<p>Have you tried accessing it like an array ?</p>

<pre><code>for (NSDictionary * dataDict in deserializedData) {
    NSString * timeStamp = [dataDict objectForKey:@"DateCreated"];
    // and so on
}
</code></pre>

<p>This should loop you through every single element in the JSON data.</p>
