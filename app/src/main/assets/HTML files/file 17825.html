<p>If by "property syntax" you mean overriding the add/remove i.e.</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler MyEvent
{
    add
    {
        ...
    }
    remove
    {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>then you would only do that if you wanted to change the behaviour of add/remove for that particular event i.e. what happens when you call <code>+=</code>/<code>-=</code> on your event.</p>

<p>For general  use of events, you would pretty much always use the field declaration i.e.</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler MyEvent;
</code></pre>
