<p>No, assemblies don't have a fixed filename extension.  Something you can see with Fuslogvw.exe (log all binds).  You'll see it searching for an .exe first, then a .dll.</p>

<p>Some observable side effects: you can add a reference to an EXE without a problem.  Or you can arbitrarily rename a class library assembly from .dll to .exe and it still works.</p>

<p>The sane thing to do is assume that whomever created this assembly didn't pull stunts like this.  You'd expect a reference assembly to be a class library and stored in a file named <code>tools.dll</code>.  Which is a good-enough approximation since actually finding that file isn't exactly that easy.  You'd have to reproduce CLR search rules which can get awfully convoluted, you don't know enough about binding overrides and probing paths.</p>
