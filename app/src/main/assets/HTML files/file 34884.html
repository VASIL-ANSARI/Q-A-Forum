<p>Just curious, why do you want to use raw sockets?  Raw sockets (<code>AF_INET</code>, <code>SOCK_RAW</code>) allow you to send out "raw" packets, where you are responsible for crafting everything but the MAC and IP layers.</p>

<p>A1: There are no "connections" with raw sockets.  Just packets.</p>

<p>A2: There are no "ports" with raw sockets. Just packets.  "Port numbers" as we know them are part of the TCP or UDP protocols, both of which are above the level at which we work with raw sockets.</p>

<p>A3: This is not specific to raw sockets - you would have this issue regardless of your protocol selection. To really answer this, we would need to know much more about your proposed protocol, since right now, you're simply blasting out raw IP packets.</p>
