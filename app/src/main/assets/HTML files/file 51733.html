<p>There is nothing wrong with using 2 different SDKs.</p>

<p>SDK A here is using the non-recommended method gcm.register(senderID). One of the reasons why Google recommends using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/instance-id/guides/android-implementation" rel="nofollow">Instance Id API</a> is because, this API provides a listener that listens for any token refreshs and requests that your app refreshes its tokens. This will ensure your app always has the latest token.</p>

<p>Now with SDK A, you are pushing with an old registration token, which will work, but eventually will stop working when GCM removes the old token from their server. 
With SDK B, you have the latest token.</p>

<p><strong>Once you send a push notification, you will get in your response the latest registration token known as the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/registration#canonical-ids" rel="nofollow">canonical id</a>. Your server side should update the old registraton token with this canonical id.</strong> </p>

<p>Why you get a MismatchSenderId error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A registration token is tied to a certain group of senders. When a client app registers for GCM, it must specify which senders are allowed to send messages. You should use one of those sender IDs when sending messages to the client app. If you switch to a different sender, the existing registration tokens won't work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose, SDK A and SDK B has its own sender id, which explains why that returned token is not working for SDK A.</p>

<p>Workaround:-</p>

<ul>
<li>For SDK A, try registering that device again when you will get the latest token which you could use to push.</li>
<li>Better still, implement the Instance Id API</li>
</ul>
