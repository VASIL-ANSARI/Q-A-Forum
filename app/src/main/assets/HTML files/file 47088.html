<p>Http headers are separated by colon and delimited by crlf. The header and the body are separated by an empty line.</p>

<p>Hence continue to read from the <code>TcpClient</code>/<code>Socket</code> until you receive an empty line. Then parse each header, look for Content-Length (to see if you should read a body too). Finally build a <code>HttpWebRequest</code> and send everything.</p>

<p>Once you receive a reply you need to read everything from the HttpWebResponse, build a valid HTTP response message and finally send everything back.</p>

<p>You could also take a look at my Apache licensed library which contains a HttpListener and a http encoder/decoder. <a href="http://github.com/jgauffin/griffin.framework" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/jgauffin/griffin.framework</a>.</p>
