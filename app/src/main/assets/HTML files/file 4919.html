<p>For templates you usually have to put the implementation in the .h/.hpp file. This may seem unnatural, but think of templates as some special "macros" that the compiler expands once you give the actual types or values (in your case, the type <code>T</code>, and the value <code>SIZE</code>). As most compilers are implemented (in your case GCC), the compiler has to find the code to insert at the time it is compiling and it sees an instantiation of the template you've defined.</p>
