<p>Code that doesn't fit as a model or controller lives in the <code>lib</code> folder. <code>helpers</code> is typically just for view related code that generates HTML or other UI related results.</p>

<p>I'd generally create them as regular classes that are instantiated and have instance methods to access the external rest service - this can make testing them easier. But this is really just a matter of preference (and also depends on how much state/reuse of those objects is required per request - depends on what you're doing exactly).</p>

<p>The "DTOs", would just be plain Ruby classes in this case - maybe even simple <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Struct.html" rel="nofollow">Struct</a> instances if they don't have any logic in them. If they are Ruby classes, they'd live in <code>app/models</code>, but they wouldn't extend ActiveRecord::Base (or anything else) </p>
