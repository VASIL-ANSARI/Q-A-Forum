<p>I would recommend to take a look into transaction blocks.</p>

<p><code>ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block</code> is associated with an open transaction inside which an error occurs and when after that client is trying to open another transaction (e.g.):</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN;
SELECTT 1;  -- ERROR:  syntax error at or near "SELECTT"
BEGIN;      -- ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
</code></pre>
