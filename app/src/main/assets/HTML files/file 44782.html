<p>To use the asynchronous features of Tornado (including websockets), you must use Tornado's HTTPServer instead of running it in a WSGI container. You can then run Pyramid inside of Tornado using <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/wsgi.html#tornado.wsgi.WSGIContainer" rel="nofollow">tornado.web.WSGIContainer</a>, replacing your current WSGI container entirely.</p>

<p>However, Tornado's WSGIContainer is single-threaded, which is not a good choice for most applications built with a WSGI framework. Unless you have a strong need to run Pyramid and Tornado in the same process I recommend keeping them separate, running a pure-Tornado websocket process alongside your Pyramid app. </p>
