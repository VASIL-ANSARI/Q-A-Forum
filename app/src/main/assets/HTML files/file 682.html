<p>Run the potential GUID though a RegEx or some custom code that does a sanity check to ensure  the strig at least looks like a GUID and consists only of valid characters (and maybe that it seems to fit the overall format). If it doesn't pass the sanity check return an error - that'll probably weed out the vast majority of invalid strings.</p>

<p>Then convert the string as you have above, still catching the exception for the few invalid strings that get through the sanity check.</p>

<p>Jon Skeet did an analysis for something similar for parsing Ints (before TryParse was in the Framework):  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.dotnet.framework/browse_thread/thread/3a72ac6eb7d88cc7/dc9241dff1dc524d?lnk=st&amp;q=%22Checking+if+a+string+can+be+converted+to+Int32%22++jon+skeet#dc9241dff1dc524d" rel="nofollow">Checking if a string can be converted to Int32</a></p>

<p>However, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/104850/c-test-if-string-is-a-guid-without-throwing-exceptions#104896">AnthonyWJones</a> indicated you probably shouldn't be worrying about this.</p>
