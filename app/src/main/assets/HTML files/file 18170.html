<p>The replacement isn't done inplace (A <code>String</code> can't be modified in Java, they are <em>immutable</em>), but is saved in a new <code>String</code> that is returned by the method. You need to save the returned <code>String</code> reference for anything to happen, eg:  </p>

<pre><code>template = template.replace("$B", "B");
</code></pre>
