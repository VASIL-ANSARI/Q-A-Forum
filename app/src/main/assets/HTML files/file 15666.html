<p>I don't know C++ but I do know marshalling so here's what the lines are doing  </p>

<pre><code>//Get size number of characters of the string pointed to by the positionMemory pointer.
string result = Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi(new IntPtr(positionMemory), size); 

//Copy the contents of objectStruct to the memory location pointed at by positionMemory
Marshal.StructureToPtr(objectStruct, new IntPtr(positionMemory), true);

//Copy size number of bytes from the byteName array starting at index 0 to the memory indicated by positionMemory
Marshal.Copy(byteName, 0, new IntPtr(positionMemory), size);

//I think offsetting the memory location indicated by allocatedObject by size number of bytes and converting the memory pointer to an Int64.
machineNamePosInMem = allocatedObject.Offset(size).ToInt64();
</code></pre>

<p>I can't see why you'd actually need to convert most of this to C++, the point of Marshalling is about making managed objects available to unmanaged code and converting unmanaged objects into managed ones, which if you're operating all in C++ you shouldn't really need to do, even if it's managed C++.</p>
