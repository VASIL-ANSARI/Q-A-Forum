<p>You're not changing anything to your line object before doing your WriteLine.</p>

<p>You will have to rebuild your line, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var items = string.Split();
items.Last() = "10";//Replace
var line = string.Join(" ", items)
</code></pre>

<p>Tip: strings are immutable, look it up.</p>
