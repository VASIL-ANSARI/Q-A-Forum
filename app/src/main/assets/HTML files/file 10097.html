<p>The flowplayer playlist plugin uses an attribute selector <code>$("[href="+url+"]");</code> however it doesn't put the value in quotes, as is required.  I toyed around with jsfiddle and this is apparently valid in jQuery 1.4.x, but fails in jQuery 1.5.  Your site is using the latter, but the flowplayer demo site is using 1.4.2.  Could you try rolling back the jQuery version and seeing if that makes a difference?  Obviously the optimal solution would be to correct the bug in the playlist plugin.</p>
