<p>The bin and obj folders are meant for output only.  When you tell Visual Studio to do a clean or a rebuild it will delete all files in these folders.  You can safely delete these folders at any time and you shouldn't lose anything in the process.</p>

<p>You are never meant to place any files in these folders.  If you want to add an external assembly (EXE or DLL) to your project you should add it to your project using the Add->Existing Item command on a project.  Then you can tell your project to reference that file and it will use the local relative path.</p>

<p>For example, if you create a "lib" folder in your project root and place <code>some.dll</code> inside it, you can then add a reference to the file located in your project and it will use the relative path <code>..\lib\some.dll</code>.</p>
