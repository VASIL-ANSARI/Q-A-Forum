<p>Literally had this problem yesterday, how are you registering the customTableViewCell's class? If you have a reuse identifier on storyboard then delete the <code>tableView.registerClass()</code> line you may have included in view did load. Check your identity inspector and make sure your class on storyboard matches your custom class. Let me know how you are registering the cell.</p>
