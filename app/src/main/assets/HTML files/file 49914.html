<p>A union gives different names and types to the same location in memory. So if a LARGE_INTEGER union was stored at location 0x1000, and since X86 is little endian:</p>

<pre><code>LARGE_INTEGER.QuadPart is 64 bit integer at 0x1000
LARGE_INTEGER.LowPart  is the lower 32 bits of the 64 bit integer at 0x1000.
LARGE_INTEGER.HighPart is the upper 32 bits of the 64 bit integer at 0x1004.
</code></pre>

<p>OVERLAPPED is used for asynchronous I/O. A read or write call in overlapped mode will return immediately, and the event specified in the OVERLAPPED structure will be signaled when the I/O completes.</p>

<p>MSDN article for OVERLAPPED structure:</p>

<p>In 32 bit mode, Offset would share memory with Pointer, in 64 bit mode, Offset and OffsetHigh would share memory with Pointer. Offset and OffsetHigh are inputs, while Pointer is used internally. InternalHigh is poorly named since it now reports number of bytes transferred, and may change yet again. Internal is now a status.</p>
