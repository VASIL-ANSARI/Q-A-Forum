<p>Variables don't work like that.  T-SQL variables hold data values, not object names.  Furthermore, that's a <em>scalar</em> variable.  It only holds one value.</p>

<p>That said, you don't need the variable at all.  You can just do this:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO tableA (buyer_id, restOfTheColumns)
SELECT CAST(columnName AS varchar(24)), restOfTheColumns
FROM differentDB.tableB
</code></pre>
