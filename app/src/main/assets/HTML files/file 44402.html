<p>In your activity, override <code>public void onBackPressed()</code>.</p>

<p>Give each fragment that comes into view a number that (conveniently) corresponds to the position in the navigation drawer item. Or save the last fragment's position. Then when <code>onBackPressed()</code> is fired, either from the fragment's "position" or "id" or "tag" you associated with its nav item row, you can use this to correctly colorize the now current nav item (its easy to just reset them all to default, and recolor in the "current" fragment). That's what I meant by the method: <code>updateCurrentSelectedItemBackground()</code> which resets the backgrounds, selecting the correct background for the current item and setting the rest to their default background. </p>

<p>Make sure to call <code>super.onBackPressed()</code> after you are done from within <code>onBackPressed()</code> so the system does it normal on back pressed behavior.</p>
