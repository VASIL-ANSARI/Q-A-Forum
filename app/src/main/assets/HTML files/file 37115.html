  <p>1) When the above code is compiled (gcc) I get the warning: warning:
  assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast [enabled by
  default] . What can be done in order for this warning to vanish? I
  tried changing the return type of getData() but still , the same
  warning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>change </p>

<pre><code>int getData(){
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>char** getData(){
</code></pre>

<p>since you are returning a <code>char**</code> from function, not <code>int</code>. after all you should also free the memory that you've allocated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) How can this code be modified so that the char C that is created in
  main() is **passed as a parameter in getData() ? Then getData should
  be able to change its content and return the **C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in C, arguments are passed by value. in order to pass a pointer from main to your function you need to pass an address of it. so, getData() would expected a pointer to C. within function, to operate on C variable you would have to dereference it. if you would pass C to getData() there's no need to return it. so, it would go like:</p>

<pre><code>void getData(char*** C){
    char** clientNames = *C;
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>and in main():</p>

<pre><code>...
char** C;
getData(&amp;C);
...
</code></pre>
