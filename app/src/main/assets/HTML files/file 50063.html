<p>CdiRunner examines the imports of your test class and builds a mini-deployment based on referenced classes. When you run the test the producer you've defined isn't included in that mini-deployment.</p>

<p>To include additional classes and packages in your test deployment you'll need to add @AdditionalClasses or @AdditionalPackages to your test class.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>@RunWith(CdiRunner.class)
@AdditionalClasses(TestProducer.class)
public class Test {
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use annotations to declare what should be included in the test deployment's beans.xml, so you can activate alternatives, interceptors and decorators that way.</p>
