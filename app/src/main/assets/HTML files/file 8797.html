<p>You can achieve what you want using the class_name and inverse_of options:</p>

<pre><code>class Account
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :name
  has_many :ratings_given, :class_name =&gt; 'Ratings', :inverse_of =&gt; :rater
  has_many :my_ratings, :class_name =&gt; 'Ratings', :inverse_of =&gt; :ratee
end

class Ratings
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :name
  belongs_to :rater, :class_name =&gt; 'Account', :inverse_of =&gt; :ratings_given
  belongs_to :ratee, :class_name =&gt; 'Account', :inverse_of =&gt; :my_ratings
end
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation has changed since I was last working with it so I wasn't sure whether this is still the recommended approach. Looks like it doesn't mention these options on the <a href="http://mongoid.org/docs/relations/referenced/1-n.html">1-many referenced page</a>. But if you take a look at the general page on <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/relations.html#has_many">relations</a> they are covered there.</p>

<p>In any case you need to explicitly link ratings_given/rater and my_ratings/ratee associations when there are two associations to the same class, otherwise mongoid has no way to know which of the two potential inverses to pick.</p>
