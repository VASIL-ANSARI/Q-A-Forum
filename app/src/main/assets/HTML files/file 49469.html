<p>As someone has already said, the PHP automatic casting rules can be quite tricky, and it is worth using <code>===</code> unless you know both sides will be of the same type. However I believe I can explain this one:</p>

<pre><code>""==[] (returns false)
</code></pre>

<p>The initial string <code>""</code> indicates the comparison will be a string one, and thus <code>[]</code> is cast to a string. When that happens, the right hand side of the comparison will be set to the word <code>Array</code>. You are therefore doing this comparison:</p>

<pre><code>"" == "Array" (returns false)
</code></pre>

<p>and thus <code>false</code> is the correct result.</p>

<p>Edit: a helpful comment below casts doubt on my answer <a href="http://ideone.com/povYMk" rel="nofollow">via this live code example</a>. I should be interested to see what other answers are supplied.</p>
