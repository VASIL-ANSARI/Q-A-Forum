<p>This was the subject of a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.c++/browse_frm/thread/6ff4ab58318f0870/52c2484d42d2a083">defect report</a>, <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/lwg-defects.html#233">LWG issue #233</a>, and <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1780.html">n1780</a>.</p>

<p>As noted there, it was apparently a simple error in editing the C++98 standard.</p>

<p>Stepanov's original implementation worked according to the current specification, and as far as I know most (all?) implementations since have done the same (though there is one that looks both before <em>and</em> after the hinted location, so you'll get optimal behavior if you specify either one).</p>

<p>This also makes it possible to hint that an insertion will be at the beginning of the set, which wasn't possible under the previous specification.</p>
