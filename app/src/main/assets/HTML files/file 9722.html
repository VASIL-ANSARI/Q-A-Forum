<p>The simplest implementation consists in instanciating the Singleton directly in a private field of your Singleton class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Singleton {
    private static final instance = new Singleton();
    private Singleton() {}
    public Singleton getInstance() { return instance; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Others implementations consist in "lazy loading" of your singleton: the instance is created only when you first call the "getInstance" method.</p>

<p>In order to protect your code in multi-thread context, there are various methods (double-null-check, inner class, etc.).</p>

<p>You will find more precisions with a quick Google search.</p>
