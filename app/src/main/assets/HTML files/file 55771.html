<p>WebAPI isn't going to push data down to the clients for you. If you want to only use WebAPI, you would need to do some sort of polling on an end point, which has many downsides including performance. Luckily, there are several options for "pushing" data down to clients.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr" rel="nofollow">SignalR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Firebase</a></li>
</ol>

<p>You could implement any one of these on you server and have each of your clients subscribe to the channel. Once a POST is made to your WebAPI, you would publish a message on the channel and each of the subscribed clients would receive the update. You could then handle the messages appropriately on the client side. </p>
