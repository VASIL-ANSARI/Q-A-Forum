<p>If there is a link between the two tables where member is the parent and register is the child, you have to delete from the child table first.  The delete from member would fail in that case because you can't delete the parent until the child is deleted.</p>

<p>Another solution would be to have a cascading delete set up between the two tables so when you delete from member it deletes from register automatically.  I usually prefer to do it explicitly though - I don't like having automated deletes that are somewhat out of my control.</p>

<p>So quick answer, just reverse the order of your queries - do the register first, then member.</p>
