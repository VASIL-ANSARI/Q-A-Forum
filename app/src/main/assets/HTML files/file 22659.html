<p>The error message is saying that you don't have the PDBs (files that contain debugging information for an executable) for Excel.exe. This makes sense, since Microsoft does not publish them.</p>

<p>If you set breakpoints in your addin, they should work fine as you use Excel to run the code in your addin. Depending on how Excel addins work, they might not be loaded into the process until they are used, so even if Visual Studio says that it can't set the breakpoint initially because the DLL isn't loaded, that's ok - as soon as you do something in Excel that requires your addin, it should be loaded and then Visual Studio will set the breakpoint.</p>

<p>When you attach to Excel, make sure to select managed debugging (.NET 4 in this case, based on  the tags on your question). If you select automatic, Visual Studio will probably only enable unmanaged debugging which won't allow you to debug your C# addin.</p>
