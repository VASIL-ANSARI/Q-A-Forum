<p>The only drawback I see here is that there is no central spot where objects are cached. Usually there is one specific layer where caching is done. With your technique, this is not the case.</p>

<p>I also think it's the responsibility of your code to decide whether something should be cached or not, not that of a class/interface.</p>

<p>But to answer your question, is this a code smell? I'd say no, but it might be confusing for new developers to get the hang of this system once it's used in a lot of places.</p>
