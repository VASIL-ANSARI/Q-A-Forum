  <p>Can the Universal selector * be replaced by :lang?</p>

<p>No, because you cannot write a selector using <code>:lang()</code> that is guaranteed to match all elements unless you assume all elements in the document will always be in the same language.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>If you're going to assume that all elements are in the same language, then using the <code>:lang()</code> pseudo is pretty pointless, since the whole point of that pseudo-class is to be able to distinguish parts of the document that differ in their content language.</p>

<p>Also note that the compound selector <code>:lang(en)</code> (consisting of just that one simple selector) is equivalent to <code>*:lang(en)</code>. It is essentially the <code>*</code> selector with an additional qualification of a pseudo-class. You are not avoiding the use <code>*</code> by replacing it with <code>:lang()</code>.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <sub><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-lang-pseudo" rel="nofollow">Selectors 4</a> allows a selector like <code>:lang('*')</code> to be written that matches elements in any language (which, again, is pointless if you <em>don't care</em> what language an element is in!), but this assumes the document even has content language semantics built into it. It is not clear if <code>:lang()</code> will work at all in a document lacking such semantics.</sub></p>
