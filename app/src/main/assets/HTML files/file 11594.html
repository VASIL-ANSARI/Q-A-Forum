<p>You will need to implement your own file copying code, and report the progress from there.</p>

<p>EDIT:
In case you don't want to copy the files yourself, you could start <em>another</em> background worker that will check the file copy progress (get the properties of the currently copied file, and check its length). If you don't run into sharing issues, it will provide you with the information you need to update the progress bar.</p>
