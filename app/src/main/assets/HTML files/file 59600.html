<p>You can change the last parameter from <code>System.IO.FileShare.ReadWrite</code> to <code>System.IO.FileShare.None</code>.</p>

<p>That locks the file in <code>location</code> exclusively as long as this stream is open and no other app can read, modify or delete that file except your own <code>FileStream</code>.</p>

<p>In fact this isn't only true for other apps - even your own app can't open another <code>FileStream</code> of that file. So keep it open as long as you need but don't forget to correctly dispose the <code>FileStream</code> after use.</p>
