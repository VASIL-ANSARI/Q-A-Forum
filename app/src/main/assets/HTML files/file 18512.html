<p>You can verify the keywords by comparing all stopwords. Here is the list of <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/fulltext-stopwords.html">stopwords</a> 
I've found out a solution to disable stopwords from fulltext. 
You just need to locate .cnf file and add this, </p>

<pre><code>ft_stopword_file = ""
</code></pre>

<p>restart mysql engine and rebuild indexes;</p>

<p>Hope this work</p>
