<p>I would avoid calling <code>$form = new PersonalDataForm();</code> in your controller.</p>

<p>I would inject that dependency in a factory, that factory should have access to the "FormElementManager"</p>

<p>FormElementManager is a AbstractPluginManager where one can store all their form related services, including Elements, Fieldsets and full Forms (as they all extend Zend\Form\Element)</p>

<p>By calling your form services from the plugin manager (and making sure to inject that plugin manager into any subsequent form factories), you won't run into these "Invalid Plugin" errors. </p>

<p>The "Invalid Plugin" exception usually means one of two things. You didn't register your element with the plugin manager, or you didn't properly inject the plugin manager where you need it.</p>
