<p>If the only thing that makes your XML not well-formed is that it's missing root, then the fix is simple â just add some root element and then parse that and work with it as normal XML.</p>

<pre><code>xml = '&lt;root&gt;' + xml + '&lt;/root&gt;';
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/1732348/41071">You really shouldn't try to parse XML with regular expressions.</a></p>
