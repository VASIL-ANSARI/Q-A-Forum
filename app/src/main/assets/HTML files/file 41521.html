<p>If I understand correctly, you want to toggle the "mode" of scrolling on the fly. In that case I would recommend storing a simple variable, say "scrollMode" and flip it based on the menu being opened and closed between "horizontal" and "vertical". Then your mousewheel event code checks that variable before doing any custom behavior.</p>
