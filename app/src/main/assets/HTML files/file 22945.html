<p>First, let me say that I don't have any experience with this Apache module, but I'll try to guide you through a general error deduction:</p>

<p>You should check if you can reproduce it more reliably. While a web browser might be ok to try it out, you should go for something like <code>curl</code> and do the request multiple times, for example using a bash <code>for</code>-loop.</p>

<pre><code>for i in `seq 1 5`; do curl -v http://localhost/xsendfile-url; done
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that the <code>Connection: Keep-Alive</code> header is set and that there are some weird characters before the actual HTTP header lead me to believe that you won't be able to reproduce this problem with separated <code>curl</code> calls, because it will open a fresh connection each time. So try this to check if that gives you the weird behavior (curl has keep alive on by default):</p>

<pre><code>curl -v http://localhost/xsendfile-url http://localhost/xsendfile-url http://localhost/xsendfile-url
</code></pre>

<p>Using this, you could go to the <a href="https://github.com/nmaier/mod_xsendfile/issues" rel="nofollow">projects github issue</a> page and report your findings. Most probably they will there help you in telling you why mod_xsendfile is behaving the way it is or that you have found a bug.</p>
