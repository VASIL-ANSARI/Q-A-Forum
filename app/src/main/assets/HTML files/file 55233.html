<p>If you are talking about extends I'm assuming you're not talking about an interface? If so, you can just override the functions.</p>

<p>EDIT: more info as requested. If you extend a class, say: </p>

<pre><code>public class Dog extends Animal {}
</code></pre>

<p>You can just override the methods in Animal. Say Animal has a method called walk:</p>

<pre><code>public void walk() { x += 1; }
</code></pre>

<p>You can override this in the class Dog with:</p>

<pre><code>public void walk() { x += 2; }
</code></pre>

<p>When you now call new Dog().walk() it will call the walk method from the Dog class, not from the Animal class.</p>
