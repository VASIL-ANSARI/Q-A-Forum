<p>Setting a parameter without actually sending it to the database (e.g. with ExecuteNonQuery), like you're doing in your code, does absolutely nothing; this isn't Npgsql-specific behavior, it's general database/ADO.NET behavior.</p>

<p>To help you understand, conceptually parameters aren't that different from inserting your value directly inside your SQL query (except, of course, for the injection protection and performance benefits).</p>

<p>If you're trying to optimize performance by not sending X queries to the database, consider changing your schema to have a single row with multiple answers, where responses to questions are represented as columns instead of rows.</p>

<p>Another option currently unsupported by Npgsql is to send multiple UPDATE SQL statements in one command, rather than doing ExecuteNonQuery for each one (the latter sends the SQL and waits for the responses). Unfortunately this is currently incompatible with parameters (but will be supported in the next major version of Npgsql).</p>
