<p>That notification is sent immediately after <code>applicationWillTerminate:</code> is sent to your app delegate. From <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/applicationWillTerminate:" rel="nofollow"><code>UIApplicationDelegate</code>'s documentation</a>, you have about 5 seconds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your implementation of this method has approximately five seconds to perform any tasks and return. If the method does not return before time expires, the system may kill the process altogether.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, you shouldn't rely on having 5 seconds, and instead use Instruments to improve your code's performance to be as fast as possible. If you're concerned that you'll need more than 5 seconds, you can request more using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplication_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIApplication/beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler:" rel="nofollow"><code>beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler:</code></a>.</p>
