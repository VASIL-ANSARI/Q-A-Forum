<p>These two lines look most suspect:</p>

<pre><code>   this-&gt;root = &amp;n;
   this-&gt;tree = &amp;t;
</code></pre>

<p>They are taking the address of a local variable, which will be destroyed when the constructor completes.  Any use of those pointers outside of the constructor will be UB. </p>

<p>You need to dynamically allocate them using <code>new</code>, and make sure your destructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator handle them appropriately.</p>
