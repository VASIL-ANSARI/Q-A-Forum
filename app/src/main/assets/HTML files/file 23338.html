<p>No, it is a <em>class instance variable</em>, i.e. an <em>instance variable</em> of the class object <code>C</code>.</p>

<p>The difference between the two is that the former is visible inside all the classes of a hierarchy, the latter is visible only inside the class that defines it. A simple example to (I hope) explain:</p>

<pre><code>class A
  @a = 0  # class instance variable
  @@b = 1  # class variable
end

class B &lt; A
  @a = 1
  @@b = 2
end

puts A.a # =&gt; 0
# the definition of @@b inside B have altered the value
# inside A. It's not the case for @a.
puts A.b # =&gt; 2
</code></pre>
