<p>Is your Modbus Server C++ project generating a managed assembly?  If not, it may be that your Add Reference didn't actually do anything.  In your C# project, if you expand the References node in Solution Explorer, do you see an entry for Modbus Server?  Does that entry have a warning icon superimposed (a small yellow triangle with an exclamation mark)?</p>

<p>If your C++ project is generating native C++ I don't think Add Project Reference will work.   </p>

<p>If Modbus Server is generating a COM object you could use Add Reference and the COM tab to add a reference to the COM object.  But that means you'd have to register the COM object on the system you're doing your build on - either manually by running regsvr32 (or whatever is appropriate for your COM object) or automatically in the Modbus Server project.</p>

<p>If Modbus Server is a regular native C++ DLL (i.e., not a COM object) then you can't access it via Add Reference at all.  </p>

<p>One alternative is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235282.aspx" rel="nofollow">P/Invoke</a> which will let you describe the DLL entry points to C#.  </p>

<p>Another alternative would be to write a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/68td296t.aspx" rel="nofollow">C++/CLI</a> wrapper that calls Modbus Server like any other C++ program would, but which declares .NET methods that can be called from C# to invoke the Modbus Server methods.  Then you can use Add Reference to add the C++/CLI wrapper project to your C# project.</p>
