<p>You can change the regular expressiion to: <code>(?&lt;=ThreepointShooter['|"]&gt;)(.\w+)</code>. <a href="http://pythex.org/?regex=(%3F%3C%3DThreepointShooter%5B%27%7C%22%5D%3E)(.%5Cw%2B)&amp;test_string=%3CStephenCurry%20Pro%3D%27ThreepointShooter%27%3EMVP1times%3C%2FStephenCurry%3E&amp;ignorecase=0&amp;multiline=0&amp;dotall=0&amp;verbose=0" rel="nofollow">See it live on http://pythex.org/</a></p>

<p>I'm not sure what exactly your going to do but you don't even need to use lookbehind expression here.</p>
