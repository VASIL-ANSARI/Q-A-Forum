<p>One way would be to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/958908/how-do-you-reverse-a-string-in-place-in-javascript">reverse</a> the string before your manipulation and ther reverse it again. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>var number = 1205000000;

function reverse(s) {
    return s.split("").reverse().join("");
}

var str = reverse(reverse(number.toString()).replace(/(\d{3})/g, "$1."));
alert(str);
</code></pre>

<p>See this working <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/2nzq8ejr/" rel="nofollow">fiddle</a>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
See the comments. Its a bit dirty but for that specific number it will work. The link posted by @Artyom Neustroev as a comment under you question seems a whole lot better than this here.</p>
