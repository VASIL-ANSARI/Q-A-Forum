<p>#1:</p>

<p>The entire point of <code>WaitOne</code> here is to allow people to write synchronous code that waits for completion; if you don't need to use methods like <code>WaitOne</code>, <code>WaitAny</code> etc - then <em>don't use them</em>; that's fine.</p>

<p>#2:</p>

<p>In <em>both</em> cases, whether it uses a dedicated thread, or whether it completes via some other callback, yes it blocks a thread: it blocks the thread that has requested to be blocked by calling <code>WaitOne</code>. If you don't want that: don't call <code>WaitOne</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Aside: since you specify 4.0, you might find it more intuitive to return a <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> instead, using <code>TaskCompletionSource&lt;T&gt;</code>. Edit: I realize now that this isn't an option due to satisfying the <code>IHttpAsyncHandler.BeginProcessRequest</code> method.</p>
