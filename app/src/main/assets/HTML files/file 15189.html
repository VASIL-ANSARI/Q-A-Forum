<p>From your Context you can simply open a read stream using:</p>

<pre><code> using (var stream = Context.Assets.Open("MyZipFolder/MyZip.zip"))
 { 
      var s = new ZipInputStream(stream);
      // do read here ...
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful that the file is marked as an AndroidAsset for build action, and remember that file names in android are case sensitive.</p>
