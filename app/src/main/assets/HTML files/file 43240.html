<p>Other answers are welcome here, of course, however here is the summary of my answer from that exchange:</p>

<p>You can use multithreading, multiple JVM processed, etc. to write to Titan in a parallel fashion.  However, if your Titan schema uses locks to enforce uniqueness, you will inevitably hit locking exceptions.  There are two ways to deal with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove locks and manage uniqueness consistency yourself: <a href="http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/0.5.4/eventual-consistency.html" rel="nofollow">http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/0.5.4/eventual-consistency.html</a> OR</li>
<li>Keep locking enabled and add transaction retry to your code. You may also consider smaller commits to keep locks open for the least amount of time possible preventing further lock contention.</li>
</ol>
