<p>The problem is that the HTML has an incorrect <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base" rel="nofollow">HTML <code>base</code> element</a>, which is supposed to specify the base url for all the relative links in the page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;base href="http://www.lecture-en-ligne.com/"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Scrapy is respecting that, that's why the links are being formed that way.</p>
