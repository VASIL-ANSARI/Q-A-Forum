<p>I have worked this out myself.</p>

<p>I was calling </p>

<p><code>patientsCard = new CSVTable();</code></p>

<p>Which should generate a new <code>JPanel</code> automatically. However, within the CSVTable class, I also generated a new JPanel via:</p>

<p><code>viewCard = new JPanel();</code></p>

<p>When I remove all references to <code>viewCard</code>, this new JPanel, in the CSVTable class, my panel correctly renders in the main GUI.</p>

<p>Hope this helps others in the same situation.</p>
