<p>What locale does is that it gives the program information about the external encoding, but assuming that the internal encoding didn't change. If you want to output UTF-8 you need to do it from <code>wchar_t</code> not from <code>char*</code>.</p>

<p>What you could do is output it as raw data (not string), it should be then correctly interpreted if the systems locale is UTF-8.</p>

<p>Plus when using <code>(w)cout</code>/<code>(w)cerr</code>/<code>(w)cin</code> you need to imbue the locale on the stream.</p>
