<p>You are installing on an unsupported operating system and something could go wrong.</p>

<p>The file <code>initSID.ora</code>, where <code>SID</code> is the instance name (<code>XE</code> in your case), is the initialization parameter file (pfile) which Oracle uses when instance starts to load its runtime settings specified by database administrator.</p>

<p>For some reason the installation process was not successful, and you end up with the default pfile named <code>init.ora</code>.</p>

<p>On startup Oracle instance reads initialization parameters from the following files in the order of appearance</p>

<ol>
<li><code>spfileSID.ora</code></li>
<li><code>spfile.ora</code></li>
<li><code>initSID.ora</code></li>
</ol>

<p>where the first two being binary counterparts of pfiles and are called server parameter files (spfiles), because they should reside on the server side in contrast to pfiles which can be on any side.</p>

<p>You can copy <code>init.ora</code> to <code>initXE.ora</code> and set appropriate parameters just to check if your instance starts.</p>

<p>However you would better try reinstalling your database checking the messages shown in the output during installation to see if something goes wrong or using supported OS.</p>
