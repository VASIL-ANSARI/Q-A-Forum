<p>Ciphertext contains of random bytes, not all of which can be represented as (UTF-8) characters. So:</p>

<pre><code>var encrypteData=encrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.utf8);
</code></pre>

<p>may introduce or leave out characters, meaning that the ciphertext is not received correctly at the Java side. Please make sure that you base 64 encode all bytes that need to be represented by text, and if text needs to be converted to bytes, always specify a character encoding.</p>
