<p>I've figured it out.</p>

<p>Even without any optimization flag on the compiler, the debugger information was just wrong..</p>

<p>So I printed out the values with two <code>for</code> loops and it was initialized correctly, even if the debugger said otherwise (weird).</p>

<p>Thanks however for the comments</p>
