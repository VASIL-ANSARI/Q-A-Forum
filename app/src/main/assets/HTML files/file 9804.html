<p>I had the same problem you have. What I did was, I used a <strong>Button</strong> instead of <strong>EditText</strong>. And <em>onClick</em> of <strong>Button</strong> I displayed the <strong>Spinner</strong>. The selected value of <strong>Spinner</strong> appears on the <strong>Button</strong> as <em>text</em>. I hope that won't be a problem. Still if you want code, let me know.<br>
For <strong>EditText</strong> to be clicked see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2119072/android-how-to-do-something-after-user-clicks-on-my-edittext">this</a> post.</p>
