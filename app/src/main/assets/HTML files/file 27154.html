<p>From the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182776%28v=sql.90%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a> about <strong>TIMESTAMP</strong>:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is a data type that exposes automatically generated, unique binary
  numbers within a database. timestamp is generally used as a mechanism
  for version-stamping table rows. The storage size is 8 bytes. The
  timestamp data type is just an incrementing number and does not
  preserve a date or a time. To record a date or time, use a datetime
  data type.</p>

<p>You may use <code>datetime</code> data instead.</p>
