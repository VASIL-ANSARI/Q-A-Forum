<p>If you are compiling the jar, you can type in the location of the output for the jar:</p>

<pre><code>-jar cvfm c:/users/matt/documents/Minecraft.jar manifest.txt *.class
</code></pre>

<p>I believe this would work if you were to create your own jar. This would be easier then directly editing the Minecraft jar. </p>
