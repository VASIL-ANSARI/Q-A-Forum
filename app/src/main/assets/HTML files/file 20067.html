<p>In first case if your parsing is successful then you will get the enum value in <code>evalue</code>. You are also passing <code>true</code> for ignore case parameter, so the comparison will ignore the case of the string. The way you have it now, it would return <code>true</code> in success and discard the value in <code>evalue</code>. </p>

<p>In 2nd code you are only checking if the enum is defined or not. </p>
