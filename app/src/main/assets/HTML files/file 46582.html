<p>There could be two possible definitions for what you mean by "Current" window
The key window is the window that receives the key events (keep in mind this could be a panel within a window), while the main window is the current parent window that is open, but doesn't necessarily receive the key events.</p>

<p>You can access either of these windows with these lines, and subsequently grab a reference to their <code>contentViews</code>:</p>

<pre><code>   [[[NSApplication sharedApplication] mainWindow] contentView];
   [[[NSApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] contentView];
</code></pre>
