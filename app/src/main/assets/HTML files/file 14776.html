<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>I think I have worked out your problem. Webkit overrides <code>display: block;</code> and computes it to be <code>display: table-cell;</code> in a td when there is no <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> declared for your html. </p>

<p>To fix this I recommend you set <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> before <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> at the top of your html.</p>

<p>The reason the jsfiddle will work is because the site has a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> already declared.</p>

<p>Try this and let me know if it fixes your problem. If not I'll try find another answer.</p>
