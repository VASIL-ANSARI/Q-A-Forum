<p>In this design,There is a one problem if the same user open it again and again then either you have to put check before insert the entry or you insert the same ip address multiple time but different time stamp.</p>

<p>Most of the popular sites consider one ip address as one view even if that client or user open that article several times. </p>

<p>I can think of solution. </p>

<ol>
<li>your approach with single check. if the same client has opened it again don't insert it. 
or group by Id when you retrieve the counter. </li>
</ol>
