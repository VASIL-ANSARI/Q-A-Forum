<p>I tried and yes the paste seems to be broken in your example. </p>

<p>There were some bugs reported on chrome buglist:</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=60057" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=60057</a></p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=61784" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=61784</a></p>

<p>But they are long closed.</p>
