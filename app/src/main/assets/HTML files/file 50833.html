<p>React Native uses logical pixels (also know as "points" on iOS), as opposed to device pixels, at the JavaScript level. When working at the native level, you occasionally may need to work with device pixels by multiplying the logical pixels by the screen scale (e.g. 2x, 3x).</p>

<p>When you are working with images, you'll want to specify their dimensions in logical pixels. Also, React Native supports fractional pixels. When you need to specify precise layouts at the granularity of device pixels, use <code>1 / PixelRatio.get()</code>.</p>
