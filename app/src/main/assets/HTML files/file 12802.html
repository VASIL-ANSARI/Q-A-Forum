<p>Many browsers appends http to url without protocol so that url.com will become <a href="http://url.com" rel="nofollow">http://url.com</a> and www.url.com will become <a href="http://www.url.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.url.com</a>. It depends on how the app treats urls. Since I have not programmed with FB API I cannot add much than general information</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://webhostinghelpguy.inmotionhosting.com/homepage/www-vs-no-www-on-a-canonical-url/" rel="nofollow">this link</a> and some on internet the two makes no difference and it is a matter of preference> I think you have to check if the links is not supposed to be https not http!</p>
