<p>Without spending too long looking at the source code, I did notice that on the home page you are using different CSS from the workpage.</p>

<p>On the home page you are calling </p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="../DW Bootstrap Site/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
    &lt;link href="css/callum.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and on the work page you are calling </p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
    &lt;link href="css/work.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which will alter the display of the age depending on the contents of these CSS files. You need to ensure that the css of each page is consisten - try to keep all external CSS in the one file so that it is a uniform call for each page. The different content for each page is then used by calling the different selectors on each page (id's and classes etc). There may well be other things wrong - that's what I noticed straight away. </p>
