<p>You don't show either the code of your site or the command you ran (and the URL you entered, if any) to trigger this issue. There's almost certainly some difference between the Python environment on the command line and that operating in Django.</p>

<p>Are you using virtual environments? If so, dependencies should be separately added to each environment. Were you operating from a different working directory? Python usually has the current directory somewhere in <code>sys.path</code>, so if you changed directories it's possible you made <code>bs4</code> unavailable that way.</p>

<p>At the interactive Python prompt, try</p>

<pre><code>import bs4
bs4.__file__
</code></pre>

<p>That will tell you where <code>bs4</code> is being imported from, and might therefore give you a clue as to why it's not available to Django.</p>
