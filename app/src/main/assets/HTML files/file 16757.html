<p>As DJC said, the fileobserver is not recursive. If you do a good search on google, you'll find a RecursiveFileObserver Class that works very well. One thing I did with it, however, is thread the startWatching method because it takes forever to set up, especially with complex directory trees, so I would advise threading it as to not bind up the UI thread.</p>
