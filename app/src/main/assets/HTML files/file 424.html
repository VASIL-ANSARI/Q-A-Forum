<p>FWIW: I have never had good luck with GCJ, I have had a lot of problems using it and have had some obscure issues pop up that took forever to diagnose to GCJ rather than me (I am always very very reluctant to blame things on external libraries). I will openly admit this happened several years ago and I have never wanted to go near GCJ again. To give that more substance this was while I was in school and was working on a mostly trivial program so on an <em>"enterprise level"</em> I have had a healthy fear of GCJ.</p>
