<p>In a UIView <code>sizeToFit</code> calls <code>sizeThatFits:</code> with the view's current size. </p>

<p>The default implementation of <code>sizeThatFits:</code> returns the current value of the view, in other words it does pretty much nothing in most cases (some subclasses of UIView override this method so it returns something more useful, ex: UILabel)</p>

<p>In other words <code>sizeThatFits</code> it is a "Template Method", a method that is made for extending the functionality of the class. It's main purpose is to be overridden.</p>
