<p>Rename <code>home.php</code> under controllers folder to <code>Home.php</code> and inside that file rename <code>class home</code> to <code>class Home</code> and then check.</p>

<p><strong>Controllers</strong></p>

<p>Controller class names should be all lowercase, except the first letter.</p>

<pre><code>If your URL is www.example.com/gallery, the controller name is Gallery.
If your URL is www.example.com/admin_folder, the controller name is Admin_folder.
</code></pre>

<p>Controller file names should match the class name, but be all lowercase.</p>

<pre><code>Gallery :: gallery.php
Admin_folder :: admin_folder.php
</code></pre>

<p>Controller methods should be all lowercase as well. There is some flexibility with uppercase, but similar to URLs, there are opportunities where it can goof something up.</p>
