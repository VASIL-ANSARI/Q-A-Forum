<p>You can load a JPEG file using the PHP <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/imagick.readimage.php" rel="nofollow">ImageMagick</a> extension and send it <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/imagick.setimageformat.php" rel="nofollow">as PSD</a> to the browser with its <a href="http://filext.com/file-extension/PSD" rel="nofollow">MIME</a> type.</p>

<p>I believe the PSD support is always available in ImageMagick, but check it out; I might be wrong.</p>

<p>Then, the browser must know to reroute that file to PhotoShop. It is likely that the PhotoShop installation already instructs it that way, but you may also need to configure the browser instead.</p>

<pre><code>$image = new Imagick();

$image-&gt;readImage("myImage.jpg");

$image-&gt;setImageFormat('psd');
header('Content-type: image/photoshop');
die($image);
</code></pre>

<p>A really <strong>dirty</strong> way of doing things is to "define" your own MIME type:</p>

<pre><code>$jpeg = 'test.jpg';

Header('Content-Type: application/jpeg-with-photoshop');
Header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($jpeg);
readfile($jpeg);
</code></pre>

<p>The browser will, the first time, pop up a windows saying "WTF? What do I do with a jpeg-with-photoshop file?!?". Just click "Open With > Choose Application > Find application on disk > clickety clickety click > Photoshop" and the browser will remember, and always open what is really a JPEG file by launching Photoshop. Photoshop will then recognize the object as a JPEG file and open it properly.</p>
