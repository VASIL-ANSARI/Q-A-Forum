<p>Deleted files in the cPanel File Manager as far as I know don't go to any trash folder. You should regularly take full backups of your site just incase things like this happen. You can also talk to your host, who should have a backup of the folder you deleted. They might however ask that you pay a small fee for this service, depending on the host.</p>
