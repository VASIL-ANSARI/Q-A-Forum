<p>A std::unique_ptr is, as the name suggests, <em>unique</em>. <strong>There can be only one!</strong></p>

<p>Now, if your thread function takes a std::unique_ptr&amp;&amp;, and you use std::move to move the parameter in the thread function, <em>then</em> you can pass the std::unique_ptr. But then your copy will be empty, since you moved it to the other thread.</p>

<p>If std::move does not work, then your compiler or standard library may have bugs in it. I imagine that transferring ownership across threads like this isn't a common occurrence. And C++11 is still fairly new.</p>
