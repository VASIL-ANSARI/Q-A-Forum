<p>The reason is, that browsers do not allow cross-site requests with AJAX (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" rel="nofollow">Same Origin Policy</a>).</p>

If you want to perform cross-site requests, you can use JSONP, as explained in <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/tutorial/Xsite.html" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/tutorial/Xsite.html</a>.</p>
