<p>My guess is that since you have a <code>&lt;cfif&gt;</code> around the "reageer" query, the error is occurring because there is more than 1 comment, but the output for the <code>username</code> is not wrapped in a <code>&lt;cfif&gt;</code> as well. Therefore, ColdFusion is trying to get the value of <code>username</code> from a query that doesn't exist (because the <code>&lt;cfif&gt;</code> prevented it from executing), hence the error.</p>
