<p>The problem is that <code>alphanumericCharacterSet</code> also seems to contain the chinese letters, so the result is "correct". Apple doesn't document it this way but I've seen a few postings (e.g. from GNUStep) that seem to indicate it. (Also note that Apple <em>does</em> document that this set contains characters that you might not want: <em>Informally, this set is the set of all characters used as basic units of alphabets, syllabaries, ideographs, and digits.</em>).</p>

<p>A simple yet inelegant workaround is to define the character set yourself, if all you want is the english alphabet without any foreign letters like <code>Ã</code> or <code>Ã</code>:</p>

<pre><code>NSCharacterSet *alphaSet = [NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString:@"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz01234567890"];
</code></pre>

<p>When you're targeting iOS >= 7, one of the <code>URL*AllowedCharacterSet</code> might be of interest. See the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/nscharacterset_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">NSCharacterSet documentation</a> for details.</p>
