<pre><code>public static class VariableStore
{
    public static string MinecraftPath
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now to 'set' your variable, you'd call:</p>

<pre><code>VariableStore.MinecraftPath = "%appdata%\\roaming\\.minecraft";
</code></pre>

<p>You access it the same way:</p>

<pre><code>System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print(VariableStore.MinecraftPath);
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that this is a very crude solution. Also, if you're planning to go through with your project (which sounds like a really nice learning project), I'd advice you to read up a little bit more about WinForms and how they work before you go any further, as you have multiple design flaws already. Don't give up and good luck! :)</p>
