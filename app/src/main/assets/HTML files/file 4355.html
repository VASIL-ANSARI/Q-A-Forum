<p>If you're in a Rails app's public folder you can't run a ruby script ( not without explicitly referencing it from elsewhere in your application first, not that you should do it anyway, its probably a security hole ), its not like PHP where hitting the actual file renders the result.</p>

<p>When a request hits the Rails app it will be redirected through the router ( see config/routes.rb ), if you want to execute ruby code in a Rails app you will need to route it to a controller first.</p>

<p>you could do this by running the command</p>

<pre><code>rails generate scaffold/resource test 
</code></pre>

<p>( only one of the options <code>scaffold</code> or <code>resource</code> is needed )</p>

<p>This will create all of the boilerplate code ( and add the routes to your routes file ) that you need to start serving requests.</p>

<p>Only static assets ( html, images etc ) will be served through the public folder. this is why all the CSS and JS are stored on the public side.</p>

<p>If you wish to write a pury ruby application that responds to server requests you'll need to write it in its own app structure, not in a Rails application.</p>
