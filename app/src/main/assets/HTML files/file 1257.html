<p>if your server is *nix based, and you have CLI access to the server, try typing</p>

<p><code>php -i</code></p>

<p>and see if it spits out a ton of data about your configuration.  to automatically seach for cURL, do this:</p>

<p><code>php -i | grep cURL</code></p>

<p>and see if anything shows up.  if your server isn't *nix, you don't have access, or the command isn't found (it's not on the <code>$PATH</code>), I'd recommend the next way.</p>

<p>second way - save the following text as a file (for example phpinfo.php):</p>

<p><code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</code></p>

<p>and put it somewhere on your production environment that nobody's going to go to (for the minute you leave it there).  otherwise, if you're a security freak, let me know and I'll put some more code.</p>

<p>anyways, hit that file in a web browser (i.e. http:// production.server / secure_or_obscure_dir / phpinfo.php ), then delete the source file (while leaving the page open).</p>

<p>again, view this page for cURL or press CTRL + f, then type "cURL" (omit quotes).</p>

<p>if cURL is there, then it's installed, otherwise you have to install it.</p>

<p>if it's installed, you're probably not getting good data back.  check the <code>curl_errno</code> or <code>curl_error</code> on the cURL object (for the last error).</p>

<p>additionally, you get more info on the object by doing this:</p>

<p><code>print_r( curl_getinfo( $theNameOfYourCURLObject ) );</code></p>

<p>to see if you're getting error HTTP statuses ( > 400 ).</p>
