<p>Looks like CTView response to setAttString, but your self.view is a UIView instead of CTView. And usually the self.view of a viewController is just a UIView.  </p>

<p>If you created the view as an outlet in your IB, make sure you set it to be CTView class. </p>

<p>Or share where did you alloc inited the "self.view" in your last line of code. </p>
