<p>Table and Column names cannot be replaced by parameters in PDO.
You'd have to replace these with the actual names, offcourse you can filter out unwanted data if you wanted to, but not by using the prepared statements.</p>

<p>Won't work:</p>

<pre><code>$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('SELECT name, colour, calories FROM ?  WHERE calories &lt; ?');
</code></pre>

<p>THIS WORKS!</p>

<pre><code>$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('SELECT name, colour, calories FROM fruit WHERE calories &lt; ?');
</code></pre>
