<p>Okay, so the first step is, of course, to identify which elements you want to remove. Step two will be to remove them.</p>

<p>Identifying duplicates is easy enough and can be done in a number of ways. Here's how I'd do it:</p>

<pre><code>var counts = {};
for( var i=0, l=arr.length; i&lt;l; i++) {
    counts[arr[i]] = (counts[arr[i]] || 0) + 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Any key in <code>counts</code> that has a value greater than <code>1</code> will now need removing. That, too, is simple:</p>

<pre><code>var result = arr.filter(function(item) {
    return counts[item] &lt;= 1;
});
</code></pre>

<p>And... done! This will filter out any items where <code>counts[item] &lt;= 1</code> fails, effectively removing any item that appeared twice or more. It's that simple ^^</p>
