<p>If you capture the PID of the sqlldr command and wait for it to complete then you will be sure its complete. You can add a datestamp to the log file or timestamp if its run multiple times a day and do a while loop and sleep and check to see when the log prints its last line of completion. Then run the next step.</p>
