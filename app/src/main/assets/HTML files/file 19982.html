<p>I had the same issue with clang and glib-2.0. Clang_complete could not locate glib.h so I added a .clang_complete file like this</p>

<pre><code>`pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0`
</code></pre>

<p>It is located in the project base folder and I run vim from this folder.
It seems that clang_complete can now locate the header file but code completion for, e.g.,  glib methods still does not work.</p>
