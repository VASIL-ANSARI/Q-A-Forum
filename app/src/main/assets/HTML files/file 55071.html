<p>Well, you should have @2x and @3x version of the images, as it will mean less work by the CPU to scale up / down the image on different devices.  Also, there is technically work done by the CPU to scale an image up or down.  However, Apple's graphics processor is pretty efficient at scaling images.  </p>

<p>So the technical answer is "Yes, it does affect performance", but in reality it is probably not a big enough difference for you to notice.  </p>

<p>Now, if you have built a poorly written app that displays hundreds of these placeholders in a UIScrollView instead of some form of a UICollectionView (which only displays what is on screen, or about to be on screen), you will notice that the slight performance difference for all those images adds up to a large performance difference.</p>
