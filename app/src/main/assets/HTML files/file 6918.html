<p>Yes, you need to (*) and you need to do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Object myObject = new Object();
EventHandler handler = (object sender, EventArgs e) =&gt; { };
myObject.Event += handler; //Wired
myObject.Event -= handler; //Unwired
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6200424/event-fires-more-and-more-times/6200458#6200458">here</a> for an explanation.</p>

<p><strong>(*)</strong><br>
You don't need to do it because of garbage collection. You need to do it, if you don't want the event to call your handler any more.</p>

<p>UPDATE:<br>
To clarify a bit:<br>
The only reason, why you want to unwire an event handler is that the object defining the event handler can be garbage collected.<br>
Think about the following example:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a class <code>PowerSource</code> with an event <code>BlackOut</code>.</li>
<li>You have a class <code>LightBulb</code> that will be on, as long as there is power. It has a method <code>ConnectToPowerSource</code>. This method subscribes to the <code>BlackOut</code> event of the supplied <code>PowerSource</code>.</li>
<li>You have a collection that contains the light bulbs</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, simply removing a light bulb from the list will not make it get garbage collected, because the <code>PowerSource</code> is still holding a reference to the <code>LightBulb</code> instance in its <code>BlackOut</code> event. Only after unregistering the <code>LightBulb</code> from the <code>BlackOut</code> event will make the <code>LightBulb</code> get garbage collected.</p>
