<p>Or you could just increment the product by one with what you have already and make the product ids the key. Keep your inputs clean also.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
//Make sure user is logged in first
if( isset($_SESSION['login']))
{

    //Setup our shopping cart if it isnt already setup into an array table to hold item info
    if( empty($_SESSION['shoppingcart']))
    {
        $_SESSION['shoppingcart'] = array();

    }

    $id = $_GET['id'];
    $quantitytoadd = $_GET['quantity'];

    if( isset( $_SESSION['shoppingcart'][$id]))
    {
        //CODE TO ADD TO QUANTITY????
         $_SESSION['shoppingcart'][$id]++;

    }
    else
    {
        $_SESSION['shoppingcart'][$id] = 1;
    }
    echo("Item has been added to your cart!");


}
else
{
    echo("&lt;p&gt;Please login to add items to your shopping cart!&lt;/P&gt;");
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>
