<p>From a comment to the accepted answer of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7017281/performselector-may-cause-a-leak-because-its-selector-is-unknown">this question</a>, it appears that somebody at Apple has confirmed this hypothesis (citing the answer itself):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, there are times when memory management is tied to the name of the method by a specific convention. Specifically, I am thinking of convenience constructors versus make methods; the former return by convention an autoreleased object; the latter a retained object. The convention is based on the names of the selector, so if the compiler does not know the selector, then it cannot enforce the proper memory management rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, it has nothing to do with a possible leak of arguments passed to the <code>performSelector:</code> call, but rather to its returned value, for which Objective-C has no way of knowing if it was autoreleased or not. This is also what Martin R from the comments was assuming.</p>
