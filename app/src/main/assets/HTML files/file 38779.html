<p>Per <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.clock" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>, <code>time.clock</code> is different between Unix (including Mac OS X) and Windows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Unix, return the current processor time as a floating point number
  expressed in seconds. The precision, and in fact the very definition
  of the meaning of âprocessor timeâ, depends on that of the C function
  of the same name, but in any case, this is the function to use for
  benchmarking Python or timing algorithms.</p>
  
  <p>On Windows, this function returns wall-clock seconds elapsed since the
  first call to this function, as a floating point number, based on the
  Win32 function <code>QueryPerformanceCounter()</code>. The resolution is typically
  better than one microsecond.</p>

<p>If you want cross-platform consistency, consider <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.time" rel="nofollow"><code>time.time</code></a>.</p>

<p>The difference between <strong>processor time</strong> and <strong>wall-clock time</strong> is explained in this <a href="http://pymotw.com/2/time/#processor-clock-time" rel="nofollow">article by Doug Hellmann</a> - basically the processor clock is only advancing if your processs is doing work.</p>
