<p>Unfortunately you can't compare dates like that.
You could compare the dates like so:</p>

<pre><code>var date1 =new Date(logDate);
var date2 = new Date(closureDate);

if(date1.getTime() &lt; date2.getTime()) {
    //date1 is smaller than date2
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>getTime</code> returns you the date as timestamp (milliseconds since the epoch)</p>
