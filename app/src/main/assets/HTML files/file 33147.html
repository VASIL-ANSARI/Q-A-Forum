<p>The error console tells the story here.</p>

<pre><code>Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
      http://yellowtailderby.com/jquery-2.1.0.js

Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined 
</code></pre>

<p>So, when you try to execute:</p>

<pre><code>$(".navButton").load("bottomNav.html");
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$</code> symbol is not defined because jQuery is not successfully loaded.</p>

<p>The issue seems to be that this:</p>

<pre><code>http://yellowtailderby.com/jquery-2.1.0.js
</code></pre>

<p>does not exist (gets a 404 error) so this script tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="jquery-2.1.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>is not working properly.  The fix is to either correct the script tag or make sure that particular file is properly located on your server at that path.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am getting the exact same error in Firefox, so I suspect that maybe you have that file in your browser cache in Firefox (so it's getting loaded via cache), but it doesn't actually exist on the server.   The Firefox reports:</p>

<pre><code>"NetworkError: 404 Not Found - http://yellowtailderby.com/jquery-2.1.0.js"
</code></pre>
