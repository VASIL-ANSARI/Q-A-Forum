<p><code>Matrix::operator=()</code> isn't working correctly, it frees the old <code>data</code> array but then doesn't create a new one with the data that should be assigned.</p>

<p>It should rather look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Matrix&amp; Matrix::operator= (const Matrix &amp;B){
   // Don't do anything if B is the same object
   if (&amp;B == this)
      return *this;

   // delete data, as in the current version
   if(data != NULL){
      ...
   }

   // Create new array of arrays, fill with numbers from B
   data = new double*[B.getHeight()];
   ...

   return *this;
}
</code></pre>
