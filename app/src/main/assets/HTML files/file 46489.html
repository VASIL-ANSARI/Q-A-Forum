<p>There is nothing you can do on your end (client side).  You can not enable crossDomain calls yourself, the source (dailymotion.com) needs to have COORS enabled for this to work.</p>

<p>The only thing you can really do is to create a server side proxy script which does this for you.  Are you using any server side scripts in your project?  PHP, Python, ASP.NET etc?  If so, you could create a server side "proxy" script which makes the HTTP call to dailymotion and returns the response.  Then you call that script from your Javascript code, since that server side script is on the same domain as your script code, COORS will not be a problem.</p>
