<p>In Angular, we want to think about changing model/$scope properties, which will then automatically update the HTML view.  (We don't want/need to work with IDs.)  So declare a model property on the button that you want to change:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button ng-class="button_1111_class" id=...&gt;Value1&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(Above, button_1111_class is a property on $scope.)  Then, when you get your data, modify your button_1111_class model data in your controller, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.button_1111_class = 'red_bg_image';  // red_bg_image is a CSS class you define
</code></pre>

<p>and your view should update automatically.  </p>

<p>If you are getting your data outside AngularJS, you may need to wrap your model/$scope changes in $scope.$apply():  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10179488/the-view-is-not-updated-in-angularjs">The view is not updated in AngularJS</a></p>
