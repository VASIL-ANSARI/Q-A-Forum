<p>Most likely, your problem is the that you're reusing the <code>result</code> variables within your for loop. When you write:</p>

<pre><code>result1 += ((-1) * count);
</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>result1 = result1 + ((-1) * count);
</code></pre>

<p>So whatever value <code>result1</code> had before this point is added to <code>((-1) * count)</code> and the result is assigned back to <code>result1</code>. You probably have similar issues with <code>result2</code> and <code>result</code>. </p>

<p>The solution is to clear the variables (reset them back to 0) after you're done using them so that the previous values do not affect the later calculations or declare the temporary variables within the for loop to be used only within the scope that they are needed.</p>
