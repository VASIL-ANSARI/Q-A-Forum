<p>I ran into the same problem with Gitlab. Download as tar in my case works fine. I also found that the downloaded ZIP file actually contains all data, but is corrupted. The data from the ZIP file can still be recovered if Java is installed:</p>

<pre><code>jar xvf corrupted-zip-file.zip
</code></pre>
