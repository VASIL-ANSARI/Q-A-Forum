<p>I can suggest you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Error-Handling-Operators" rel="nofollow">Error Handling Operators</a> page in the RxJava documentation. Experiment with different operators to come up with the one that suits your use case best. I think you should probably go with some kind of default value returned by <code>onErrorResumeNext()</code>, e.g. returning a <code>new UserPublic[0]</code>. Calling <code>processError</code> here would be problematic, especially if it deals with UI, since you're probably still processing on a background thread.</p>
