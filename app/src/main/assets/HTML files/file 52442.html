<p>The code you show should work correctly both with and without selenium.  If it's not it generally means you have some JS code that is blocking the clicks, or with recent versions of selenium-webdriver that your elements may be hidden behind other elements (fixed header/footer bar for instance) - although that would normally show an error.   </p>

<p>Assuming it's not failing on every click you attempt, then you need to look at the ones that are failing and see what common things are being done (maybe post some of the html) - Since you say a 1 second sleep fixes it, I would guess you have some fields being transformed by JS libraries and the clicks are being ignored until the libraries have finished transforming the elements.</p>
