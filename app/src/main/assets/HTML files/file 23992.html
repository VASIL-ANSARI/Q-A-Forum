<p>You do not seem to have defined <code>T</code>. It's a placeholder. It requires definition.</p>

<p>This code might work if it were used in a context where <code>T</code> had a definition. For instance,</p>

<pre><code>private IList&lt;T&gt; AddDataTransferObjects(IList&lt;T&gt; dataTransferObjects)
    : where T : IMapperMarker
{
    IList&lt;T&gt; targetObjectsCollection = new List&lt;T&gt;();
    for (int counter = 0;  counter &lt; dataTransferObjects.Count; counter++)
    {
        targetObjectsCollection.Add(MappSharePointDAOToDTO(sharePointDaos[counter], dataTransferObjects[counter]));
    }
    return targetObjectsCollection;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you called that like this as follows:</p>

<pre><code>IList&lt;IMapperMarker&gt; dtoList = Something();
var list = AddDataTransferObjects(dtoList);
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the inner <code>T</code> would be bound to the type <code>IMapperMarker</code>.</p>
