<p>There are a couple of attributes of the combinations that may be used to optimize the brute force method:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using mirror images (horizontal, vertical, or both) you can generate 4 combinations for each one found (except horizontal or vertical lines). Maybe you could consider only combinations starting in one quadrant.</p></li>
<li><p>You can usually generate additional combinations of the same length by translation (moving a combination).</p></li>
</ol>
