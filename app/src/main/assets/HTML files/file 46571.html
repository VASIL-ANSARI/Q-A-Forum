<p>So apparently the problem is MySQL does NOT assume any specific order if none is provided. That means - with every query run listings might be sorted in a different way. My problem was - for listings with the same sorting value the order was random within the ones with the same value. Since technically 90% of the time the values were in fact different the problem was not as easy to spot. </p>
