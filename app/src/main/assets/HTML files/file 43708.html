<p>Geoprocessing tools will object to shapefiles (and dbase files) with an extra period in their name. Will need to rename the files prior to using them with CopyFeatures and other tools.</p>

<pre><code>folder, shp_name = os.path.split(shp)
name = os.path.splitext(shp_name)[0]

for file_name in os.listdir(folder):
    if file_name.startswith(name):
        os.rename(os.path.join(folder, file_name),
                  os.path.join(folder, file_name.replace('.', '_', 1)))
</code></pre>
