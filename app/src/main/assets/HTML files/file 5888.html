<p>OK, if I were to troubleshoot this issue, I would approach it as below:</p>

<p>1) If I am using .NET 4.0 make sure <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233103.aspx#aptca" rel="nofollow">this</a> is already handled.</p>

<p>2) Use ILDASM or reflector to open all DLLs in question on the bin folder to make sure <code>AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute</code> is set on them.</p>

<p>3) Use <code>AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()</code> at the time of error (using immediate window) to see which assembly is loaded from where. This I think could be your problem as I have seen too often that old or rogue versions of assemblies are loaded from GAC or various bin folders</p>

<p>I think using these 3 steps you will be able to find your problem.</p>
