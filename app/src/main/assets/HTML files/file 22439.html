<p>As simple as putting your space inside a character class? I am assuming you are only allowing a single space based on the re-formatting code in the second code block.</p>

<pre><code>var postcodePattern = /[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9]{1,2}[ ]{0,1}[0-9][A-Z]{2}/i;
            var resultPost = postcodePattern.test(words[i]);
            if(resultPost)  {   
            alert("Postcode detected: " + words[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>As per the comments, you are splitting you input on spaces as well here:</p>

<pre><code>bodyContentsStrippedTags.split(/\s+|\,|\&amp;|\||\/|\?|\!|\:|;|"/);
</code></pre>

<p>with the \s+ in your split regex. This means postal codes with a space get passed to your regex as two separate array items and not a single string.</p>
