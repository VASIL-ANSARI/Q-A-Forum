<p>According to your code <code>Data Source = .\SQLEXPRESS</code>, you'r trying to connect to a local server. If so you don't need any <strong>ID</strong> and <strong>Password</strong>. And be aware of using <code>Catalog</code>, it's somehow tricky and I hate it. To know how it's working, check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1949774/what-is-the-point-of-initial-catalog-in-a-sql-server-connection-string">this</a> out.</p>

<p>Actually I'm using this code and it works like a charm:</p>

<pre><code>SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(@"Server = localhost; Database = furniture_display; Integrated Security=True;");
</code></pre>
