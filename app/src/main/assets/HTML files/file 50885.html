<p>It doesn't render a screenshot, because the page has no <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> initially and therefore nothing to render. Everything, including the body, is loaded through JavaScript after PhantomJS' onLoadFinished event fires.</p>

<p>You need to wait a little for a full page load. A simple 5 second wait was sufficient for me:</p>

<pre><code>page.open('http://www.telegraaf.nl/', function(status) {
    setTimeout(function(){
        page.render("screenshot.png");
        phantom.exit();
    }, 5000);
});
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course wait in a more fancy way in order to make it more robust and not to wait too long: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/11340038/1816580">phantomjs not waiting for âfullâ page load</a></p>

<hr>

<p>You may need to run PhantomJS with <code>--ignore-ssl-errors=true</code> (and maybe <code>--ssl-protocol=any</code> if PhantomJS &lt;1.9.8).</p>
