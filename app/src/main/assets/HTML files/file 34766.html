<p>You can <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/AOT" rel="nofollow">use Mono to perform an ahead of time compilation</a>. But in the general case this is not possible because you can not really know for what types you have to instantiate generic types. Mono tries to figure it out using static analysis techniques but if you instantiate generic types using reflection this will obviously fail.</p>
