<ul>
<li>In the described case <code>Company</code>'s <code>id</code> will be used when persisting <code>Employee</code> object, but <code>Company</code> itself will not be merged (note that <code>Employee</code> is the owning side of the relationship)</li>
<li>If <code>Company</code> is transient rather than detached, you will get "object references an unsaved transient instance" error</li>
<li>If <code>cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST</code> is used, you will get "detached entity passed to persist" error.</li>
</ul>

<p>From JPA Specification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If X is a managed entity, it is
  synchronized to the database. </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>For
  all entities Y referenced by a
  relationship from X, if the
  relationship to Y has been annotated
  with the cascade element value
  cascade=PERSIST or cascade= ALL, the
  persist operation is applied to Y. </li>
  <li>For any entity Y referenced by a
  relationship from X, where the
  relationship to Y has not been
  annotated with the cascade element
  value cascade=PERSIST or cascade= ALL:
  <ul>
  <li>If Y is new or removed, an
  IllegalStateException will be thrown
  by the flush operation (and the
  transaction marked for rollback) or
  the transaction commit will fail. </li>
  <li>If
  Y is detached, the semantics depend
  upon the ownership of the
  relationship. <strong>If X owns the
  relationship, any changes to the
  relationship are synchronized with the
  database;</strong> otherwise, if Y owns the
  relationships, the behavior is
  undefined.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
