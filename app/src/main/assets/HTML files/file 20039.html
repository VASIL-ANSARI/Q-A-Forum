<p>I'm not sure what your app is suppose to look like, but I'm guessing your content should fit the screen better instead of being spread out having a lot of space around it. </p>

<p>One solution would be to have another layout file that adapts your content to the x-large screens. So in resources create a new folder called layout-xlarge and add a new xml layout file there. If its an extra large screen that one will be used instead. The drawables uses pixel-density instead of screen size so you still need all sizes for your graphics to look good.

<p>A second solution would be to decided if you want to support x-large screens or not. 
Then add this to your manifest:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;supports-screens
 android:xlargeScreens="false"
 /&gt;
</code></pre>
