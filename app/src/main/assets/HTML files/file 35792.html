<p>The problem is that the backslash character (<code>\</code>) is used both for escaping special characters in string literals (e.g. <code>\n</code> is interpreted as a single newline character, and <code>\\</code> as a single backslash character), and it's used in escaping special characters in regular expressions.</p>

<p>So when a string literal is used for a regexp, and you need the regexp to see <code>\</code>, you need to escape the backslash and include <code>\\</code> in the string literal. Specifically, in <code>email</code> you need <code>\\.</code> rather than <code>\.</code>. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>email: '^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&amp;â*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$'
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could put the regular expressions in <code>/.../</code> rather than <code>'...'</code> (or <code>'/.../'</code>). Then string literal escaping doesn't apply, and you don't need to double the slashes. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>email: /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&amp;â*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/
</code></pre>

<p>In the latter case, you also don't need <code>new RegExp(patterns.email)</code>, since <code>patterns.email</code> is already a RegExp object.</p>
