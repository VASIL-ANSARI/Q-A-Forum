<p>I am having the same problem.
My challenge is that the users want to retreive repeatedly for different criteria and they expect the results to accumulate in the grid until they clear the grid.  I am building this capability.  I got the accumulation to work, but along the way something is causing the "Displaying items 0 - 0 of 0".
This question has been sitting out here for a long time.  It makes me feel discouraged.
My theory is that the custom binding messes up the other settings.
