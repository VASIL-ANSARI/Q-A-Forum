<p><strong>Problem Solved</strong></p>

<p>What I didn't realise was that none of my dynamically created fields were populated when a partial page post-back occurred. After having a look at this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://forums.asp.net/t/1360420.aspx#_Why_dynamically_created" rel="nofollow">Why dynamically created controls disappear after a post back</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I discovered that the controls need to be reinitialized before page load i.e. in the Page_Init, I changed the code slightly so that in the _displaySingleQuestion() method I told the session what the Question ID was and then called the method in Page_Init so the controls for the current question were on the page to be queried by the save method.</p>

<pre><code>    public void Page_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        logger.Debug("Page_Init START");
        if (!Page.IsPostBack) { Session["qid"] = 0; }
        int qid = Convert.ToInt32(Session["qid"]);
        if (qid &gt; 0)
        {
            _displaySingleQuestion(_formObject, qid);
        }
        logger.Debug("Page_Init END");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This also meant that the AsyncFileUpload needed to be re-initialized before the page could continue, with this done my logging method is now recording that the fileuploadClick() event is being successfully called.</p>

<p>Note, I added the line </p>

<pre><code> if (!Page.IsPostBack) { Session["qid"] = 0; }
</code></pre>

<p>So that it would only try and get the values on a partial page postback and not a full page, such as when the page is first loaded.</p>
