<p>It's hard to tell with the code you've posted, but one guess is that ng-click won't work like that. ng-click was meant to call and invoke methods, not to define pieces of logic on the body. Angular probably sees the stuff you've defined in ng-click and doesn't know how to interpret it. Move your logic to your scope.</p>

<pre><code>$scope.changeFolder = function(){
    $scope.folderOpen = !$scope.folderOpen;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then change your html to reflect that. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a ng-click="changeFolder()" href="#"&gt;
  &lt;i ng-class="folderOpen ? 'fa fa-folder-open-o' : 'fa fa-folder-o'"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;{ item.pretty_name }&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
