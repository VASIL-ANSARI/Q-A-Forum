<p>Create your random object static</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
   public static Random rand = new Random();

   public int MyMethod()
   {
       return rand.Next() % 10 + 1;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Random works on <code>System.DatTime.Now.Ticks</code>. </p>

<p>If we do like this </p>

<pre><code>Random rand = new Random();
</code></pre>

<p>internally it happens as </p>

<pre><code>Random rand = new Random(System.DateTime.Now.Ticks);
</code></pre>

<p>Just think for a moment the only thing which is not constant in system is System Time.</p>

<p>When ever using Random class make its object once and use its method <code>Next()</code> where ever you want. You will find this situation in loops when random object is created inside loops.</p>

<p>In your code they are created one after another, they get created by same Ticks seed value.</p>

<p>Create your random object static and then they won't be same.</p>
