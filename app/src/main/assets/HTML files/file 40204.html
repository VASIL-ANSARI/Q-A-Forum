<p>Unless you explicitly specify an <code>order by</code> clause, there is absolutely no guarantee on the order of rows returned. The fact that you got them in the order you expected when you omitted to <code>length</code> condition is completely coincidental, and may very well break if the table is moved to different storage or the indexes rebuilt.</p>

<p>If you want your result ordered by <code>V.SITES_CODE</code>, you should explicitly state it:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT     V.CODE_OF_HOLIDAY, V.SITES_CODE, A.SITES_NAME, D.DESCRIPTION
FROM       ZZZ_SITES_VISITED V, ZZZ_SITES_AVAILABLE A, ZZZ_HOLIDAY_DETAILS H, ZZZ_DIFFICULTY_RATINGS D
WHERE      V.CODE_OF_HOLIDAY = H.CODE_OF_HOLIDAY
AND        A.SITES_CODE = V.SITES_CODE(+)
AND        H.DIFFICULTY_RATING = D.HOLIDAY_DIFICULTY
AND        H.CODE_OF_HOLIDAY = V.CODE_OF_HOLIDAY
AND        LENGTH(D.DESCRIPTION) &gt; 6
ORDER BY   V.SITES_CODE
</code></pre>
