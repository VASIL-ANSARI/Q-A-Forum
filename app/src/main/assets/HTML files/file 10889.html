<p>A usercontrol runs inside Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Basically Visual Studio loads the assembly containing the control and executes the control.</p>

<p>This means that if your control shows a message box for some event that is executed at design time, then that message box will be shown in Visual Studio as well.</p>

<p>To fix this, make sure your control doesn't execute harmful or similar code when hosted in Visual Studio.</p>
