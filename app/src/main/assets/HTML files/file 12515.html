<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED">The docs</a> for <code>PACKAGE_ADDED</code> state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a protected intent that can only be sent by the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can't modify it, or try to add flags to it. From the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.1.html">release notes for 3.1</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the system adds FLAG_EXCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES to all broadcast intents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and from the docs for <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#FLAG_EXCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES">FLAG_EXCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If set, this intent will not match any components in packages that are currently stopped. If this is not set, then the default behavior is to include such applications in the result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this means that your app won't work the same way as it used to. You'll have to make sure your app is started in order to receive PACKAGE_ADDED.</p>
