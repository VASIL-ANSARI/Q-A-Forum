<p>Update: I overlooked the fact that 'resize' is coming from XQuartz's (xserver/xterm) package which Apple no longer supplies directly nor maintains; see the XQuartz project for info. See Swell's answer as it uses the term size escape sequence (all that resize is really doing).</p>

<p>You can use system call to 'resize' (<strong>man resize</strong> for details). This is  standard across all(?) xterm and shells (bash/tsh/csh/...)</p>

<p>Assuming you are not using ncurses, but if you are and had a resize handler set, you will get the resize event just like if the user resize the terminal using their mouse.</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace Demo.Native.ResizeTerm
{
    class MainClass
    {
        [DllImport ("libc")]
        private static extern int system (string exec);


        public static void Main (string[] args)
        {
            system("resize -s 50 100 &gt; /dev/null");
            Console.WriteLine ("We will be 50 lines and 100 columns in Terminal.app now");
            Console.ReadKey ();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I added this sample to the CursesSharp repo, github link to source : <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/CursesSharp/blob/368906549512446dc5e97f8c9214c482d6847aac/CursesSharp.Demo/Demo.Native.ResizeTerm/Program.cs" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sushihangover/CursesSharp/blob/368906549512446dc5e97f8c9214c482d6847aac/CursesSharp.Demo/Demo.Native.ResizeTerm/Program.cs</a></p>
