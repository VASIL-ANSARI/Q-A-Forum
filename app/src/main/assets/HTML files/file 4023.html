<p>See <a href="http://www.sqlmonster.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/sql-server-programming/74464/sp-columns-running-slow" rel="nofollow">this post</a> and try switching database compatibility level to 100 for SQL Server 2008. Maybe if you moved the database from 2005 to 2008 the performance hit is coming from there.</p>
