<p>I think the problem is that, in step 3, you try to set the <code>className</code> of <code>accordionParagraphs</code>, which is actually an array rather than an element.</p>

<p>Try replacing it with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>accordionHeadings[i].onclick = function accordion() {

    // 'this' refers to the element that was clicked
    // 'nextElementSibling' gets the element directly after it
    var accParagraph = this.nextElementSibling;

    // now you have the right element, you can change its class
    if (accParagraph.className == 'hidecontent') {
        accParagraph.className = 'showcontent';
    } else {
        accParagraph.className = 'hidecontent';
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>You could also do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>// 'this' refers to the element that was clicked (heading)
// 'parentNode' gets its parent
// 'getElementsByTagName('p')[0]' selects the first &lt;p&gt; element
var accParagraph = this.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('p')[0]; 
</code></pre>
