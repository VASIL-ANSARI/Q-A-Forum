<pre><code>$imones = array ("php.net","w3schools.com", "stackoverflow.com");
foreach($imones as $url1) {
    $curl1 = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($curl1, CURLOPT_URL, $url1);
    curl_setopt($curl1, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, TRUE);
    curl_exec($curl1);
    $contime1 = curl_getinfo($curl1, CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME);
    echo $url1 . ' took ' . $contime1 . ' seconds to connect&lt;br /&gt;';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Tested. Sample result: </p>

<pre><code>php.net took 0.032 seconds to connect 
w3schools.com took 0.124 seconds to connect 
stackoverflow.com took 0.016 seconds to connect
