<p>I found a new information that can help to solve the problem :</p>

<p>The annotation @EmbeddedId is used to specify a primary key, so if one of the fields of this key is null, then it returns a null entity.</p>

<p>The new problem is that the entities are generated automatically using Hibernate, and even if a View does not have a primary key, the part with @EmbeddedId is created.</p>

<p>So how do you think the problem can be solved? </p>
