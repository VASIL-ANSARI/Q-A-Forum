<p>That will not work. Android generally will not load <code>java</code>/<code>javax</code> classes from elsewhere, and as Selvin notes, <code>javax.print</code> is not part of Android itself.</p>

<p>You are welcome to use <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/printing/index.html" rel="nofollow">the printing APIs added to Android 4.4</a>. Prior to that, there was no printing support in Android, though various third-party tools (e.g., Google Cloud Print) offered various ways for people to connect to specific printers.</p>
