<p>Two things come to mind right away: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>a parent node is still pointing at the node which you deleted</p></li>
<li><p>the node you're deleting might have a <code>node-&gt;right</code> pointer hanging off of it, which you are lopping off the tree, instead of re-hooking it back into the tree.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There might be more problems, but you need to address these issues at a bare minimum.</p>
