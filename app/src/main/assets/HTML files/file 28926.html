<p>You are not doing the same as in the opencv version. If you do, you'll get the wanted results:</p>

<pre><code>fork = mh.imread(path)
bin = fork[:,:,0]
bin = mh.erode(bin)
bin = (bin &lt; 127)
</code></pre>

<p>The erosion step was missing and the threshold was different.</p>

<pre><code>from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(bin)
plt.gray()
</code></pre>
