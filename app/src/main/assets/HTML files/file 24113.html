<li><p>Does the stripping of spaces also happen in the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mobile/worklight/getting-started.html#advanced" rel="nofollow">Push Notifications sample application provided in the IBM Worklight Getting Started training material</a>? Because for me, it doesn't.</p>

<p>If it happens only in your application, need to understand how you're processing the message.</p></li>
<li><p>As I have mentioned to you in a comment elsewhere, Worklight does not place any restrictions - each PNS (APNS, MSPN, GCM) has its own limitation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The 256 bytes are not only for the message part of the payload, but for the entirety of the payload, so it could be that for the message part what is left is only 65 characters, but again, this is not in Worklight's control. </p>

<p>I haven't done this yet myself, but you can start stripping the payload and see when it fails, that would be your minimum payload from Worklight's perspective.</p>

<p>The message is not meant to be long in principle. </p>

<p>Another way to maybe increase what you can pass in the message (in the remaining size of the payload)  is to use an alias so that less information is passed, thus more space remains for the message.</p>
