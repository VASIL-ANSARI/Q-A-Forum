<p>there are a number of things you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>set permissions on the directory containing the files</li>
<li>set permissions on the files</li>
<li>set up your server directives to mod rewrite your urls so that way only things in a "public" folder are accessible by direct linking, otherwise they must be loaded by proxy via server side code.</li>
</ul>

<p>I prefer method 3. </p>
