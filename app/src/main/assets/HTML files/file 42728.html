<p>I have since discovered that there was actually no issue with the database being copied - I had set the application to open once the installer exited and each time, it would throw an exception when I tried to access data. However, when I launched it from Program Files, it worked perfectly. So there's just an issue with my wix installer launching after install, I think - it's a new issue though!</p>
