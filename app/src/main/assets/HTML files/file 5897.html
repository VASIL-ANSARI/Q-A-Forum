<p>You should literally be able to copy the XmlRpc folder from your copy of Zend Framework and use it in your own projects. The only dependency that I can see is in XmlRpc/Exception.php as it requires a file in the root directory of Zend/ (Exception.php) you could simply copy this file along with the XmlRpc folder keeping the directory structure the same and it should work....</p>
