<p>2 possible Linux-only solutions are <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html" rel="nofollow">splice()</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html" rel="nofollow">sendfile()</a>. What they do is copy data without it ever leaving kernel space, thus making a potentially significant performance optimization.</p>

<p>Note that <strong>both have limitations</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html" rel="nofollow">sendfile()</a> requires a socket for its output for Linux kernels before 2.6.33, after that, any file can be the output, and also it requires the input to support <code>mmap()</code> operations, meaning the input can't be <code>stdin</code> or a pipe.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/splice.2.html" rel="nofollow">splice()</a> requires one of the input or output streams to be a pipe (not sure about both), and also for kernel versions 2.6.30.10 and older, it requires the file system for the stream that is not a pipe to support splicing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Note that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3668131/492336">some filesystems might not support splicing for Linux 2.6.30.10 and below</a>.</p>
