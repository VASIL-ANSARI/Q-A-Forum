<p>I have a more straightforward way to move a circle. Your code is too long for me to read. See if you like this!</p>

<p>If I were you, I would use a <code>PictureBox</code>. I first create an image of a circle, and then put that image in the <code>PictureBox</code>. Then you can just use a timer to change the position of the <code>PictureBox</code>.</p>

<p>You should set the <code>Interval</code> of the timer to 33 ms, which is roughly 30 fps. This is how you would programme the timer:</p>

<p>Keep a counter to indicate how many pixels the circle has moved. Let's say you want it to move in a 100px x 50px rectangular path. </p>

<pre><code>For every 33ms,
    If the counter is less than 100, 
        increase the X position and the counter by 1, 
    if the counter is between 101 and 150, 
        increase the Y position and the counter by 1, 
    if the counter is between 151 and 250, 
        decrease the X position by 1 and increment the counter
    if the counter is between 251 and 300,
        decrease the Y position by 1 and increment the counter
    if the counter is greater than 300,
        stop the timer
</code></pre>

<p>I really don't like drawing stuff on the screen with the <code>OnPaint</code> event. I mean, you are <em>moving</em> a ball! People think of this as changing the x and y positions of a ball, not as deleting the ball at the previous position and drawing it in the new position. Changing the position of the picture box just makes LOTS more sense, don't you think so?</p>
