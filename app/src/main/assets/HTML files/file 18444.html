<p>The command you're trying to use fire a solr server, but you're using websolr as you stated in your configuration. </p>

<p>You don't need to run that command except in local, where you don't rely on websolr. </p>

<p>According to the documentation, sunspot_rails handles WEBSOLR_URL you could check with "heroku config" if that environment variable is correctly set by the addon. </p>

<p>Moreover, <a href="https://github.com/outoftime/sunspot/blob/master/sunspot_rails/lib/sunspot/rails/configuration.rb#L312" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/outoftime/sunspot/blob/master/sunspot_rails/lib/sunspot/rails/configuration.rb#L312</a> tells us that if you do not give any url or host in the yml under the production key it will fallback to that environement variable. So you may just need to wipe the hostname and port from there and it should work as intended.</p>
