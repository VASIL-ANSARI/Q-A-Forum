<p>Create a <code>9 patch</code> of the same image, mark the expandable area as everything above this border, and set this <code>9 patch</code> as the background of the view to which you want to have this border.</p>

<p>You could also, create a <code>LinearLayout</code> with required height (2-3 dp?) and use this as the background image. Put this layout below the view for which you want this border.</p>
