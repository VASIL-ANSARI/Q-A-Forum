<p><code>1100 * 10^9</code> is <code>1.1*10^12</code> elements. Let's for a moment assume that these elements are 4-byte integers, that's a total allocation of:</p>

<p><code>4.4 * 10^12</code> bytes</p>

<p>dividing by 1024 * 1024 * 1024 to get gigabytes...</p>

<p><code>1,048,017.748 GB</code> - which is about a thousand terabytes. </p>

<p>I don't think there is a processor architecture anywhere on the planet which can address, let alone allocate, this much ram.</p>

<p>(although if I'm wrong about this I'd be fascinated to hear it!)</p>
