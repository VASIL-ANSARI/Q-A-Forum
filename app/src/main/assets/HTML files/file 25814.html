<p>It sounds like you can make changes to the code. Have you considered just using a logging framework (like slf4j) and writting trace messages to the log at the entry and exit points of the methods you're interested in? Logging is, basically, auditing, which is what I think you're really looking for.</p>

<p>The difficulty you're going to find with the annotation approach is having some way to process them at runtime. You can use spring aspects if the classes you're talking about are spring beans, or you can use compile-time-weaving (CTW) to introduce advice around the annotated methods to audit information concerning the method's params and return values (at a push you could use load-time-weaving, but that approach really is nonsense for most applications). CTW is much more difficult, but necessary if you're creating instances of objects in code (that is, you're auditing the domain model, rather than the static infrastructure), or you're auditing a big-ball of mud.</p>

<p>Finally, after 35 years of hard-earned experience, I can tell you as a fact (although I can't actually prove it), if you're having these sorts of problems than it's always easier and less expensive to throw away the system you have and re-implement it from scratch. A.l.w.a.y.s.</p>
