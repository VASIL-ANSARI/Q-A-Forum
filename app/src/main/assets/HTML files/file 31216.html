<p>The way I've typically dealt with this type of situation is as you've mentioned, pre-populating each "outer" elements with a set of known values.  This works under the assumption that you know exactly how many elements you want in the second dimension of the array, and that you know ahead of time how many elements will be in the first.  Here is some code to demonstrate:</p>

<pre><code>$pageviews = array();
$articles = Array("00", "01", "02", "03");

$prepopulated = Array (
    "Article 1" =&gt; 0,
    "Article 2" =&gt; 0,
    "Article 3" =&gt; 0,
    "Article 4" =&gt; 0,
    "Article 5" =&gt; 0
);
</code></pre>

<p>You can then create a skeleton array before importing the csv:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($articles as $article) {
    $pageviews[$article] = $prepopulated;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when you import the data from the csv, all that you're doing is overwriting the default values in the skeleton array you just created:</p>

<pre><code>if (($handle = fopen("pageviews.csv", "r")) !== FALSE) {
    while (($data = fgetcsv($handle, 1000, ",")) !== FALSE) {
        $pageviews[$data[0]][$data[1]] = $data[2];
    }
    fclose($handle);
}
</code></pre>
