<p>I guess the problem is the from submitting, I don't think you actually want to load a new page there, so try: <code>onsubmit="greeting(); return false;"</code> to call your function but stop the form submit event.</p>

<p>Otherwise the submit action will try and reload the page -- which jsFiddle is not liking very much. </p>
