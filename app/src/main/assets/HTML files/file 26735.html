<p>Here is how you would get the score changes and kills that occur on any given calendar day:</p>

<pre><code>select date(date) as thedate, max(score) - min(score) as DayScore,
       max(kills) - min(kills) as DayKills
from datapoints dp
where player_name = :player
group by date(date);
</code></pre>

<p>To get the top day for scores, for instance, you would add an <code>order by</code> and <code>limit</code> clause like this:</p>

<pre><code>order by DayScore desc
limit 1;
</code></pre>
