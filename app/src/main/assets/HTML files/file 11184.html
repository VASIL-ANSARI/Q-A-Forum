<p>Remove the following and everything will be fine. </p>

<pre><code>    private void ChildWindow_Closed(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        this.DialogResult = false;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And to evaluate a bit more, ChildWindow_Closed is the outcome of setting the DialogResult at the first place. 
By re setting it unexpected things happen. </p>
