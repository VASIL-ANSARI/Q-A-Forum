<p>Not exclusively. It refers to any native code you provide access to through <code>DllImport</code>.</p>

<p>You know what your function does. Otherwise you wouldn't be making it available. Then consider whether a malicious user, having only access to managed and safe native code, would be able to mess up the program (or worse) if also given access to the function you're looking at.</p>

<p>Pretty much any function taking pointers that you actually expose as pointers will be unsafe, but the reverse is not true, functions that don't involve pointers can still be unsafe too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that if you are not dealing with any untrusted code, you can just put everything in a <code>NativeMethods</code> class and not worry about safe or unsafe.</p>
