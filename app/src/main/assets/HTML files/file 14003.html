<p>Seems like your view is in wrong location because you mentioned that Controller, Views are under a folder called "MVC". </p>

<p>The "Views" folder should be under the root directory, that is the place where ViewEngine looks for the views.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
You can override this default behavior using a custom ViewEngine. For that implement <code>IViewEngine</code> interface and it has got a method called <code>FindView</code> where you can implement your own logic to scan different location.</p>
