<p>When you declare a variable in C, it only exists in the <strong>scope</strong> in which it is declared. If you declare it inside a function, it only exists <strong>inside that function</strong>.</p>

<p>You need to declare <code>test</code> as an instance variable in your class if you want to be able to access it from all of the object's instance methods:</p>

<pre><code>@interface ViewController : UIViewController {
    WifMon *test;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>test</code> will be available in all instance methods of the object.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want the instance variable to be accessible by other objects, or be able to access it using <code>self.test</code>, you can declare it like this:</p>

<pre><code>@interface ViewController : UIViewController

@property (strong) WifMon *test;

...

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can access it using <code>self.test</code>.</p>

<p>Note that this example is using ARC (which is enabled by default so you are probably already using it), but if you aren't, you will need to declare the property as <code>retain</code> instead of <code>strong</code>, and remember to release <code>test</code> in your <code>dealloc</code> method.</p>
