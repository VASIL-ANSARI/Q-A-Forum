<p>Your problem here is not LINQ but that your List argument is passed by value, so in your outer code you still have the modified copy of the List that you passed but not the new one created by the <code>ToList</code> method inside the method <code>ChangeList</code>.</p>

<p>To get the new list created by the ToList method you have to pass the argument by reference in this way :</p>

<pre><code>  void ChangeList(ref List&lt;int&gt; list)
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Remember that by default C# is pass by value .</em></strong></p>
