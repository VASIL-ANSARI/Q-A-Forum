<p>You have couple of problems in your code.</p>

<p>You cannot have loose variable declared as part of the class definitions. Only private/public/protected or nothing is allowed. No access modifier is the same as public. Therefore your #1,2,3 are valid. But #4 is not.</p>

<p>If you want to access instance field in your class method your should use 'this' keyword:</p>

<pre><code> for (var i: number = 0; i &lt; this.numberArray1.length; i++) {
         //validate numbers
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Or declare this field as static:</p>

<pre><code>private static numberArray1: number[] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
</code></pre>

<p>And access it through class name:</p>

<pre><code>for (var i: number = 0; i &lt; NumberClass.numberArray1.length; i++) {
        //validate numbers
}
</code></pre>
