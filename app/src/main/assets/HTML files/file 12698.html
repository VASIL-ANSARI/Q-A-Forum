<p>I think this is an okay approach but there are a couple of considerations to be made:</p>

<ul>
<li>You're sharing the dataModel with 2 views so you may have to update the view when you return to the DiagnosticsStudiesViewController's parent (self in your code) depending on how dataModel data is displayed.</li>
<li>This might get hairy in the future if you need to thread your code.  In that case you might have to make a copy of the dataModel to pass to DiagnosticsStudiesViewController or handle edits to dataModel in a thread-safe manner.</li>
<li>You'll obviously require a network connection for both view controllers to work so you've made a workflow decision with your two view controllers by pulling dataModel from the server.  In the future it may be hard to uncouple these view controllers.   </li>
</ul>

<p>If it works for your case and the decision has been made to not persist I think you'll be fine.</p>
