<p>Without code it's impossible to help. Post some excerpts at least.What kind of "jquery accordion" are you using?
Most likely the accordion has some css that makes an item <strong>appear</strong> "active"; you could check for clicks on an item (ie it is being closed, but not because some other item opens, but because the items is "minimized") and then revoke the css that makes it appear active.</p>
