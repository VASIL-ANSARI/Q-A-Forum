<p>Decreasing is difficult, but increasing the space between two adjacent items is easy: just insert an empty <code>Item</code> between them with the needed additional vertical space (minus the amount of one extra regular spacing, of course) as <code>height</code>. Don't forget to also set a non-zero <code>width</code> or otherwise the item won't be taken into account for the layout calculation. </p>

<p>With no spacing set for the <code>Column</code> itself you can achieve this way every spacing configuration possible. This is obviously a bit hacky, but there is no other way. </p>
