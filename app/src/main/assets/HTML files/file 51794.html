<p>You can run your own TextSecure server, but first of all you need to create accounts at Twilio, AWS S3, Google Developer and Apple Developer.
Twilio - for sms broadcasting(for registration in TextServer).
AWS - for documents in TextSecure.
Google developer - for push notifications.
Apple Developer - for push notifications(i didn't reg this one because i did hack Push server).
After thay you need to install: JDK and Cryptography extension, Maven, Postgresql, Redis.
With Maven install: Dropwizard-simpleauth, WebSocket-Resources.
With Maven compile PushServer and start it with your settings (redis, auth, gcm, apn).
With Maven compile TextServer with -DskipTests key.
After that you can use your own TextServer but without RedPhone. The RedPhone repo was deleted from github.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you.</p>
