<p>In your second example both <code>obj</code> and <code>myObject</code> have been dealloc'd after you call <code>-release</code> since the retain count goes from 1 to zero.  In the first example, since your <code>@property</code> has "retain", the retain count goes from 1, to 2, then back to 1 when you release it, so it is not dealloc'd.</p>

<p>In short, you should <em>not</em> release objects you directly assign to ivars, except from within your <code>-dealloc</code> method, or before assigning something else to the same ivar.</p>
