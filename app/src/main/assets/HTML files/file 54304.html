<p>I don't think there is a good way of doing so.
It's really a bad practise to handle activity references like that, since android wouldn't be able to gc them when needed (orientation changes, lack of memory).
<br/>
<br/>
The best way is to pass all the data you need with <code>Intent</code> extras (intent that you use to start activity), and, if you need <strong>SecondActivity</strong> to return something, use <code>Fragment1.startActivityForResult()</code> for starting activity, and when done, use <code>SecondActivity.setResult()</code> to return desired result, you will need to override <code>onActivityResult()</code> to get the result (there are plenty tutorials about this).
<br/>
<br/>
If you absolutely need to hold references to something, you can use your own instance of <code>Application</code> class (don't forget to declare it in the manifest) to hold data for you while application is running.</p>
