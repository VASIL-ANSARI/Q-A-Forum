<p>Edit, updated:</p>

<p>graphics.PreferMultiSampling only enables anti-aliasing on the back buffer. I think the problem might be that when drawing to your render target it isn't drawing there with anti-aliasing. </p>

<p>The RenderTarget2D constructor has an overload that takes a preferredMultiSampleCount parameter. Try calling that and pass say 4 as the preferred multi sample count. If that works you might then be able to turn off multisampling on the back buffer.</p>

<p>Old:
I had the same problem as I was rendering in 3D to create non-square tiles out of polygons and then switching to SpriteBatch to draw in 2D*. The SpriteBatch.Begin() changes a whole bunch of render states under the cover, which will screw up subsequent (even next frame) 3D draws. So you need to reset these states before doing the 3D drawing.</p>

<p>Hopefully that's the problem anyway.</p>

<p>*although anti-aliasing wasn't my problem, it was more severe it just wasn't drawing.</p>
