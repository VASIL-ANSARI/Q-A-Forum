<p>I cannot understand why you are passing NPViewController (ViewController) to InternalTabViewController(ViewController) and moment later you dismiss it ( dismissViewControllerAnimated).</p>

<p>As you need only string i would recommend redesigning protocol</p>

<pre><code>-(void) passItemBack: (NPViewController *) controller didFinishWithItem: (NSString *) string;
</code></pre>

<p>to something simpler</p>

<pre><code>-(void) passItemBack:(NSString*) item;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if it will solve problem. If I would have your full code I could help. </p>
