<p>First and foremost, simply test it and see will it fly. Also cheating on a test is bad.
Anywho obvious mistakes:</p>

<ul>
<li>not using between for your WHERE statements
(<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp</a>)</li>
<li>LIMIT goes at the end (or almost) of your statement</li>
<li>The amount in limit is plain wrong, should be 10.</li>
<li>Minimal price is supposed to be 3000, not 2000.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is enough help for a query, have fun doing the work!</p>
