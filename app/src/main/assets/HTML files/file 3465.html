<p>There's the <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/comment.php?mode=view&amp;cid=114974" rel="nofollow">CrashReporterPrefs app</a> that comes with XCode (search for it with Spotlight; should be in <code>/Developer/Applications/Utilities</code>).  That can be to set to Server Mode to disable the application 'Unexpectedly Quit' dialog too.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20091230100541242" rel="nofollow">another suggestion</a>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/Problem\ Reporter.app
</code></pre>

<p>To re-enable, do the following:</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/Problem\ Reporter.app
</code></pre>

<p>It might be that the application is dumping a large core file - you'd probably notice the effect on available disk space though.  You can switch off core dumping using</p>

<pre><code>sudo sysctl -w kern.coredump=0
</code></pre>

<p>Reactivate by setting <code>=1</code>.</p>
