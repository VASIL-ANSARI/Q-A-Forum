  <p>My question is why doesn't the same thing happen at code 2 but with the method f itself?</p>

<p>Because the class that contains the method <code>f</code> hasn't been disposed yet. See, in the first case somebody else created <code>sc</code> so it was able to dispose it--but in the second case you created <code>sc</code> inside the method. It's going to stay in scope while the class that created it is in scope.</p>
