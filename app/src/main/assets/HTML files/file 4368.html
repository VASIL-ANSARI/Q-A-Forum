<p>Making <code>ps</code> globally visible requires that it is a global variable. You probably also need to do this for the number of columns and lines.</p>

<pre><code>struct ponto *ps;
int colunas, linhas;

int main()
{
    colunas = /* whatever */;
    linhas  = /* whatever */;
    ps = malloc(sizeof(struct ponto) * colunas * linhas);
    /* do other stuff */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>ps</code> is visible to all functions in the source file and through it, they can access the memory it points to.</p>

<p>If you have multiple source files, you'll have to tell them about <code>ps</code> in a header file which declares it</p>

<pre><code>struct ponto { /* whatever */ };  /* define the struct in the header */
extern struct ponto *ps;
extern int colunas, linhas;
</code></pre>

<p><code>realloc</code> performs an entirely different operation, it resizes the buffer <code>ps</code> points to. <code>null</code> does not exist in standard C.</p>
