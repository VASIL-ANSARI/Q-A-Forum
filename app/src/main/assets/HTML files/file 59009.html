<p>You should not be putting any code in <code>
$( document ).ready()</code> - a node's edit form only gets created when a node is being edited.</p>

<p>You should add any code you need for the edit form into the node's <code>oneditprepare</code> function. That gets called each time the edit form is being built for a node.</p>
