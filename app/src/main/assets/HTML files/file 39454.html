<p>I am assuming you are using the .NET's default Emal api found in the <code>System.Net.Mail</code> namespace.</p>

<p>You can add the file as an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.attachment%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">attachment</a> to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mail.mailmessage%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>System.Net.Mail.MailMessage</code></a> object. </p>

<p>The <code>System.Net.Mail.Attachment</code> class accepts a constructor that can take the stream which you could have used to create the xls file. So, if you create the excel file on the fly, you'll probably already have a reference to the stream where it is written. Then you need to use the code below:</p>

<pre><code>using (Stream myXlsFileStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    // assumig you populate the stream like this...
    WriteXlsToStream(myXlsFileStream);
    myXlsFileStream.Flush();


    MailMessage message = new MailMessage();
    // configure mail message contents ...
    using (Attachment xlsAttachment = new Attachment(
            myXlsFileStream, 
            "FileNameToAppearInEmail.xls", 
            "application/xls"))
    {
        message.Attachments.Add(xlsAttachment);

        // send the message
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please, note that the stream must not be closed, and all data should have been written to it. You may need to call <code>myXlsFileStream.Flush()</code> (as in above code) before adding the attachment, in order to ensure that the file is entirely written.</p>
