<p>I would loosely couple the solution and not try to do everything on the Java EE/Servlet container as exchanging data using sockets (managed by the application itself) is not something you typically want to do from a Java EE/Servlet container.</p>

<p>Running this on a Java EE container might also be overkill as this doesn't sound like a typical enterprise application where stuff like security and transaction management is important and the app could benefit from services provided by the Java EE/Servlet container.</p>
