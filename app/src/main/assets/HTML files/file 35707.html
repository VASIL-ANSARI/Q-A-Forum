<p>Yes, it's safe. And it doesn't matter that a "temporary" array is being created, you got the result you wanted and stored it in the local variable <code>ret</code>, so it won't go away. Garbage collection doesn't work like that, only the objects that are no longer referenced (say, by a local variable) are candidates for being garbage collected.</p>
