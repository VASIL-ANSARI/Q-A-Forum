<p>Ok, what happens in your code now is that you draw your image after the restore call has been called resulting in that nothing happens.</p>

<p>This is because the image loading is asynchronous.</p>

<p>What you need to do is to integrate the image loading so that it finishes earlier in the pipe-line, <em>then</em> use the image integrated in the scaling, for example by taking the image loading out of the <code>draw</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
var imageObj = new Image();

imageObj.onload = function() {
    /// now the image has loaded, now we can scale it
    draw();
};
imageObj.src = 'image-url';

function draw() {
    // clear canvas
    context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    context.save();
    context.translate(translatePos.x, translatePos.y);
    context.scale(scale, scale);

    /// draw image here
    context.drawImage(imageObj, 69, 50);

    context.restore();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then for each time you need to re-scale the image just call <code>draw()</code>.</p>
