<p>Start by creating multiple AVDs of level 7 (android 2.1) with different screen resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>QVGA</li>
<li>HVGA</li>
<li>WVGA</li>
</ul>

<p>Test the screen rotation (Ctrl-F11).
If your application runs fine with these three emulators, you can be pretty sure it will run fine on level 7 and above with different screen resolutions.</p>

<p>If you want to go the extra mile, you can test your application on AVDs level 8, 9, 10 ... with different screen resolutions...</p>
