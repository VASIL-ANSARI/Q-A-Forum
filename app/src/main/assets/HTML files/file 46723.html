<p>In your second query, you didn't put quotes around the strings. So it treats your variable containing 'aaron' as meaning a column.</p>

<p>This would be best solved by actually using parameterized queries.</p>

<pre><code>$query = "INSERT INTO users (vid, fname, ...) VALUES (:vid, :fname, ...)";
$stmt = $conn-&gt;prepare($query);
$stmt-&gt;execute(['vid'=&gt;$xml-&gt;vid, 'fname'=&gt;$xml-&gt;fname, ...]);
</code></pre>
