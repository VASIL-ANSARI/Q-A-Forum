<p>I would just add the image as a resource to your project, this will bake it into the DLL/EXE itself. Right-click your project and select Properties and then click on Resources. Click Add Resource and then Add Existing File. Select your image and optionally rename it. Then in your code you can access it using its fully qualified name:</p>

<pre><code>var img = WindowsFormsApplication1.Properties.Resources.logo;
var logo = iTextSharp.text.Image.GetInstance(img, BaseColor.WHITE);
doc.Add(logo);
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>WindowsFormsApplication1</code> with whatever namespace you have setup for your project.</p>
