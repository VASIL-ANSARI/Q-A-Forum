<p>Use a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html">lookahead assertion</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$result = preg_replace('/, (?=\p{Lu})/u', '&lt;br /&gt;\n', $subject);
</code></pre>

<p>The regex means "Match a <code>,</code> and a space, but only if they are followed by an uppercase Unicode letter". That way, the letter doesn't become part of the match itself.</p>
