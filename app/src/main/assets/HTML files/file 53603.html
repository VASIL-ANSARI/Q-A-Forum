<p>As suggested by Ziv Weissman (in the comments section above) and after wasting quite a few hours on this, I have abandoned the AngularJs style validation process for the Login button and the input type password as well.</p>

<p>Chrome pretends it does not have a value for the field as a security measure. There's no way to hack around that. from: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29964035/input-type-password-value-returning-empty-unless-i-use-a-breakpoint-in-the-chrom">here</a></p>
