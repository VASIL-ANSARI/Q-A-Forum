<p>It's not that nothing is printed to the screen, it's that you do all your printing in a few microseconds, at which point you restore the pre-<code>curses</code> screen and exit. Throw in a <code>pad.getch()</code> or just a <code>time.sleep(1)</code> and you'll see the output.</p>

<p>If you want this to go slowly enough that you can watch it, instead of as fast as your computer can count up numbers, you'll want a delay (and a <code>refresh</code>) inside the loop.</p>
