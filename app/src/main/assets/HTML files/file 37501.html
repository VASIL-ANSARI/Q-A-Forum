<p>It seems what you want to do is some kind of <strong>"Conditional aggregation"</strong>. Right now <code>Aggregation</code> functions do not support lookups like <code>filter</code> or <code>exclude</code>: fieldname__lt, fieldname__gt, ...</p>

<p>So you can try this:</p>

<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-aggregate-if" rel="nofollow">django-aggregate-if</a></p>

<p>Description taken from the official page.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conditional aggregates for Django queries, just like the famous SumIf and CountIf in Excel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also first <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/models/querysets/#annotate" rel="nofollow">annotate</a> the desired value for each team, I mean count for each team the ammount of <code>True</code> in the field you are interested. And then do all the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/models/querysets/#aggregate" rel="nofollow">aggregation</a> you want to do.</p>
