<p>Of course, you have to connect to the database before you can change it.  You do that with the following:  <code>$mydb = mysqli_connect('yourHost', 'yourUserName', 'yourPassword', 'yourDatabase');</code></p>

<p>After connecting to your database in PHP, you can use <code>mysqlyi_query($mydb, 'ALTER table tbldocument alter docID int(11) not null auto_increment')</code></p>

<p>You can do that for every attribute that you want to change, and in fact any SQL you want to run from PHP, provided you have the correct permission.  Bear in mind that if you run any SQL with a result set, you will want to hold the result in a variable, so <code>$result = mysqli_query('SELECT * FROM tblDocument')</code>  </p>

<p>For more information, PHP has great documentation on databases <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.mysqli.php" rel="nofollow" title="here">here</a></p>
