<p>In general, you want to create a single table for an entity and not break them into separate tables for users.</p>

<p>This makes the system more maintainable.  Queries on the system are consistent across all applications.  It also structures the data in the way that databases are optimized for accessing it.</p>

<p>There are a few specialized cases where you would split user data into separate tables or even separate databases.  This might be a user requirement ("our data cannot mix with anyone elses").  It may be needed to support various backup and security policies.  However, the general approach is to design the tables around entities and not around users.</p>
