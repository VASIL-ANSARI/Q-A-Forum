<p>I'm cringing when I see all those <code>for</code> without indent nor braces.</p>

<p>Does your program handle tasks? Because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/win8devsupport/archive/2012/10/26/how-to-debug-a-task-exception-in-windows-store-application.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> may solve your problem in that case (those kind of exceptions never crash the program at the right time!)</p>

<p>If not, then you need to debug the program some more. Like printing <code>rrow</code>, <code>rrcol</code>, <code>grid-&gt;size()</code>, <code>grid-&gt;at(rrow)-&gt;size</code> everytime before the line where it crashes.</p>

<p>But my money is on the concurrency / memory management side of the code. The fact that it crashes in the destructor in the delete part, makes me think maybe you are handling items that were already deleted elsewhere or concurrently handling items without the appropriate measures. And in your screenshot you have a bunch of <code>size=???</code> which maybe means that your item/instance was deleted and your pointer points to free memory, causing the crash when accessing it in your loop. It's a tough error to solve.</p>

<p>Additionnally, you should be able to access parameters of your exception in the debugger, if you can, maybe you can post all of its contents?</p>
