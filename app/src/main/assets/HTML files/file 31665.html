<p><em>IsComplexType</em> is implemented in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>!TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(this.ModelType).CanConvertFrom(typeof(string));
</code></pre>

<p>All these classes are not specific for MVC and can be used by you. You only need to replace <code>ModelType</code> with a type you want to test.</p>
