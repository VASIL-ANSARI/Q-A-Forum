<p>You should use correct session key for language (<code>django.utils.translation.LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY</code>) cause exactly this key is used to take current language code from session in <code>LocaleMiddleware</code> for all future http requests.</p>

<p>Also your html forms are incorrect cause they send language code in POST data but your url + view declarations expect that language code is located directly inside url. That's different approach. Why not to use django setlang view as is? Maybe you have problems to make it work, don't you?</p>

<p>P.S. I suggest you to remove your db credentials if they are real.</p>
