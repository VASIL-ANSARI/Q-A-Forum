<p>How are you trying to get the database onto your pc? Are you using Eclipse?</p>

<p>If so, in Eclipse, run your app and then click the DDMS button top right of the Eclipse screen. Navigate to the sdcard within the mnt directory and find your database. Click on it and then click on the 'pull a file from the device' button at the top right. This will save the db to your pc where you can open it in other programs. I use sqliteman.</p>

<p>If the db is in your devices internal memory, you can't access it in this manner. The only way I've found to get the db onto the pc is to create an activity which backs up the db and then emails it to me.</p>
