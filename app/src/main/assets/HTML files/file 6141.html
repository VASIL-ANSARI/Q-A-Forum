<p>One problem is definitely that you don't stop the default action of the link. I'm not sure what the problem is with the first line (it might be that the load request is stopped because the link is followed), but the second will reload the page. Use the <code>preventDefault</code> method to stop the browser from following the link:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
  $('a.flip').live('click',function(e){
    $(".panel").slideToggle("slow");
    $('#reviews').load('SendIdToDatabase.php', {id_cruise: this.id});
    e.preventDefault();
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>With that it should work with either of your lines. It's only the URL that differs, and that is not used.</p>
