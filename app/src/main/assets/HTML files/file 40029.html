<p>The way that you're calculating the width of your elements is the problem. You're adding 0% to the end. </p>

<p>So a value of 1 = 10%, 2 = 20%, 3 = 30%, etc. However, with your half steps, this pattern breaks. 1.5 = 1.50%, 2.5 = 2.50%, 3.5 = 3.50%, etc. </p>

<p>You need to multiply, not add. Do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(".a, .b, .c, .d").width(ui.value * 10 + "%");
</code></pre>

<p>That will fix your problem. I updated the fiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/w6o28751/2/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/w6o28751/2/</a></p>
