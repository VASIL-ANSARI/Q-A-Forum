<p>I had the same problem before and I solved it doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>I downloaded the last two APIs(API 15 and API 16)</li>
<li>I installed ADT 20.0.3 with Eclipse JUNO</li>
<li>I installed the latest versions of platform-tools(revision 14) and sdk-tools(revision 20.0.3)</li>
<li>I downloaded the new system images based on Intel Atom x86 for the platforms(pay attention to this cause API 15 and 16 won't work on ARM(at least for me didn't work)).</li>
<li>As you mention enable GPU emulation when you create your AVD.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: You can do all these with your SDK Manager. If it is not the case because your country is blocked(Can't access to Google repositories), you'll have to use a proxy and go for direct links, BTW that's my case. :)</p>

<p>That should be enough, I think this is the best configuration you can have for developing Android, altough your problem can be solved by applying statement 1 and 4.
Good Luck!!!</p>

<p>PD: If you want to test some app who uses OpenGL 2.0 in a previous API version(for example Froyo) you'll have to do it in a physical phone.</p>
