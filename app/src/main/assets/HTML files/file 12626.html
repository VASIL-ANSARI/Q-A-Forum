  <p>.1. Is this the standard of using autowire ?? that is create a interface, implement its method and then finally in your controller class use the interface class's setter method. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is more-or-less standard way, but this is just a convention. <a href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/in_the_age_of_dryness" rel="nofollow">Some</a> consider this to be a bad practice. It is not enforced in any way by Spring (however you might be forced to add CGLIB to your dependencies if you don't use interfaces).</p>

  <p>.2. if i use autowire in that way what is the benefit i got ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't know what do you mean by <em>that way</em>, but just to name few benefits: easier testing, decoupling, less infrastructure code...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.3. what is the substitute code of using autowire ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, hard to tell what do you mean by <em>substitute code</em>. There are plenty of other techniques: you can use XML, <code>@Configuration</code>, <code>@Resource</code>, <code>@Inject</code>, (probably few other <em>ats</em>), constructor injection, field injection, setter injection (the one in the tutorial), looking up Spring beans directly from <code>BeanFactory</code>... </p>
