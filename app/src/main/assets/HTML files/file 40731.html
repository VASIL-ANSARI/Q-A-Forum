<p>What is your question here? The message you get explains exactly what the situation is and what is suggested to solve it:</p>

<p>The old <code>mysql</code> extension is outdated and insecure, it will not be present much longer. This is <em>clearly</em> stated in the documentation. I suggest you read that.  </p>

<p>To solve the issue you should use one of the two suggested extensions instead. They are more modern and allow more secure implementations. </p>
