<p>The dollar sign is used by the compiler for inner classes. </p>

<p><code>$</code> sign represents inner classes. If it has a <code>number</code> after <code>$</code> then it is an annonymous inner class. If it has a <code>name</code> after <code>$</code> then it is only an inner class.</p>

<p>So in your casese these are representing annonymouse inner classes</p>
