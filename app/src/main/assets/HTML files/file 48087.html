<p>If you want the options that were submitted in the form to be pre-selected when the page is redisplayed, add the <code>selected</code> attribute to the option based on whether it's in <code>$_POST['select3']</code>.</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($fifth_column as $value) {
    $selected = (isset($_POST['select3']) &amp;&amp; in_array($value, $_POST['select3'])) ? 'selected' : '';
    $select .= "&lt;option value='$value' $selected&gt;$value&lt;/option&gt;";
}
</code></pre>
