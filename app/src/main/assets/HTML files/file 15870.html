<p>Caching, especially when it's offline, is done by most modern browsers automatically.  Since PHP is a server-side language, it's restricted to only effect stuff on the "online" end.  If you want to increase performance though, you can try automatically <a href="http://code.google.com/p/minify/" rel="nofollow">minifying</a> your resources via PHP.</p>

<p>If you're super-intent on storing data offline, you could see what you can fit into cookies, but I don't really see that as a conventional method.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>If you mean making static pages on the server side, then yes. With the right permissions, you can create and edit pages with fopen() and <a href="http://www.tizag.com/phpT/filewrite.php" rel="nofollow">related functions</a>. </p>
