<p>Opcache uses an SMA as its in-memory cache.  This only persists whist the process (or process tree) exists.  I suspect that you are using a CLI variant of PHP where the process only exists for one request. With the Apache and FastCGI variants, the cache does persist across multiple requests.</p>
