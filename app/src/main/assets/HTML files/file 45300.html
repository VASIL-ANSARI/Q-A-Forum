<p>There seems to be a few things wrong here.  In your query statement you have "categorien" after INNER JOIN.  Also, is your table categorie or categories as you have listed in your question?</p>

<p>You should not need two while statements to do this either.  Plus your initial while statement is not correct.  There should not be quotes around $results.</p>

<p>Whenever I am doing a query in php, I always make sure I get the results desired in a mysql query and then copy that properly formatted query into my php code.</p>

<p>I suggest you do that here to verify that the results given are what you expect first.</p>

<p>Then go back and fix your php.  You only need one while loop and it should look something like:</p>

<pre><code>while( $row = mysql_fetch_array ( $results) )
</code></pre>
