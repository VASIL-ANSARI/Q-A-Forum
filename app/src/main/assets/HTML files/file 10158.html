<p>Have you tried changing the Error to just output the raw HTML for the link like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (duplicateKeyAttempt == true)
            {
                ModelState.AddModelError("", "A delivery charge already exists for this combination of customer type and delivery method. " +
                    "Please check the information you have provided, this selection cannot be saved. " +
                    "If you want to edit the existing database entry, click &lt;a href=\"url\"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;");
            }
</code></pre>

<p>What have you tried so far?</p>
