<p>Do you mean "reopen" the class (instead of extend)? If so - you should be able to do exactly what you've just said.</p>

<pre><code>class Diff::LCS
  def my_new_method
    ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>However - you have to beware of load-order. If the place that you have written the above code is loaded <em>before</em> your original Diff:LCS class is loaded - then you'll not be reopening, but actually defining the class.</p>

<p>...ah, just re-read your issue. You're trying to figure out what to name the file in which you put this. Previously you have depended on rails' default naming convention (eg Object being in object.rb) but you don't have to do that. you can actually just call it "whatever_library.rb" as long as you manually load it (using <code>include "whatever_library.rb"</code>)  in your environment.rb (in Rails2) (or I think application.rb for Rails3).</p>

<p>If you must use rails default then yes, make a directory called "diff", and in there, put your code in the "lcs.rb" file.</p>
