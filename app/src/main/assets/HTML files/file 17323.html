<p>With the user entering a code to allow the communication it sounds like securing the channel using an encryption method that uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_key" rel="nofollow">symmetric key algorithm</a> would work.  The key would essentially be what the user types in to allow the communication to take place.</p>

<p>However, in order to establish the key, the main question is in how it is delivered to the user.</p>

<p>If it's safe to assume that there is an operator running application A and that the operator can speak with the user of app B, then the operator could simply tell the user what the code is. </p>

<p>If, however, app A or the operator of app A has no direct contact with the user then you'll have to go a different route.  </p>
