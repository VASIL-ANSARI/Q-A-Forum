<p>The expression <code>new Time(0,0,1)</code> create a temporary pointer to a permanent object on the heap. The temporary pointer will indeed be destroyed automatically (which is a no-op), leaving the object still on the heap but unreferenced. A leak has occurred.</p>

<p>To prevent the leak, make sure to store the pointer somewhere and ensure that delete is eventually called on it.</p>
