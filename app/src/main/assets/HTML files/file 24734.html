<p>You cannot change Ext themes on the fly for already rendered components. The reason is that during the rendering process, Ext will read the style properties of generated DOM elements like border size, margins, etc., and use that information to determine the size of each elements. In most cases, this size is set in <code>style</code> property of the elements, and so it won't be affected by the change of the CSS rules.</p>

<p>So, if the rendered elements size is not the same for two different themes, the already rendered component will break in the way you've observed.</p>

<p>You can test this explanation by swapping between two themes that differs only by their colors, for example "Classic" and "Gray" themes. Components size won't be affected in this case.</p>
