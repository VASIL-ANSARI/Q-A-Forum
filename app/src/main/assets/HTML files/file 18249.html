<p>You can try using an OUTER JOIN or LEFT/RIGHT JOIN. OUTER JOIN computes the cartesian product of all entries including entries that are not present in both tables. LEFT JOIN shows everything in the table in the left hand side of the ON statement whether or not it exists in the right hand side, and RIGHT JOIN does the opposite.</p>

<p>Also, INNER JOIN is the same thing as JOIN if you want to save yourself some keystrokes!</p>
