<p>The proper place to warn users about such things is (IMO) build system. Take a look at Ogre3D, KDE and many other projects - all of them print sort of outline after configuration of build. This outline contains information on what is found and what is not and what are consequences of this.</p>

<p>Even Qt don't do anyting to fix this. There is option to build Qt with STL support and if it's not built such way, there are no warnings or whatever, only compile errors regarding undefined methods. So, i think, there is no way to warn user about such things during compile phase.</p>
