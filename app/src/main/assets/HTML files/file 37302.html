<p>There is no trick because you can't write code the way you're trying to write it.  You do not want to put the data into a global variable and then try to magically discover when the data is there.  That's just not a good way to write async code.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to put the code that uses the result of the async call in the actual callback itself or call some function from the callback and pass it the data.</p>

<hr>

<p>You don't show your actual code, but here's an example using jQuery Ajax (just for example purposes, you can do this with any code or library):</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: "some.php",
  data: { name: "John", location: "Boston" },
  success: function(data) {
      // the results of the ajax call are here in the data argument 
      //    to this callback function
      // you can either use the data here (write any code here that needs to use it)
      // or you can call some other function and pass it the data
  }
});
</code></pre>
