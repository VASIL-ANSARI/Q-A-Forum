<p>You're on the right track with <code>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</code> objects. Execute the below in a query editor, it produces <code>SELECT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> statements for tables that contain <code>GROUP_ID</code> column with <code>'Unused_Group'</code> value.</p>

<pre><code>-- build select DML to manually review data that will be deleted
SELECT 'SELECT * FROM [' + TABLE_SCHEMA + '].[' + TABLE_NAME + '] WHERE [GROUP_ID] = ''Unused_Group'';'
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'GROUP_ID';

-- build delete DML to remove data
SELECT 'DELETE FROM [' + TABLE_SCHEMA + '].[' + TABLE_NAME + '] WHERE [GROUP_ID] = ''Unused_Group'';'
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE COLUMN_NAME = 'GROUP_ID';
</code></pre>

<p>Since this seems to be a one-time cleanup effort, and especially since you need to review data before it is deleted, I don't see the value in making this more complicated.</p>
