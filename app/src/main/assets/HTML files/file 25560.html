<p>If you open up the jar file that the <code>schemaLocation</code> should point to the xsd according to this screen shot:</p>

<p>Then you'll see that IntelliJ has a bunch of xsd files for different versions of Spring:</p>

<p>This means that you really have all the schemas you need.</p>

<p>If your bean definitions file has problems then your <code>schemaLocation</code> must point to the wrong version in the Spring jar file:</p>

<p>Check the <code>Settings | Schemas and DTDs</code> and verify that you haven't accidentally manually set it to point to the wrong xsd file:</p>

<p>If it is wrong then you'll have to remove that line using the minus sign. This will cause IntelliJ to go back to it's default values:</p>

<p>After that you should be seeing the same thing as in the first screen shot.</p>
