<p>I think you get exception java.lang.NumberFormatException because if the string starts with letter, the code gets to </p>

<pre><code>if(Character.isLetter(Text.charAt(0))){
    newString += count(Text.charAt(0), Integer.parseInt(count));
    count = "";
}
</code></pre>

<p>block, and you try to parse <code>count</code> which value is <code>""</code> since the first uncompress is called with <code>return uncompress(Text, "", "");</code>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, that code could only handle compressed string that starts with digits. Maybe you can try validate the inputted compressed string first to avoid the exception.</p>
