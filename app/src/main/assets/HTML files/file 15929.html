<p>Take a look at <a href="http://blog.davidebbo.com/2011/06/precompile-your-mvc-views-using.html">Precompiled Razor Views by David Ebbo</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why would you want to do that?</strong></p>
  
  <p>One reason to do this is to avoid any runtime hit when your site
  starts, since there is nothing left to compile at runtime. This can be
  significant in sites with many views.</p>
  
  <p>Also, you no longer need to deploy the cshtml files at all, resulting
  in a smaller deployment file set.</p>
  
  <p>Another cool benefit is that it gives you the ability to unit test
  your views, which has always been something very difficult with the
  standard runtime compilation model. Iâll cover that in more details in
  a future post.</p>
