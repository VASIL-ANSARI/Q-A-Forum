<p>Using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow">zip</a> method you can do this very nicely:</p>

<pre><code>x, y = zip(*[(e_x, e_y) for e_x, e_y in zip(x, y) if e_x is not None])
</code></pre>

<p>Here you iterate over both lists at once, creating a new list with tuples containing the elements of x and y. These tuples are only added if the element from x <code>e_x</code> is not <code>None</code>.
The outer <code>zip</code> converts the list of tuples back in two separate lists.</p>

<p>Edit: As Donkey Kong pointed out in a comment, it is better to use <code>is not None</code> instead of <code>!= None</code>. I updated the code accordingly.</p>
