<p>I tested this code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
echo date('l jS \of F Y h:i:s A', strtotime('first monday of +10 month'));
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And got the result -- all I had to do was add "of" to the string.  Notes on the site indicate this is for >=5.3.</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>Monday 3rd of November 2014 12:00:00 AM
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Ignore all this BS</p>

<p>It's because you missed the note <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php" rel="nofollow">in the documentation</a>.  It applies </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Relative statements are always processed after non-relative statements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it's going to the first Monday and then going forward 10 months.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Strike this: Change the order to <code>'+10 months first Monday'</code> to get what you desire.
I misread the note, too.  I guess it means you need to do 2 strtotimes in the order you need.</p>
