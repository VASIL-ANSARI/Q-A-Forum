  <p>what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23353173/unfortunately-myapp-has-stopped-how-can-i-solve-this">use LogCat</a> to examine the Java stack trace of your crash.</p>

<p>Second, do not call inherited methods on your <code>Activity</code>, like <code>findViewById()</code>, until inside of <code>onCreate()</code>, and usually after the <code>super.onCreate()</code> call. <code>onResume()</code> is called after <code>onCreate()</code> completes, which is why your first edition survives better.</p>

<p>Third, specifically with <code>findViewById()</code>, you need to call that after the widget already exists. That will not occur until <code>setContentView()</code> or equivalent means of setting up your UI.</p>
