<p>Check out <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winforms/thread/ab564345-dcc8-4c85-b56c-ff6d3097d905/" rel="nofollow">this link.</a> Looks like you should just be able to set the <code>ForeColor</code> of a Label to a color value that has a different alpha value.</p>

<pre><code>button1.Visible = false;

//make label fade in (alpha value++)
//once opacity reaches 255, make it fade out (alpha value--)

button1.Visible = true;
</code></pre>

<p>I think you will need some sort of timer so the fade in and out isn't so instant. I'll try explaining better if you need.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry, I assumed this was a WinForms app... This won't work for a web application. Try using jQuery or javascript.</p>
