<p>External storage (an SD card) is required for Couchbase for Android.  I missed this and didn't have one configured on my emulator.  Took me a bit to figure out that was the problem.</p>

<p>My application is big (for mobile standards).  It weighs in at 15 Mb.  I am using Ektorp (CouchDB JPA like abstraction) which has several dependencies, one which requires a separate Apache HttpClient version (used "jarjar links" to prevent conflicts with the Android shipped HttpClient version). The EmptyApp available from the link below weighs in at 10 Mb. </p>

<p>If size isn't a requirement, I'd recommend it.  Development was an absolute dream. </p>

<p>This is the best tutorial I found on setting it up:
