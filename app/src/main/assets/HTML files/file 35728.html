<p>Often when you use printer drivers for dot matrix devices and you are leveraging TTF and other other fonts the device reverts to printing graphics and not text.  This will make the device print very slowly.  What you want to do is to send raw text along with font selection commands.  This will make your application a bit proprietary to that device or devices that speak the same language but will make it much faster.</p>

<p>Personally, for performance, I would create a large string that contained all the commands to do what you need.  Font select, print text, cr/lf, select font etc.  You would simply look to the Epson documentation to determine the correct sequence to trigger the font you want.  Using this methodology you would be using 'printer resident' fonts which will be very fast.</p>
