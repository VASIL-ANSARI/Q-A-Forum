<p>Not sure if this is what you mean, but since MySQL 5.0 supports BDB, you should be able to do: </p>

<p><code>ALTER TABLE table_name ENGINE = DBD;</code></p>

<p>Make sure to backup your data before attempting this.</p>

<p>Also, I do not believe mysqld by default starts with BDB enabled, to enable it, you have to start mysqld with <code>mysqld-max</code></p>
