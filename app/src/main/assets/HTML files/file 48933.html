<p>You can pass any RSpec matcher to <code>with</code>, and <code>contain_exactly(1, 2, 3)</code> does exactly what you want, so you can pass that to with:</p>

<pre><code>expect(calculation_service).to receive(:sum?).with(contain_exactly(1, 2, 3)) { 6 }
</code></pre>

<p>However, "with contain exactly 1, 2, 3" doesn't read very well (and the failure message will be similarly grammatically awkward), so RSpec 3 provides aliases that solve both problems.  In this case, you can use <code>a_collection_containing_exactly</code>:</p>

<pre><code>expect(calculation_service).to receive(:sum?).with(
  a_collection_containing_exactly(1, 2, 3)
) { 6 }
</code></pre>
