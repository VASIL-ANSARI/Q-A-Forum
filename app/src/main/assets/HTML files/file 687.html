<p>One of my all-time fave sign-up forms was the original <a href="http://www.vox.com/" rel="nofollow">Vox</a> one, which has since been changed; there was <a href="http://www.askthecssguy.com/2007/03/form_field_hints_with_css_and.html" rel="nofollow">a great break-down</a> of it published online, and it goes into the things that made it so great to me.  How they implemented the CSS layout of their forms, how they used in-form validation with pop-up tips, etc. -- it was nice.</p>
