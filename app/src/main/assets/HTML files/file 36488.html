<p>If you want to do it via code and looking for api</p>

<p>PermissionService of alfresco has API</p>

<pre><code>void setInheritParentPermissions(org.alfresco.service.cmr.repository.NodeRef nodeRef, boolean inheritParentPermissions) 
</code></pre>

<p>if you pass true in second argument it will set inheripermission as false so none of the other person able to see space create by admin(provided space is created by admin user)</p>

<p>otherwise as I had suggested in comment you can do it from user interface as well.</p>
