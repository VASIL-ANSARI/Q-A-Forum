<p>Based on your comments, error is in this line:</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap coverImage = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(book.getCoverImage().getInputStream());
</code></pre>

<p>What is being thrown is <code>NullPointerException</code>, which means that:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>book</code> is null</li>
<li><code>book.getCoverImage()</code> returns null</li>
<li><code>book.getCoverImage().getInputStream()</code> returns null</li>
</ol>

<p>You have to check which one of those is happening (use <code>Log.d()</code> and simply print out those values, or use debugger). </p>

<p>Possible reasons I can think of:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>book</code> could be null on example because "sample.epub" is missing, or it's format is invalid and <code>EpubReader</code> fails in decoding it.</li>
<li>Book does not have cover image?</li>
</ol>
