<p>Actually, opencv side of a triangle maybe difficult in terms of vision but I would suggest some method that may help you achieve. </p>

<p><strong>1) Use Corner detector</strong></p>

<p>(<a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/feature_detection.html?highlight=canny#canny" rel="nofollow">OpenCV Canny</a>) to detector all corner in the binary image. I would say use Morphological Operations (<a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html?highlight=erode#dilate" rel="nofollow">Dilate and Errode</a>) as a means to reduce noise instead of blurring or non-max suppression. Next Use the extreme points, and connect it to form Triangles. Because there will be perhaps many corners you can try fitting all the points and select the maximum Fit. You may also use delaunay triangulation to find the triangle to the points. </p>

<p><strong>2) Using Curvature Info.</strong>
Since one edge of the triangle is missing, you can use the 2 edges to compute the curvature of the circumscribing contour. Again here Morphological Operations (<a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html?highlight=erode#dilate" rel="nofollow">Dilate and Errode</a>) can be useful. Than you can select points where curvature (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28104828/estimate-image-line-gradient-not-pixel-gradient">Computing the Curvature of Binary Image Contour</a>)  change drastically as extreme point as vertex and fit lines to get approximation to the traiangle. If you image is less noisely you can use <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/structural_analysis_and_shape_descriptors.html?highlight=convexhull#convexhull" rel="nofollow">Convex Hull</a> to get the approximation.</p>

<p><strong>3) RANSAC Fitting</strong>
You may also use Fitting method to approximate the triangle by using variants of triangles and fit it to the 2 estimated edges on the binary image.</p>
