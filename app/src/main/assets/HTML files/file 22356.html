<p>If you are trying to use the Windows Task Scheduler you will have to work with the Task Scheduler COM interfaces described <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383606%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you just want to start an executable you can use the System.Diagnostics.Process class to run the executable in a seperate process.</p>
