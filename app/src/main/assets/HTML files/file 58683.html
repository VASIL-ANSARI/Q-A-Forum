<p>You can use the concept of intercept-url in spring security for this. </p>

<li>Java Based Configuration - h ttp://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#authorize-requests</li>
<li>XML Based Configuration - h ttp://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#ns-minimal <strong>and</strong> h ttp://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#nsa-intercept-url</li>
</ol>

<p>In your case, the URL to be intercepted is "permission". And in your particular case, you would want to dynamically configure the intercept URLs in spring security, reading them (permissions) from your database. You may look at the following answers to achieve the same by implementing a custom <strong>FilterInvocationSecurityMetadataSource</strong>. - </p>
