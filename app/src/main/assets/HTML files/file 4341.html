<p>If every .cpp file includes it's own header-file first, and then other headers, you'll get this check without using external tools.</p>

<p>This is actually part of <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Names_and_Order_of_Includes" rel="nofollow">Googles C++ Style Guide</a> for the same reason:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The preferred ordering reduces hidden
  dependencies. We want every header
  file to be compilable on its own. The
  easiest way to achieve this is to make
  sure that every one of them is the
  first .h file #included in some .cc.</p>

<p>If you have any header files that does not have a corresponding .cpp-file, you'd have to do something special for them.</p>
