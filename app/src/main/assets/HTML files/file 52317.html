<p>I have finally gotten PyGLPK working!  </p>

<p>I was able to "solve"<strong><code>fatal error: i386-linux-gnu/python2.7/pyconfig.h: No such file or directory</code></strong> by installing 32 bit Ubuntu instead of 64 bit.<br>
I would not recommend trying to install the 32 bit version of python on 64 bit Ubuntu as that opens up another huge plethora of issues.<br>
<strong>If you know how to fix this error on 64 bit Ubuntu please speak up!</strong></p>

<p>Once I got past that error I experienced a new error:<br>
<strong><code>ImportError: libglpk.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</code></strong><br>
I discovered that <em>part</em> of this error is the due to PyGLPK being quite old. The newest version of PyGLPK (v. 0.3) is not compatible with the newest version of GLPK (v 4.58). <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22159081/4053066">This post</a> suggested GLPK v 4.47 was the last working version compatible with PyGLPK, which seems to be working fine.<br>
After installing GLPK v 4.47 the error still appears to occur. I've found that installing python-glpk using the command <strong><code>sudo apt-get install python-glpk</code></strong> fixes the error. I believe this is because installing python-glpk also installs some dependency which is also necessary for PyGLPK, because even after uninstalling python-glpk PyGLPK continues to work.<br>
I can confirm that following this step while using GLPK v. 4.58 does <em>not</em> work. An older version of GLPK <em>and</em> whatever dependency python-glpk installs are <em>both</em> required.</p>
