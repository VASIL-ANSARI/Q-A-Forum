<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, most events in WPF (i.e. on <code>UIElement</code>) are implemented by manually implementing <code>add</code>/<code>remove</code> which means the event member can only be on the left hand side of a <code>-=</code> or <code>+=</code> operator (i.e. it can't be "read").  The internals are such that each event is "delegated" to a collection of events and that collection only contains elements for assigned events (e.g. if there's a single <code>MouseLeftButtonDownEvent += somehandler;</code> then that collection of events will have only one entry.  Unfortunately, what the collection of events stores to represent a handler is an internal structure that you would have to be able to instantiate to query the collection.  You are unable to instantiate an instance of that structure (<code>RoutedEventHandlerInfo</code>, FWIW) in order to query the collection (<code>UIElement.EventHandlersStore._entries</code>, also FWIW).  e.g. if you could you, you could query the handler for a particular event as such in the QuickWatch window:</p>

<pre><code>grid.EventHandlersStore._entries[
    new RoutedEventHandlerInfo(UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDownEvent, false)]
</code></pre>

<p>But, the debugger does not allow you to invoke an internal constructor.
<strike></p>

<p>There isn't something that lists <em>just</em> the events.  You can see all the members of a instance in the debugger (watch, quickwatch, etc.) and the events have a distinct icon.  You can then expand each one of these to see what method was assigned to the event.  For example:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lqgMf.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>As you can see, <code>MyEvent</code> has been "assigned" the method <code>t_MyEvent</code> for this particular instance.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
If you have more than one event handler assigned to an event, the debugger will only show the last assigned method in top-level of the event in quick watch.  To see <em>all</em> the methods assigned, you'll need to drill-down to the invocation list.  For example:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5fxkX.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>.. this shows that both <code>t_MyEvent</code> and <code>t_MyEvent2</code> are in the invocation list for <code>MyEvent</code>.  If you hace no handlers, the value for <code>MyEvent</code> will be <code>null</code>.</p>

<p></strike></p>
