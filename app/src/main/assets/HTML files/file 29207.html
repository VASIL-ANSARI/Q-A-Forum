<p>Turns out there was an issue with my nameservers at my host. I figured this out using information here: <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/50611/" rel="nofollow">http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/50611/</a> (the referenced thread can be viewed in the internet archive, here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150315055800/http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/50611" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20150315055800/http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/50611</a> ) </p>

<p>After that I received an error message associated with a blocked IP. I added my new ip at accounts.authorize.net in Tools (top menu) > Fraud Suite (left menu) > Authorized AIM ip addresses (body, second to last item).</p>
