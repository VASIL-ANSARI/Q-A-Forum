<p>Some bytecode generator libraries contain support for easy creation of getter/setter variables, which simplifies things significantly - you just import the library classes and write Java code. Some frameworks can even automatically generate getters and setters (along with a whole bunch of other things) based upon a simple annotation on a field.</p>

<p>On the other hand, bytecode generation generally has a runtime performance impact as the new classes are compiled, although that can be mitigated by caching the generated class files.</p>

<p>My experience with annotation processing has not been nearly as pleasant. It generally requires you to configure or even modify your build system so that the annotation processor is executed. In addition, coding an annotation processor can become <em>very</em> uncomfortable if you wish to modify a source code file extensively, and apparently there is nowhere near the same framework/library variety as there is for bytecode generation.</p>

<p>My personal favorite, to be honest, is using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandle.html" rel="nofollow">Java 7 method handles</a> when possible - or just writing the **** getters and setters by hand.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The main problem with the annotation processing API is that (as far as I know) it does not support <em>modifying</em> code at compile-time. The recommended approach seems to be the generation of independent decorator classes. Sure, that is relatively easy if you use e.g. <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html" rel="nofollow">Apache Velocity</a> but the end result is not nearly the same.</p>

<p>There are some hacks where the original source file is processed to add methods and re-compiled, but even getting the <em>path</em> of the source file is almost impossible. There is usually a lot of guesswork involved, with various assumptions about the project structure being made. In addition, the annotation processor essentially maintains a separate source tree for the processed source files.</p>

<p><a href="http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html" rel="nofollow">Project Lombok</a> (which I can't believe I forgot to mention before) uses a lot magic of various colors to leverage the annotation processing API to something more usable. It could very well be what you need...</p>
