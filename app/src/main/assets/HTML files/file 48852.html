<p>Loop through the array and then add them.. let me suppose the array name is <code>$players</code>, then..</p>

<pre><code>$total_score = 0;
foreach($players as $key=&gt;$value)
{
  if($value['player_name']=='player1')
  {
    $total_score +=$value['player_score'];
  }
}
echo "PLAYER's TOTAL SCORE = ".$total_score;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>This looks like JSON code.. so first decode it using <code>json_decode</code> </p>
