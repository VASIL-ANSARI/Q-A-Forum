<p>Subject has already been partially treated <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19329530/onresize-for-div-elements">here</a>. Partially because it doesn't talk about React. It says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer supports onresize on all HTML elements. In all other Browsers the onresize is only available at the window object. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onresize" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onresize</a>
  If you wanna have onresize at a div in all browsers check this:
  <a href="http://marcj.github.io/css-element-queries/" rel="nofollow">http://marcj.github.io/css-element-queries/</a>
  This library has a class ResizeSensor which can be used for resize detection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that, there is few chances that setting <code>onResize</code> work on a React component. Read how <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/dom-event-listeners.html" rel="nofollow">React advises to attach onResize event</a>. As a result, some modules were created to handle so cases, like <a href="https://github.com/nrako/react-component-resizable" rel="nofollow">react-component-resizable</a> that allow you to set a wrap your component and set a props.</p>

<p>I advice you to follow <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/dom-event-listeners.html" rel="nofollow">React example</a>.</p>
