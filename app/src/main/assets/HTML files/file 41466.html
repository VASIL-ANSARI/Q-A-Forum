<p>The problem is that <code>require</code> expects a String (e.g. <code>require "path_to_module"</code>) but you're giving it a Class:</p>

<pre><code>require User
require Report
</code></pre>

<p>If this is running in Rails, then Rails will autoload both of these classes. You don't need to do <code>require</code> at all.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After you've removed those lines, <code>Date_calc.months(6)</code> is still going to give you a NoMethodError, because <code>months</code> is an instance method, but you're trying to call it as though it's a class method. You either need to call it on an instance of the Date_calc class, like this:</p>

<pre><code>Date_calc.new.months(6)
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could define it as a class method by doing <code>def self.months(range)</code> instead of <code>def months(range)</code>, which would allow you to call <code>Date_calc.months(6)</code>. But you might want to think about whether or not Date_calc should actually be a class, or if it should be a module.</p>

<p>It should be a class if you want to have multiple instances of it, like you would want an instance of a User or instance of a Report. "User" and "Report" are both nouns, because the class represents a <em>thing</em> that we might want to have more than one of. Does the sentence "I want to create a Date_calc" make sense? How about the sentence "I want to create two Date_calcs"? If you said yes to both, then a class makes sense.</p>

<p>If, however, you just want something to put some related methods in, but that doesn't represent a <em>thing</em>, then you might want to use a module instead. In Rails, for example, the <code>Rails</code> object is not a class, it's a module. It doesn't make sense to say "I want to create a Rails," much less "I want to create two Rails." Rails is just a module used to group related methods together. If Date_calc fits that description, then it makes more sense as a module:</p>

<pre><code>module Date_calc
  def self.months(range)
    # ...
  end
end

# and then...
Date_calc.months(6)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we use <code>def self.months</code> instead of <code>def months</code>, because we want to be able to call the method on the module itself.</p>
