<p>From what you've described, you don't need a subquery:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Ethnicity, COUNT(Referral)
FROM Demographics, Marketing
WHERE Demographics.id = Marketing.source_id
AND Referral = 'website'
AND Gender = 'Female'
ORDER BY Ethnicity
</code></pre>

<p>...note that this gives you a different resultset from the one you've shown, though, with ethnicity, count on each row.</p>
