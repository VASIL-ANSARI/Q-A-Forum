<p>Yes, you can redirect the STDOUT of the spawned process.  MSDN has an article on that topic:</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363679.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ReportEvent()</code></a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363752.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>EventWrite()</code></a>, or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364137.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>TraceEvent()</code></a> to write log messages to the System Event Log (which is located within Windows' Control Panel), depending on which logging API you decide to use.  Refer to MSDN for more details:</p>

<p>A service is a background task, it should not display its own UIs.  Use the system Event Viewer to view log messages.  The popup the user sees if the service fails to start is not displayed by the service itself, but by the Service Control Manager.</p>

<p>Starting with Windows Vista, services do not run in the same desktop session as logged in users (<em>Session 0 Isolation</em>), so they cannot display their own UI anymore.  If your service must display a popup message, it can use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383842.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>WTSSendMessage()</code></a> for that. For more complex UIs, it is best to implement that as a separate non-service GUI app that runs in the user's session, and then the service can launch/communicate with that app as needed.</p>
