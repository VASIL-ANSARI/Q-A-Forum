<p>Browsers read from top to bottom.  When your jQuery executes, the browser has not found the element yet, so nothing happens.  Move your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to the bottom of the page (right before the body ending tag).  Alternatively, you could wrap your jQuery code in <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/" rel="nofollow"><code>$(document).ready(</code></a>, which delays execution until the entire page has been read.</p>
