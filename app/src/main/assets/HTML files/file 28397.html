<p>You can speed up a query if you look at the part of the query that uses the data for calculations: <code>where</code> clauses and <code>order</code> clauses mostly.</p>

<p>If you don't have already then add indexes on <code>nots.cnt</code> and <code>nots.fch</code>.</p>

<p>It is also a good practice to run a <code>explain</code>:</p>

<pre><code>explain select notas.notid, ...
</code></pre>

<p>The output will tell you if keys are used and where not.</p>
