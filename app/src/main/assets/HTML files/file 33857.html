<p>You shouldn't need to do this. Qt should determine the correct locale to use from your system settings. If the correct locale is set, the calendar-widget will show the correctly translated names. You can check this by manually setting the default locale, like so:</p>

<pre><code>    QtCore.QLocale.setDefault(QtCore.QLocale('hr_HR'))
</code></pre>

<p>But as I say, it really shouldn't be necessary to do this. You can check the default system locale that Qt is using by doing:</p>

<pre><code>    loc = QtCore.QLocale.system()
    print(loc.name())
</code></pre>

<p>If this does not show the correct language, then either your system locale settings are incorrect, or the version of Qt you are using is buggy. One example of a bug that might affect you is <a href="https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-1313" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, which was not properly fixed until Qt-4.8.5.</p>
