<p>Azure itself does not have any certain restrictions on the buffer setting for the Ubuntu VM. First I would check the current buffer setting values using the commands listed here - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7865069/how-to-find-the-socket-buffer-size-of-linux">How to find the socket buffer size of linux</a>.
Secondly, if you want to configure or tune them, you can refer - <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-tcp-tuning/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-tcp-tuning/</a></p>

<p>Not sure if this is the answer you are looking for, as Ghedipunk pointed, it might be a issue of Nagle's algo, in which case, you might want to try adding the tcp_nodelay configuration in the tunnel configurations - </p>

<p>socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1</p>

<p>though I personally never worked with Ratchet.</p>

<p>PS- I wanted to add this as a comment as I am not sure this is the correct answer you are looking for, but SO forum is not allowing me to add a comment.</p>
