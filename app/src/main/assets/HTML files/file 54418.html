<p>What you're looking for is basically the opposite of the mysql <code>Group_conat()</code> function--instead of concating together a set, break it apart on a separator.</p>

<p>There's no easy one line query that covers this if you don't know the exact number of parameters.  If you know the max number of parameters, you can write something like: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19073500/sql-split-comma-separated-row">SQL split comma separated row</a>.</p>

<p>I suggest what you really want to do is write a procedure if you don't know the exact limit or it may change.</p>

<p>Here's another SO question that covers how you can achieve this with stored procedures:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17308669/reverse-group-concat-in-mysql">&quot;Reverse GROUP_CONCAT&quot; in MySQL?</a></p>
