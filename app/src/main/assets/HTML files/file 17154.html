<p>The value of <code>String name</code> isn't being set by <code>message.setText</code> rather it's being set by the StringExtra in the received intent (that starts the activity)</p>

<p><code>TextView message</code> is pointing to the <code>TextView R.id.show_message</code></p>

<p>So <code>message.setText("anything")</code> would set the text value of show_message to "anything"</p>

<p><code>message.setText(name)</code> sets the text of show_message to whatever String name represents... here the value passed in the intent.</p>
