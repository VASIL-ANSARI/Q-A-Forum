<p>In your method <code>displayFeedback</code> you seem to be hoping to replace the JTable object and have the display change to reflect what is selected in the <code>JTree</code> above.  Instead of replacing what is in the <strong>View</strong> object, you should focus your effort on updating the <strong>Model</strong>, in this case, the <code>AbstractTableModel</code> subclass that you have created.   There are  a couple ways you can do that, but for a brute force proof of concept, you could do something like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>add a constructor to <code>MyTableModel</code> that takes a 2 dimensional array of <code>data</code></li>
<li>in displayFeedback, create a new instance of <code>MyTableModel</code> that has new data relevant to the tree node that was selected.</li>
<li>call <code>setModel</code> on your global <code>table</code> variable. </li>
</ul>
