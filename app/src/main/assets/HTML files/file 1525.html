<p>You probably need the full type, i.e. 
@property (nonatomic) BOOL boolArray <strong>[100]</strong>;</p>

<p>The [100] is significant type information, not just an indication of how much space to allocate.</p>

<p>Also, I think the property will be treated like a <code>const BOOL *</code> that can't be assigned, so it would probably have to be <code>readonly</code>. The correct thing to do is probably make this readonly, which means that thins will fetch the array pointer then subscript it to assign to members of the array.</p>

<p>Alternately you can use an <code>NSArray</code> for this, but that will require that you use <code>NSNumber</code>s with boolVaules which is more of a biotch to deal with.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Actually the stupid compiler doesn't like the [] for some reason. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>@interface TestClass : NSObject {

    const BOOL *boolArray;
}

@property (nonatomic, readonly) const BOOL *boolArray;

@end


@implementation TestClass;

- (const BOOL *)boolArray {
    if (!boolArray)
        boolArray = malloc(sizeof(BOOL) * 100);
    return boolArray;
}

- (void)dealloc {
    [super dealloc];
    free((void *)boolArray);
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>ANOTHER UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>This compiles:</p>

<pre><code>@interface TestClass : NSObject {

    BOOL boolArray[100];
}

@property (nonatomic, readonly) const BOOL *boolArray;

@end


@implementation TestClass;

- (const BOOL *)boolArray {
    return boolArray;
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>This is a bizarre issue. I wish the compiler would explain exactly what it's unhappy about like "Can't declare property with array type" or something.</p>

<p><strong>YET ANOTHER UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>See this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476843/create-an-array-of-integers-property-in-objective-c">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/476843/create-an-array-of-integers-property-in-objective-c</a></p>

<p>Apparently according to the C spec, an array is not a "Plain Old Data" type and the Objective-C spec only lets you declare properties for POD types. Supposedly this is the definiition of PODs:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/working-groups/fpcltf/Pkg/ISOcxx/doc/POD.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fnal.gov/docs/working-groups/fpcltf/Pkg/ISOcxx/doc/POD.html</a></p>

<p>But reading that it seems like an array of PODs is a POD.  So I don't get it. </p>
