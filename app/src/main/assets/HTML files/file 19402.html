<p>Well, sounds like you are on the right track. You will be redirected to your login page if viewstuff.aspx requires authentication, so you will need to put the logic there (in login.aspx.cs) to pull out your query string, pull apart the values and authenticate the user before passing them back to the returnurl.</p>
