<ol>
<li>make a backup of the project.
to solve this problem close the solution and create new one, then add new project property sheet and open up property manager and crete new property sheet.
open this new property sheet and go to <strong>common properties > user macros > add new macro</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>type into name field OTHER_LIB_ROOT and 
type into value field "the path to the missing properties" EXCLUDE \path\to\myprops.props.</p>

<p>now save all and close solution.
open back the solution that has the problem and add this property sheet you just created to the project(not sure if you can add it to the unloaded projects, if so do it), if there is no project loaded create a new one.</p>

<p>save all and reload the solution.
I think this will work only if you have the misssing propertes in correct paths.</p>

<p>if that doesn't work then replace $(OTHER_LIB_ROOT) from your post with real path.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Import Project="ADD REAL PATH HERE\path\to\myprops.props" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or simply remove the lines from the project when you open it with text editor.</p>
