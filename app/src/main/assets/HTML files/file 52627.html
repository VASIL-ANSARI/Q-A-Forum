<p><code>&lt;=</code> which means Less than or Equal to ie <code>if(c.getCount()&lt;=15){</code></p>

<p>Alternately you could do (without an else clause).</p>

<pre><code>if(c.getCount() &gt; 15( { 
    btnLoadMore.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
    ........ your code that is currently in the else clause.. 
} else {
    btnLoadMore.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note! View.GONE is an alternative to View.INVISIBLE. The difference being that INVISIBLE just makes it so that the view (Button) cannot be seen, whilst GONE makes it if as the view (Button) is not there.</p>
