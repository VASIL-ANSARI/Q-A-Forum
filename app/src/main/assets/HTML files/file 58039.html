<p>You can achieve that when you set in your project's Gradle file the compileSdkVersion not bigger than 22.<br>
<strong>Important! When you deploy a version of your app to Google Play store which was compiled against a version bigger than 22, you can never ever switch back to a version below 23. You cannot even switch back to the last stable version if this version used and SDK version lower than 23. You will get an exception in Google Play Store then. It will not allow it.</strong><br>
(This happened to me some days ago, I accidently set a version bigger than 22, deployed it to Google Play, and suddenly I had lots of crashes because Android 6.0+ didn't have the used permission and I didn't ask for it because it was not implemented in code. But I was also not able to switch back to the previous working version in Google Play. So I had to quickly implement the new permission model but was not even able to test it since I don't have Android 6.0 devices and the emulators are a total crap and slow. Now I have 3 apps in store where I don't know how they behave on Android 6.0+. I get no crashes anymore so I guess my implementation is correct)</p>
