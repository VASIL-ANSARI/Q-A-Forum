<p>is wrong. It should be </p>

<pre><code>count_table* cTable = malloc(sizeof(count_table));
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you must allocate memory for list_node_t also seperately.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Apart from what Clifford has pointed about allocating memory for the list node, I think the memory allocation should also be taken care for the <code>char *key</code> inside of the list node. </p>
