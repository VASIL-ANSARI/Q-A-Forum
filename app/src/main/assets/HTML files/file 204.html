<p>To monitor the servers we use the free <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/tools.html" rel="nofollow">tools from Maatkit</a> ... simple, yet efficient.</p>

<p>The binary replication is available in 5.1, so I guess you've got some balls. We still use 5.0 and it works OK, but of course we had our share of issues with it.</p>

<p>We use a Master-Master replication with a MySql Proxy as a load-balancer in front, and to prevent it from having errors:</p>

<ul>
<li>we removed all unique indexes</li>
<li>for the few cases where we really needed unique constraints we made sure we used REPLACE instead of INSERT (MySql Proxy can be used to guard for proper usage ... it can even rewrite your queries)</li>
<li>scheduled scripts doing intensive reports are always accessing the same server (not the load-balancer) ... so that dangerous operations are replicated safely</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, I know it sounds simple and stupid, but it solved 95% of all the problems we had.</p>
