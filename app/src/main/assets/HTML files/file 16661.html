<p>There is the open-source <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bcusdk/" rel="nofollow">BCUSDK</a> software stack for KNX which has a C-based system daemon (<a href="http://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/index.php/eibd" rel="nofollow">eibd</a>) with clients (Unix and TCP-socket based) for multiple languages (Python is one). I've written the <a href="https://github.com/ekarak/eibd_ruby" rel="nofollow">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ekarak/eibd_lua" rel="nofollow">Lua</a> client libraries as well, and I'm using it for day-to-day hacking with KNX. </p>

<p>Also, there is <a href="http://openremote.org" rel="nofollow">OpenRemote</a> which has lots of information on KNXnet/IP and some Java classes that could get you started, if you wanted to, from scratch.</p>
