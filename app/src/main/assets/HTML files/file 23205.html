<p>In C++, the versions taking a comparator are sometimes suffixed with <code>_if</code>. This is the case for <code>std::find</code>. <code>std::find</code> takes an element to find, whereas <code>std::find_if</code> takes a comparator that implements equality. The error simply means that it couldn't find a match for a <code>Tile</code> being equivalent to a lambda.</p>
