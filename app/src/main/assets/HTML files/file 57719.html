<p>You probably should take into account that printable <strong>strings are zero-byte terminated in C</strong>. Hence the fields in your anonymous <code>struct</code> should each have one more byte (so <code>char first[8];</code> and <code>char initial[2];</code> etc...). BTW the space for the <code>last</code> (family) name is really too small: my name won't fit in it, and is not that unusually wide.</p>

<p>You also should test the result of <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fscanf" rel="nofollow"><code>scanf</code> &amp; <code>sscanf</code></a>. They return the number of scanned items. You might use <code>%5s</code> to scan a field of 5 characters (+1 for the terminating zero byte). You should read the documentation of <code>scanf</code> before using it.</p>

<p>You should probably clear <code>workers[i]</code> e.g. with <code>memset(workers+i, 0, sizeof(workers[i]));</code> before filling it.</p>

<p>BTW, compile your program with all warnings &amp; debug info (e.g. <code>gcc -Wall -g</code> if using <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/" rel="nofollow">GCC</a>...) and <strong>use the debugger</strong> (e.g. <code>gdb</code>) e.g. to run it step by step.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should consider using pointers to the heap and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation" rel="nofollow">C dynamic memory allocation</a>. Then be sure to test against failure of <code>malloc</code> and beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak" rel="nofollow">memory leaks</a>; a tool like <a href="http://valgrind.org/" rel="nofollow">valgrind</a> would be very helpful.</p>

<hr>

<p>BTW, a <code>printf</code> call like <code>printf("%s", workers[0].first);</code> is having an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" rel="nofollow"><strong>undefined behavior</strong></a> (UB) when <code>workers[0].first</code> is a field or array of <code>char</code>-s which is <em>not</em> zero-byte terminated. And UB is really <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25636788/841108">bad</a>, you always should avoid it. Read <a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html" rel="nofollow">Lattner's blog entries about <em>undefined behavior</em></a>.</p>
