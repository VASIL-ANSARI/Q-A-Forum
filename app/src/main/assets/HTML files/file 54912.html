<p>I'm not aware of any way to send events to the home button (pretty sure this wouldn't be possible).</p>

<p>You can programmatically enable / disable guided access however, using UIAccessibilityRequestGuidedAccessSession. In order for this to work, your device must be supervised using MDM and have a profile installed that enables single app mode for your application.</p>
