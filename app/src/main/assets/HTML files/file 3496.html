<p>Possible solution...</p>

<p>The data I was trying to deserialize was serialized from another component in the same application. The generated XML did not set the &lt;FixedCostAccrual&gt; element for each task. I imported the XML into MS Project and exported it as XML. MS Project set the &lt;FixedCostAccrual&gt; value to 0 for each task when I exported. However, valid values are within the range 1-3. </p>

<p>Not sure why MS Project would set the default value to something outside the range, but the solution was to fix the  component which generates the output XML.</p>

<p>I'm still not sure why it generates the XML with the wrong xmlns attribute though.</p>
