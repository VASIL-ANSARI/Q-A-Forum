<p>IIS isn't used <strong>just</strong> for ASP.Net, it can serve up <a href="http://php.iis.net/" rel="nofollow">PHP for example</a>...so the type of application and pool varies, it's not automatically created and tied to then ASP.Net engine.</p>

<p>If you can clarify a bit more what you're trying to do maybe we can help further.  For example, if you want to point the root application to another folder and it be an application or create another website, IIS allows you to do any of that...you just need to update the question with which version of IIS, as the instructions very between them.</p>
