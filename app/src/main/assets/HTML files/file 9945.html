<p>Your page is using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode" rel="nofollow">Quirks Mode</a>, which causes IE to pretend to be IE5.5.</p>

<p>The reason this is happening to you is detailed here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6168612/divs-appearing-different-on-different-browsers/6168758#6168758">divs appearing different on different browsers</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason you're getting Quirks Mode
  is the two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="nofollow">UTF-8 byte order
  marks</a>
  at the start of your file:</p>

<pre><code>ef bb bf ef bb bf 3c 21 44 4f 43
.  .  .  .  .  .  &lt;  !  D  O  C
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You'll need to save your file without
  this. It should be an option in
  whatever editor you're using.</p>
