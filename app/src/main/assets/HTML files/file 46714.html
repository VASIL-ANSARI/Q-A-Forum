<p>First things first - <code>AJAX is Async</code> Asynchronous.</p>

<p>So the code block does not wait for the previous instruction to be completed before it executes the next line.</p>

<p>So your <code>document.writeline</code> would have already been executed by the time the response comes back.</p>

<p>Try printing that info in the success call back after the if block and you would indeed see the response.</p>
