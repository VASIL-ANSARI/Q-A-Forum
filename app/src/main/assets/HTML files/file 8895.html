<p>In your code above, you are not using ViewState to store the SearchClicked value, but rather you are using the Session to store it. ViewState is persisted on the page in a hidden value and gets posted back to the server. This means that the viewstate is stored on the browser, and therefor will persist as long as the user is on the page. Session information is stored on the server. A users session will eventually time out, but other things can cause the session to reset, such as rebuilding the application or editing the web.config file.</p>

<p>To store to ViewState use the following</p>

<pre><code>public bool SearchClicked
{
get { return  ViewState["bool"] == null ? false : (bool)ViewState["bool"]; }
set { ViewState["bool"] = value; }
}
</code></pre>
