<p>TF-IDF (which means "term frequency - inverse document frequency"), is <em>not</em> giving you the frequency of a term in its representation. </p>

<p>TF-IDF gives high scores to terms occurring in only very few documents, and low scores for terms occurring in many documents, so its roughly speaking a measure of how discriminative a term is in a given document. Take a look at <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tf-idf-weighting-1.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> resource to find an excellent description of TF-IDF and to get a better idea of what it is doing.</p>

<p>If you only want counts, you'd need to use <code>CountVectorizer</code>.</p>
