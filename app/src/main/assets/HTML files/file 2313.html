<p>1 tells PHP to send <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_location" rel="nofollow">a Location header to the HTTP client</a>, forcing a redirect to "homepage.php".</p>

<p>2 <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php" rel="nofollow">tells PHP to include</a> "homepage.php" inline to execution of the current page.</p>

<hr>

<p>As a note about your question, your confusion might be over the term <strong>"header"</strong>.  It is overloaded sometimes to refer to the top part of a page in reference to code separation.  Code separation is a common practice where one puts PHP code/HTML used in multiple pages into a separate file, and then included in the top (header) of each page.</p>

<p>HTH,</p>
