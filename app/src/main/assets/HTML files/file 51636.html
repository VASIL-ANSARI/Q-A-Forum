<p>Thought of answering my own question after figuring out what was the issue. Missed to include the cordova whitelist plugin in the <code>config.xml</code>. Addded the following line and voila...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;gap:plugin name="com.indigoway.cordova.whitelist.whitelistplugin" version="1.1.1" /&gt;
</code></pre>
