<p>Try removing the leading plus sign before the numbers in your url. The plus sign is used for international numbers and you can safely replace it with two leading zeroes. Moreover, be sure to provide a string in which no space occurs between numbers: something like </p>

<p><code>NSString *stringURL = @"sms:00141555 51212";</code> will NOT work correctly.</p>

<p>One more thing. The statement </p>

<pre><code>[stringURL release];
</code></pre>

<p>is not correct because <code>stringURL</code> has not being retained. You should remove it from your method.</p>
