<p>It's hard to tell what the issue is, but something I always use with nHibernate when troubleshooting is to enable show_sql so I can see the SQL that gets generated (so you can try that in your database query window). See this link for info: <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/arnona/archive/2011/01/19/tip-of-the-day-for-nhibernate-2-show-sql-and-format-sql.aspx" rel="nofollow">Enable show_sql in nHibernate</a></p>
