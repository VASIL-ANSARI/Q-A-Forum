<p>In your <code>abs</code> function, <code>abs(abs_input)</code> will call the function again. In it, it will happen again. And again. And again. And again. And... eventually the computer will not be able to remember how many times you called it and from where.</p>

<p>What you probably wanted is to call <code>Math.abs(abs_input)</code> inside your <code>abs()</code> function - a built-in function, different from your <code>abs()</code> one, so you don't get the infinite recursion (a function calling itself till it can't any more).</p>

<p>Same for <code>round</code> and <code>Math.round</code>, and <code>log</code> and <code>Math.log</code>.</p>
