<p>When you run the python script at the terminal, it runs as a process with your user ID, I assume?
If you can open the input file by doing this, then it is most likely a permission issue.</p>

<p>The apache process just isn't privileged enough to open the file.</p>

<p>I'd suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check the owner and permission of the file - make sure it is readable by the Apache process userID. This requires the file to at least have read permission, ie. -rw-r--r-- (chmod 644).</p></li>
<li><p>Also don't forget the directory path permission and/or ownership.
eg. if the file is in /home/foo/bar/inputFile.xml, you need to check that the whole path /home/foo/bar is accessible by the Apache user. This requires at least drwx--x--x (chmod 711) on the directories.</p></li>
</ul>
