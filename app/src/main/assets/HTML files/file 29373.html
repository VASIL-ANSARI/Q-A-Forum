<p>You can't, normally you would get cellinfo using the following objects and their methods:</p>

<p>CellInfoGsm &lt;---- Anything other than LTE</p>

<p>CellInfoLte &lt;----  LTE only</p>

<p>As per the android docs:
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellInfoLte.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellInfoLte.html</a></p>

<p>CellInfoLte was added in api 17.  Which makes sense considering nearly every lte device now runs on api 17 and they want you to upgrade not downgrade.  </p>

<p>If this is because you have an old device that doesn't support 17 and somehow supports lte (very extreme case but I am sure there probably is such a phone) you'll have to wait for a KitKat droid build, since that is designed to run on older devices as well as the new ones.</p>
