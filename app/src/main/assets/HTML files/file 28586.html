<p>You are not returning the result of the recursive function call. These issues are often overlooked by beginners, when you are returning from a recursive functions. Change the <code>if</code> block in your first function to:</p>

<pre><code>if temp.upper() != "END":
    s += temp
    return getpayload(s)
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't add <code>return</code>, then the value returned from <code>return s</code> is simply discarded, and your function by default returns <code>None</code>.</p>
