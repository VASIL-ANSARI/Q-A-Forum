<pre><code>for (Object *object in Array) {
    UIView *view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:???];

    // Do whatever else you need here

    [??? addSubView:view];
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have done "for (Object *object in Array)" in case you need data from said object inside your views subviews.</p>
