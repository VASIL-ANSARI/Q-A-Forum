<p>What's the exception ?</p>

<p>I guess you are getting the exception because your client certificate is rejected as valid from the server (unless you did the necessary things to set up trust).</p>

<p>When you use self signed certificates(the ones created by makecert), you would have to also supply a Client Certificate Validation callback when creating the SslStream object. Use this constructor overload <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms145056.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms145056.aspx</a> </p>
