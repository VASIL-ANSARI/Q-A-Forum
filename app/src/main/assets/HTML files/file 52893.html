<p>Check to ensure that when you call <code>setcookie()</code> you are setting a reasonable expiry time that will ensure that your cookie will not expire while being used.</p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php" rel="nofollow">From the php documentation (trimmed for important parts):</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The time the cookie expires. This is a Unix timestamp so is in number
  of seconds since the epoch. In other words, you'll most likely set
  this with the time() function plus the number of seconds before you
  want it to expire.</p>
  
  <p>If set to 0, or omitted, the cookie will expire at the end of the
  session (when the browser closes).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>further down the <code>setcookie()</code> documentation I found this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cookies must be deleted with the same parameters as they were set
  with. If the value argument is an empty string, or FALSE, and all
  other arguments match a previous call to setcookie, then the cookie
  with the specified name will be deleted from the remote client. This
  is internally achieved by setting value to 'deleted' and expiration
  time to one year in past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i.e. it seems that your cookie is somewhere being updated to either an empty string or being set to false.</p>
