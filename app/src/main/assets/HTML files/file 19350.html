<p>You can check if jQuery is included in Google Chrome. Just use inspect element, you should see a script tag (with the jquery file in the src, you can check it to verify if code is really there) somewhere in the head tag or at the end of the body.</p>

<p>Your code looks about right, but it might have errors. It's better to check the actual page. Also, remember that you should include jQuery before your other jQuery plugins.</p>

<p>And one more thing, I think it would be better to use WordPress's jQuery to make sure you don't introduce bugs or incompatibilities with the one from Google. You can do this by putting this in functions.php</p>

<pre><code>function insert_jquery(){
   wp_enqueue_script('jquery');
}
add_filter('wp_head','insert_jquery');
</code></pre>
