<p>Exceptions denote an <em>exception</em> case to your set of use cases, something which your program does not really expect, but can happen, this is a common situation especially when dealing with user output.</p>

<p>What I am not understanding is <em>how</em> can your list of symbols be empty? If a valid body of text which matches your rules can be empty, then you will need to cater for that scenarios without exceptions. </p>

<p>If on the other hand, an empty set of symbols denotes something which the user should have done but did not, and without it your application cannot function, then, you should throw exceptions.</p>
