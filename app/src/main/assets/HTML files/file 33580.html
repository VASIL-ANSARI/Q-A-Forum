<p>Your example would be the correct way to do it, assuming <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are variables defined in the window scope. To pass specific values for a, b, and c you'd do something like <code>onclick="foo('bar', 'baz', 'quux')"</code>. The "magic" form <code>onclick="foo(event)"</code> will pass in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event" rel="nofollow">Event object</a> containing details about e.g. what button was clicked and where.</p>
