<p>Instead of saving it into local storage and getting people mad when they clear their cache how about storing it on a server ? And Create a php array on that server containing the data of your pokemon ?</p>

<pre><code>var currentPokemon;

var Pokemon = {

    0: {
        Name: "Mudkip",
        Exp: 0,
        NextExp: 50,
        Lvl: 1, 
        Img: "http://www.pokestadium.com/pokemon/sprites/img/main-series/5/black-white/animated/front/258.gif"
    },

    1: {
        Name: "Treecko",
        Exp: 0,
        NextExp: 50,
        Lvl: 1, 
        Img: "http://www.pokestadium.com/pokemon/sprites/img/main-series/5/black-white/animated/front/252.gif"
    },

    2: {
        Name: "Torchic",
        Exp: 0,
        NextExp: 50,
        Lvl: 1, 
        Img: "http://www.pokestadium.com/pokemon/sprites/img/main-series/5/black-white/animated/front/255.gif"
    }

};

currentPokemon = Pokemon[Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)];

/*
    Now you can get all data you want from currentPokemon :)
*/
</code></pre>
