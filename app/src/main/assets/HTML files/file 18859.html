<p>I'm going to sidestep the question of what is <em>safe</em> and simply state that whitespace in the URL is <em>illegal</em> per section 2.4.3 of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt" rel="nofollow">RFC 2396</a>. Doing illegal things means that you cannot really predict what software will do when it encounters such a URI.</p>

<p>Besides, if JavaScript is involved you probably don't want to guarantee that changing that hash of a URL doesn't trigger an XHR and cause network activity that re-parses the URL. (For example, you may decide you want to mess with history state or do some analytical tracking <code>onhashchange</code>.)</p>
