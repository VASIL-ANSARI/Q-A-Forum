<p>Short answer: No. </p>

<p>What you could do, however, is add your custom bar to the correct position on the application's window <code>[UIApplication.sharedApplication.keyWindow addSubview:myCustomNavBar]</code>, and have that simply display over the navigation bar, if that will work for you.</p>
