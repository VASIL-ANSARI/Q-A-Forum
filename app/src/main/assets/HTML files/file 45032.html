<p>To magically create a line:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT 'NA' AS ATTR FROM TABLE WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM TABLE WHERE %condition%)
UNION
SELECT ATTR FROM TABLE WHERE %condition%;
</code></pre>

<p>Explain: Select "NA" if the subquery returns no rows and union it with the subquery itself. Either one of the unioned sets is empty so it gives what you want.</p>
