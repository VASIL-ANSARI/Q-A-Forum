<p>It's not stopping because the condition <code>readString != null</code> isn't being violated.</p>

<p>For it to print the non-1st place horses, sort the array and assign places as applicable.</p>

<p>For it to stop, try replacing <code>while( readString != null )</code> with <code>while( nobodyHasWon )</code>. Make a boolean <code>boolean nobodyHasWon = true</code> and set it to false when a horse has won (i.e., after <code>System.out.println("1st place: Horse " + (i+1));</code>).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>// assumptions made: there is only one winner at 15, the rest are below 15, there are no ties, and the first ranked horse has been found
int second, third, secondValue, thirdValue;
secondValue = 0; thirdValue = 0;
for( int i = 0; i &lt; arrRan.length; i++ ) {
    if( i != &lt;indexOfFirstPlaceHorse&gt; )
    {
    if( arrRan[ i ] &gt; secondValue ) {
        second = i;
        secondValue = arrRan[ i ];
    }
    }
}
for( int i = 0; i &lt; arrRan.length; i++ ) {
    if( i != &lt;indexOfFirstPlaceHorse&gt; &amp;&amp; i != second ) {
        if( arrRan[ i ] &gt; thirdValue ) {
            third = i;
            thirdValue = arrRan[ i ];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
