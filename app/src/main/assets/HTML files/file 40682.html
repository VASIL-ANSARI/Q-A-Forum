<p>You have an extra comma in your sprintf call, try this:</p>

<pre><code>let getDoubled x =  sprintf "%d doubled is %d" x (x * 2)
</code></pre>

<p>The comma means you are constructing a tuple, and this is what you have in your second snippet - a tuple of a  function (your partially applied <code>sprintf</code> that's waiting for the second argument) and an int (the result of <code>x*2</code>).</p>
