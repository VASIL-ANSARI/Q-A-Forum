<p>My guess is that you are entering in numbers like 1.05, 1.15, etc. If you enter that as the amt, you multiply by 100 (to get total cents) and add .1 (not sure why you did that). And then cast into an int when you really want a double. Since you cast into an int, cents / 25 will typically be 4 as, for example, 115/25 divides four times with the remainder thrown out, hence why you keep getting four as an answer.</p>
