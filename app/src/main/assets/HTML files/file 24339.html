<p>You are going to wanna look at using PHP's string functions. You will probably want to find a pattern or repeat occurance in the text you pull from the database to make changes to the string. In your example the periods might be a good starting point. Maybe look at strpos() function php and the str_replace() function more specifically and how they work.</p>

<p>I suggest trying to learn about the PHP string functions and then attempting to use them to solve your problem. If you have issues post what you have done and the trouble you are having and it will be easier for people to give you additional assistance.</p>
