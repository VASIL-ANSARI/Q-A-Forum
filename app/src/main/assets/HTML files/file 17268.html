<p>I found it.</p>

<p>For some reason my key class <em>VttcElement</em> was not been well stored inside the cache because the exception was thrown inside its <em>equals</em> method right in the line it makes <em>(VttcElement) obj</em>.</p>

<p>I changed all my keys to Strings instead <em>VttcElement</em> using its attributes concatenated with comma and it worked as key perfectly.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
