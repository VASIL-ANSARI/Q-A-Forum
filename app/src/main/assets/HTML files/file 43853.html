<p>The <code>/dev/console</code> device is not necessarily available to you.  For Linux that device would only show any result if you happen to look at the current virtual terminal.  Also (including Linux), for most systems <code>/dev/console</code> requires elevated permissions to open it, e.g., your application is running as <code>root</code>.  The reason for that is because some system messages are written to the system console.</p>
