<p>You will need to find the source code for whatever version of Android is associated with a given trace, then check out what that line is. I can tell you that the latest code indexed by Google Code Search does not have line 1359 inside <code>dispatchKeyEvent()</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at the indexed <code>dispatchKeyEvent()</code>, the only way I can see a <code>NullPointerException</code> occurring directly in that method would be if the <code>KeyEvent</code> itself were <code>null</code> for some reason.</p>
