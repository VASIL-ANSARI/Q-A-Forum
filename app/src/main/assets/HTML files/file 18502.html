<p>Okey..., You have mentioned that you don't want a count of the other plans that particular user hold, but according to your requirement you can have optimum output like, </p>

<p>this many user have plan 1 active and this is the count of the other active plan he have exept plan one.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT u.userID,
   u.Name,
   p.Id AS Plan1ActiveId,
   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plans sub where sub.userID = u.userID and sub.plan &lt;&gt; 1 and sub.status = 1) AS OtherActivePlanCount
FROM users u JOIN plans p ON (u.userID = p.userID) 
where p.plan = 1 AND p.status = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>or if you want to drill it down towards the details of the plan you need to apply second query that bring you other plans' detail.</p>
