<p>Singletons are frowned upon when Dependency Injection is viable (and I have yet to find a case where a Singleton was necessary).</p>

<p>More than likely you will have control of instantiation of controllers, so you can get away with the mentioned <code>$controller->setApplication($application)</code>, but if necessary you can use static methods and variables (which are far less harmful to the orthogonality of an application than Singletons); namely <code>Controller::setApplication()</code>, and access the static variables through the instance methods.</p>

<p>eg:</p>

<pre>
// defining the Application within the controller -- more than likely in the bootstrap
$application = new Application();
Controller::setApplication($application);

// somewhere within the Controller class definition
public function setContentType($contentType)
{
    self::$application->setContentType($contentType);
}
</pre>

<p>I have made of a habit of separating static and instance properties and methods (where necessary, and still grouping properties at the top of the class definition). I feel that this is less unwieldy than having Singletons, as the classes still remain quite compact.</p>
