<p>Think about what things are similar. </p>

<p>Country, State, County, City are all geographic entities that can contain each other.</p>

<p>A River is a geographic entity that can cross human-defined boundaries.  </p>

<p>A Boundry is something that helps to describe any of the above.</p>

<p>Country, State, County, City and River all have some properties in common.  For example, they probably all have a name.  They also all have a Boundry.  That implies that they perhaps should share a common base class (maybe GeographicEntity).</p>

<p>Country, State, County, City have a hierarchy, and they are human-defined.  You might consider a subclass of GeographicEntity, say PoliticalEntity, that has things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>The parent PoliticalEntity that it belongs to</li>
<li>A list of zero or more entities that it contains (e.g. a Country contains States).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that things are not quite that simple in real life (there are e.g. cities that cross county or even state lines), but for learning those edge cases can likely be ignored.</p>
