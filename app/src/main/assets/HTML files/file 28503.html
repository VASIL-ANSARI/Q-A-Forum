<p>It's not about having the same name, it's about a derived class being able to override the base class functionality, to do something more specific/different when required.  The derived class can choose not to override the method and in that case it will use the base class method instead.</p>

<p>Imagine a BaseCar class with an OpenDoor method. The BaseCar OpenDoor method would handle most use cases, e.g pulling the door outwards to open it, but for say an instance of SuperCar, you could override the OpenDoor method to handle it's own approach, e.g pulling the door upwards to open it.</p>

<p>Using this approach, you can be confident that with any instance of BaseCar, when you call OpenDoor, it will call the appropriate code.</p>
