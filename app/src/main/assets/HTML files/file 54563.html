<p>At discovery time, TestExplorer creates a process and asks our adapter to find tests. Your TestCaseSource method runs and generates the cases. It has a name generated by Moq.</p>

<p>Much later in the lifetime of the program, your test is executed by Visual studio, which creates a <strong>different</strong> process and asks the adapter to run the tests. Since we are running in a new process, the adapter has to discover (that is generate) the cases all over. Most likely, Moq generates them with a different name. The originally created cases are never run and NUnit runs these new cases, which, from the point of view of TestExplorer, were never discovered in the first place.</p>

<p>I haven't seen this symptom before, but we have a similar problem with random arguments being regenerated at execution time. It's essentially a problem with the architecture and could only be resolved if the Adapter could somehow keep the originally loaded test assembly around to be found by the execution process.</p>
