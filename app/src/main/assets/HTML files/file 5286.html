<p>Assuming that the "id" fields are autoincrementing values (the database is generating them for you) then, after you insert the track you must recover the id of the just-added row (using <code>mysql_insert_id()</code>).  You then use that id, plus the album and composer ids, for an INSERT into albumtrack.</p>

<p>Also, you should be aware that the INSERT syntax you're using is MySQL specific.  That's fine if you never contemplate switching DBs, but you might want to learn the "standard" INSERT syntax (<code>INSERT INTO tablename (col1, col2. . .) VALUES (val1, val2. . .)</code>) as well.</p>
