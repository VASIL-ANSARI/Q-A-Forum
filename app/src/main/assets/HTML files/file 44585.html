<p>Are you sure your <code>logback.xml</code> file is in the correct location and is being detected?<br>
Try intentionally putting in errors in the config file, and seeing if you get messages in the console (Logback will do this automatically). </p>

<p>IF not you can see the <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html" rel="nofollow">Logback configuration</a> how to pass or run your application like below.</p>

<pre><code>java -Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/logback.xml YourMainClass
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let us begin by discussing the initialization steps that logback follows to try to configure itself:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Logback tries to find a file called <strong>logback.groovy</strong> in the <code>classpath</code>.</li>
  <li>If no such file is found, logback tries to find a file called <strong>logback-test.xml</strong> in the <code>classpath</code>.</li>
  <li>If no such file is found, it checks for the file <strong>logback.xml</strong> in the <code>classpath</code>.</li>
  </ol>
