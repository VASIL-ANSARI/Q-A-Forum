<p>if you're running on a 64bit machine, then ipso-facto the sharepoint installation is 64bit. Most of the sharepoint assemblies are x64 only, so this error is a result of your product trying to load the 64bit assembly into a 32bit process (running 32bit clr.)</p>

<p>Without knowing the product that's trying to load the sharepoint assembly, it's hard to tell what's going on. If this is custom code, set the project build target architecture to x64 and rebuild. </p>
