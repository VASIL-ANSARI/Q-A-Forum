<p>The problem is that you are mixing Slim and Ruby together on the second line. Try something like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>= form.input :sample_name, placeholder: "Name", :input_html =&gt; {:rel =&gt; "popover", :data =&gt; {:content =&gt; "content", "original-title" =&gt; "title"}}
</code></pre>
