<p>Okay, don't be so frustrated. Let's look at this step by step:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Python path syntax:</strong>  </p>

<p>In Python, when you split your code base across modules, you qualify the name of the import with the name of the module. Let's say your project is structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>my_project
|__utils
|  |____init__.py
|  |__file_utils.py
|__my_module
   |____init__.py
   |__main.py
</code></pre>

<p>In your <code>main.py</code> if you want to access methods you have defined in <code>file_utils.py</code> you add  an import statement in your <code>main.py</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>import utils.file_utils.read_file
</code></pre>

<p>assuming <code>read_file</code> is the method you want to import into <code>main.py</code>. This way of importing modules where you have a <code>.</code> separating every module is referred as python path syntax.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PYTHONPATH:</strong>  </p>

<p>In the above example, the import statement would work only if the Python interpreter knows where to look for the first module namely the <code>utils</code>. Only when it finds <code>utils</code> can it find <code>file_utils</code> and <code>read_file</code>. You specify the list of all the paths you want the interpreter to look into in the environment variable <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. So in order to have an import statement like above in your code, you have to make sure that the full path to your project <code>my_project</code> is in <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Assuming <code>my_project</code> is in <code>C:\AMAZEBALLS_CODE\my_project</code> you should have <code>C:\AMAZEBALLS_CODE</code> in your <code>PYTHONPATH</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE:</strong>  </p>

<p>Now let's suppose your <code>my_project</code> is actually a Django application. A Django application needs a settings file where you specify a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/" rel="nofollow">whole bunch of things</a>. In order to instruct Django which settings file to look into you specify it in <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code>. Assuming this is your project structure:</p>

<pre><code>my_project
|__utils/
|  |____init__.py
|  |__file_utils.py
|__my_module/
|  |____init__.py
|  |__main.py
|__site_settings/
   |__dev_settings.py
   |__production_settings.py
</code></pre>

<p><code>myroject.site_settings</code> is the module Django has to look into for the settings file. And <code>myroject.site_settings.dev_settings</code> is the value you need to be setting to the <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code> in the above case. When documentation says <code>cms.settings</code> or <code>mysite.settings</code> they mean <code>cms</code> or <code>mysite</code> is the name of your project and <code>settings.py</code> is the name of your settings file. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's look at your question:</p>

<p>Can you permanently set it in the environment variables of Windows? Sure.<br>
Is it the right way? No.   </p>

<p>Because if you want to create another application tomorrow in another location, you will have to edit this in the environment variables section of Windows. Also, it is a practice to use a different settings file for development environment and another one for production. So setting it at one place with one value makes it inflexible. But if you are aware of all of the above and sure you are gonna be using just the one settings file set <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code> to <code>myproject.site_settings.dev_settings</code> in the env variables section.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  </p>

<p>Looks like you are putting your <code>pysec-master</code> project in <code>C:\Python27</code>. Do not put your projects in the python installation. Create a <code>settings.py</code> file in your project and set <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code> to <code>pysec-master.settings</code></p>
