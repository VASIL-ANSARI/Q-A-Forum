<p>What you need to do is use a different DataSet per Query.</p>

<p>Personally I'd split your Query code into a separate Function taking the Event and Distance as Parameters and returning your DataTable;</p>

<pre><code>Private Function GetResults(ByVal EventCode As Integer, ByVal RaceDistance As Integer) As DataTable

    Dim query As String = "SELECT RaceNo, FirstName, LastName, 
                           RaceDistance, RaceTime 
                           FROM " &amp; EventCode &amp; _
                         " WHERE NOT ISNULL(RaceTime) 
                           AND RaceDistance = '" &amp; RaceDistance &amp; "' 
                           ORDER BY RaceDistance ASC, RaceTime ASC;"

    Dim connection As New MySqlConnection(frmMain.connStr)
    Dim da As New MySqlDataAdapter(query, connection)
    Dim ds As New DataSet

    Try
        If da.Fill(ds) Then
            Return ds.Tables(0)
        End If
    Catch ex As Exception
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message)
    Finally

        da = Nothing
        connection.Close()
        connection = Nothing
    End Try
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I've assumed your Data Types here, you will of course need to modify this to use the correct Data Types.</p>

<p>Then you can attach your DataSources using;</p>

<pre><code>dgvLoadResultsA.DataSource = GetResults(EventCodeA, RaceDistanceA)
dgvLoadResultsB.DataSource = GetResults(EventCodeB, RaceDistanceB)
dgvLoadResultsC.DataSource = GetResults(EventCodeC, RaceDistanceC)
dgvLoadResultsD.DataSource = GetResults(EventCodeD, RaceDistanceD)
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally you'd also pass in your Connection String to the GetResults Function, then your Function is Unit Testable, but I'll leave that decision to you.</p>

<p>Of course, you should ideally check that your Function returns a valid DataTable before attaching. But I didn't want to over complicate the solution!</p>
