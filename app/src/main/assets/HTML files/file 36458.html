<p>I think what you're after is this:</p>

<pre><code>gem install rails -v 4.0.8
rails _4.0.8_ new myapp
</code></pre>

<p>That would generate a rails 4.0.8 app, and create a default Gemfile locked at 4.0.8. Less tedious.</p>

<p>Rails needs to be installed, to run the <code>rails</code> command. <code>gem</code> is the installer. Ruby needs to be installed, to run <code>gem</code>. Ruby evolves and fixes bugs, old projects may need older versions etc. You probably want a ruby version manager which gets its' own installation (chruby, rbenv, rvm) that should precede the <code>gem install ...</code>. You can lock the ruby version for a project, in the Gemfile too e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby '2.1.2'
</code></pre>
