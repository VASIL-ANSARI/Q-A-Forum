<p>pip is run from the command line, not the Python interpreter. It is a program that <strong>installs</strong> modules, so you can use them from Python. Once you have installed the module, then you can open the Python shell and do <code>import selenium</code>.</p>

<p>The Python shell is not a command line, it is an interactive interpreter. You type Python code into it, not commands.</p>
