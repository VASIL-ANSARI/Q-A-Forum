<p>Building a gem consists of basically creating a simple directory structure for your script, and a special file known as a gemspec that will list all its dependencies. That gemspec can be used with rubygems to create a gem file (*.gem), which can be installed using rubygems or uploaded to rubygems.org for public consumption.</p>

<p>There are several tools that automate part of this process. A relatively simple one is the Bundler gem, which will both take care of dependencies during development, and make it easy for you to package your gem. <a href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/01/10/using-bundler-for-ruby-gem-development/">This article</a> contains enough information to get you started with gem development using bundler.</p>
