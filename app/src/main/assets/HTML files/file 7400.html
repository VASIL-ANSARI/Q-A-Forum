<p>I don't think there's a contradiction. </p>

<p>5.2.2 clearly says what a function call is. A function call is a postfix expression followed by parentheses
containing a possibly empty,
comma-separated list of expressions
which constitute the arguments to the
function.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a function call to <code>B::B(A const&amp;)</code> anywhere in your program, so I don't see how the second passage applies.</p>
