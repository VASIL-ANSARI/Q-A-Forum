<p>Assuming the code lives inside a view controller that implements the <code>BSKeyboardControlsDelegate</code> protocol, we first add a <code>keyboardControls</code> property to the view controller to hold a reference to the keyboard controls:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeViewController: UIViewController, BSKeyboardControlsDelegate {

    var keyboardControls: BSKeyboardControls? // Here's our property

    // Remaining view controller code here...
}
</code></pre>

<p>(It's an Optional, with the trailing question mark, because it will be nil before we set it.)</p>

<p>Then, assuming you have an array called <code>fields</code> that contains the fields you're working with, we can translate the two lines in question as follows:</p>

<pre><code>self.keyboardControls = BSKeyboardControls(fields: fields)
self.keyboardControls?.delegate = self
</code></pre>
