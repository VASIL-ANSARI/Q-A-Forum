<p>Looks like it would be <a href="http://localhost:8080/bridge/services/Calculator/add">http://localhost:8080/bridge/services/Calculator/add</a></p>

<p>It seems to expect to parameters but there's no indication of how to pass them in the url - you could try appending ?x=2&amp;y=3 to it and see if it returns 5</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yup that seems right, see the post at <a href="http://blog.saminda.org/2008/08/exposing-osgi-service-as-web-service.html">http://blog.saminda.org/2008/08/exposing-osgi-service-as-web-service.html</a> for a calculator example</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: As I've commented on the original question, the links to the code which you are calling are no longer available.  However, it seems like there is a general principle to calling this things.  The format seems to be </p>

<p><code>http://server:port/bridge/services/ClassName/MethodName?parameter=value&amp;anotherparam=value</code></p>

<p>so in the adding numbers example, ClassName is Calculator, MethodName is add and the x and y parameters (that the code adds together) are passed as URL parameters.</p>

<p>I'm not a Java developer myself, so I don't know if you need to compile the web service code first before it is callable, but if you've got the "hello" code working already, you'll know the answer to this.</p>
