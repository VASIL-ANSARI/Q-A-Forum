<p>I found this tool called <a href="https://developers.google.com/playn/" rel="nofollow">PlayN</a> which may be what you're looking for. I've never used it before, but it looks promising. Of course, it may require rewriting your Java source to use their API, which means, as others have said, you're probably best off just manually porting to JavaScript.</p>
