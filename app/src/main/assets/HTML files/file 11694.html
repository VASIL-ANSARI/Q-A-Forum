<p>The precision of <code>DateTime</code> itself is down to the tick.</p>

<p>The granularity of <code>DateTime.Now</code> is typically 10 or 15ms - it's the granularity of the system clock. (That doesn't mean the clock is <em>accurate</em> to the nearest 10 or 15ms, mind you.) The subtraction operator on <code>DateTime</code> shouldn't know or care about that though - the result is just a <code>TimeSpan</code> which again has a precision to the tick level.</p>

<p>Just casting to <code>int</code> should be absolutely fine.</p>
