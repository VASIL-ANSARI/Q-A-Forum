<p>session_start needs to be defined at the top of every page, right after the opening php tag, on every page where the session data is expected to exist. You must do this before addressing any other session function or variable.</p>

<p>check for white space before the opening php tag in test2.php. Also, enable error reporting. You might be sending something out before the session call that is causing session_start() to fail.</p>
