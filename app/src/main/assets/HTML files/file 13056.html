<h2>Issues to realise:</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Code cleanliness-</strong>> Doing anything more than basic layouts in code can get very messy, very fast.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code re-use</strong>-> Itâs extremely easy to inflate an XML layout into a specified view 
with one or two lines of code</p></li>
<li><p><strong>code Performance</strong>-> Creating the objects necessary for an in-code layout leads to unnecessary garbage collection.  As per the Android Designing for Performance article, âavoid creating short-term temporary objects if you can.â</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attribute availability</strong>-> Defining Views in an XML layout exposes attributes that are not always available by object methods.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Possible disadvantages:</h2>

<p>It make take more time to do an XML layout versus defining the layout in code, especially if there are only one or two interface elements that need to be changed.</p>

<p>After thinking about what I want to accomplish, it makes sense for me to use XML layouts for the dynamic view changes I need.  It would be more than just a few lines of code to do my layout changes without utilizing XML layouts.</p>

<p>Now you can decide according to your requirements.</p>
