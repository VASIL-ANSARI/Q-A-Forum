<p>There are two issues here. </p>

<p>First off when you add elements in code - you need to get the MDL library to update your the Dom by making a call to upgradeDom</p>

<pre><code>componentHandler.upgradeDom(gridHolder);
</code></pre>

<p>If that does not work I have found that using javascript to generate the dynamic elements does update the DOM and it all seems to work, where using JQuery has not.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34936154/google-mdl-creating-card-in-jquery-shows-only-text-no-background-or-border">Google MDL - Creating card in jquery shows only text - no background or border</a> where I had a similar problem and it includes JavaScript code to generate elements.</p>
