<p>You must either set a reference to whatever-wrapper-class-is instance after creating a <code>ContentFragment</code> instance, and then call the method of the reference. Or you may remove <code>static</code> modifier from <code>ContentFragment</code> definition if it fits your design. That happens because nested static class' instance may exist without a wrtapper object of wrapper class, thus in the nested class there is no reference to the wrapper class and it can's call wrapper class' methods.</p>
