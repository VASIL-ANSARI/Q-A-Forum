<p>You need to group by bank_id. When you group a question you get the result for each value for the variable you group on.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT bk.*, SUM(amount) AS tot_amount, (bk.balance - SUM(amount)) AS bank_balance 
FROM banks bk 
LEFT JOIN cheque ch ON (bk.bank_id = ch.bank_id  AND ch.status = 1 AND ch.delete_state = 0)
WHERE bk.delete_state=0 
GROUP BY bk.bank_id;
</code></pre>
