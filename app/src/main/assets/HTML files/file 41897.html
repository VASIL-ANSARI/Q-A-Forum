<p>You may have a race condition.</p>

<p><code>.ToList()</code> calls the <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> constructor.  The code is <a href="http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/generic/list.cs,d2ac2c19c9cf1d44" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>If the number of elements in your <code>taskSeedSource</code> changes between the time the constructor starts and finishes, it's possible that you could end up with an inconsistent list.  In particular look at line 94.</p>

<pre><code>ICollection&lt;T&gt; c = collection as ICollection&lt;T&gt;;
if( c != null) {
    int count = c.Count;
    if (count == 0)
    {
        _items = _emptyArray;
    }
    else {
        _items = new T[count];
        c.CopyTo(_items, 0);  /* it's possible there are now fewer elements in c */
        _size = count;
    }
} 
</code></pre>
