<p>It <em>almost</em> sounds like what you want to do is render the lights to your color map, then use your color map as a texture, but instead of decal mode set it to modulate mode, so it's multiplied with the existing color instead of just replacing it.</p>

<p>That is different in one way though: instead of just affecting the vertexes, it'll map to the individual fragments (pixels, in essence).</p>

<p>Edit: What I had in mind wasn't a 3D texture -- it was a cube map. Basically, create a virtual cube surrounding everything in your "world". Create a 2D texture for each face of that cube. Render your coloring to the cube map. Then, to color a vertex you (virtually) extend a ray outward from the center, through the vertex, to the cube. The pixel you hit on the cube map gives you the color of lighting for that vertex.</p>

<p>Updating should be relatively efficient -- you have normal 2D textures for the top, bottom, front, etc., and you update them as needed.</p>
