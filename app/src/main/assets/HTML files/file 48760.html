<p>It sounds like you want a <code>Multimap</code> from <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/NewCollectionTypesExplained" rel="nofollow">the Guava library</a>.</p>

<p>You can also go the route of using a <code>Map&lt;Integer, List&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>, but then you will need to manually handle the case where the list is null (probably just allocate a new list in that case).</p>
