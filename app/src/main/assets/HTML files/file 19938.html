<p>I was seeing  "New tag collected" from build-in app called "Tags" because my application didn't work properly. </p>

<p>When it works ok, it has higher priority than "Tags" and phone reads tags from my application. But when it works unproperly and phone collect a tag, "Tags" application is activated and "Tags" application talks to my device. </p>

<p>After repairing code, my app has higher priority and phone reads tags using my application.</p>
