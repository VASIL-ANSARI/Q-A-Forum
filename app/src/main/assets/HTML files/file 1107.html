<p>That's not generally the way that it's done. Take a look at the discussion <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/95567/is-there-any-benefit-to-using-cocoas-version-of-mvc-with-net">here</a>, in particular the link to the Apple documentation.</p>

<p>If you still want to do it the way you say you do, it's not particularly hard to implement something like bindings "by hand". You'd just create a "binding" object that knows how to subscribe to changes, and connects to a property of a view.</p>

<p>To actually answer how it's done - normally, you have a controller object that monitors the state of the model (acting something like an Observer), and updates the view object(s) as necessary.</p>
