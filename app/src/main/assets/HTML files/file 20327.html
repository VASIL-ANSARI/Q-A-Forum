<p>You can surely hash a file and save the hash value.</p>

<p>Have a look at HashAlgorithm.ComputeHash</p>

<p>The MSDN example gets the point across but is flawed:</p>

<pre><code>FileStream fileStream = fInfo.Open(FileMode.Open);
// Be sure it's positioned to the beginning of the stream.
fileStream.Position = 0;
// Compute the hash of the fileStream.
hashValue = myRIPEMD160.ComputeHash(fileStream);
</code></pre>

<p>Please be sure and dispose of things like <code>FileStream</code> that implement <code>IDisposable</code>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Just to be clear... the hash is useful to <em>validate</em> the file has not been changed/tampered with since the hash was created.</p>

<p>You still must store the file itself.  You cannot re-create the file from the hash.</p>
