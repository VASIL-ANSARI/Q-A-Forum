<p>If you supply a username and a password in your app, you should consider it exposed to the user - there is really no way to guarantee that the user does not examine your app or sniff the network connection.</p>

<p>Also, if is <em>common to block SMTP traffic</em> in firewalls and maintain a single smarthost, to avoid compromised machines becoming spambots. Even if you successfully manage to hide the credentials, using SMTP like this might be an unreliable choice.</p>

<p>You essentially have three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the Send Email services of the OS - launching a mail in whatever email client the user has.</li>
<li>Ask the user to configure a valid SMTP server.</li>
<li>Set up your own relay to SMTP (for example as a <em>web service</em>), where you add additional checks and throttling to make sure it isn't misused.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last option can of course be combined with authentication of the user against your own user database - that way you can shut down misbehaving users.</p>
