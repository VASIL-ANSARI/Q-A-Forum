<p>It looks like this is what you need:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT i.dept_name, COUNT(a.s_id) FROM instructor i
LEFT OUTER JOIN advisor a ON i.id = a.i_id
GROUP BY i.dept_name;
</code></pre>

<p>I have to add that <code>advisor(s_id,i_id)</code> is bad database design if a student really can not have more than 1 advisor as you said. Because in that case, simply add advisor_id to the student relation and get rid of the advisor table.</p>

<p>Also: your use of the word 'function' is incorrect. We are talking about queries here.</p>
