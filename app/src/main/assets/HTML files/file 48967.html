<p>In your local copy of the repo, edit <code>progressbar/__init__.py</code> and change the following line:</p>

<pre><code>__version__ = '2.3dev'
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>__version__ = '2.3.1'
</code></pre>

<p>Save the file, then reinstall with <code>pip</code>. Of course, without a pull request, this will only work locally for you.</p>

<p>Another option is to use the much more up-to-date <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar2" rel="nofollow"><code>progressbar2</code></a>, on Github <a href="https://github.com/WoLpH/python-progressbar" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It has been validated to work up to Python 3.5. Obviously, you'll have to test your code to ensure it works with the new version, but this is probably your best bet.</p>
