<p>Solution is just a set of projects, nothing more.</p>

<p>When MSBuild works on a solution, it computes the build order analyzing project and binary references -- this process is identical in Visual Studio and in Team Build (i.e. TFS). For project references it determines from build outputs if a project should rebuild. As long as MSBuild is able to resolve references on the file system, everything is fine.</p>

<p>You will see the same behavior in Visual Studio: you just get a warning, but build succeeds.</p>

<p>Team Build use a single directory for all build outputs, so the order you use to build the solutions can influence binary reference too.</p>
