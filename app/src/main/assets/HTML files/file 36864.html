<p>I seem to have fixed it by juggling with the class in the utils package.</p>

<p>I saw that IDEA IntelliJ detected the class in utils by importing as import _root_.ClassName, disregarding the utils package.</p>

<p>Then I moved ClassName to the root package, app. The compiler complained that it couldn't import _root_.   so I moved the class back to the utils package and it seemed to have fixed it somehow after a rebuild.</p>

<p>The key thing that made it work was dragging the class from root to the utils package. It seemed to have updated links everywhere. But, have I not had the help of IDEA, how else would I fix this? I would like to use a simpler text tool, Sublime, that doesn't have the Scala integration that IDEA has.</p>
