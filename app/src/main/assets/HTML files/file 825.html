<p>Wow, that's evil.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this portable across compilers?</p>

<p>Most definitely not. Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>foo* x = new bar();
delete x;
</code></pre>

<p>In order for this to work, foo's destructor must be virtual which it clearly isn't. As long as you don't use <code>new</code> and as long as the derived objectd don't have custom destructors, though, you could be lucky.</p>

<p>/EDIT: On the other hand, if the code is only used as in the question, inheritance has no advantage over composition. Just follow the advice given by m_pGladiator.</p>
