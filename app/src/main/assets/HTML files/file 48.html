<p>You should use <code>atexit()</code> if possible.  <code>on_exit()</code> is nonstandard and less common.  For example, it's not available on OS X.</p>

<p>Kernel.org - <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/on_exit.3.html"><code>on_exit()</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This function comes from SunOS 4, but is also present in libc4, libc5 and
  glibc.  It no longer occurs in Solaris (SunOS 5).  Avoid this function, and
  use the standard atexit(3) instead.</p>
