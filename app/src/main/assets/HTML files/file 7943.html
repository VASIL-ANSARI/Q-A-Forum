<p>If you want to use same methods/selectors for events (like UIControlEventTouchDown ...) across multiple files, try adding them using <code>addTarget:action:forControlEvents:</code> method instead of doing through IBAction (interface builder).<br>
Also , I dont think  your approach of importing delegate in controller is correct.</p>
