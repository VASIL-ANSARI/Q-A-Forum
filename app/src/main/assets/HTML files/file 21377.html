<p>This is not a programming or even a technical question. </p>

<p>viddur.com might do what you want â its a startup and they probably don't have a public api yet, though. Other than that, no one will offer you this service for free. It cost between 0.01-03 cents to encode video (and you have to do it multiple times per video to support varios platforms). Encoding and hosting video is not as cheap as static images. You're basically trying to create a product around a free service that doesn't exist.</p>

<p>TL:DR: Abandon your idea, and only post technical questions to Stackoverflow.</p>
