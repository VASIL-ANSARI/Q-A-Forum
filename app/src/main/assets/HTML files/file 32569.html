<p>In theory, you can use the EPUB 3 Structural Semantics Vocabulary: <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/" rel="nofollow">http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/</a> to structure your publication.</p>

<p>Note, however, that the current reading systems mostly ignore epub:type values, and, in any case, the "pages left in this chapter" thing is not defined by the EPUB3 specification, hence "defining" it is up to each reading system implementer.</p>
