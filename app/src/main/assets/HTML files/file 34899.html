<p>You can share screen of your iPod to your desktop computer using AirPlay and record screencast from this computer. It will look like you recorded screen of your iPod. For this you will need anything like this: <a href="http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/record-iphone-screen/" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/record-iphone-screen/</a></p>

<p>Or you can try solution from Apple Support Community: <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4893020?start=0&amp;tstart=0" rel="nofollow">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4893020?start=0&amp;tstart=0</a>
They suggest following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get RecordMyScreen from emu4ios.weebly.com on your iPhone. Sroll down
  untill you find RecordMyScreen then press install. When it asks if you
  want to install the app press indtall. It may take more than one try,
  so if it doesn't work the first time tap retry. I have it and it works
  great.</p>
