<p>when going out of range it means the value is not indexed example</p>

<pre><code>int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
console.writeline(myArray[6]);
</code></pre>

<p>you would get the going out of range exception for the reason that the index starts with Zero</p>

<p>Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5</p>

<p>Array: 1 2 3 4 5 6</p>

<p>So when you are using <code>(myArray[6]);</code> your actually pulling the 6th element in the index. If you notice it only goes to 5.</p>
