<p>You need to nest the loops to brute-force it like you are attempting:</p>

<pre><code>for a in range(451): # range(450) excludes 450
    for b in range(451):
        for c in range(451):
            ...
</code></pre>

<p>It's very obviously O(n<sup>3</sup>), but if you want a quick and dirty answer, I guess it'll work&mdash;only 91 million loops, worst case.</p>
