<p>Your JavaScript code needs to be included in every separate page that needs to use it. Assuming by "that method" you mean the "func()" function defined by the "controller" constructor, you'd have to instantiate an object and then call through it:</p>

<pre><code>var myController = new controller();
myController.func();
</code></pre>
