<p>You need to open the final file "wb" as suggested by @Kupiakos otherwise you will end up with a corrupted archive. Your other problem is that you need to close the zipfile before using the <code>StringIO</code> buffer. The close writes the file catalog to the zipfile. Without that, an unzipper may make assumptions such as this being only one of a multipart zip and do odd things. Nominally, just add <code>outfile.close()</code> or put it in a context manager</p>

<pre><code>inMemoryZip = StringIO()
with zipfile.ZipFile(inMemoryZip, 'w', compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as output:
    //outfile.write(stuff)
inMemoryZip.seek(0)
return inMemoryZip
</code></pre>

<p>then later</p>

<pre><code>with open('pathToNewZip.zip', 'wb') as archive:
  archive.write(inMemoryZip.getvalue())
</code></pre>
