<p>I have solved the problem. The real source of it was not accessing the variable, but an error in how and when I accessed the variables in my javascript. When I declared the variables outside of jQuery in the parent page, like this:</p>

<pre><code>   var friendsCache = new Object;
</code></pre>

<p>...it worked! In my IFrame page I can access the value like this:</p>

<pre><code>   var friends = window.parent.friendsCache;
</code></pre>

<p>So now I have a solution that looks something like this. When the user has logged in successfully with Facebook Connect, I call the function loadFriends:</p>

<pre><code>function loadFriends() {
   if (jQuery.isEmptyObject(friends)) {
      FB.api("/me/friends?fields=name,first_name,picture", renderFriends);
   }
   else {
      renderFriends();
   }
}

function renderFriends(friendsData) {
   if (friendsData != undefined) {
      if (!(jQuery.isEmptyObject(friendsData))) {
         friends = friendsData.data;
         window.parent.friendsCache = friends;
      }
   }
   // Do the stuff you want to do when the friends are loaded
}
</code></pre>

<p>As long as the parent page isn't reloaded, I don't need to load the list of Facebook friends from the Graph API. Instead I load them from my cache variable, which gives me a highly noticeable increase in performance.</p>

<p>Eventhough this description was a little broader in scope than my original question, I hope someone will find it useful.</p>
