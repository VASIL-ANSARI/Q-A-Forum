<p>To get a private value, usually a public get function is implemented.</p>

<p>You want to set the value - usually a public set function is implemented for this task:</p>

<pre><code>void Set_Word(string&amp; newValue) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Or implement the Getter as returning a reference, as Vlad from Moscow stated.</p>
