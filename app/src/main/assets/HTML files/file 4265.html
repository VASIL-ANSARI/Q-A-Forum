<p>As far as I know, no.</p>

<p>ASP.NET final HTML will be sent to the browser only after it has finished execution.. unlike classic ASP command like Response.Flush will won't have the desired effect of seeing the text/image before the page loads.</p>

<p>There are some ways around though. If the page is target of previous page, have the previous page open small pop up saying "loading" and close that pop up with script in the "heavy" page.</p>

<p>Another way around is having the "heavy" code taking time to run asynchronously in separate thread, then in the main thread show only the "Please wait" and have the separate thread hide that message once done.</p>
