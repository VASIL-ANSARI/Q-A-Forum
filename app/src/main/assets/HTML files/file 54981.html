<p>It's currently private API in iOS. The token is stored in a dictionary in the main interface class, you could replace that (using the private key) and then call <code>getPersistentUser</code> on the <code>UserService</code>. You'd also need to be sure to set <code>setStayLoggedIn:</code>.</p>

<p>For Android you could perhaps use <code>Backendless.UserService.setCurrentUser(user);</code>, though I haven't tried keeping multiple users all logged in at the same time.</p>
