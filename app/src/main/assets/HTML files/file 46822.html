<p>Put a better processor on your server and increase the RAM, then go to your php.ini settings and raise the maximum allocated memory for all the various memory/processor relative configurations.</p>

<p>This will empower the server further and improve the running efficiency.</p>

<p>If you cannot find your php.ini file. Create a new php file with the following contents and open it in the browser:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you delete this file after finding out where php.ini is... as an unwanted user (hacker) could find this file and it would give them detailed information leading to vulnerabilities in your server configuration.</p>

<p>Once  you've found php.ini, do some looks online to determine settings that are not obvious and increase the memory allocations in various areas.</p>
