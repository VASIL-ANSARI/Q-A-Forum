<p>as I can see, there are two diffrent Stylesheets overwriting each other, i am not that deep into Wordpress, but maybe in ur Theme u can define <code>hover color</code> and <code>aktive color</code>
<strong>AND</strong> maybe <code>hover color</code> for sub-menu?</p>

<p>otherwise u have to work with code :P</p>
