<p>The best way to authenticate and Android app, is to </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Authenticate the user in the Android App with the Google Signin for Android. Link: <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start</a></p></li>
<li><p>The Google SignIn above will generate a google ID token. The google ID token should be sent to your server. The server can get user details using the this ID. You can read more on <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/backend-auth" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/backend-auth</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>This part can however be implemented using the strategy passport-google-token.</p>

<p>Create a route and strategy to validate the token on your server, and call the API from android passing the access_token as a variable.</p>

<p>Hope this helps and saves you time.</p>
