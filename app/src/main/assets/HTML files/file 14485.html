<p>If you can generally expect the XML to be well-formatted, or at least consistently formatted, you should be able to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" rel="nofollow">regular expressions</a> to strip out the XML.</p>

<p>You can experiment with <a href="http://www.ultrapico.com/Expresso.htm" rel="nofollow">Expresso</a> to craft your expression.</p>

<p>If you want to then parse the XML you strip out, that's a job for the .NET XMLParser.</p>
