<p>Did you try accessing the web page with telnet?</p>

<p>Please do the following:</p>

<p>telnet [hostname] [port]</p>

<p>And in the telnet shell type:</p>

<pre><code>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: [hostname]
&lt;return&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(mind the extra return after Host!</p>

<p>Please post both the results from telnet and the results from your code</p>

<ul>
<li>EDIT *</li>
</ul>

<p>Found the problem:</p>

<p>You use fputs instead of fwrite. fputs expects a string, which it detects by looking for a NULL character.</p>

<p>In your case however, such NULL character is not promised, so you have to be explicit.
As a bonus, your program now terminates and flushes input to file.
The fix:</p>

<p>Replace your while and do while loops with the following do while loop:</p>

<pre><code>do
{
    int write;
    bytes_read = read(socket_desc, server_reply, sizeof(server_reply));
    write = fwrite(server_reply, 1, bytes_read, fp);
    printf("Written %d bytes_read: %d\n", write, bytes_read);
    memset(server_reply, 0, sizeof(server_reply));
    fflush(fp);
} while (bytes_read &gt; 0); // This termination is wrong! You should look at Content-Length from the server's reply to detect the actual length
</code></pre>

<p>It works now....</p>
