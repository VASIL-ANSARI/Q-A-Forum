<p>There haven't been any reported issues of charts not displaying in Excel in any version of XlsxWriter that supported charts.</p>

<p>There are also almost 300 chart comparison tests in the XlsxWriter codebase that test the charts that it produces byte for byte against files produces by Excel. These are all passing.</p>

<p>Also, the output from zipfile in your post clearly shows the chart elements are there. If they were present but incorrect Excel would complain when it loaded the file.</p>

<p>And the code that you link to has a screenshot of the output that clearly shows a chart.</p>

<p>I also ran the code and see the chart in 3 versions of Excel and 1 version of LibreOffice.</p>

<p>So you need to go back and verify your results. If you think there is an issue then create a small working program that demonstrates it and submit a bug report.</p>
