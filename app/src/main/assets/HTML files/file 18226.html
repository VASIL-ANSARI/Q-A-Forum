<p>If I got you right you always want the <code>bar</code> value to a <code>foo</code> with the highest <code>id</code>.</p>

<pre><code>select * 
  from your_table t1
 where id = (select max(id)  from your_table t2
                            where t2.foo = t1.foo) 
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/f476c/14" rel="nofollow">SQL Fiddle</a> for a demo. It also gives an alternative way with a left join. The construct does assume that the "latest one" is the one with the highest id.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> So according to your comment you only want that "highest id" for foo=2, that is a simply <code>OR</code> logic. I don't know if foo can be null so I added the <code>IS NULL</code> condition otherwise the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> might not work.</p>

<pre><code>select * from your_table t1
where  foo &lt;&gt; 2 or foo is null
   or  (foo = 2 and id = (select max(id)  from your_table t2
                                         where t2.foo = t1.foo) ) ;
</code></pre>
