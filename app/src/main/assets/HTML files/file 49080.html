<p>Running your code through the popular online c compiler here: </p>

<p>Your code ran as expected. What happens when you type "."?</p>

<p>EDIT: (Solution)</p>

<p>The problem was that when you input a negative number,</p>

<pre><code>a = '-'
</code></pre>

<p>which has an integer value greater than zero, hence not triggering the negative case.</p>

<p>The solution then, is to check for the negative sign:</p>

<pre><code>if (a == '-') {...}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, note that the '.' entered to terminate the loop is being counted as a positive number.</p>
