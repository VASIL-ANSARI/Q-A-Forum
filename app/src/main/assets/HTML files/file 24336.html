<p>Something like this, in order to simplify your code</p>

<pre><code>function successHandler(url, ball) {
  return function(ret) {
     alert('file: ' + url + 'EXXXXXXISTS!!!!!');
     ball.css('color','red')
  }
}

var balls = $('.ball'), requests = []


balls.each(function(index, ball) {
  var url = ...
  requests.push($.ajax({ url : url , success : successHandler(url, ball) })
})


$.when.apply($, requests).done(function() {
  alert('all balls are checked')
}) 
</code></pre>

<p>Little explanation: You are blindly using <code>this</code> in your callback, not knowing in which context it is going to be executed. In order to workaround it and have your url into callback we are creating function that returns a function, so it will have url of current <code>.ball</code> item in it's context.</p>

<p>Also you'll probably need to execute code after all ajax requests are done, so using <code>$.when</code> is the simplest way of doing it. And we are storing all deferreds in array for this reason. </p>
