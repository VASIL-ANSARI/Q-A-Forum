<p>If you take both of these articles together you <em>might</em> end up with something like the below, though you will definitely want to tailor this to your specific application</p>

<pre><code>private void TabControl1_Selecting(Object sender, TabControlCancelEventArgs e) 
{

    TextBox dynamictextbox = new TextBox();
    dynamictextbox.Text = "(Enter some text)";
    dynamictextbox.ID = "dynamictextbox";
    (TabControl)sender.controls.Add(dynamictextbox)
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't meant to be a complete example but to illustrate how it might work. In your case you will have to wire up the Selecting event in code for each dynamic tab</p>
