<p>I'm running into the same problem with SmartGo Kifu; filed as rdar://18245085. Here's my current workaround: use a class derived from UISlider, and override continueTrackingWithTouch:withEvent: to filter out events that are coming in too fast.</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)continueTrackingWithTouch:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
{
    if (self.tracking)
    {
        const NSTimeInterval TOO_FAST_TO_HANDLE = 0.1;
        if ([event timestamp] - previousTimestamp &gt;= TOO_FAST_TO_HANDLE)
        {
            previousTimestamp = [event timestamp];
            return [super continueTrackingWithTouch:touch withEvent:event];
        }
    }
    return self.tracking;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Still hope this will get fixed for the final release of iOS 8, or somebody has a better way to handle this.</p>
