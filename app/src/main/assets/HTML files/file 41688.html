<p><code>dont_delete</code> is not copied over to <code>B</code>; you can only delete <em>direct attributes</em> from objects.</p>

<p>Python looks up attributes on instances and classes by delegating down the chain of inheritance, not by copying attributes across to sub-classes. As such there is nothing to delete from a subclass either.</p>

<p>You should not try and 'uninherit'; when are using <code>A</code> as a base class, you are effectively stating that <code>B</code> is the same thing as <code>A</code>, only more specialised. That process only ever should <em>add</em> attributes, not remove. Design your classes accordingly; use a mixin base class for attributes and methods that should not always be inherited, for example.</p>
