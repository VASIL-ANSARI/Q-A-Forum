<p>This is not related to you shader.</p>

<p>It appears to be depth test related. Here, the order of triangles in the depth relative to you viewport is messed up, because you do not make sure that only the nearest pixel to your camera gets drawn. </p>

<p>Enable depth testing and make sure you have a z buffer bound to your render target.

<p>Only the triangles highlighted in red should be visible to the viewer. Due to the lack of a valid depth test, there is no chance to guarantee, what triangle is painted top most. Thus blue triangles of the faces that should not be visible will cover parts of previously drawn red triangles.</p>

<p>The depth test would omit this, by comparing the depth in the z buffer with the depth of the pixel to be drawn at the current moment. Only the color information of a pixel that is closer to the viewer, i.e. has a smaller z value than the z value in the buffer, shall be written to the framebuffer in order to achieve a correct result. </p>

<p>(Backface culling, would be nice too and, if the model is correctly exported, also allow to show it correctly. But it would only hide the main problem, not solve it.)</p>
