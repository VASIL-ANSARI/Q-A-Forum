<p>No, esp is a stack pointer, so it should point to some address inside stack. Your program doesn't seem to provide any stack section, so I guess the OS allocates the stack.</p>

<p>Well, if you are about to return from a function, <code>dword ptr [esp]</code> (but not esp) should indeed contain an address from the sections above, as this should be an address of the next instruction to be executed after the function call.</p>
