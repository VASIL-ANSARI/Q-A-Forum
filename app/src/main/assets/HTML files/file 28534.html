<p>In order for the grid to update with the correct result, you need to do two things: the first is to update the Total in the dataset. The second is to rebind the grid to the updated dataset. The most common way to do that is to set the datasource to null and then back to your  dataset. I would also suggest to look at your sql statements, in particular cmdSelect. It's never used.<br>
<strong>Edit:</strong><br>
Take a look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.editmode.aspx" rel="nofollow">EditMode</a> and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.cellendedit.aspx" rel="nofollow">CellEndEdit</a> event. It should be good start to start editing the grid. The EditMode specifies when to edit the cell and the cellEndEdit event can be used to update the data in your grid.</p>
