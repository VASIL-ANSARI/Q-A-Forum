<p>Problem solved. I tried to make a demo on <a href="http://meteorpad.com/pad/i7tuxRfhzv2P2pnAm/Leaderboard" rel="nofollow">meteorpad</a> as suggested by @Florian, and it worked somehow on there.<br>
So I went back to my project and restructured it like the demo project on meteorpad, somehow it worked.  I ended up using the <code>simple:highlight</code> package <a href="http://libraries.io/meteor/wilddeer:highlight.js/1.0.10" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  </p>
