<p>I've got exactly the same question. The problem as I see it is that the view login_form is designed to cater for everything (forgotten passwords, captchas, etc) in one. What I'm trying to create is a system where there is the quick login, and then if needed, another view to deal with registration, forgotten passwords, etc. I'm struggling to separate out the two objectives from this one login_form form. </p>

<p>The auth controller login function has all that logic, and then simply $this->load->view('auth/login_form', $data);</p>
