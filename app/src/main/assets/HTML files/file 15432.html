<p>well 3x100px > 290px, right? So it's no wonder the 3rd box breaks onto the newline.</p>

<p>You need to keep in mind, that <code>position:relative</code> <strong>keeps the original space of the element</strong> occupied. That's why the 3 boxes don't fit although you shift 2boxes 50px to the left.</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>Try to use <code>position:absolute</code> - it takes the elements out of the document-flow (this is not "compatible" with float though). Other than that you need to adjust the width of the child elements to fit the with of the parent or vice versa.</p>

<p>keep in mind, that by using absolute positioning or negative margins, parts of your content gets clipped. It's better to use correct dimensions, so everything fits well.</p>
