<p>I haven't checked recently, but I don't think PyBluez can do BLE.</p>

<p>Your issue with trying to connect while scanning is a known issue that happens with some hardware.  It's an issue specific to certain hardware.  Essentially you need to stop scanning, make your L2CAP/GATT connection, and then restart scanning...  or buy a different dongle that doesn't have that issue.</p>

<p>All the work I've done with BLE in Python has been to mimic what <code>hcitool</code> and <code>gatttool</code> does in Python.  It's unfortunate, but there's no library (that I know of) that does BLE yet.  Here's a code snippet that may help you to get started:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23788176/finding-bluetooth-low-energy-with-python/23809773#23809773">Finding Bluetooth low energy with python</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, you could interact with Bluez using the DBUS interface it provides.  I've been told that you can't interact with attributes that aren't part of a Bluetooth profile, though.  (So, you can interact with a BLE device that uses the heart-rate profile, but not read a value from an accelerometer)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Seems there <em>is</em> a library for GATT now:  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gattlib" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gattlib</a></p>
