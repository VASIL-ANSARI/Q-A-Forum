<p>This is an example of integer division. Try:</p>

<pre><code>private float frequency = 1.0/2.0;
</code></pre>

<p>Java will execute 1/2, which yields 0.5. However, since Java sees this as operations on integers (and 0.5 isn't an integer), it'll truncate the decimal and leave just the integer part, 0. By telling Java to work with floats (1.0 vs. 1), you tell it to keep the decimal part of the intermediate computation.</p>
