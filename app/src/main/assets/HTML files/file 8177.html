<p>All you need to do is make an instance of UITabBarController, then alloc any views you want in it, then set the UITabBarController views. Make sure that your TabBarController is the one that is visible. Also make sure that any viewControllers you want in your tab bar are being imported with <code>#import</code>.</p>

<pre><code>UITabBarController *c = [self tabBarController];
SecondViewController *s = [[SecondViewController alloc] init];
[s setTitle:@"Whatever"];
c.viewControllers = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:self, s, nil];
[s release];
</code></pre>

<p>Put this in the viewDidLoad method of the first controller allocated.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could just change the way your ApplicationDelegate sets up the TabBarController, but i won't go into that.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
