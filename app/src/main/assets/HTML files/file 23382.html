<p>Imagine the following scenario. </p>

<ul>
<li>Bob is surfing the internet and goes to your site.</li>
<li>Eve's site opens an iframe with content from <a href="http://bobsbank.com" rel="nofollow">http://bobsbank.com</a></li>
<li>Eve's site stars injecting keystrokes and clicks to that site, sending all of Bob's money to Eve's account</li>
</ul>

<p>This sort of scenario is why what you're trying to do is impossible.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript" rel="nofollow">same origin policy</a> will prevent it.</p>
