<p>Not sure if you want it globally, but if you do... from ze manual:</p>

<p>If you want the filter to run automatically every time it encounters POST or COOKIE data you can enable it by opening your application/config/config.php file and setting this:</p>

<pre><code>$config['global_xss_filtering'] = TRUE;
</code></pre>
