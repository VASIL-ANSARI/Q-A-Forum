<p>Make will only try to build the first target in your makefile (and all prerequisites of that target, and all prerequisites of those targets, etc.)  To choose a different, or more than one, top-level target (or "goal target") you can specify them on the command line: <code>make run</code>.</p>

<p>You can move the <code>run</code> target to be the first target in the makefile, then it will be run by default.</p>

<p>Or, if you have more than one "top-level" target that you want to run, you can collect them in another rule; for example in the above you could use:</p>

<pre><code>default: classes run
</code></pre>

<p>Although by long-standing convention this target is named <code>all</code> (but that's just a convention).</p>
