<p>I think this depends a great deal on the font used.  That said, <em>Smashing Magazine</em> gives this "rule of thumb":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Heading to Body Font-Size Ratio</strong></p>
  
  <p>To better understand the relationship
  between heading and body font size, we
  divided each websiteâs heading font
  size by its body font size. We took
  the average of these ratios and
  derived a rule of thumb for you to
  work with:</p>
  
  <p>Heading font size Ã· Body copy font
  size = 1.96</p>
  
  <p>The overall value, then, is 1.96. This
  means that when you have chosen a font
  size for your body copy, you may want
  to multiply it by 2 to get your
  heading font size. This, of course,
  depends on your style; the rule of
  thumb wonât necessarily give you the
  optimal size for your particular
  design. Another option is to use a
  traditional scale (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
  12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 36, 48, 60,
  72) or the Fibonacci sequence (e.g. 16
  â 24 â 40 â 64 â 104) to get natural
  typographic results.</p>
