<p>The SshExec class is for executing a single command.  It logs into the server for each command, and executes the command you asked it to.  It's similar (but not the same) as you logging in, typing <code>cd  ..</code>, logging out again, logging in again and typing <code>ls</code> - when you logged in the second time you were redirected to the home directory.</p>

<p>If you want to continue to use the SshExec, you should combine your commands so you can just execute a single command.  In this instance, for example, you would execute <code>ls ..</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to issue multiple commands like an interactive session, look at the <code>SshShell</code> class instead of <code>SshExec</code>.</p>
