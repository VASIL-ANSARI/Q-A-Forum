<p>The first one is better, and fairly standard and proper.  The second form is general bad form.  Because it's completely unclear the object you <code>init</code> is the same one that you <code>release</code>.  It's always best to think like this:</p>

<pre><code>instiate object
do something with object
release object
</code></pre>

<p>In this case "do something with object" happens to be assigning it to a different instance variable.  But it really doesn't matter what you do there, the pattern holds true.  It's entirely up to the <code>setDataModel:</code> method what happens to the object afterward.</p>

<p>Personally though, I prefer the <code>autorelease</code> for most of these cases.  Simply because you have to think about it far less.</p>

<pre><code>DataModel *tempDataModel = [[[DataModel alloc] init] autorelease];
[self setDataModel:tempDataModel];
</code></pre>

<p>So the easier pattern to remember is:</p>

<pre><code>instantiate and autorelease object
do something with object
</code></pre>

<p>But this is a matter of taste, and many prefer the explicit <code>release</code>.</p>
