  <p>Is there a way to extract the <code>sizeof()</code> of the array from just the pointer to the first letter?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you have to keep track of this explicitly and maybe pass around the length as extra arguments to functions etc.</p>

<p>You have tagged your question "C++". In C++ we usually use <code>std::vector</code>, <code>std::string</code> or other container classes to keep track of this.</p>
