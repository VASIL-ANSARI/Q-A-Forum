<p>Take a look at the C++ documentation on Namespaces. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/</a></p>

<p>You can declare that you are 'using' a namespace for a specific scope (such as a function). But I don't believe you can arbitrarily specify where a using statement starts and ends, it is always for the rest of the scope it is declared in.  </p>

<p>I should note (someone please correct me if I'm wrong) that in C++ you can arbitrarily declare a scope almost anywhere you want, simply by using curly braces.</p>

<pre><code>{ 
  using mynamespace;
  /* rest of your code here */
}
</code></pre>

<p>But use it sparingly and carefully, because if used too often or in the wrong context, it can make code harder to read (which defeats the whole point of 'using' in the first place, right?).</p>
