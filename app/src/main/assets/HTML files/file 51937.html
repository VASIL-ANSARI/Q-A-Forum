<p>WordPress has a specific way to handle ajax requests. It is bad practice to place external PHP scripts inside the WordPress structure. If needed put them in a place on the server which is outside the control of the WordPress .htaccess.</p>

<p>WordPress functions anyway will not work within this script if you do not include wp-blog-header.php (which will trigger the bootstrap process of WordPress).</p>

<p>You can handle Ajax requests from within your theme or within a custom plugin you create.</p>

<p>The correct way to handle Ajax requests in WordPress is extensivley described in the WordPress codex:</p>

<p><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins" rel="nofollow">https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins</a></p>

<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Create a custom Plugin and use the functions as described in the codex</p>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Use the ajax functions as described in the codex in a custom Theme or Child Theme</p>

<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Create an external PHP file outside the WordPress folder structure on your server structure and make an ajax call to this external script.</p>

<p>Option 1 and 2 are good practice in terms of migration.</p>
