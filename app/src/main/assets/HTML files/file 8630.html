<p>The server may have sent multiple messages by the time the client attempts to read them, and if these fit within the same 4k buffer, the <code>recv()</code> call will obtain both of them.</p>

<p>You don't show the <code>getMessage</code> code, but I'd guess you're doing something like <code>pickle.loads(msg)</code>, but this will only give you the first message and discard the rest of the string, hence the dropped messages.  You'll also get another issue if more than 4096 bytes are buffered by the time you read, as you could end up getting a fragment of a message and thus an unpickling error.</p>

<p>You'll need to break up the string you get back into seperate messages, or better, just treat the socket as a stream and let <code>pickle.load</code> pull a single message from it.</p>
