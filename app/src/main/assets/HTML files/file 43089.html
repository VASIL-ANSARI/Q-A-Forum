<p>Declare previousData like this:</p>

<pre><code>PMDG_NGX_Data previousData;
</code></pre>

<p>(without the asterisk). Now, when you want to 'save' the structure, do this:</p>

<pre><code>previousData = *data;
</code></pre>

<p>(right hand side has an asterisk). Note that this assumes that PMDG_NGX_Data is copy-able and a fixed size. If it's an interface or an abstract class, then this won't be possible. Perhaps the API gives you a "Clone" or "Copy" method you can call.</p>
