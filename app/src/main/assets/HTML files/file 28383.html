<p>This is the so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" rel="nofollow"><em>Singleton</em> design pattern</a>. Its distinguishing feature is that there can only ever be exactly one instance of that class and the pattern ensures that. The class has a private constructor and a statically-created instance that is returned with the <code>getInstance</code> method. You cannot create an instance from the outside and thus get the object only through said method.</p>

<p>Since <code>instance</code> is <code>static</code> in the <code>getInstance</code> method it will retain its value between multiple invocations. It is allocated and constructed somewhen before it's first used. E.g. in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/55548/73070">this answer</a> it seems like GCC initializes the static variable at the time the function is first used. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/58804/73070">This answer</a> has some excerpts from the C++ standard related to that.</p>
