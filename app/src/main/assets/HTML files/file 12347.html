<p>You are doing a POST, but why? You need to retrieve the XML contents, right? Then use GET and make sure you are doing the ajax query from the same domain.</p>

<p>If you can't change the domain, then you have to use a proxy php file which gets the wanted file's content for you, on the same domain, you doing the jquery ajax calls.</p>

<p>Also, you can check what's the exception if you specify the following arguments with errorMsg:</p>

<pre><code>function errorMsg(xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError)
{
    console.log(thrownError);
}
</code></pre>
