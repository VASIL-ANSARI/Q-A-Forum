<p>So I had a similar problem a few months ago while developing a framework designed for this sort of thing. Essentially, I gave up and instead had my parent window send a message to my child window (right after it was created), and that message contains the event source as part of the message (which is essentially a reference to the parent window). I then reply back to the window by doing postMessage on that object.</p>
