<p>Your example doesn't run, since <code>li</code> isn't defined, but if I understand what you're trying to do, and you don't care about the order of the list of numbers in each box, then this works - it's up to you if you think it's slicker or not.</p>

<pre><code>def sqrs(seq):
    indices = [(x % 3, x / 3) for x in range(0, 9)]  # Set up a list of coordinates
    boxes = [[seq[x*3+xx][y*3+yy] for xx, yy in indices] for x, y in indices]  # Use the list of coordinates both to reference the boxes and to reference the cells within the box, to reorganize the list.
    return boxes
</code></pre>
