<p>You probably want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search" rel="nofollow"><code>r.search()</code></a> to execute a regular expression search:</p>

<pre><code>for i in rez:
    if r.search(i[0]):
        count = 0
    else:
        count -= 1
</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of <code>i[0]</code> to get the first value from each tuple returned by the query.</p>

<p>Using <code>i == r</code> simply <em>compares</em> the tuple <code>i</code> (as returned by the query) to the compiled regular expression patter <code>r</code> and will never be true. It does not execute any of the search methods of the given pattern.</p>
