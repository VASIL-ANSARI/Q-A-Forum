<p>using <code>absmiddle</code> is not only a <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/divisions/students/dss/accessibility/web/webaim-12comm.html" rel="nofollow">common HTML mistake</a>, but is also considered bad practice when used this way, i.e. you should always separate styles from content, and use external stylesheets instead of inline styles embedded in the markup.</p>

<p>to solve this and achieve cross browser compatibility, replace the <code>align:absmiddle;</code> rule and use <code>vertical-align: middle;</code> instead.</p>
