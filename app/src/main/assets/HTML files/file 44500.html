<p>In JavaFX, there is no separate <code>LayoutManager</code> class. There is a set of predefined layout panes, subclassing <code>Pane</code>, which lay the child nodes out in different ways. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/layout/Pane.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Pane</code></a> class does no layout, so using it is the closest equivalent to using a <code>null</code> layout manager in Swing. Incidentally, this approach is not really recommended, either in Swing or in JavaFX.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/layout-tutorial/builtin_layouts.htm#JFXLY102" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> runs through the built-in layout panes. There is also a useful <a href="https://www.parleys.com/tutorial/interface-layout-javafx-2-0" rel="nofollow">presentation</a> (requires registration to Parleys) on general layout in JavaFX 2 and later.</p>
