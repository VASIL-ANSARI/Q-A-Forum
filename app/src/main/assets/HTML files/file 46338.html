<p>I'm pretty sure these are meant as jokes. I think it's unlikely that you'll find an Android device running on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Star" rel="nofollow">Death Star I</a>, mostly because the spaceship was blown up in the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/DS-1_Orbital_Battle_Station" rel="nofollow">Battle of Yavin</a>:</p>

<p>The <code>STANDARD_GRAVITY</code> value is the amount of gravity you'll find on Earth, which is a bit more useful. All of these can be used with the gravity sensor (<code>Sensor.TYPE_GRAVITY</code>): your sensor should pick up about <code>STANDARD_GRAVITY</code> worth of gravity in one direction.</p>

<p>For more about the gravity sensor, see <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion.html" rel="nofollow">the Android developer documentation</a>.
