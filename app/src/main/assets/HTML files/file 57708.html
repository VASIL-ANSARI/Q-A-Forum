<p>I'm not entirely certain what you're trying to accomplish, but perhaps something like below would help in the case that you are guaranteed that there is a ScoreDifference match for every result.</p>

<pre><code>select *
from (
    select *,
        DiffScore = HomeScore - AwayScore
    from Score) s
join ScoreReference sr
    on s.DiffScore = sr.ScoreDifference;
</code></pre>

<p>Could you, perhaps, provide a more concrete example with sample data set, etc?</p>
