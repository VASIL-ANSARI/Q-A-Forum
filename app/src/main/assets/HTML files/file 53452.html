<p>On notable difference between linux and windows are new lines. In linux the character for new lines is \n (line feed) in windows new lines are representd by two characters \r\n (carriage return and line feed). <br>Moreover regular expressions by default don't match on multiple lines and normally the new line character acts as the $ or end line matcher, this may be one of the reasons your regular expressions behaves differently in both operating systems.</p>
