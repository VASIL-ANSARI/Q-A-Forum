<p>From what I understand you need a functionality to filter and sort the data. You could make use of a build in mechanics for that purpose: <code>CollectionView</code>. You need to create one which source will be set to the data you get from database. </p>

<p>To filter the collection you can use the <code>collectionView.Filter</code> and define different filters for your purposes. For Sorting functionality you should make use of <code>collectionView.SortDescriptions</code>. This way you utilize the tools already present in .NET that you only need to customize for your needs. </p>

<p>With this approach, you don't remove anything from base collection, so you need to get the data only once and present it in different ways in your application. If you are using MVVM approach, this code should be done in the ViewModel. If you insist on achieving such functionality in your View, you could play with <code>&lt;CollectionViewSource&gt;</code>.</p>
