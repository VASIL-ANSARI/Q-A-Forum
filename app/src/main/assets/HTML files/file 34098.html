<p>You can use <a href="http://ilspy.net/" rel="nofollow">ILSpy</a>. Open up the DLL, choose any method to analyse and select <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wCF78.jpg" alt="enter image description here"> to analyse the method. A new window will open up, which shows you three categories (Uses, Used By and Overridden By). You can navigate through the hierarchy.

<p>If there are any free tools which can show the trace at runtime... I don't know. But I am currently using ANTS Performance Profiler which shows the trace (including performance details). </p>

<p>And finally there is this article on codeproject: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15410/Creating-a-Custom-NET-Profiler" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15410/Creating-a-Custom-NET-Profiler</a>
It shows how to build a "Custom .NET Profiler" and saves the trace in a textfile:</p>

<pre><code>System.IO.StringWriter.Write, id=70671928, call count = 622
  System.Text.StringBuilder.Append, id=21629200, call count = 635
    System.IntPtr.op_Inequality, id=21665400, call count = 717
    System.String.AppendInPlace, id=9670768, call count = 635
System.Configuration.XmlUtilWriter.AppendAttributeValue, id=73427152, call count = 14
  System.Xml.XmlTextReader.get_QuoteChar, id=70046432, call count = 14
    System.Xml.XmlTextReaderImpl.get_QuoteChar, id=70049120, call count = 14
</code></pre>
