<p>In general, Qt has (as far as I know) no built-in way to do this. You need a program that understands how to convert PDF content into (for example) post-script to send to a printer.</p>

<p>A quick Google search came up with a library called "<a href="http://poppler.freedesktop.org/" rel="nofollow">Poppler</a>" that can render PDF content onto, say, <code>QImage</code> instances, and then you could print those. </p>

<p>That said, if you are restricting yourself to linux, you could just create a <code>QProcess</code> and call something like:</p>

<pre><code>lp document.pdf
</code></pre>
