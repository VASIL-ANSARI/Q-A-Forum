<p>I'd look into using a WADL to document interacting with your API. Its not directly answering your question - because this isn't generated from source code documentation, its XML, and maintained separately. </p>

<p>It does answer this directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what GET and/or POST parameters the
  script will accept / require and of
  which type they are</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can place sample payloads in the document, along with URI params, accepted content-types, error codes/responses/payloads. I find it very valuable, and with a WADL, someone can code a client against your API.</p>
