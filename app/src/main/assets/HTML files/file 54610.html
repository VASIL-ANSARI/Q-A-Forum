<p>One way under Windows is to start developing cordova Apps with Visual Studio TACO (Tools for Apache Cordova). </p>

<p>Start by downloading the free Visual Studio 2015 Community <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs?sku=community&amp;clcid=0x407" rel="nofollow">here</a> and choose the "Cross Plattform Mobile Development" part to be installed. With that you have everything to start development.</p>

<p>Create a new cordova project in Visual Studio File->New Project and in the window choose on the left side Templates->Javascript->Apache Cordova Apps and give your first project a name and create it.</p>

<p>Now you have a "Hello World!" App which you can run on different plattforms.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/get-started-first-mobile-app/" rel="nofollow">link</a> will show you how to enhance your first App.</p>

<p>For sure you do not need Visual Studio and you can just install plain cordova <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I found VS very helpful.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
