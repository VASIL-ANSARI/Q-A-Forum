<p>Like many learners, you are using the wrong tool, simply because you don't know the proper one.</p>

<p>You need not a multiquery (which you never actually need anyway) but a <strong>JOIN</strong>.</p>

<p>Simply rewrite your two monster queries to a join like this</p>

<pre><code>$searchquery="SELECT l.*, u.`user-username`, u.`user-firstname`, u.`user-lastname`
FROM `listing-details` l, user u
WHERE l.`user-username`=u.`user-username`
AND `listing-address` LIKE ...";
</code></pre>

<p>Besides, your quoting is wrong. </p>
