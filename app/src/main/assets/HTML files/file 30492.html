<p>The unsatisfied link error is telling you, that there was no library with such a name found.
See here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18625948/opencv-java-unsatisfiedlinkerror">OpenCV + Java = UnsatisfiedLinkError</a>.</p>

<p>On a side note, you really shouldn't be using code inside JSPs. Create a Servlet that does what you want with the image, add it's path/URL as an attribute <code>request.setAttribute("key", "value")</code>. </p>

<p>Use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/index.html?javax/servlet/RequestDispatcher.html" rel="nofollow">RequestDispatcher</a>:</p>

<p><code>getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/path/to/page.jsp").forward(request, response)</code></p>

<p>to forward the request and response to the JSP. You can then reference it there with <code>${key}</code>.</p>
