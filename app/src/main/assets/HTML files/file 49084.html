<p>The mqclient.ini and JMSconfig files are used setting attributes like what client side exits to use, TCP level overrides etc. They are basically used for configuring the client libraries/jars. They are not meant for application configuration for example what queue manager or queue to use. This sort of info, connection factory or destination info, is typically pulled from a JNDI so that the configuration can be modified without affecting application. </p>
