<p>py-serial is the port for python2.4 for later versions of python use the numbered version e.g. </p>

<pre><code>sudo port install py27-serial
</code></pre>

<p>It is an historical error - originally they thought they should just have one  version of python packages then it was realised that you could have multiple versions of python and that many packages are version dependant.</p>
