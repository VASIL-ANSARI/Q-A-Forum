<p>The short answer is: no. The CLI command does not expose all attributes of Spring Initializr (it never did). I am not sure if it's an oversight or if we were waiting for someone to complain about it.</p>

<p>Either way, there's nothing wrong adding support for the other attributes, I've created <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2793" rel="nofollow">#2793</a> for you. </p>

<p>As for the spelling, this is on purpose to align with the CLI parameter style of other commands.</p>
