<p>I first just got this to work by manually adding:</p>

<p><code>config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)</code></p>

<p>to production.rb but that obscured the real issue...</p>

<p><code>RACK_ENV</code> and <code>RAILS_ENV</code> were both set to <code>staging</code> while I had the gem loading in the <code>:production</code> set... So although Heroku told me it was using the <code>rails_12factor</code> gem when the instance started, it wasn't really (I assumed it wouldn't be listed there if it wasn't a production environment, wrong assumption!) </p>

<p><code>staging.rb</code> was loading <code>production.rb</code> which is why setting STDOUT there worked, thus confusing the issue further.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies, and hope this helps someone else in future - go check your config variables and/or change where the gem is being loaded! :)</p>
