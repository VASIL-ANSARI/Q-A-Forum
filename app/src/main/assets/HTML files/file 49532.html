<p>I checked the computers having the problem and I got this in the console:</p>

<pre><code>reference error $ is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>I found out that <code>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>  is being blocked by Firefox. When I'm trying to load Google CDN in a New Tab in FF, it says <code>"This Connection is Untrusted"</code> and <code>"I Understand the Risk"</code> option is not available.</p>

<p>So I therefore conclude it's not the browser version having issue nor jQuery code, it's the browser blocking jQuery Google CDN. I'll try if this page helps <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/connection-untrusted-error-message" rel="nofollow">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/connection-untrusted-error-message</a>.</p>
