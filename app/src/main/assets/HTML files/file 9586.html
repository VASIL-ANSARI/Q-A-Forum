<p>I think you should be able to do this in two different methods.  First replace the text "images/" to your dynamic URL on the server side before you assign the email HTML to the container.  It should be straight forward whatever language you are using.</p>

<p>If that is not possible then you can do that on client side with JQuery.  The code below loops through all the img tags on the page and replaces to a path you specify.  This does not actually change the source code but it renders the images with the new path.  </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $("img").each(function(i) {
        $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('src').replace('old_path', 'new_Path'));
    });
});
</code></pre>
