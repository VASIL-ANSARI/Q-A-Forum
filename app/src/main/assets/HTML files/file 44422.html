<p>It could be due to trying to run an older version of Python 2.7.x (like 2.7.6) on newer releases of OS X.  If you are on OS X 10.10, that's very likely the problem.  See <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue21811" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.python.org/issue21811</a>.  You may need to add at least the patch for <code>_osx_support.py</code>.  If not, try running <code>pip</code> with <code>-v</code> and update your question with the results.</p>

<p>Update: With the additional information you supplied, it is clear that you are running into the OS X 10.10 support issues that were fixed in the changes for Issue21811 released in 2.7.8.  In particular, the <code>configure</code> changes are needed to correctly parse the two-digit minor version number (<code>10</code>); otherwise, the code in <code>configure</code> mistakenly thinks you are are running on a very old version of OS X and generates obsolete link directives.  You should backport <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/2672e30d9095" rel="nofollow">https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/2672e30d9095</a> and <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/a7ab09e00dbc" rel="nofollow">https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/a7ab09e00dbc</a>.</p>
