<p>From the comments on the question, it looks like your django model and database schema are out of sync. If you can, just delete the database and recreate. If you have important data in there...</p>

<p><strong>First make a backup of your production database</strong></p>

<p>Depending on which version of django you're using, database synchronisation behaves differently.</p>

<h3>Django &lt;= 1.6</h3>

<p>The <code>python manage.py syncdb</code> command can be used to add any missing schema information to your database. If your problem stems from the fact that you've added new tables or fields to your model / that constraints have been deleted, this might fix the schema.</p>

<p>It will not remove any old fields or migrate any data, so there's a good chance you'll need to do some manual editing afterwards.</p>

<h3>Django >= 1.7</h3>

<p>1.7 introduced the new <code>python manage.py migrate</code> (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/" rel="nofollow">Docs</a>) command which is more intelligent. As your model changes, migrations are created. When an old database needs to be brought inline with a new model, the migrations are applied to the database.</p>

<p>This is far more flexible and allows database versions to be upgraded/downgraded as required.</p>

<p>The downside is that you need to have made migrations as you go (or create them manually afterwards). See the documentation for more information</p>

<p>In either case, if the model is too far out of sync or you don't have the appropriate migrations, you're going to need to do some manual work to get the data into the state required by django.</p>
