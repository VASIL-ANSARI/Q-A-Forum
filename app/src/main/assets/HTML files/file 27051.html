<p>I've been thinking about this; probably the best way to do it would be to manually add the <code>preferredFontForTextStyle:</code> method onto the <code>UIFont</code> class at runtime if the app is running on iOS 6, and then dynamically pick an appropriate system font size there. The UI7Kit project on github does something like this for other methods, but not this one unfortunately.</p>
