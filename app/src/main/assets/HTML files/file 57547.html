<p><code>android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED</code> is send, as its name suggest, after, but <strong>only</strong> after a device boot time. Are you restarting your device?</p>

<p>Instead of restarting device to test out your application, you can send system broadcasts directly through adb:</p>

<pre><code>./adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED -c android.intent.category.HOME -n &lt;your.package.name&gt;/.&lt;YourReceiverClass&gt;
</code></pre>
