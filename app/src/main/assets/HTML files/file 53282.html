<p>I'm not aware of any way to do that strictly with selenium. You'll have to use another library, maybe <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" rel="nofollow">BeautifulSoup</a>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code># use selenium to get the html
html = driver.page_source

# pass it to beautifulsoup
td = soup.find("td")
# extract the elements you don't want
b = td.find("b")
b.extract()
sc = td.find("script")
sc.extract()
# print just the number
print td.text.strip()
</code></pre>
