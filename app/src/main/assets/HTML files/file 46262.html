<p>First of all, a cosine of 180 degrees should be equal to <code>-1</code>, so the result you got is right.</p>

<p>Secondly, you sometimes can't get <em>exact</em> values when using <code>sin/cos/tan</code> etc functions as you always get <em>results that are the closest to the correct ones</em>. In your case, the value you got from <code>sin</code> is the closest to zero.</p>

<p>The value of <code>sin(PI)</code> that you got differs from zero only in the <em>9th</em> (!) digit after the floating point. <code>3.5897934739308216e-009</code> is almost equal to <code>0.000000004</code> and that's almost equal to zero.</p>
