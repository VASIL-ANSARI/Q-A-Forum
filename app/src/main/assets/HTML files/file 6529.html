<p>It sounds like the Silverlight xap file isn't being updated correctly in the ClientBin folder of your web site.</p>

<p>As a work around you could try deleting it before rebuilding and checking that your edits are indeed compiling.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of that might prevent the xap file being updated is that it's still in use by the web service, but the message (as translated by Google so it's not 100% accurate) reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Build started: Project: papa_images, Configuration: Debug Any CPU ------ papa_images -> C: \ extharddrive \ documents \ workspace \ papa_images \ papa_images \ Bin \ Debug \ papa_images.dll generate the application manifest, there were no changes identified start.<br>
  The application manifest file is up to date
  Xap packaging, it does not start to change were identified.<br>
  The XAP package can be created on the date the test page.<br>
  The test page was successfully created.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which implies that there were no problems in that area.</p>
