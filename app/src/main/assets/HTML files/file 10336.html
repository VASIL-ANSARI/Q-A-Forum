<p>Within any Java EE application, there are likely multiple applications all running within the same JVM.  There is only one <code>System.out</code>.  If several applications are trying to write to <code>System.out</code> at the same time, it can cause contention on the output, and could theoretically impact performance.</p>

<p>Additionally, while not necessarily performance related, it makes the output very messy and difficult to read - especially if multiple applications are writing output at the same time, without any indication as to which application the output is coming from.  (The same for multiple concurrent requests within even the same application.)</p>

<p>As you mentioned, using a proper logging framework will eliminate both these issues.</p>
