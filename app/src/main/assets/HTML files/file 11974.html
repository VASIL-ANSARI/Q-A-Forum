<p>Well, I had the opportunity to test a iPad 2 and using the TextInput with skin spark.skins.mobile.TextInputSkin, the events of flex works but does not open the keypad in iOS and with skin (stagetext new skin), keypad open in iOS (and with native access to spell check, etc ...) but do not run flex events. Since we do not need both situations simultaneously works (which fortunately it's my case for now).</p>
