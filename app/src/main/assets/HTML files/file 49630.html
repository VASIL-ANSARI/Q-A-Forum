<p>Personal opinion - but a class in a model as described above should represent a 'thing', be it a Student, a Module, or a Relationship between the two.  </p>

<p>If you were to use Entity Framework for example to interact with the database from code then this is how the database would be represented, a collection of three classes, one for each of the tables you have described.</p>
