<p>You need to initially set <code>conv</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>long conv = ~0;
</code></pre>

<p>As far as it running perfectly on one machine and not at all on another, you just got lucky.  <code>conv</code> does have a value, even if you don't explicitly set it.  On one machine, it was <code>0</code> and on the other it was something other than <code>0</code>, hence the different behavior.</p>

<p>Another method would be to use a <code>do while</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>do
{
    ...
}
while(conv != 0);
</code></pre>
