<p>The reason for the <code>JSONException</code> is that the <code>reponse</code> you get from the server can't be parsed and a <code>JSONObject</code> couldn't be created.</p>

<p>By the looks of it, I would suggest that it's because of the HTML tags that are found in the <code>response</code>. This might be because you might be using <code>echo</code> to print out some message and this is being sent in the <code>response</code>. For more info read this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26870860/error-parsing-data-org-json-jsonexception-value-br-of-type-java-lang-string-ca">Error parsing data org.json.JSONException: Value &lt;br of type java.lang.String cannot be converted to JSONObject</a></p>

<p>In any case, you need to make sure the <code>response</code> from the server could be parsed to create a <code>JSONObject</code>.</p>
