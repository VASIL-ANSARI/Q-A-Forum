<p>you say that you follow tutorial. So have you done these steps?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the basic collection view classes implemented and associated with the storyboard objects, it is now time to design the cell. This is, quite simply, a matter of dragging and dropping items from the object library onto the prototype cell in the storyboard view. Additionally the size of the cell may be modified by selecting it and using the resulting resize handles. The exact design of the cell is entirely dependent on what is to be displayed. For the purposes of this example, however, each cell is simply going to display an image.</p>

<p>Because you are creating a new label in the code, when it should be already available in prototype cell. You only have to assign cell.cellLabel.text = @"bla bla"; </p>

<pre><code>UILabel *label = [[UILabel alloc] init];
label.text = @"whatever";
cell.cellLabel = label;
</code></pre>
