<p>Assuming send_keys is being sent to the proper element, it loos like the upload_image_first variable is an absolute path.  When you send_keys, you are concatenating the current path to that absolute path.</p>

<p>So, if you run this program from /home/emin, you would send_keys to /home/emin/home/emin/Desktop/test/me.jpg</p>
