<p>I added now a CompassMapActivity.java sample to the <a href="https://github.com/nutiteq/hellomap3d/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nutiteq/hellomap3d/</a> AdvancedMap3D project. It rotates map based on compass, sets GPS location and adds a second person view 3D model. It is using Google sample OrientationManager code for compass reading smoothing, with raw data you will get very unstable picture.</p>

<p>We use it in Google Glass app, and it looks quite cool.</p>
