<p>Try this</p>

<pre><code>lock(obj1)
{
   lock(obj2)
   {
        // here you have lock on obj1 and obj2
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>lock accepts only one argument. Example above will lock two items in scope of second lock.</p>

<p>Maybe it's providing answer to question, but:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Locking here doesn't mean that for duration of the lock no other code
  on other thread can access or modify the object. If you lock an object
  any other thread can modify the object at the same time. What lock
  code block allows you to do is to make the code inside the lock block
  to be single entry i.e only one thread can execute the lock code block
  once and other threads who tries to execute the same code block will
  have to wait till the owner thread is done with executing the code
  block. So basically you really don't need to lock 2 or more objects in
  usual cases. By locking your purpose is to make the code block single
  entry</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, as other mentioned this solution is useless, better is creating new object desired for locking.</p>
