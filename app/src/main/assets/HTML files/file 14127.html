<p>Xpath sounds like what your looking for. It allows for searches to be made within any level of an XML directory.</p>

<p>The following example looks multiple levels deep with an xml directory and checks if the description node contains whatever is held within <code>$txtSearch</code></p>

<pre><code>$holidayDoc = simplexml_load_file($url);    
$qry = "//channel/item[description[contains(text(),\"$txtSearch\")]]";
$holidayDoc-&gt;xpath($qry);
</code></pre>

<p>Results can then be iterated through using a foreach loop</p>
