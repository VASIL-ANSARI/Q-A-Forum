<p>How sure are you that calling a member function via a pointer is slower than just calling it directly? Can you measure the difference?</p>

<p>In general, you should not rely on your intuition when making performance evaluations. Sit down with your compiler and a timing function, and actually <em>measure</em> the different choices. You may be surprised!</p>

<p>More info: There is an excellent article <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/FastDelegate.aspx" rel="nofollow">Member Function Pointers and the Fastest Possible C++ Delegates</a> which goes into very deep detail about the implementation of member function pointers.</p>
