<p>not sure if I am understanding it correctly, so this is what I think you want to do: </p>

<p>you have a Matrix X * Y that has blocked ways. You don't care how, but you want to know if a way from place A to place B exists, that leads you through the matrix touching each tile exactly ones? Sorry if that's obvious but I wanted to repeat it because I first read it as "Iterate through the matrix ones and give me any path".</p>

<p>To me this sounds like a backtracking algorithm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking</a></p>

<p>You start at Position X (say top left) and then make a step. Your accept method then checks: </p>

<p>(a) Is this tile blocked? 
 (b) Have I already been here? </p>

<p>If both of those conditions return false, you step on that tile and mark it as "stepped on". If you're answer to either of those questions is "yes", you try a different tile. If no tile is left, you step to the previous tile. If you arrive at your destination, you have found a path and you can print it. If you backtrack to your origin and have no more steps, there is no possible way. </p>
