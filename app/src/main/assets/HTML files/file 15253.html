<blockquote>
  <p>In the Java file how are ImageButtons declared?</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>ImageButton ib = findByViewId(R.id.yourImageButtonId);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>the textView is not visible over the button i.e it gets half hidden
  behind the button. What is the solution for this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can set Text to a button no need to put a textview over it. </p>

<p>Also you can give a simple button a <code>android:drawableOnTop</code> attribute,
the given recource appears on top.</p>

<p>To your other problem:</p>

<p>Check line 33 in your onCreate() method. Post it if you cant find the NullPointer on your own. </p>
