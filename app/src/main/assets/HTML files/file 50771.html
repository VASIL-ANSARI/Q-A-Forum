<p>CouchDb is a document-oriented NoSQL database. </p>

<p>Entity Framework (EF) is an <strong>object-relational mapper</strong> to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It is meant to be used with Relational databases.</p>

<p>As CouchDb uses HTTP as its transport protocol and it is REST based, you could easily interact with it using any HTTP enabled client. Try using MyCouch which is a simple async, open sourced, CoucDb client written in C#. It builds on top of the async HttpClient and lets you work with native JSON and/or entities/POCOs.</p>
