<p>This is also a use-case for the Executors framework, specifically <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html#scheduleAtFixedRate%28java.lang.Runnable,%20long,%20long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit%29" rel="nofollow">scheduleAtFixedRate</a>. Just watch out for that thread hanging around when the app is done. You can use a custom <code>ThreadFactory</code> that makes daemon-threads. Or, if you want something simpler, use the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/Timer.html" rel="nofollow">Timer</a> API. You can construct a <code>Timer</code> with a boolean argument meaning "use daemon thread". You can also shut down the executor service explicitly when your application is ending.</p>
