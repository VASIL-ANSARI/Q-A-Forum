<p>The earliest you can begin to load your data is in the init method. But to be honest most of the time they get called so quickly after eachother you probably wont even notice the difference. But if you were interested, just wack it in here: </p>

<pre><code>- (id)init
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self) 
    {
        [self loadcategoryData];
    }
    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also I don't know how much data your downloading, but if you are loading a long list and it is taking a long time then maybe you should consider doing "paging" (i.e. only downloading a sub section of the data and then requesting more as the user scrolls down the page.</p>
