<p>Here is a quick one</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    words = str(input("Input Sentence:")).split()
    for word in words:
        print(word[1:] + word[0] + "ay", end = " ")
    print ()

main()
</code></pre>

<p>A better solution would probably use list comprehension so you could actually use the output, but this does what you asked.</p>

<p>EDIT:
This works for python3.x
If you want it to work for python2 you are going to have a bit more fun. Just add the strings together for each word, then print the result string.</p>
