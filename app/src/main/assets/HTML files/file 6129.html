<p>Is there any way for you to modify your data to turn these strings into booleans? Using strings in this way strikes me as a code smell. Personally, I would turn these strings into boolean properties of the class you're using as the data source for your grid and modify their visibility properties in the markup, rather than go back to the database to select these properties on a row-by-row basis.</p>

<p>Regardless of that, yes, you can use the RowDataBound event like this:</p>

<pre><code>yourGrid_RowDataBound(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow)
    {
        YourClass currentClass = (YourClass) e.Row.DataItem;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; currentClass.stringFlags.Length; i++)
        {
            string currentFlag = currentClass.stringFlags[i];

            if (currentFlag == "Tax")
            {
                Image imgTax = (Image) e.Row.FindControl("imgTax");
                imgTax.Visbile = true;
            }
            else if (currentFlag == "Compliance")
            {
                Image imgCompliance = (Image) e.Row.FindControl("imgCompliance");
                imgCompliance.Visbile = true;
            }
            else if (currentFlag == "Accounting")
            {
                Image imgAccounting = (Image) e.Row.FindControl("imgAccounting");
                imgAccounting.Visbile = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
