<p>When one needs a geometry library for Java <a href="http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm" rel="nofollow">JTS</a> should be mentioned at first. And of course <a href="https://github.com/mapfish/java-geojson" rel="nofollow">Java-GeoJSon</a> to load the data. The latter library is built upon JTS, so you even don't need any special adapters between two libraries.</p>
