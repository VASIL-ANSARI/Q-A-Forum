<p>I guess you are referring to <code>analytic_Index</code>. Everytime your windows (or inspector) is closed, all non serialized properties will be lost. <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2012/10/25/unity-serialization/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> an exhaustive description of how serialization works in <code>Unity</code>.</p>

<p>In a few words, for what concern your specific case. Every member variable of <code>Editor</code> class (or <code>EditorWindow</code>) won't be serialized, so it will be lost when the window is closed (or switching to play mode). Generally the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/SerializedProperty.html" rel="nofollow">SerializedProperties</a> belong to a particular asset (<code>MonoBehavior</code>, <code>ScriptableObject</code>,..), so you can put such a value on the particular asset you are visualizing through your <code>EditorWindow</code> (or <code>Editor</code>).</p>
