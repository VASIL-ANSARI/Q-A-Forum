<p><code>unique_ptr</code> forces you to be explicit about transferring ownership, so it is visible and clear in the code. With <code>auto_ptr</code> it is too easy to get silent transfers of ownership and when reading the code it's not always clear whether ownership is transferred, and if it is, whether it was intended by the author of the code or is a bug!  When you see a <code>unique_ptr</code> used with <code>std::move</code> it is obvious that the intention is to transfer ownership.</p>

<p><code>unique_ptr</code> properly supports move semantics, so it only allows ownership transfer from temporaries and moved objects (i.e. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category">rvalues</a>). Containers can detect if a type is "move aware" and act appropriately.  <code>auto_ptr</code> does not know about move semantics, and will transfer ownership from lvalues or rvalues, so containers <em>think</em> it's a normal copyable object, but it doesn't behave like one because it modifies its source when copying.</p>

<p><code>auto_ptr</code> was useful when used carefully, but it was too easy to misuse it and write dangerous code. It is time for it to die. <code>unique_ptr</code> supports everything <code>auto_ptr</code> can do, but is safe by default (you have to try harder to use it wrong) and also has extra features like custom deleters and array support.</p>
