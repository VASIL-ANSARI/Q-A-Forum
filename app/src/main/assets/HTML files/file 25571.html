<p>The <code>Fetch</code> construct only works on properties that map relationships between objects, so properties that are mapped with "References", "Many-To-One" or "Many-To-Many".</p>

<p>This is why it works as expected with the <code>User</code> property but not against the string <code>Content</code> property.</p>

<p>After further investigation I don't think you can achieve what you want using LINQ syntax but it should be possible using an equivalent <code>HQL</code> statement using the <code>fetch all properties</code> hint:</p>

<pre><code>session.CreateQuery("from Article fetch all properties")
</code></pre>
