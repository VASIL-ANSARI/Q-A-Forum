<p>Your code works asynchron. That is why you add an anonymous function to retrieve the data.</p>

<p>The <code>console.log</code> is called right after the request but before the response is there. So <code>$scope.playlists</code> is empty.</p>

<p>You have to put the <code>console.log</code> inside the success callback to see the result.</p>
