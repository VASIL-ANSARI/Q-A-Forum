<p>we know that if a method returns a boolean, it cannot return null.  I suspect that instead you should interpret this as "Assertion failed, and the message is: null".  Try instead calling the version of <code>assertFalse</code> which takes a message:</p>

<pre><code>assertFalse("didn't expect x to be in network", fb.existsInNetwork(x))
</code></pre>
