<p>glReadPixels reads from the default framebuffer (GL_BACK for dbl buffering), yes.
To read a texture, you may want to use FBO w/ attached texture colorbuffer.
Then set the FBO active and you can use glReadPixels.
Since FBO is pretty complicated to tame and you are using JOGL, 
I link you to an <a href="http://jogamp.org/git/?p=jogl.git;a=blob;f=src/test/com/jogamp/opengl/test/junit/jogl/acore/TestFBOOnThreadSharedContext1DemoES2NEWT.java;hb=HEAD">offscreen unit test</a> which uses GLFBODrawable/FBObject
internally and uses glReadPixels to perform the snapshot.
Ofc .. you would need to walk a bit through the code and it's new API.</p>
