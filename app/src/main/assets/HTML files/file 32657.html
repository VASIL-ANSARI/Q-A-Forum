<p>Hmm, tough one to solve in a secure fashion. Basically I don't trust desktop apps ;-)</p>

<p>You might be looking for some sort of federation. Basically it is about letting your Identity Server trust the 3rd party (by means of signature). Your Identity Server would then use a SAML token from 3rd party as login information and generate a new SAML token (signed by you) to forward to the the MVC web application. I think Dominick has a video or two about it, but not sure it meets your requirements. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/thinktecture/Thinktecture.IdentityServer.v2/wiki" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/thinktecture/Thinktecture.IdentityServer.v2/wiki</a></p>

<p>The Java desktop app probably cannot create a signed SAML token, so you could consider using "something else". Preferably something signed from where they logged in the first time.</p>

<p>You should avoid having your web app trust anyone but your own Identity Server / Identity Provider.</p>

<p>Hope this helps? Happy to help where I can :-)</p>
