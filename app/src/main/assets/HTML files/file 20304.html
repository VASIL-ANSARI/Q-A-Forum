<p>I would say if Responsibilities of A and B are totally different the create separate classes for both of them and let the child implement what they want this way some child want only A or only B or both and it keeps it manageable and maintainable </p>

<pre><code>// Base class.
class Base
{
public:
    // For responsibility A
**Goes to class A**
    virtual void A1();
    virtual void A2();
    ...


**//Goes to class B**
    // For responsibility B
    virtual void B1();
    virtual void B2();
    ...

    // More responsibilites.
    ...
};

// Derived class 1.
class Derived_1 : public Base **//inherits from A**
{...}; 

class Derived_2:Public A,Public B
</code></pre>
