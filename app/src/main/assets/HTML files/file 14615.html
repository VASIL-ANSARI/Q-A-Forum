<p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>Specifically, you can <em>not</em> do that if the parent element does not have a fixed height. Think about it: if an element could have a height equal to a percentage of its parent's height, then the parent's height would need to be calculated first. But to calculate the parent's height, you need first to calculate the height of its children. But before you calculate the height of this child, you need to calculate the parent's height. You see where this is going.</p>

<p>If the parent <em>does</em> have a fixed height then percentage heights on children are fine.</p>

<p>If the parent does <em>not</em> have a fixed height and you set a percentage height to a child the browser will simply give up and treat the child as having <code>height: auto</code>.</p>
