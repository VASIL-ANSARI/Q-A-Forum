<p>I answer myself. It is possible to turn off the device, but the application has to implement the device administrator feature via API: <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html" rel="nofollow">Device Administration</a></p>

<p>In this API there is a <code>locknow()</code> function that do what I want.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is for extending the android hardware and security features and it is very unlikely that anyone wants to control the device in that way.</p>

<p>What I wanted is the ability to lock the device from a simple gesture. As I dont want to make my own device manager class I check if the free application "lockScreen" is installed and launch it. It is a shortcut and an easy way to do what I want. This app must be register as device manager so it has implemented this class. It is possible to get it free from the market.</p>
