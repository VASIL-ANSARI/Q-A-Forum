<p>Setting a cronjob up is the most straightforward way to achieve that, because you're basically trying to schedule the data output from the .php file to an index.html file.</p>

<p>Another variation would be to output your index as a .php file and not an .html one, using something like memcache, Redis or even phpFastCache with an expiration time of one hour for the csv data.</p>

<p>Other than that, I see no direct solution for it.</p>
