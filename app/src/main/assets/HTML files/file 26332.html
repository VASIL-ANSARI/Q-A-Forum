<p>Instead of having an async constructor (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8145479/can-constructors-be-async">which is not possible with .NET, anyway</a> (thanks Servy) (and I don't think any other framework that allows for that is a sane framework, if such a thing exists)), you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Construct your object in such a way that you don't depend on that Javascript call;</li>
<li>Call whatever logic you need that will be done past .NET boundaries, and when the Javascript is done and responds...</li>
<li>... Call some <code>initialize()</code> method (name it like that or something similar).</li>
</ul>

<p>You could have a flag in each instance telling whether is has already passed through the post-Javascript initialization, and some logic in your class so that its instances can only be considered to be in a valid, ready, usable state after that initialization step. Good luck and happy coding :)</p>
