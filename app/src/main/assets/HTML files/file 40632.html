<p>before every connection and statements you need to close any privious connection and statement
because <strong>sqlite</strong> does not support more than one active transactions, so before the first <strong>con1.prepareStatement</strong> (in the while loop ) in your code, close other previous connections and statements also, I mean <strong>pst</strong>, <strong>con</strong>, etc</p>
