<p>Ok, after copying your XML code for just the EditText (with id phoneum_code), I've tested changing the line</p>

<pre><code>android:hint="@string/prompt_code" 
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>android:text="@string/prompt_code"
</code></pre>

<p>It worked with any text I entered in the prompt_code string, for both hint and text.</p>

<p>I have the feeling you're setting the text in this particular EditText to an empty string somewhere in your code, which overwrites any value that was declared in your XML.</p>

<p>You want to check the code that uses this EditText and verify if it's not calling <code>setText("");</code> on the edittext object at some point.</p>
