<p><code>##</code> is used to bodge two tokens together to make a single token. So something like <code>func##1</code> would expand to the single token <code>func1</code>.</p>

<p>Using it here, it tries to bodge together <code>::</code> and <code>Foo</code> to make a single token <code>::Foo</code>. As the error says, that's not a valid token. You don't want a single token here; you just want to keep the two tokens separate:</p>
