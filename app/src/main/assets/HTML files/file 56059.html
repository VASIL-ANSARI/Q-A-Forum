<p>I'm not 100 percent sure that it is a bad idea to just READ value from UIKit on a background thread, however if it is so indeed, maybe it would be reasonable to use good old <code>dispatch_sync</code> function?</p>

<pre><code>__block BOOL appStateIsInForeground = YES;

dispatch_sync(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{

    if ([[UIApplication sharedApplication] applicationState] == UIApplicationStateActive) appStateIsInForeground = YES;
    else appStateIsInForeground = NO;
});
</code></pre>
