<p>Without more details it's tough to say what's wrong specificaly. However, I can say from personal experience that when I first had to implement fragment tabs, I went through a lot of lousy tutorials before finding something that worked. The tutorial that finally made sense for me is here:

<p>As a bonus, there's also some Github source code:
