<p>Hmm ... this works for me to capture the image:</p>

<pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE);
activity.startActivityForResult(intent, AbstractActivity.CAPTURE_IMAGE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE);
</code></pre>

<p>when the user takes the picture, it asks whether the user wants to accept this image, and then it goes back to my activity where I ...</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    if (requestCode == CAPTURE_IMAGE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE) {
        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
            handleAvatarUpload(data); // which uses Uri selectedImage = data.getData();
        } 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't received any crash reports with this code and it's been out in the wild for a few months. our userbase is in line with other apps in our category with android 2.3.3 at around 71% of users, 2.2 at 16.35%, and 2.1 at 5.7%</p>
