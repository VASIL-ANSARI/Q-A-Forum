<p>I am not able to give you a 100% certain answer, both because it's a bit subjective and also because I am not able to actually see your app (print screens would be nice). But, in my opinion a <code>UIScrollView</code> would be a good answer. Another option is to animate your <code>UITextField</code>, so it can go "up" when the keyboard comes.</p>
