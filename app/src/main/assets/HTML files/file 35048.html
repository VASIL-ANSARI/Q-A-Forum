<p>Besides inefficiency of the method you chooses, could you also look if the variables you attempt to update to actually not conflicting with database indexes or primary/foreign keys in database?
If you attempt to pass empty string into fields which set as not null it will abort procedure. </p>

<p>For example field tipoPe = request.Form("tipo") or email = request.Form("email") could be a mandatory in your table or set as unique. I do not see any validation for that...</p>

<p>Best solution would be use of a store procedure which would return you a string in case of failure or successes.
And also what are you attempt to validate her:</p>

<pre><code> senha_S = request.form("senha")
 senha_C = request.form("confsenha")
 senha =  request.form("confsenha")

 if **senha1** &amp; "" &lt;&gt; "" or **senha2** &amp; "" &lt;&gt; "" then
    if senha_S &lt;&gt; senha_C then
</code></pre>

<p>where does  <strong>senha1</strong> and <strong>senha2</strong> comes from?
For password verification following would be more then sufficient:</p>

<pre><code> if senha_S &lt;&gt; senha_C and len(senha_S)&lt;8 then
</code></pre>

<p>using len(senha_S)&lt;8 you also enforcing minimal lenght of the password.
Also I would recommend following changes in your redirect:</p>

<pre><code> response.redirect "Registro.asp?msg='A Senha e a ConfirmaÃ§Ã£o de Senha nÃ£o sÃ£o iguais. Por favor, preencha novamente!'"
</code></pre>

<p>otherwise you may on your redirect page get only small portion of your message, like only first letter A.</p>
