<p>You need to use Ajax in order to communicate between your client (JavaScript) and your server (PhP). Ajax is based on the XmlHttpRequest object and offers the possibility to send and receive data to/from a server without refreshing the page.</p>

<p>It can carry several types of data such as XML but also HTML, raw text, or JSON. To send data to your server in your case you just need to call your PhP page with a parameter in the GET/POST method.</p>
