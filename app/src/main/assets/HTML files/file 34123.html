<p>Looking at your fiddle, there are mainly 4 tags. i.e.
"title" , "link" , "ul" , "script". That's why you need to use index as 3, since the script tag contains the variable name and value.
Try this and it would work. </p>

<pre><code>$('#variableHere').text(data2[3].innerText);
</code></pre>

<p>it will return you following o/p: <strong>var gVariable = 0; gVariable = 5</strong>
Now you can use regex/substring function to extract the vairable name and value..</p>
