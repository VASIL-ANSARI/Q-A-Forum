<p>Usually your Ad-hoc build settings will specify an Entitlements.plist file which disables debugging via the <code>get-task-allow</code> setting. This is to stop your users from being able to debug/inspect memory etc. while they are testing your app. If the app works with your Debug build then this is the most likely explanation.</p>
