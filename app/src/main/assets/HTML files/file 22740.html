<p>You need to list all of your fields (don't use '*').</p>

<p>Then use the SUM() function on what you want summed.</p>

<p>Then, everything beyond the ProjectFeeAmount field will either need to be excluded from your list, or aggregated somehow (sum, min, max, etc.).</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
   Contract,
   Sum(PAContNumber) as SumOfPAContNumber,
   ProjectManagerID,
   ...
FROM
   ...
GROUP BY
   Contract,
   ProjectManagerID,
   ...
</code></pre>
