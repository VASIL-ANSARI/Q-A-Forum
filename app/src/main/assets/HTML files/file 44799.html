<p>I would guess the main problem is you have whitespace in your comma-separated string.</p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>$parseLocations = "sioux city_ia, alabaster_al, boise_id, atlanta_ga";
</code></pre>

<p>will <code>explode()</code> to this:</p>

<pre><code>array("sioux city_ia", " alabaster_al"," boise_id", " atlanta_ga")
</code></pre>

<p>Note the space at the beginning of all but the first item in the array.</p>

<p>If you just do this:</p>

<pre><code>$parseLocations = "sioux city_ia,alabaster_al,boise_id,atlanta_ga";
</code></pre>

<p>You should get the array values you expect.</p>

<p>Now that being said, I don't know why, if you are hardcoding the city/state values to begin with, that you wouldn't just hard code into a usable array like:</p>

<pre><code>$locations = array(
    array('city' =&gt; 'some value', 'state' =&gt; 'some other value'),
    ...
);
</code></pre>

<p>and save yourself all the exploding and other string manipulations to get to a workable data structure.</p>
