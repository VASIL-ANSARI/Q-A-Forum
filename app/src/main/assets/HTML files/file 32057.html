<p><code>os.rename()</code> change the path of the file but doesn't move its actual data on the disk.
this is why you can't move (rename) it from one drive to another.</p>

<p>moving between drives is actually copy it first, and then delete the source file.
you can use <code>shutil.move()</code> method which do it when you trying to transfer files between two drives</p>

<pre><code>import shutil
shutil.move(src,dest)
</code></pre>
