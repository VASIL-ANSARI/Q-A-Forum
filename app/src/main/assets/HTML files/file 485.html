<p>You might try launching a modal from JavaScript using the JavaScript integration (see <a href="http://www.raditha.com/java/mayscript.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.raditha.com/java/mayscript.php</a> for an example). </p>

<p>The JavaScript you would need would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>function getPassword() {
  return prompt("Enter Password");
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the Java would be:</p>

<pre><code>password = jso.call("getPassword", new String[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately that means giving up all hope of having a nice looking modal. Good luck!</p>
