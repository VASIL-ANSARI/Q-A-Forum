<p>After struggling for almost one month I have been able to solve my problem.
The problem was with <code>Cacert.pem</code> file which was missing in my php folder in xampp directory.
I downloaded new carcet.pem from <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem" rel="nofollow">https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem</a> and saved it as carcet.pem.txt in my php folder inside the xampp directory. I then opened php.ini file inside php folder and changed
    <code>;curl.cainfo=</code> to 
    <code>curl.cainfo="C:\xampp\php\cacert.pem.txt"</code>. <strong>Do not forget</strong> the <strong>.txt</strong> extension and also don't forget to <strong>restart your xampp</strong>.
That solved the problem for me.
