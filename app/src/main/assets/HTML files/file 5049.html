<p>You need to put the lookbehind before the number. Also, you need to add digits as illegal characters inside the lookbehind, or the <code>4</code> in <code>v.34</code> will match. Try</p>

<pre><code>(?i)(?&lt;!v(?:ol)?\\.?\\s*\\d*)\\d{1,4}(?![^(]*\\))
</code></pre>

<p>This is expecting (edit: wrongly, as it turns out) that regexkitlite supports infinite repetition inside lookbehind which not many regex flavors do. </p>

<p>A look into the <a href="http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/RegexKitLite/#ICUSyntax_ICURegularExpressionSyntax" rel="nofollow">docs</a> shows that it does support finite (but variable) repetition inside lookbehind, and if you are aware that the following will only work if there is at most one space between <code>vol.</code> and the number, then you could try</p>

<pre><code>(?i)(?&lt;!v(?:ol)?\\.?\\s?)(?&lt;!\\d)\\d{1,4}(?![^(]*\\))
</code></pre>
