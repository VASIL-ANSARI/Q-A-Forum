<p>A subview transformation matrix is relative to its superview.</p>

<p>In other words, if you just apply an affine transform matrix to  <code>_contentView</code>, its subviews will still have an identity matrix which is composed to that of the superview. This is reflected in this paragraph from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/windowsviews/conceptual/viewpg_iphoneos/WindowsandViews/WindowsandViews.html" rel="nofollow">Apple's View Programming Guide</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The coordinate system of each subview builds upon the coordinate systems of its ancestors. So when you modify a viewâs transform property, that change affects the view and all of its subviews. However, these changes affect only the final rendering of the views on the screen. Because each view draws its content and lays out its subviews relative to its own bounds, it can ignore its superviewâs transform during drawing and layout.</p>
