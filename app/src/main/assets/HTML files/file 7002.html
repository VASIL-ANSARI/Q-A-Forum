<p>It depends if you need your variable to be temporary or not:</p>

<pre><code>struct thread_data data; // allocated on the stack
// initialize your data.* field by field.

struct thread_data* data = malloc(sizeof (struct thread_data)); // allocated on the heap
// initialize your data-&gt;* field by field.
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, you have to allocate your structure first to be able to access its fields.</p>
