<p>This is first checking to see if there is a value defined.  It appears that this value <code>BCM2835_NO_DELAY_COMPATIBILITY</code> toggles on and off compatibility with a particular set of timers.  If it isn't defined (in other words, if it's not turned off) then the two <em>macros</em> are defined to point to an actual function.</p>

<p>Later, those actual functions are defined.</p>

<p>Was there some other question??</p>
