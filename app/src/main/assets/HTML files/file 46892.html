<p>What you've drawn is actually straight lines. The fact that it looks curved is an optical illusion. You can get this same effect with yarn and a piece of cardboard.</p>

<p>Your code is doing the wrong thing.</p>

<p>You need to map out the diagonal grid you want with graph paper, figure out the endpoints of your diagonal grid, and then come up with a loop that gives you those endpoints.</p>

<p>If you want to draw a diagonal grid in a 5x5 rectangle you'd draw lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>0,1 to 1,0
0,2 to 2,0
0,3 to 3,0
0,4 to 4,0
</code></pre>

<p>Your grid spacing is probably more like 20 or 30 points than every point, and your whole grid is probably the full size of the screen, but you get the idea.</p>
