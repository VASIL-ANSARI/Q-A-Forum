<p>You might have another, runnable "less.*" file on your PATH that is shadowing your "less.cmd" file.  If you run</p>

<pre><code>where less.*
</code></pre>

<p>from a directory other than the one containing less.cmd, does it list your file?</p>

<p>Also, try adding</p>

<pre><code>echo Running less.cmd (as %0) with parameters %*
</code></pre>

<p>as the first line in your less.cmd file and then run your commands, again.  Do you always see the message, or only when running it by full path?  What is the full text of the commands you're running and this output?  What is your full path (i.e. the output from "set PATH")?</p>

<p>One more thing: check that your "lessc.wsf" file is actually located in the same folder as your "less.cmd" file.  I'm not sure how your script would ever run, if this were not the case, but it's still worth double-checking.</p>
