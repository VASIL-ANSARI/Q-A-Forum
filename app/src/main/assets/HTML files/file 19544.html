<p>Define a simple function within your fabfile.py to read your passwords out of a separate file.  Something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>def new_getpass(username):
    with open("/etc/passwd", "r") as f:
        for entry in [l.split(":") for l in f.readlines()]:
            if entry[0] == username:
                return entry
    return None
</code></pre>

<p>This will return <code>None</code> in the event that the username cannot be found and the entire user's record as a list in the event the user is found.</p>

<p>Obviously my example is getting its data from <code>/etc/passwd</code> but you can easily adapt this basic functionality to your own file:</p>

<p><code>credentials.dat</code></p>

<pre><code>database1|abcd1234
database2|zyxw0987
</code></pre>

<p>And then the above code modified to use this file like this, with the slight variation to return only the password (since we know the database name):</p>

<pre><code>def getpass(database):
    with open("credentials.dat", "r") as f:
        for entry in [l.split("|") for l in f.readlines()]:
            if entry[0] == username:
                return entry[1]
    return None
</code></pre>

<p>While not as simple as an import, it provides you flexibility to be able to use plaintext files to store your credentials in.</p>
