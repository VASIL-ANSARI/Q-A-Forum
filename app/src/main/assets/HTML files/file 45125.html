<p><code>promiseA</code>'s <code>then</code> function returns a new promise (<code>promiseB</code>) that is immediately resolved after <code>promiseA</code> is resolved, its value is the value of the what is returned from the success function within <code>promiseA</code>.</p>

<p>In this case <code>promiseA</code> is resolved with a value - <code>result</code> and then immediately resolves <code>promiseB</code> with the value of <code>result + 1</code>.</p>

<p>Accessing the value of <code>promiseB</code> is done in the same way we accessed the result of <code>promiseA</code>.</p>

<pre><code>promiseB.then(function(result) {
    // here you can use the result of promiseB
});
</code></pre>
