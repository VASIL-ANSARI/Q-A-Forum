<p>I would recommend using Google Analytics and setting up a Custom Report that tracks only article views. This would give you the insights you seek plus a lot more and it would avoid counting bots (like Google, Bing or a SPAMer).</p>

<p>But if you defiantly want to track users on your own I would recommend tracking the IP address in one field and Session ID in another.</p>

<pre><code>session_start();

$user['ip']  = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
$user['sid'] = session_id();
</code></pre>
