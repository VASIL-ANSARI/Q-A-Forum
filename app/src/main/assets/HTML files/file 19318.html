<p>Well if you have just started with Struts2, i suggest you to download <a href="http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2341" rel="nofollow">sample applications</a> from Struts2 home page and run them.</p>

<p>these sample apps comes with required jars which should be there in minimum to run Struts2 application.</p>

<p>Alternatively if you can go ahead with maven i will suggest you to create sample Struts2 application with <a href="http://struts.apache.org/2.2.3/docs/struts-2-maven-archetypes.html" rel="nofollow">maven</a> and let maven download and provide you all the dependencies you need to run your sample application</p>
