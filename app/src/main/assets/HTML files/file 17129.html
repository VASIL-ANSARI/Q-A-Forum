<p>You try to mock out *wit_configuration_file_path* with is in the same source file as the function under test *wit_load_configuration*. This is not possible. The linker sees the original implementation of wit_configuration_file_path and also the mocked version.</p>

<p>CMockery has a pretty course grained scope for the mocking. In the end, you can only mock out complete source files. If two functions are in the same source file, they are either both mocked out or they are both in the "System under Test". </p>

<p>What to do in this case? Don't mock out *wit_configuration_file_path* or place it in a different source file. As *wit_load_configuration* and *wit_configuration_file_path* are so highly related, probably not mocking the function out would be the best solution.</p>
