<p>If you want to be able to toggle a Form Region - you need to build a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa942864%28v=VS.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Custom Task Pane</a> integrated with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386097.aspx" rel="nofollow">Ribbon extensibility</a>. There is no way to toggle a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa942843%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Form Region</a> once it has been opened unless the user initiates it via the form region expand/collapse action. Custom Task Panes are what you are looking for.</p>
