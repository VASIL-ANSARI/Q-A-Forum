<p>You can directly modify your mysql table. Try this:</p>

<p><code>Alter table Tablename modify column ColumnName int(11) auto_increment;</code></p>

<p>You can take reference to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220473/auto-increment-a-non-primary-key-field-in-ruby-on-rails">Auto increment a non-primary key field in Ruby on Rails</a> to execute it the rails way.</p>

<p>You can also come up with a pretty stupid hack, something like in your model, inside create method:</p>

<pre><code>def self.create(user, user_number)
 user = User.new #update fields
 user.user_number += 1
 user.save
end
</code></pre>

<p>However I would still ask why don't you use the <code>id</code> itself as <code>user_number</code>?</p>
