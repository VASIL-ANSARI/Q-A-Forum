<p>also I'm not completely sure I understand what exactly are you trying to do. I think you have a mistake in the code you posted: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are trying to append the script to <code>$html.children('head')</code> while <code>$html</code> is not the <code>$iframe</code> itself but the contents.. I think <code>contents()</code> doesn't return a DOM element so the rest after that isn't valid anyway. <strong>edit</strong> - now I see in the comments that regular js does work for you so this probably ain't the problem</p></li>
<li><p>I vaguely remember there is an issue with cross site scripting when calling js libs from another domain in an iframe. Not sure about that</p></li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: Found it: <a href="http://www.codecouch.com/2008/10/cross-site-scripting-xss-using-iframes/" rel="nofollow">here</a> maybe this is the issue. There is also a solution here</p>
