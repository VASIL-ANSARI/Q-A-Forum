<p>I see two problems in the app.yaml as you show it:</p>

<ul>
<li>the word <code>script</code> (second occurrence) is un-indented (needs two
spaces before it).</li>
<li>the <code>url</code> regular expressions are tried in order:
<code>/.*</code> will match <strong>any</strong> URL, so the following <code>/crossdomain.xml</code>
handle will <strong>never</strong> trigger.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first issue can be fixed with miniscule editing, and so can the second one -- you just need to swap the second and third handler directives.</p>
