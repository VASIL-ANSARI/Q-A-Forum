<p>Short answer: You can't. In both UIView and Core Animation animations, the view/layer does not actually move as it's position appears to be animating. Instead, there is a "presentation layer" that draws the animated object as it moves.</p>

<p>If you want to make objects tappable while a position animation is "in flight" you have to put a tap gesture recognizer on a superview that spans the entire area the view will travel over, and then do hit testing on the presentation layer of the object that's being animated.</p>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>I have a project on Github called <a href="https://github.com/DuncanMC/iOS-CAAnimation-group-demo" rel="nofollow"><strong>iOS CAAnimation Group demo</strong></a> that is a working demonstration of how to use hit testing on the presentation layer to detect taps on a view that's being animated along a complex path.</p>

<p>The code is written in Objective-C, but it should still be an illustration of the concept and techniques. Let me know if you have trouble making sense of the Objective-C code. I'm decent at Swift, although I'm still paying the bills in mostly Objective-C, so that's the syntax I know best.</p>
