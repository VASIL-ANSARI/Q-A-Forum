<p>Change your <code>else</code>, which handles the wrong input case to this:</p>

<pre><code>else {
    System.out.println("You need to enter a number!");
    userInput.next();
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the user enters a <code>String</code>, you are not consuming it. That is why you are going in to infinite loop. </p>

<p>So when add <code>userInput.next();</code> current string will be consumed and you will go for the next input.</p>
