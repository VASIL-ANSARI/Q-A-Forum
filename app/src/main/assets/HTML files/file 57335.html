<p>Nothing <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.23" rel="nofollow">here</a> mentions any kind of branching. This is a mere expression evaluation, a <code>&amp;&amp;</code> in an <code>if</code> statement is no different from a <code>&amp;&amp;</code> in an expression. Would you ask the same question with the following code ?</p>

<pre><code>boolean isValid = condition &amp;&amp; (list!=null) &amp;&amp; (list.size()&gt;0);
if (isValid) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically what happens, the expression gets evaluated and then the branching happens.</p>
