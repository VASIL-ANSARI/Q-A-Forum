<p>According to the documentation, no it does not. It "terminates the flow of bytes" on the stream. While <code>CFWriteStreamWrite</code> is synchronous, it does not guarantee that all bytes you want to write will be written in one call. Thus it returns the number of bytes actually written; your job is to keep calling it until your data is exhausted or you otherwise decide to stop.</p>
