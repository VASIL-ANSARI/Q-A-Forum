<p>I started from scratch using the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-python-flask-skeleton" rel="nofollow">App Engine Flask Skeleton</a> and added <code>flask-restful</code> as a dependency in <code>requirements.txt</code> and then just added more or less the code you have above and it worked without an issue. I added the repository to <a href="https://github.com/jonparrott/App-Engine-Flask-Restful-Example" rel="nofollow">my github here</a> if you want to use it - you can see the changes I made to the skeleton in <a href="https://github.com/jonparrott/App-Engine-Flask-Restful-Example/commit/eb65f0fdf4f89ba0fadbed56c5b853b1c9e6957d" rel="nofollow">this commit</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why your example isn't working, but one thing I noticed that could be causing issues is that you're doing <code>from lib.flask ...</code>. It seems your third-party packages live in <code>lib</code> and you haven't necessarily "lifted" <code>lib</code> into your <code>sys.path</code>. The skeleton includes a <a href="https://github.com/jonparrott/Darth-Vendor" rel="nofollow">vendoring library</a> that makes sure that this is handled properly. It might be a potential source of the problem.</p>

<p>Either way, I hope the forked skeleton can help you get up and running.</p>
