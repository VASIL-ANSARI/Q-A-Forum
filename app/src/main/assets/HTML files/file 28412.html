<p>The command you show is correct. You can verify this by creating a new project: without modifying any settings pdb and exe go in OutDir. If this doesn't work for you, the only possibility seems the project is overriding the exe path somewhere. Look in the project settings, or if it's a custom project check the <code>TargetName</code> property.</p>
