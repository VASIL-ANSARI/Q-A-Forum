<p>Well it would be really easy if you use <a href="http://www.roseindia.net/java/example/java/swing/AbsCoordinate.shtml" rel="nofollow">Absolute Positioning</a> which allows you to set the JLabels, JButtons, etc by their coordinates instead of having to position them and make the code super confusing. </p>

<p>Then for the score part I would just create a new JLabel, one for the computer and one for the player, that is displayed in the top left/right and will show the scores.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
