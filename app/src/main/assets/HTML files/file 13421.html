<p>as it stated: Multithreading is managed internally by a thread scheduler, a function the CLR typically delegates to the operating system. A thread scheduler ensures all active threads are allocated appropriate execution time, and that threads that are waiting or blocked (for instance, on an exclusive lock or on user input)  do not consume CPU time.
  Theoretically NET team may implement their own scheduler, but i doubt this.So i think the GetThreadTimes function is what you need.</p>
