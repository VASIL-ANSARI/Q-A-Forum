<p>I'm assuming your code looks something like this (give or take):</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String [] args)
{
    ...
    Stage myStage = new Stage();
    Player myPlayer = new Player(myStage);

    myStage.addActor(myPlayer);
    ...
}

...

public class Player extends Actor
{

    Stage myStage;        

    public Player(Stage _stage)
    {
        myStage = _stage;

        myStage.addActor(&lt;another Actor object&gt;);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since all objects in Java are references, when you pass myStage to myPlayer, you are not copying myStage, instead you're passing a reference to the Stage you already declared and initialized.</p>

<p>In short, you can call myStage.addActor() from inside your Player class without a problem. I would recommend taking a look at your class structure, however, to make sure that objects (such as your player) only encapsulate their own functionality. For example, if the buttons are only for control, maybe they should be added to the stage separately from the main method as a UI class that extends Actor.</p>
