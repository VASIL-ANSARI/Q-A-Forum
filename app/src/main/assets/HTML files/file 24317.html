<p>This will answer the first part of your question.</p>

<p>If you call <code>finish()</code> anywhere outside of onCreate(), then <code>onPause()</code> and <code>onStop()</code> will be called, but not if you call it from <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onCreate%28android.os.Bundle%29" rel="nofollow">onCreate()</a> : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can call finish() from within this function, in which case
  onDestroy() will be immediately called without any of the rest of the
  activity lifecycle (onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), etc) executing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>onSaveInstanceState()</code> won't be called even if you call <code>finish()</code> outside of <code>onCreate()</code> because the user will never be able to return to the activity so it will never need to restore its state.</p>
