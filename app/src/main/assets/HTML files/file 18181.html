<p>When you output the content from the db you can use <code>de()</code> and <code>evalaute()</code> on the content to process the vars. You will likely need to use a nested combination. I forget the exact syntax.
<code>De(evaluate('#var#'))</code> or something like that.</p>

<p>However this will prove problematic if you have any other <code>#</code> in the content that is not a var. I would suggest using lexicons instead.
