<p>If you aren't passing any <code>level</code>, then <code>String level</code> would be initialized to <code>NULL</code>. Although the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt%28java.lang.String%29" rel="nofollow">javadocs</a> state you should have a <code>NumberFormatException</code> if you don't pass a valid number, it is possible that <code>parseInt</code> parses your string as <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Even if it didn't though, Java initializes all values to 0 on its own. Make sure you pass a valid level value and try again.</p>
