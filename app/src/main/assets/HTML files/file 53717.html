<p>Can't do it with object literal. But you can remember that <code>foo.bar</code> is equivalent to <code>foo['bar']</code>, and write this instead:</p>

<pre><code>var opts = {};
opts[username] = {
      active: true,
      email: emails,
      first_name: first,
      last_name: last,
      phone: phone,
      role: "technician"
    };
ref2.set(opts);
</code></pre>
