<p>Your code listed is fine. It looks like you're still maintaining a reference to the original ActivePlayer, somewhere else in your code.</p>

<p>As a side note, your pattern for creating an ActivePlayer isn't the norm - generally a class doesn't call alloc from within an init method. Instead, the caller should perform:</p>

<pre><code>[[ActivePlayer alloc] initWithName:@"Bob"];
</code></pre>

<p>and your init method should work with the return value of</p>

<pre><code>[super init];
</code></pre>
