<p>Those 3 for loops should be inside your main for loop.</p>

<pre><code>out_list = []
for numb in('EFBO839787', 'EFBO839786', 'EFBO815155'):
  url = 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/result/partial/' + numb + '?teamview=false'
  teams_list = []
  inner_page = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
  soupb = BeautifulSoup(inner_page, 'lxml')

  for report in soupb.find_all('td', 'match-details'):
              # your code as it is

  for shots in soupb.find_all('td', class_='shots'):
              # your code as it is

  for incidents in soupb.find("table", class_="incidents-table").find("tbody").find_all("tr"):
              # your code as it is
</code></pre>

<p>It works just fine - shows up a team just once.  </p>

<p>Here's output of first for loop:  </p>

<pre><code>[{'score': ['1-3'], 'away_team': ['Man City'], 'home_team': ['Dynamo Kiev']}, 
{'score': ['1-0'], 'away_team': ['Zenit St P'], 'home_team': ['Benfica']}, 
{'score': ['1-2'], 'away_team': ['Boston United'], 'home_team': ['Bradford Park Avenue']}]
</code></pre>
