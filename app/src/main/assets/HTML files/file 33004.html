<p>Just don't use that method call instead inline your condition. </p>

<pre><code>status = e.status == 1 ? "Active" : "Not Active"
</code></pre>

<p>LINQ to EF would try to convert your LINQ expression to under laying data source language (probably SQL), and since SQL doesn't have any knowledge of your method it would fail. </p>

<p>You can execute your query without that method and then execute your method on in-memory collection. like:</p>

<pre><code>var query = (from e in conn.equipments
             select new 
             {
                  id = e.id,
                  status = e.status
             }).AsEnumerable(); //as Servy pointed out

var result = (from e in query 
             select new 
             {
               id = e.id, 
               status = GetEquipmentStatusText(e.status)
             }).ToList();
</code></pre>
