<p>From <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge</a> documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command line tool that lets
  you communicate with an emulator instance or connected Android-powered
  device. It is a client-server program that includes three components:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A client, which runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client from a shell by issuing an adb command. Other Android tools
  such as the ADT plugin and DDMS also create adb clients.</li>
  <li>A server, which runs as a background process on your development machine. The server manages communication between the client and the
  adb daemon running on an emulator or device.</li>
  <li>A daemon, which runs as a background process on each emulator or device instance.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the daemon is the ADB component that runs on the device (or emulator) which accepts commands from the ADB server and executes them.</p>
