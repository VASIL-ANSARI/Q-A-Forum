<p>If this is live application and user experience is important, then I suggest you avoid sending anything email-related in post_save handlers, or even in views.</p>

<p>Reasons are: SMTP can go down, network connection can go down, network can be up but speed can be that of a snail etc. In each of those cases either your program breaks, or user waits and waits and waits... which is not good for business.</p>

<p>The solution is to write/buy/find separate email dispatcher that is able to handle all such situations gently, alert administrator in case of trouble, switch SMTP gates on the fly, additionally it could trace bounce-back etc.</p>

<p>Then, in your post_save handler, you only add something like this:</p>

<pre><code>   email_dispatcher.add_to_queue(my_email)
</code></pre>

<p>Regarding ready-made solutions - quick scan of code.google com resulted in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-mailer/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/django-mailer/</a> but I haven't used it so cannot make recommendation.</p>
