<p>You can just set the native function to your own one to override it.
Basically:</p>

<pre><code>window.scrollTo = YourAnimatedScrollFunction;
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind not to use the brackets for assigning the function, because that would execute it instead of assigning it. Also be sure that your custom function accepts the same parameters as the native function.</p>
