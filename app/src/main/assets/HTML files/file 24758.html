<p>It sounds like a self-join situation, something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM table a
JOIN table b
   ON  a.id_BusLine = b.id_Busline
   AND a.id_NextBusStop = b.id_BusStop
</code></pre>

<p>That links them together, but you'd want ordering too, if your isFirstStop is 1/0 then:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM table a
JOIN table b
   ON  a.id_BusLine = b.id_Busline
   AND a.id_NextBusStop = b.id_BusStop
ORDER BY isFirstStop, ....
</code></pre>

<p>Need some way to order the stops after that.</p>
