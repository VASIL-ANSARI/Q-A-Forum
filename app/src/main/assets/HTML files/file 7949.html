<p>Have you tried using a modal view controller? Based on each selection, if you push a modal view controller onto the view it will automatically hide the navigation bar. </p>

<p>Essentially it is meant to be a screen that is used to temporarily accept user data. If you implement this it will automatically hide the navigation bar when it comes into view as it is owned by the view controller that presents it and is not pushed onto the navigation controller stack. </p>
