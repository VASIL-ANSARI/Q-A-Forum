<p>The following will work correctly:</p>

<pre><code>for (it = list.begin(); it != list.end(); ) {
    if (!(*it)-&gt;alive) {
        it = list.erase(it);
    } else {
        ++it;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is not just with certain sizes. In your example, you are <strong>skipping</strong> an element every time you remove one. Think about it.</p>

<p>If the element is not "alive", then you do: <code>it = list.erase(it);</code>, which removes the element and sets <code>it</code> to the one that follows it. <strong>then your loop performs <code>++it</code></strong>, which skips the next one, possibly skipping <code>end()</code>!</p>

<p>This is not just an issue with skipping <code>end()</code>, you were skipping others too, but removing the last element in the list will likely yield a crash.</p>
