<p>Could you make your question a little more clear, are you saying that your validation is not working on the client side or the server side ?</p>

<p>If you're trying to get it to work on the Server side You will need to use <code>$form-&gt;isValid(my_post_Data)</code> in order to validate the form on your controller. But if you're already doing this and you're not being able to get it work then are you getting any error ?</p>

<p>If you already know how to do it on the server side but expecting it to work on client side then it is not enough to get it to validate on the client side. But you could do it easily using simple ajax request without having to write client side validation again. You could consult <a href="http://www.zendcasts.com/ajaxify-your-zend_form-validation-with-jquery/2010/04/" rel="nofollow">this</a> . This is very simple and saves you a lot of time.</p>
