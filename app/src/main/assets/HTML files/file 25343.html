<p>This kind of timer is retained only by the run loop. Since you don't have a pointer to it, you can't <code>invalidate</code> it. It also is going to retain its target (<code>self</code>), so it's not possible for <code>self</code> to deallocate prior to the timer firing. After it fires, the run loop will release it, so it will deallocate, causing it to release <code>self</code>, and allowing that object to deallocate (assuming there are no other retains on it).</p>

<p>In most case I do not recommend <code>scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:â¦</code> because it makes it impossible for you to <code>invalidate</code> the timer. But if that behavior is exactly what you want, then it will work fine with no additional code.</p>
