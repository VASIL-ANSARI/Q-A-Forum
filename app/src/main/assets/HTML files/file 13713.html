<p>I think IIS is not serving the right file for a .class, probably it is returning a 404 error or something similar, since it cannot find the file. </p>

<p>That error means that Java was expecting a .class file, all class files start with 0xCAFEBABE, which is a magic number with which Java can check that the file it is receiving is in fact a class file. In your case, however, the file returned by IIS is not a class file, it does not start with 0xCAFEBABE, and Java is unable to parse it.</p>

<p>The most common reason for it is that the web server is not able to serve the file, often because of a 404 error.</p>

<p>You should check what happens under the hood, search in IIS logs for requests of .class files, or use a tool (maybe even firebug) to see what is returned to the browser.</p>
