<p>Assuming you have a 1 to many relationship you want to use a <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p.id, p.name, c.id, c.tb1_ID, c.city
FROM Table1 p
LEFT OUTER JOIN Table2 c
ON p.id = c.tb1_ID
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a many to many you'll need to decide how you're limiting table 2.</p>
