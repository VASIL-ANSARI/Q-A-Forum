<p>I think the problem is, that you are probably already in a state transition, but the error interceptor kicks in and then you try to do another transition.</p>

<p>I always explicitly reject the currently resolving promise which is caught by the error interceptor:</p>

<p>instead of doing <code>return errorResponse;</code> you should inject <code>$q</code>service in the interceptor and do <code>return $q.reject(errorResponse);</code></p>
