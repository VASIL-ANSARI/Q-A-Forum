<p>It doesn't support this until <code>0.9.4</code>.</p>

<p>step 1. Get the latest version of sails.js</p>

<p>step 2. Generate sails with the the cli</p>

<p>step 3. See <code>config/sockets.js</code>, customize <code>onConnect</code> function, see below:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports.sockets = {

  // This custom onConnect function will be run each time AFTER a new socket connects
  // (To control whether a socket is allowed to connect, check out `authorization` config.)
  // Keep in mind that Sails' RESTful simulation for sockets 
  // mixes in socket.io events for your routes and blueprints automatically.
  onConnect: function(session, socket) {

    // By default: do nothing
    // This is a good place to subscribe a new socket to a room, inform other users that
    // someone new has come online, or any other custom socket.io logic
    console.log("Got a connected client");

  },
...
</code></pre>
