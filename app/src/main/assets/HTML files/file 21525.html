<p>If you need the memory <em>all at once</em>, no, there is really no way to do it without changing to a 64-bit kernel (which, yes, would allow you to allocate more memory in a single process)</p>

<p>That said, if you don't need the memory all at once, but instead just with fast access, you can always offload parts of the memory storage to another process.</p>

<p>That could for example work by storing the data in the other process, and have your process temporarily map shared memory from that process into its own memory space when required. It will still be stored in-memory, but you'll have some overhead when switching memory range. If the overhead is acceptable or not would depend on your memory access patterns.</p>

<p>It's not a very straight forward approach, but without changing the kernel to give you a 64-bit address space, it sounds like you're in a bit of a bind.</p>

<p>EDIT: You may be able to raise the limit a little above 2GB by reconfiguring the kernel, but that only means you'll hit the hard limit there instead. Also, that would require root access.</p>
