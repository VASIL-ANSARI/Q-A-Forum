<p>You could design a function to manage error handle and you should be evaluating them and consider if you need a performance optimization.</p>

<pre><code>def commit_or_rollback(my_session, do_something, error_type):
    try:
        do_something(my_session)
        my_session.commit()
        return True
    except error_type as err:
        my_session.rollback()
        print(err)
        return False

def do_something(my_session):
    # do something

commit_result = commit_or_rollback(my_session, do_something, NoResultFound)
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful session control and performance. This method could keep the code clearly.</p>
