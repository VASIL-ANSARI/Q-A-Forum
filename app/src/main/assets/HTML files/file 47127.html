<p>You need to put an entire RFC822 email message in the raw field.  So where you have "TEST MESSAGE OR SOMETHING" you should have a string like:</p>

<pre><code>To: someguy@gmail.com
From: myaddress@gmail.com
Subject: this is my cool subject

here's a text/plain email, neato?
</code></pre>

<p>remember to have <code>\r\n</code> between lines and two between headers and body.  seems for php that <a href="https://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.mail.mail-mime.example.php" rel="nofollow" title="PEAR::Mail_Mime">PEAR::Mail_Mime</a> is a good library for constructing such rfc822 MIME email message strings.</p>

<p>For more details, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/sending" rel="nofollow">Sending Email</a>.</p>
