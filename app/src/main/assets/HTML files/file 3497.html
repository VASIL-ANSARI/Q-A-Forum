<p>Sure. But first, note that I recommend against this; I say that a sequence operator should not have a side effect, and a statement should have a side effect. If you're doing something in that ForEach lambda, then make it a statement in the body of a foreach loop rather than making it look like a sequence operator.</p>

<p>That said, here's what you do. First, you write yourself a ForEach that works on arbitrary sequences, not just lists:</p>

<pre><code>public static void ForEach&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; sequence, Action&lt;T&gt; action)
{
    foreach(var item in sequence) action(item);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now you write your break like this:</p>

<pre><code>someList
    .TakeWhile(x=&gt;x.ToString() != "foo")
    .ForEach(sl=&gt;
    {/*your action here*/});
</code></pre>
