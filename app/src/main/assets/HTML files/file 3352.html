<p>That won't do squat.  Transactions are isolated within a single "database".  In order to have transactions span across multiple databases, you need what's called "distributed transaction management".  Standards to do this include XTA.  More enterprise oriented frameworks, including Java J2EE, include this sort of thing as standard.</p>

<p>Since it looks like you're using PHP, you're going to have to roll your own, so to speak.  I'll assume Mysql supports nested transactions (I don't know).  So, if the inner transactions on the two db's both succeed, you're good... commit the two outer transactions.  If either of the inner transactions fail, rollback both outer transactions.</p>
