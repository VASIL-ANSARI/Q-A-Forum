<p>Let's say I have this structure:</p>

<pre><code>struct OuterStruct
{
    int a;
    struct InnerStruct
    {
        int i;
        int j;
    } b;
} s;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can access <code>s.a</code>, and I can even save it in a variable, to better handle it, pass it to functions, ...</p>

<pre><code>int sa = s.a;
</code></pre>

<p>Well, now I want to do the same with <code>s.b</code>, and to do so I need <code>InnerStruct</code> to have a name!</p>

<pre><code>???? sb = s.b;   // here I have to use InnerStruct, otherwise sb would have no valid type!
</code></pre>

<p>The alternative would be to declare <code>InnerStruct</code> outside of <code>OuterStruct</code>, and then putting an instance of it inside as member of <code>OuterStruct</code>. But this would hide the fact that <code>InnerStruct</code> belongs to <code>OuterStruct</code>, making your intent less clear.</p>
