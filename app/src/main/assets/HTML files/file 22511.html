<p>An approach I would consider is <strong>dependency injection</strong>.</p>

<p>On Android, if you use a dependency injection tool such as Square's <a href="http://square.github.com/dagger/" rel="nofollow">Dagger</a> you can simply create a <code>@Module</code> class which provides and injects components into your application.  This way, you could maintain each white-label client's logic as separate components, and at compile time, a specific component would be selected via the reference in the <code>@Module</code> class.</p>

<p>This is also a great way to test your applications and it can avoid a lot of boilerplate code.</p>

<p>There's great info in the following talks also given by Square:</p>

<p>iOS has similar frameworks, one being <a href="http://objection-framework.org/" rel="nofollow">Objection</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Outside the box options:</strong></p>

<p>Is it a requirement that the mobile client has to speak directly to the white-label's servers?  If not, you may want to consider using your own servers as a proxy to the white-label's servers.  This would move all of the business logic up to your server, supporting all of your clients.</p>

<p>I don't have any experience with this but a seemingly promising option is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/j2objc/" rel="nofollow">J2ObjC</a> which is in development at Google.</p>

<pre><code>J2ObjC is an open-source command-line tool from Google that translates
Java code to Objective-C for the iOS (iPhone/iPad) platform. This tool
enables Java code to be part of an iOS application's build, as no editing
of the generated files is necessary. The goal is to write an app's non-UI
code (such as data access, or application logic) in Java, which is then
shared by web apps (using GWT), Android apps, and iOS apps.
