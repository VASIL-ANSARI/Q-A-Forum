<p>I always go for the second option and it has never let me down. If you do it right, you will have always the expected result. What I think it's happening to your application (and you call it bloody mess quite randomly) its because your <code>UIView's</code> will probably still have some autoresize definitions on the Interface Builder. Besides removing all the autoresizes I also uncheck the "Autoresize subviews" checkmark from the parent <code>UIViews</code>. </p>
