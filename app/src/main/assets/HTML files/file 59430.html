<p><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide" rel="nofollow">this ruby style guide</a> says  the <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax is "possible and convenient when you have to define many class methods."</p>

<p>They have code examples using both versions, so there's definitely not a broad community consensus for using one over the other.</p>

<p>I personally use <code>def self.my_method</code> to minimize indentation</p>
