<p>You can't do it like that - at this point it is not yet known which class (or classes) are including the module.</p>

<p>If you define a <code>self.included</code> method it will be called each time the module is included and the thing doing the including will be passed as an argument. Alternatively since you are using AS::Concern you can do</p>

<pre><code>included do 
  #code here is executed in the context of the including class
end
</code></pre>
