<p>If you want it to work properly you'll have to use AngularJS for all form actions or just leave AngularJS away.</p>

<p>Anyways, to do it in AngularJS you'll have to use the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngClick" rel="nofollow"><code>ngClick</code></a> directive in stead of using <code>onclick</code>, for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form ng-submit="vm.confirmUsers()" name="myForm"&gt;
    &lt;select ng-model="vm.username"&gt;
        &lt;option&gt;User 1&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option&gt;User 2&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option&gt;User 3&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option&gt;User 4&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option&gt;User 5&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;button ng-click="vm.addUser(vm.username)" type="button" ng-disabled="vm.username == null"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;textarea ng-model="vm.users" required&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" ng-hide="myForm.$invalid"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In stead of having the <code>onclick=checkUsername();</code> stuff, you'll have to add it to your model using a controller, for example:</p>

<pre><code>vm.addUser = function(username) {
    if (vm.users == null || vm.users.length === 0) {
        vm.users = "'" + username + "'";
    } else {
        vm.users += ", '" + username + "'";  
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This way it will work the same for manually inputting data and having a selection list to add details.</p>

<p>However, not only the <code>onclick</code> has to go, you also have to submit your form using AngularJS to do it properly, using <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngSubmit" rel="nofollow"><code>ngSubmit</code></a>.</p>

<p>To send an HTTP request you can use the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http" rel="nofollow"><code>$http</code></a> service, for example:</p>

<pre><code>vm.confirmUsers = function() {
    $http.post('?page=submit', {
        usernames: vm.users
    }).success(function() {
        // What to do if it was successful?
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>This will post a POST request to the same URL you provided in your form, and adds the usernames (you'll have to pass them as a parameter) to it as parameters.</p>

<p>Anyways, the biggest issue here is that you're mixing several things here, going against all principles commonly used in AngularJS applications. But to detail all issues here, the answer would be way too long.</p>
