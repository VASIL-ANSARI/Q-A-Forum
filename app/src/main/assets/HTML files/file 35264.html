<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>

<p>What does the function  </p>

<pre><code>bindAll(); 
</code></pre>

<p>do? are you binding the same event multiple times and causing some kind of loop?<br>
maybe you need to unbind first or bind in such a way that calling it multiple times applies the binding once?</p>

<p>Is </p>

<pre><code>data.Items
</code></pre>

<p>in </p>

<pre><code>$('table').replaceWith(data.Items);
</code></pre>

<p>really a rendered html table? Do you have more than one table on the page? if so you should probably reference it by ID.</p>
