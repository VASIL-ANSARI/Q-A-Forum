<p>That print out simply tells you that the map value is an object of class ReVerbFeatures. And that class didn't override the "toString()" method, thus giving you some not-so-human-readable output.</p>

<p>But the thing is: you do have an object of that class at hand. So you could be casting it </p>

<pre><code>ReVerbFeatures feature = (ReVerbFeatures) me.getValue();
</code></pre>

<p>to then call any of the methods of that class, for example.</p>

<p>And as others have said: read about "raw types", and if possible, change that code accordingly.</p>

<p>Finally: if you have to deal with code ... then there is no way but learning about all the involved concepts. You shouldn't be dealing with stuff that you don't understand. Meaning: you should decide, if you have the time to really learn about all these things; or stop doing what you are doing right now. Avoid being responsible for something ... if you lack the skills to be really in charge.</p>
