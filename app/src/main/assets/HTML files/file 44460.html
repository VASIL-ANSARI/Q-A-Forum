<p>On <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/ntohl" rel="nofollow">Linux</a> OS <code>ntohl</code> is declared in <code>arpa/inet.h</code> (or <code>netinet/in.h</code>) header file. On <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740069%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Windows</a> it's <code>Winsock2.h</code></p>

<p>As for correctness of reading the header, it is incorrect. You are doing <code>fscanf(fin, "%s %d %d %d %d %d...</code> which is an attempt to read numbers in their textual representation, separated by spaces, which is totally not how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au_file_format" rel="nofollow"><code>AU</code> file</a> is represented. This file type is a binary file and should be read as a binary using <code>fread</code> for example.</p>
