<p><strong>How are you managing your table data? NSArray?</strong></p>

<p>You need to provide these details as what you have posted should work: setting the <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delegate</code> and calling <code>reloadData</code>. When you simply "<code>reloadData</code>" you need to ensure there were changes to the dataSource. If no changes were made to the dataSource <em>(i.e. add / remove an object from the array)</em>, then nothing is going to happen.</p>
