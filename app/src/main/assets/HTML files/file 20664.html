  <p><code>std::ios::imbue &lt;ios&gt;</code></p>
  
  <p><code>locale imbue ( const locale&amp; loc );</code></p>
  
  <p><strong>Imbue locale</strong></p>
  
  <p>Associates loc to both the stream and its associated stream buffer (if
  any) as the new locale object to be used with locale-sensitive
  operations.</p>
  
  <p>All callback functions registered with register_callback with
  imbue_event as its first parameter are called.</p>
  
  <p>In fact, this member function calls its inherited homonym
  ios_base::imbue(loc), and if the stream is associated with a stream
  buffer, <strong>also calls rdbuf()->pubimbue(loc).</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>27.4.4 Collaboration of Locales and Iostreams</strong></p>
  
  <p>The base class ios_base contains a locale object. <strong>The formatting and
  parsing functions defined by the derived stream classes use the
  numeric facets of that locale.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The class template basic_ios holds a pointer to the stream buffer.
  This stream buffer has a locale object, too, usually a copy of the
  same locale object used by the functions of the stream classes. <strong>The
  stream buffer's input and output functions use the code conversion
  facet of the attached locale.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your case, it would use the "C" numeric locale and the "chs" character locale.</p>
