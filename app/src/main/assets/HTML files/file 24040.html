<p>As you can read <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data.html" rel="nofollow">LOAD DATA</a> statement its very flexible , you can specify the fields,rows delimiter and many other features. This will allow you to make your csv in any format do you want.<code>LOAD DATA</code> is indeed the fastest way to insert data in mysql.</p>

<p>In php you can very simply write data to a file like its shown <a href="http://www.tizag.com/phpT/filewrite.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<p>After this indeed you need a cron job that will load the file in mysql, <a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/07/php-cron-job/" rel="nofollow">this</a> should be helpful.</p>
