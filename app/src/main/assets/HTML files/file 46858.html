<p>You could start a session, and define a variable as soon as they join, if the variable is already set don't do anything.</p>

<pre><code>// Start a session.
    session_start()

// Only save the page if the user has not joined before.
if (!isset($_SESSION['has_joined_before'])) {

    // Get the URL
    $first_page = "http://".$_SERVER[HTTP_HOST].$_SERVER[REQUEST_URI];
    // Save the first page somewhere.

    // Don't save the first page again.
    $_SESSION['has_joined_before'] = true;
}
</code></pre>
