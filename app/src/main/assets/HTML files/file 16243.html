<p>You can subtract both dates, and the calculate the differences. Kinda like this: </p>

<pre><code>long difference = calendar.getTimeInMillis()-currentTime;

    long x = difference / 1000;
    seconds = x % 60;
    x /= 60;
    minutes = x % 60;
    x /= 60;
    hours = x % 24;
    x /= 24;
    days = x;
</code></pre>

<p>You can subtract the time you've already calculated. You get the hours, get the rest, do the minutes, etc.</p>
