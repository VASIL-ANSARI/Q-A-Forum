<p>What you need to do is resize both the containing div and the paper. In this example I will show your circle is cropped bottom right. </p>

<p>When you click the canvas, it will resize to show your circle is drawn correctly.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/kRzx5/7/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/kRzx5/7/</a></p>

<pre><code>var paper = Raphael("canvas"),
r = paper.rect(100, 100, 100, 100),
c = paper.circle(500, 500, 80);

// size i want to resize to
var w = 1000;
var h = 1000;

var canvas = $('#canvas');
canvas.on('click', function(){
    // resize container
    $(this).css({width: w, height: h});

    // resize paper
    paper.setSize(w, h);
});
</code></pre>

<p>In this example I am using an arbitrary size to use, you could keep checking the positions and sizes of each object that gets added, and find the item which has largest value on x and y when checking its bounding box, then resize to this. So paper will always fit the items that get added.</p>
