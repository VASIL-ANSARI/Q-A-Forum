<p>To me it looks like you need to provide a way for the statement to return a value "Valid tokens: INTO" tells me that. I haven't used DESCRIBE before, but I would imagine that it returns something.</p>

<p>Interactive SQL doesn't allow the command so I can't really help you much further than that.</p>

<p>BTW, add the iSeries tag to your question. You might get a few more answers that way.</p>
