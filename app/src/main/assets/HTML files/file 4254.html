<p>A good place to start would be removing the string comparisons and putting them in a table with assigned IDs and adding numerical columns in the place of</p>

<pre><code>opportunities.marketing_message != 'Birthday Alert'
</code></pre>

<p>So you'd have...</p>

<pre><code>[id]    [name]
1       Birthday Alert
2       Anniversary
</code></pre>

<p>Numerical comparisons are always much quicker even with indexing.  Doing this would also allow you to easily add new types in the future.</p>

<p>This part is redundant, you don't need <code>AND (opportunities.communication_alert_date &gt;= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 60 DAY))</code> because the clause right before it will do the job.</p>

<pre><code>AND ((opportunities.communication_alert_date BETWEEN 
    DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) AND DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY))) 
AND (opportunities.communication_alert_date &gt;= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 60 DAY))
</code></pre>
