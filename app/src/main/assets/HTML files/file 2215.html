<p>JAX-RS is the Java EE RESTful framework. JavaServer Faces (JSF) is the Java EE MVC framework. It supports all what you've mentioned in your question: postback to same form on error, i8n/l10n and <em>much</em> more. To learn more about JSF, go through <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/tutorial/doc/bnaph.html" rel="nofollow">Java EE 6 tutorial part II chapters 4-9</a>.</p>

<p>You can do a bit MVC with JAX-RS, but it isn't a full fledged MVC framework. The same story goes on that you can do a bit RESTful with JSF, but it isn't a full fledged RESTful framework.</p>

<p>If you want best of both worlds, I think you really need to head to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" rel="nofollow">Ruby on Rails</a> or <a href="http://www.grails.org/" rel="nofollow">Groovy on Rails</a>.</p>
