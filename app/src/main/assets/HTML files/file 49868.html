<p>It looks like <code>PypeR</code> cannot find <code>R</code> to run. Most likely the <code>R</code> command is not in the search path for <code>command ($PATH)</code> when you are using idle. One way is to explicitly point out which <code>R</code> command to use, e.g., if the <code>R</code> command is located in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, you may use</p>

<pre><code>r = R(RCMD="/usr/local/bin/R")
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, it is best if you can add <code>R</code>'s path for idle environment.</p>
