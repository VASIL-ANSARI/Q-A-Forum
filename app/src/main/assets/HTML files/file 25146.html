<p>One (or more) of the rows has data in the <code>traceValue</code> field that cannot be converted to a float.</p>

<p>Make sure you've used the right combination of dots and commas to signal floating point values, as well as making sure you don't have pure invalid data (text for instance) in that field.</p>

<p>You can try this SQL to find the invalid rows, but there might be cases it won't handle:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM vwSimProjAgentTrace WHERE NOT ISNUMERIC(traceValue)
</code></pre>
