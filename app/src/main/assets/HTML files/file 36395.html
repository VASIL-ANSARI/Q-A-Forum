<p>How many times is this being called?  If this gets called multiple times then your event will be called multiple times.</p>

<pre><code> ibSerialPort.OnPacketReceived += ibSerialPort_OnPacketReceived;
</code></pre>

<p>As a test, you could remove the delegate just before you add it:</p>

<pre><code>ibSerialPort.OnPacketReceived -= ibSerialPort_OnPacketReceived;
ibSerialPort.OnPacketReceived += ibSerialPort_OnPacketReceived;
</code></pre>
