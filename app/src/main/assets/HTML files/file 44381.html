<p>The <code>InlineObjectElement</code> is generated on-demand only while the text line is in the visible area. Making the <code>InlineObjectElement</code> read-only thus would not prevent it from being deleted if the user scrolls away before pressing Del.</p>

<p>You'll have to write an <code>IReadOnlySectionProvider</code> implementation that matches your <code>VisualElementGenerator</code> so that you can protect the pieces of text that will cause the inline element to be generated.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you really need to know the start/end offsets of an existing <code>InlineObjectElement</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int start = parentVisualLine.StartOffset + element.RelativeTextOffset;
int end = start + element.DocumentLength;
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know the start offset of the parent <code>VisualLine</code>, there's no way to determine the offset. But you should always know it, given that you either created the element yourself in a generator (in which case it's <code>context.VisualLine</code>) or found the element in the <code>parentVisualLine.Elements</code> collection.</p>
