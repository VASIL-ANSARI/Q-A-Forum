<p>If you need to find the element, any method you choose will either be O(n) or O(log(n)) (if available). Once you know the index of the element, replacing an element is a constant time operation.</p>

<p>The real questions are whether you actually want a list or not. If don't need order, then use a set, in which case lookup and insertion are O(n). If you need order, and you want to swap things in an and out, then consider a tree or heap structure. </p>

<p>You're probably missing the information that python lists are array-backed, rather than linked structures.</p>
