<p>If you want to have background image then use CSS background-image property on a proper div instead of putting <code>&lt;img src="background.jpg" alt="homeScreen" class="home"/&gt;</code> inside it.
Closing icon should be visible then and you'll be able to play with CSS positioning of it, as you've made e.g. with <code>home</code> class.</p>
