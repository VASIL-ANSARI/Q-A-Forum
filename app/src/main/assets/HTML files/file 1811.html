<p>No You can't do that. All that triggering of the AJAX calls has to be done from the client side, though there are ways where you can push some data to client from the server using reverse AJAX or comet but that is not what you are looking for. For your case, you have to do that ugly logic. But if you don't want to parse it, you can store the id in the element itself as data/custom attribute and use it instead of parsing. </p>
