<p>If you want to have scrollable tabs in stead of having them appear on multiple lines, you will need to either create you own tabcontrol from scratch, or create a tab control style in which you override the control template.</p>

<p>If you are completely new to silverlight (and xaml), this might be too difficult for you to do. I do not believe there is a simple way to do this, as this functionality is just not part of the standard tab control.</p>
