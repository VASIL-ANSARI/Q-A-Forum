<p>I already reported a bug to Apple (following a request of an Apple employee in the dev forums) on the performance degradation of assetForUrl in iOS5.</p>

<p>Background: The assetLibrary was refactored and it is now based on CoreData, on each assetForUrl call, the SDK actually opens a new SQLite connection (BAH...), causing a significant performance hit.</p>

<p>Temp solution: In my app I need to load 200 pics using assetForUrl. in IOS4 it took 100ms, in iOS5 around 5+ seconds. I found out that enumerating the <em>entire library</em> (around 1500 pics) and caching it in a URL-->ASSET dictionary, takes around 3 seconds. I'm using this technique for now. Watch out for stale assets if you hold on to them and changes to the library occur.</p>
