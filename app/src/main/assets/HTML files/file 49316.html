<p>The error is pretty clear: you are calling <code>Horizontal</code> with less than the required 2 arguments: in fact, you are calling it with <em>no</em> arguments.</p>

<p>Shouldn't you be calling it <em>after</em> you've read in <code>length</code> and <code>width</code>, so you can pass them to it?</p>
