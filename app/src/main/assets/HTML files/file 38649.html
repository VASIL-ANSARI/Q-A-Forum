<p>Your query is fine, you just need to give an alias to that <code>COUNT(*)</code></p>

<pre><code>SELECT affID, COUNT(*) as c FROM taffiliate...
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can get that value with</p>

<pre><code>echo $row['c'];
</code></pre>

<p>And since you already have the <code>affID</code> and your WHERE clause is restricted to only that, you don't need MySQL to return the <code>affID</code>. Your query can even be</p>

<pre><code> SELECT COUNT(*) as c FROM taffiliate WHERE affID=123    // 
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you can execute your query in many better ways after reading this</p>
