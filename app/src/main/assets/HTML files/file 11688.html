<p>Simple: Don't. </p>

<p>You <em>could</em> bundle the C++ DLL into the .NET Assembly as a <a href="http://www.jelovic.com/articles/resources_in_visual_studio.htm" rel="nofollow">resource</a> - but then these malicious users could just use ILDASM or Reflector or whatever to pull resources out of your .NET assembly - or decompile your .NET wrapper and recompile it with whatever code they want. </p>

<p>Bottom line is, you're really barking up a tree you can't climb (you can do things to dissuade people, but you're not going to stop them from messing with your app if they really want to) - and somehow merging your DLLs into one file really isn't going to give you any meaningful benefit.</p>
