<p>The (-1) returned by SSL_connect() indicates that the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of SSL_connect() to continue the handshake.   </p>

<p>Generally, the calling process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy the needs of SSL_connect(). </p>

<p>However, when using a non-blocking socket, nothing is to be done; but select() can be used to check for the required condition.</p>

<p>(When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.)</p>
