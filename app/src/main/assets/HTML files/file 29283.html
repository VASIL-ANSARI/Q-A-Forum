<p>for example you wana add ole Object to your report 
in c#.net you can do that like this
first you must add references to your project
i usually use CRAXDRT.dll and CrystalDecisions.Shared.dll then you can use the code bellow to add your ole object to your report:</p>

<pre><code>CRAXDRT.OleObject to3 = report2.Sections[i].AddPictureObject("YourPictureName.bmp", 0, 0);
to3.Height = 1600;  //just a number as height
to3.Width = 1250;   //just a number as width
to3.Left = 0;       //the left part of the object will be start from the value which you set for this property
to3.Top = 0;        //the top part of the object will be start from the value which you set for this property
</code></pre>
