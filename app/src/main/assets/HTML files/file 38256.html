<p>For clarity of the comments:</p>

<p>The issue is that .one() will execute once for each element of a class if the selector contains only a class. This is described in the JQuery API:  </p>

<p><strong>.one( events [, data ], handler )</strong><br>
<strong>Description:</strong> <em>Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element per event type.</em></p>

<p>Specifically, if you have 10 elements on a page of the same class, .one() will execute 10 times.</p>
