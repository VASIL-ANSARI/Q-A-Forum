<p>When going through the code I saw that the UserControl was added twice to the main Frame, thus producing the bug. Sorry for that.</p>

<p>The main fix remains, using "bring to front" on the UserControl should be enough to fix the problem as stated somewhere else on the web.
Also you should be setting AutoScroll to true on the UserControl, then in the code call usercontrol.AutoScrollMinSize to the document size should produced the desired effect.</p>
