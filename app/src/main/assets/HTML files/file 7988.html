<p>I really can't think of a reason not to other than what if your operation does something more than slightly different from the associated action the OS does. For an exagerated instance, if you had your trash can button be the place where you created new widgets. But I figure if you are keeping the operations similar to those of the OS, then you are fine. In fact I agree with you, it may even look better for the app.</p>
