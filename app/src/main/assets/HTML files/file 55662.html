<p>The problem is that there are multiple rows that match the first condition.  Some also satisfy the second condition.</p>

<p>I think you are looking for a <code>left join</code> with a <code>where</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM TABLE_A a LEFT JOIN
     TABLE_B b
     ON b.Column1 = a.Column1 AND
        (b.Column1 + CONVERT(varchar(10), b.Column2)) = a.Column1
WHERE b.Column1 IS NULL;
</code></pre>
