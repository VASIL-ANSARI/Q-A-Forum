<p>ASP.NET webforms relies on having a single <strong>server side</strong> form. </p>

<p>You can add as many <em>client side</em> forms as you want (no <code>runat="server"</code> attribute).</p>

<hr>

<p>This is due to the attempt to have a desktop like development model for web development.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The single-form model is a key element for the implementation of the ASP.NET state maintenance feature. Since the page always posts to itself, the runtime finds it easy to retrieve and restore the state saved during the last access. While there are other ways to save and restore the state of a page, using a single-form model is by far the simplest and most effective of all solutions.</p>
  
  <p>In general, renouncing multiple forms is not a big sacrifice. Multiple forms are sometimes useful, but probably not as frequently as you may think. A scenario in which you would find it helpful to use multiple forms is when you implement form-based functionality in a large number of pagesâin search and login dialogs, for example. I'll return to this later in the column. Before going any further, though, a review of the HtmlForm class is in order.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>ASP.NET-MVC has no such limitation - you can have as many forms as you like.</p>
