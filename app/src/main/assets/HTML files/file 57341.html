<p>This is a tricky part of ipython / Jupyter. The set of kernels available are independent of what your virtualenv is when you start jupyter Notebook. The trick is setting up the the ipykernel package in the environment you want to identify itself uniquely to jupyter. From <a href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments" rel="nofollow">docs on multiply ipykernels</a>, </p>

<pre><code>source activate ENVNAME
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name ENVNAME --display-name "Python (whatever you want to call it)"
</code></pre>

<p>If you only want to have a single Python 3 kernel, from the conda environment, just use <code>python -m ipykernel install --user</code> and it will reset the default python to the one in the virtualenv.</p>

<p>And yes, you will need to restart the kernel and re-run the prior steps.</p>
