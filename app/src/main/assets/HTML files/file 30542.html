<p>Some devices do not rotate the image when saving it, but rather set an EXIF header saying "hey, image viewer! could you, like, rotate this image when you display it? kthxbye".</p>

<p>That's why in <a href="https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-camera" rel="nofollow">my CWAC-Camera library</a>, I go through the gyrations to rotate those images, as not all image viewers will honor those EXIF headers.</p>
