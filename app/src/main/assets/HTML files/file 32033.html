<p>Rename your variable <code>exit</code> to a name that does not conflict with a standard library function.  The program is probably jumping to the code contained in your variable (hint: there isn't any) instead of being able to jump the system library function <code>exit()</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>&lt;iostream.h&gt;</code> header is from pre-standard C++ and it really isn't something that you should be using in modern C++ (if your compiler was from the current millennium rather than the last).  Also, no C++ compiler should accept <code>main()</code> with no return type; you should have written <code>int main()</code>.  If Borland 5.02 does accept that code, you seriously need to upgrade to a standard compiler âÂ preferably a C++11 compiler rather than a C++98 or C++03 compiler.  Note that C++11 is a rather different language from C++98, and C++98 is a radically different language from pre-standard C++.  You are being given a seriously sub-standard education if you are being forced to use a pre-standard C++ compiler.</p>
