<p>I'm a little bit confused about your statement of the problem, but I'll try to give a suggestion anyway. 
You say that you set up the players when selecting a row, but the code to set them up is in cellForRowAtIndexPath. So it's set up and playing starts when a cell is returned and displayed in your table view. </p>

<p>What exactly are you trying to achieve? You have a table view with a number of rows, and whenever you tap on a cell the fifty sounds have to start playing one after the other (1 second apart). If you tap the same cell again they should stop and restart, is that it? </p>

<p>Then what I would do is set up the 50 players in viewDidLoad of your TableViewController. Use prepareToPlay().
Start them when needed.</p>

<p>Then if you need to restart them, just cycle through them, check if they are still playing using isPlaying. Pause them if needed, set the current time to 0 and call playAtTime again. 
Don't remove the players in audioDidFinishPlaying. Because then you'd have to recreate them. 
Just reset them so they're available for immediate playback again. </p>

<p>By the way, if you're going to do more with audio and want more control and better performance I highly recommend the excellent frameworks The Amazing Audio Engine 2, or AudioKit</p>
