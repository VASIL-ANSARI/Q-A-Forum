<p>Python creates a <em>bytecode cache</em> for each python module you import; for Python 2 the same name as the original file with the extension <code>.pyc</code> is used. It is that file that is imported when you import <code>random</code>, even if the source <code>.py</code> file was deleted.</p>

<p>Use:</p>

<pre><code>import random
print(random.__file__)
</code></pre>

<p>to  locate the stale <code>random.pyc</code> bytecode file and delete it.</p>

<p>In Python 3 these files are normally stored in a subdirectory called <code>__pycache__</code> but these are ignored if there is no corresponding <code>.py</code> source file. People that want to distribute just the bytecode files (to obfuscate their code in commercial software distributions, for eample) they'll have to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html#cmdoption-compileall-b" rel="nofollow"><code>compilall</code> script with the <code>-b</code> switch</a>, something you almost certainly did not do.</p>
