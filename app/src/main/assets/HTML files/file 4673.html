<p>I wouldn't rely on threads being executed correctly within web applications. Depending on the web server's MPM, the process that executes the request might get killed after a request is done (I guess).</p>

<p>I'd recommend to make the media server request synchronously but let the media server return immediately after it started the encoding without problems (if you have control over its source code). Then a background process (or cron) could poll for the result regularly. This is only one solution - you should provide more information about your infrastructure (e.g. do you control the media server?).</p>

<p>Also check the duplicates in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1994507">another question</a>'s comments for some answers about using task queues in such a scenario.</p>

<p>BTW I assume that no exception occurs in the background thread?!</p>
