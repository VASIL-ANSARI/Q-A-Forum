<p><code>TimeStamp.toString()</code> internally uses <code>Date.getHours()</code> whose javadoc states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns the hour represented by this Date object. The
       returned value is a number (0 through 23)
       representing the hour within the day that contains or begins
       with the instant in time represented by this Date
       object, as interpreted in the local time zone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <code>toString</code> is using your local time zone whereas <code>getDate</code> doesn't.</p>
