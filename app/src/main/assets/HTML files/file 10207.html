<p>I've spent a pretty good amount of time trying to rotate a view exactly on API level 8 and I think it's impossible to make it work properly. FYI, it doesn't work correctly on android 3.2 either although there's a <code>setRotation(int angle)</code> method in the View class. This won't work correctly at all for VideoView for example.</p>

<p>P.S back then it seemed that I've managed to make the rotation thing work for anything other than VideoView though. Have you overriden the <code>onTouchEvent</code> method? If you have not your view won't be receiving the touch event since rotating the canvas will just make the view draw rotated but it will still receive the touch events in its old area. You have to manually apply rotation matrix to the touch event coordinates in order to offset them to the proper location.</p>
