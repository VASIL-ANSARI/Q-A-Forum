<p>Consider creating a root class or interface for your Crate-able objects:</p>

<pre><code>public class Crate&lt;I&gt; : Item 
    where I : Item
{
    private int capacity;
    private List&lt;I&gt; contents;
    //... and so on
}

public interface ICrateable{
// define common features such as name, ID, description etc here
}

public class Shirt: ICrateable{
// implement interface
}


public class DepotSlot : StorageFurniture&lt;Crate&lt;ICrateable&gt;&gt;
{
    // now you can add any Crate&lt;XYZ&gt; here
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you're processing Crate-s it only makes sense to have common things you'd do with them - open them, close them, put labels on them, discard them, load them on trucks, unload them, etc. All these common features can be abstracted in a root (abstract?) class or interface.</p>

<p>If you don't have any predefined operations with the crates you might as well just make them <code>oject</code> and give up the generics</p>
