<p>You aren't getting back a straight <code>NSError</code>, you are getting back a <code>CKError</code>. Looking at the documentation for <code>CKError</code>, there is in fact a <code>CKPartialErrorsByItemIDKey</code> key. That looks like the key that would return a dictionary of CKErrors keyed by item ID if you ask me! The userInfo object should contain that key.</p>
