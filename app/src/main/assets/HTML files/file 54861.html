<p>As I found it difficult to understand your question I apologize for my limited response. However I will give it a shot. I attempted to make a program in C which will display combinations of an array of characters which is similar to a string, just without a '\0'. I will attempt to convert my code to C#.</p>

<pre><code>/* String for combos to be enumerated */
char[] set = { 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' };
/* Length of the array */
int setLength = set.Length, a, b, c;

/* This will print all combos that have 1 value. E.g. A, B, C, D */
for (a = 0; a &lt; setLength; a++) 
{
    Console.WriteLine(set[a] + Environment.NewLine);
}

/* This will give the 1st value of the combo */
for (a = 0; a &lt; setLength; a++)
{
    /* This will give the 2nd value. Resulting in combos with a length of 2 */
    for (b = 0; b &lt; setLength; b++)         
    {
        Console.WriteLine(set[a] + set[b] + Environment.NewLine);
    }
}

/* 1st value */
for (a = 0; a &lt; setLength; a++)
{
    /* 2nd value */
    for (b = 0; b &lt; setLength; b++)
    {
        /* 3rd value */
        for (c = 0; c &lt; setLength; c++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(set[a] + set[b] + set[c] + Environment.NewLine);
        }
    }
}
/* To continue with longer combos simply add more and more for loops */
</code></pre>

I hope this helped.</p>
