<p>SoundJS can only play back sounds that have been registered and loaded by SoundJS. It may be possible to register a sound and its loaded data using private APIs, but it would take some work, and there is no official approach.</p>

<p>The key things you have to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register the sound. The AbstractPlugin does most of the work, but requires a "complete" event to finish the process</li>
<li>You could force the complete (check out the <code>AbstractPlugin._handlePreloadComplete</code> method, which stores the loaded ArrayBuffer in the <code>_audioSources</code> hash.</li>
</ol>

<p>You would have to do that for each sound. Once the sound is registered, and has the necessary data for each ID, the SoundJS APIs should work.</p>

<p>This is an interesting approach, and it might make sense to add it as a feature request to SoundJS.</p>
