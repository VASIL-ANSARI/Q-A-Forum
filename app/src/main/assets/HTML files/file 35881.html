this guy met the same issue, check this link out.</p>

<p>I copyed the answer  written by Dimitar Dimitrov as follows</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This means that your service had already stopped - either killed from
  the OS, or stopped from your application.</p>
  
  <p>Does this problem happen every time you debug your project?</p>
  
  <p>Override your service's onDestroy() method and watch what event flow
  leads to it. If you catch DeadObjectException without going through
  this method, your service should have been killed by the OS.</p>
