  <p>My first problem is how to change the order of the cards ranks. In each separate class(Card Game) that inherits from class Card as different card games place different levels of importance on different cards.</p>

<p>You have two approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Since you're inheriting from <code>Card</code>, you can just override <code>compareTo</code> to behave accordingly.</li>
<li>You can take a look at the <code>Comparator</code> interface, which is convenient for redefining the comparison rules for objects based on context.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for that error you're getting, it doesn't really make sense. The problem might be elsewhere.</p>
