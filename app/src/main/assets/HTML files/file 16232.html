<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc221360%28v=vs.95%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">IsolatedStorageSettings</a> is only available for silverlight. </p>

<p>Similar mechanism is <a href="http://ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings" rel="nofollow">there</a> for Metro Apps.</p>

<p>But for normal desktop Applications similar class is not present.</p>

<p>If i have to approach, i will create similar class, MyLocalStorageSettings, and maintain a Dictionary inside it.</p>

<p>To any modification in dictionary i will save to disk (using IsolatedStorageFile). This dictionary should be loaded either at the time application is loaded, or at the first access to this class.</p>

<p>I have utilized similar approach for storing complex settings in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229512" rel="nofollow">Metro Apps</a>, where existing infrastructure is not sufficient.</p>
