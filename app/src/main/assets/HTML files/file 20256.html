<p>To every process on a 32 bit computer, the memory addressable is 4GB, whether the computer actually has 4GB of actual RAM memory or not is unimportant.</p>

<p>For example, if your computer has 2GB of RAM, to the JVM, it looks like there is 4GB of memory. The other 2GB of memory comes from mapping the memory to a file in the HDD(this is the virtual memory). </p>

<p>If there are multiple processes running, to each process, it seems like it is the only process running on the computer, with 4GB of addressable memory to it. Since, JVM will not be the only process running, the memory manager in the operating system may decide to push the content of unused memory onto the Virtual Memory file. this is upto the OS to decide. </p>

<p>Since it is swapping to disk, the lag in performance will be noticable(unless it is a Solid State Hard drive)</p>
