<p>In your example, <code>prototype</code> and <code>slice</code> are properties of the <code>Array</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.slice  // On the Array.prototype object, get `.slice` property
</code></pre>

<p>Then, with the <code>.slice</code> property, get the property <code>.call</code> on it and execute that.  In this example, only <code>.call()</code> is a method invocation (e.g. a function call).  This is not chaining at all.  This is just nested property declarations, not chaining.</p>

<p>Chaining like your other example:</p>

<pre><code>var standard = name.substring(1).toLowerCase()
</code></pre>

<p>executes left to right.  <code>name.substring(1)</code> is executed and on the return result from that method, the <code>.toLowerCase()</code> method is called.  Chaining only works if the prior methods return appropriate object types for the follow-on methods.  In this case, a new string object is returned by <code>name.substring(1)</code> and <code>.toLowerCase()</code> is called on that new string object.  Thus things execute from left to right.</p>
