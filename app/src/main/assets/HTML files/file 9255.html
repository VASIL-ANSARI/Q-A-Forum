<p>The format of the file doesn't really matter -- use whatever works for you. The key to being able to tune the gameplay, I think, is to turn the rules of the game into objects that you can configure. If the rules are all objects, you can do things like changing the order in which they're applied, the weight given to each one, the conditions under which a rule becomes effective, etc. You might have an object that's responsible for managing and properly applying the rules, basically a "rule model." Once you have that, all you need to do is to implement NSCoding in your rule and rule model classes and you can easily write and read rule configurations.</p>
