<p>While, OAuth is the enterprise/long term solutions. 
For a weekend project,</p>

<p>Can you think of restricting the methods to only GET or few which is needed, and also provide access to only specific resources?</p>

<p>Here is one workaround I used.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem for an angular js application on tomcat to interact with a restful, back end application.  </p>

<p>I created a java application and hosted on the same tomcat where angular was hosted. This java application made calls to backend.
I later replaced the tomcat/java application with grunt and nodejs. Worked good.</p>

<p>nodejs, relay requests was 4 lines code :-)</p>
