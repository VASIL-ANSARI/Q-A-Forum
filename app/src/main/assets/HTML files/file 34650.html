<p>Basically, joins are a fast way. Which way might be the fastest depends on the exact requirements. A couple of hints:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The purpose of your <code>WHERE</code> clause is unclear. It seems you intend to join to <em>all</em> look-up tables and include a condition for each, while you only actually need some of them. That's inefficient. Rather use <a href="/questions/tagged/dynamic-sql" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;dynamic-sql&#39;" rel="tag">dynamic-sql</a> and only include in the query what you actually <em>need</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>With the current query, since all of your fk columns in the main table can be <code>NULL</code>, you <em>must</em> use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-FROM" rel="nofollow"><strong><code>LEFT JOIN</code></strong></a> instead of <code>JOIN</code> or you will exclude rows with <code>NULL</code> values in the fk columns.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>name</code> columns in the look-up tables should certainly be defined <code>NOT NULL</code>. And I would not use the non-descriptive column name <code>"name"</code>, that's an unhelpful naming convention. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20326892/any-downsides-of-using-data-type-text-for-storing-strings/20334221#20334221">I also would use <code>text</code> instead of <code>varchar(32)</code>.</a></p></li>
</ul>
