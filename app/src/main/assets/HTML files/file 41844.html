<p>You did not attach your output, but I'm assumping it looks something like this: <code>BLAHNULL</code></p>

<p>The <code>$failed</code> variable is an instance variable. It is different for each "Process" you make.</p>

<p>When you call showFailed, it makes a geocode, which in turn makes a new Process. That process then echoes its <code>BLAH</code> status after being set. Once that geoCodeAddress exits, the failed status of the original, outer Process is printed, which is null.</p>
