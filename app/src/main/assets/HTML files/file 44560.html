<p>What you are looking for is:     </p>

<pre><code>var result = eval(repl4)
</code></pre>

<p>Be careful however as any Javascript in repl4 will be evaluated and executed, i.e. if someone types malicious Javascript into your text field it will get executed unless you filter it. </p>

<p>Applying <code>parseInt()</code> to the values of the text input however make the use of <code>eval()</code> acceptable in your example as it will return an integer or <code>NaN</code> thus preventing any code injection (this assumes of course that the formula is not coming from an <code>input</code> as well).</p>
