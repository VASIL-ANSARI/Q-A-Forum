<p>If you perform a request against the database then it will retrieve all the properties for the specified object. In this instance all of the properties on <code>TestModel</code> will be populated. The benefit of using <code>IQueryable</code> over <code>IEnumerable</code> is you can use the LINQ extension methods, e.g. <code>Where</code>, <code>Select</code>, etc, and you can also use the <code>DbSet</code> within a LINQ statement, i.e. <code>from x in dbSetVariable where id == 1 select x</code>.</p>

<p>One thing you could try, for example, is:</p>

<p><code>from x in DbSetVariable select new { newName = x.name }</code></p>

<p>This will create an anonymous object with a single property called <code>newName</code> and it will be populated with the data from the <code>name</code> column. This may result in a query that requests a single column. If you wanted to request other, individual columns, then simply add new properties to the anonymous type:</p>

<p><code>from x in DbSetVariable select new { newName = x.name, newValue = x.value }</code></p>
