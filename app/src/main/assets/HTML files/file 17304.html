<p>Make the "fields" class have a draw method:</p>

<pre><code>public function draw($msg) {
    echo $msg;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the textarea or input class put:</p>

<pre><code>parent::draw("&lt;input&gt;");
</code></pre>

<p>This cuts down on the number of methods you have, and can call one method for both types of field.</p>

<p>Also in your "fields" class, change the id code to be like this:</p>

<pre><code>public $id
public function __construct($id) {
    $this-&gt;id = $id;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the subclass:</p>

<pre><code>parent::__construct(1); //Or whatever ID you want
</code></pre>

<p>The way you have it, ID is the same value every time you set it, which will result in every subclass of fields having the same id. This way each subclass will have a seperate ID. </p>

<p>Also because I'm nice, here's it all put together:</p>

<pre><code>public class field {
    $id;
    public __construct($id) {
        $this-&gt;id = $id;
    }

    public function draw($msg) {
        echo $msg;
    }
}

public class input extends field {
    public __construct() {
        parent::__construct(1);
        parent::draw("&lt;input&gt;");
    }
}

public class textarea extends field {
    public __construct() {
        parent::__construct(2);
        parent::draw("&lt;textarea&gt;");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's how I'd put it together from what you've said. I may have mistaken what you were asking for though. Can you tell I'm primarily a Java programmer from that?</p>
