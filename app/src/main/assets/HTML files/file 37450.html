<p>The problem is missing curly braces around the <code>else</code> block: although you have indented the block correctly, the indentation does not matter: only the first line</p>

<pre><code>item = input.nextLine();
</code></pre>

<p>is considered part of <code>else</code>; the remaining ones are executed unconditionally.</p>

<p>Note that there is only one place where you set <code>done</code> to <code>true</code>, you could replace the <code>do</code>/<code>while</code> loop with a "forever" loop, and use <code>break</code> to exit the loop in the middle:</p>

<pre><code>while (true) {
    ...
    if (ans.equals("Done")) {
        break;
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes declaring <code>done</code> variable unnecessary.</p>
