<p>A better way to handle what you're trying to do is to have a variable that holds the index of the current section. Then, you could use something like <code>ng-show="currentSection === 1"</code> which I think would be a little more straight forward.</p>

<p>Then your click action could look more like <code>ng-click="currentSection = 1"</code>. That will show all elements with <code>ng-show="currentSection === 1"</code>.</p>

<p>Does that help any?</p>
