<p>Have you installed the js extension to Visual Studio 2012?  Go to Tools | Extensions and Updates and then SDKs if you have many installed.</p>

<p>Don't think the bundling has any affect on your intellisense, I've tried with and without and my intellisense is still there.  Ensure you css stylesheet is included in your solution and maybe test with a more specific class, e.g. "onebeatconsumer" instead of "row" (there could be a clash somewhere with this)</p>

<p>If you are using LESS, this could most definitely be your issue as it visual might well not be able to parse LESS syntax as it only generates the full styles at runtime.  Does styles in a standard css stylesheet work okay for you?</p>
