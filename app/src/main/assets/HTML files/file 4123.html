<p>You could always use <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch/p?hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;cd=1&amp;ct=rc#GawBxmf1je8/NTP/NtpClient.cs&amp;q=ntp%20lang%3ac%23&amp;l=34" rel="nofollow">a managed NTP client</a> and fetch the time from an NTP server.  (Note that a smart user could use their hosts file to redirect the NTP queries to a fake NTP server under their control, but there's really only so much you can do about this.)</p>
