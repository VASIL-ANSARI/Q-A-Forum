<p>It's a good practice because you can never be sure how you might want age to change at a later date. It might need to have some kind of validation or something else and it's easier to change it in one method than everywhere the field is used (and it's a lot easier to miss one place where its used and thus have some difficulty tracking down a potential error).</p>
