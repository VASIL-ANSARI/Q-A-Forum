<p>Yes, you can. You must correctly call the parent constructor with its correct signature, but your child constructor can have its own completely different signature.</p>

<pre><code>B::B(bool b):A(string())
{
    cout&lt;&lt;"here it is : "&lt;&lt;b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above causes A's constructor to be executed with an empty string as an argument, then B's constructor to be executed with the <code>bool b</code> as an argument.</p>
