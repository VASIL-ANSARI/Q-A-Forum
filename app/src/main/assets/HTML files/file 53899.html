<p>The default visible area in OpenGL ranges from -1 to 1 on each axis (the so-called normalized device coordinates).</p>

<p>In your line example, all the values are in this range and thus are visible. In the point example, the coordinates are simply outside of the screen. You can either change the coordinates to fit in the [-1,1] interval, or add a projection matrix that handles that for you.</p>
