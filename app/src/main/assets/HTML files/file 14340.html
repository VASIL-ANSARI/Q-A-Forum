<p>Ensure that your key word is not a <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/fulltext-stopwords.html" rel="nofollow">stop word</a>. To <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_ft_stopword_file" rel="nofollow">disable or modify the stop word list</a>, you'll need access to set system variables and restart the server.</p>

<p>Also, ensure that your key word meets the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_ft_min_word_len" rel="nofollow">minimum full text word length</a>. The default minimum length is 4.</p>

<p>Finally, ensure that the word appears in less than 50% of the records. MySQL won't return results where the word appears in 50% or more of the records. </p>
