<p>You should :</p>

<pre><code>static public class doSomething implements Callable&lt;Boolean&gt; {

    @Override
    public Boolean call() throws Exception {
        // TODO something...
        return Boolean.FALSE;
    }
}

doSomething task = new doSomething ();
Future&lt;Boolean&gt; future = executor.submit(task);
Boolean res = future.get(); // get() will block waiting for result, so dont call it on UI thread
</code></pre>

<p>you will also have to catch ExecutionException, InterruptedException</p>

<p>as in Larry Schiefer answer, you should look into other - more android oriented solutions to acomplish it. If you need to maintain FTP connection then maybe Service will be better, if you need only to get results then AsyncTask or AsyncTaskLoader</p>
