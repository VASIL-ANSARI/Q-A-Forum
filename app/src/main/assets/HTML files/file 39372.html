<p>An new API, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/" rel="nofollow">Web Cryptography API</a>, is currently in draft status but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.crypto" rel="nofollow">according to MDN</a> it can be used in in the latest versions of almost every major browser. </p>

<p>However, I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve? You said you want client-side encryption of the username and password, but why aren't you just using TLS to encrypt all the traffic? Or are you using the username &amp; password to generate a private key with which to encrypt and decrypt the data client-side so you only have to store the public key on the server? </p>

<p>And a side-note, you are storing the encryption keys in files. How secure are you storing them? When somebody steals the keys all the data is out in the open.</p>
