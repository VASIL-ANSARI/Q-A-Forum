<p>If the user sees <em>hang-outs</em> when your code is launched, I wouldn't launch it right away.</p>

<p>Assuming the query executes on the fly based on the user's input, I would wait until you the user types enough chars to process a lighter query and wouldn't bog down the UI. Especially using <code>%LIKE%</code> syntax, less char's you have to work with, means a larger query and a longer wait-time for the user.</p>
