<p>You are saving the ingredients as a single text item, so, when you are reading them from the database and putting them into a list item, there is only one item.</p>

<p>You will need to add some kind of a delimiter, let's say, a comma, to allow you to split the string you read back from the database into an array of strings.  That way, you can easily add it to the list as individual entries.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>String[] ingredients = stringReadFromDatabase.split(",");
</code></pre>

<p>This will return an array of Strings, each with one item in them.  I didn't use a space as a delimiter, so you can still have ingredients like 1/2 Cup of Sugar.</p>
