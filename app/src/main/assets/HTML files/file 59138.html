<li>You could have created one superclass for all you view controllers and override viewWillAppear/viewDidDisappear there.</li>
<li>If there is no exception and you want to present a modal view controller no matter what view controller is currently on screen, you can present it over self.window.rootViewController in AppDelegate's didReceiveRemoteNotification method.</li>
</ol>
