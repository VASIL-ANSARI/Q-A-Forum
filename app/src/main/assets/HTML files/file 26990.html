<p>I figured this out by trial and error, and I'll put the solution here for others who might find it useful. The problem was I was using <code>ValueGreaterThanOrEqualTo</code> and it should have been <code>VersionGreaterThanOrEqualTo</code></p>

<p>This will skip for Windows 8</p>

<p><code>&lt;BypassIf Property="VersionNT" Compare="VersionGreaterThanOrEqualTo" Value="6.2"/&gt;</code></p>

<p>This will skip for Windows 7 and 8</p>

<p><code>&lt;BypassIf Property="VersionNT" Compare="VersionGreaterThanOrEqualTo" Value="6.1"/&gt;</code></p>
