<p>When you have a static variable in a header file new object of it is created everytime you include it. The scope of it will be just for that module (or file). Since in one file(<code>other.c</code>) you are incrementing it you are seeing the values are being incremented and in the other(<code>main.c</code>) your not incrementing it hence the value is always 0.</p>
