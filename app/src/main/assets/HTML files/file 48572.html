<p>You need to swap out the place holder text for your actual API Keys here:</p>

<pre><code> static String API_KEY = "MY API KEY";

 static String API_SECRET = "MY API SECRET";
</code></pre>

<p>You can get them at <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api" rel="nofollow">https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api</a>. </p>

<p>Although, if you're just starting out, I recommend testing with the <a href="https://sandbox.coinbase.com/" rel="nofollow">Sandbox</a> API first to avoid any security risks. If your API keys have permissions to buy/sell or send money out of your account, any one who has them can do so. </p>

<p>When using the Sandbox API, you'll need to change the URL from <code>https://api.coinbase.com/v1/accounts</code> to <code>https://api.sandbox.coinbase.com/v1/accounts</code>. </p>

<p>Also, we've released <a href="https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2" rel="nofollow">v2 of our API</a>, which is far more awesome, but would require some other modifications to this script. </p>
