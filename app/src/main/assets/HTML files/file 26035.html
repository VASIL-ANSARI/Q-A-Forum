<p>My bad, at first I followed a site (I don't remember) to copy emma.jar into my test project /libs/. I think it somehow calls the jar file twice so it throws IllegalAccessError . I solve this problem by deleting all emma, emma_ant jar files and copy them into /Java/jdk/jre/lib/ext. Now all of my tests run fine and I can get the code coverage now.</p>
