<p>MPI uses S<em>ingle Program Multiple Data</em> message passing programming model, that is all MPI processes execute the same program and you need to use conditionally to decide which process will execute which part of the code . The overall structure of your code could be as follows (assuming master with rank 0 distributes work and worker receive work).</p>

<pre><code>if (myrank == 0) { // master
  for (int k = 1; k &lt; mpiWorldSize; k++) { // send a chunk to each worker
    MPI_Send(...);
  }
}
else { // worker
  MPI_Recv(...); // receive work
}
</code></pre>

<p>Analogously master would collect work. Check out documentation on <code>MPI_Scatter()</code> and <code>MPI_Gather()</code> collective communication functions which seem relevant.</p>
