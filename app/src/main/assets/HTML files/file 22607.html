<p>There are two ways of specifying time data for Highcharts and I think you are using the wrong way for the problem. It's the second style you should use when having gaps in the data.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A compact array without gaps only containing the values for each time-point</p>

<pre><code>data: [2, 5, 3, 6, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>Then you specify the time-point for the first measure together with the interval. eg:</p>

<pre><code>pointStart: Date.UTC(2013,1,12), // start point in milliseconds
pointInterval: 3600 // interval in milliseconds
</code></pre>

<p>You cannot have different length between the time-points this way.</p></li>
<li><p>A two dimensional array with both time-points and measure</p>

<pre><code>data: [[Date.UTC(2013,1,12), 2],
       [Date.UTC(2013,1,12), 5],
       [Date.UTC(2013,1,12), 3],
      ...]
</code></pre>

<p>This way of specifying the array can have gaps where there's no data.</p></li>
</ol>
