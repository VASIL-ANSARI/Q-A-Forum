<p>Okay, I solved the problem with the help of Mario Zechner. 
As he states here <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/robovm/Ume9XVrGQBg" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/robovm/Ume9XVrGQBg</a>
updating to RoboVM version 1.14.0 and deleting the ~/.robovm folder solved the problem!</p>
