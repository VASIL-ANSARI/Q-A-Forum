<p>Another developer suggested that I clear out the temporary files built by .Net when the solution is built.  He pointed me to "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files\root", and told me to delete the contents therein.  </p>

<p>After I did that, the entire problem disappeared.  So it's my interpretation that when I use the "Clean Solution" feature under Build, that "everything" isn't actually cleaned.  </p>

<p>I may be interpreting the evidence wrong, and if so, I welcome clarification.  However, I can attest that this solved my problem. </p>
