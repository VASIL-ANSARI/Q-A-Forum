<p>You're asking how to read a json file, so here it goes:</p>

<pre><code>// This will actually read any file, not just .json
std::ifstream in(filePath, std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);
std::ostringstream contents;
contents &lt;&lt; in.rdbuf();
in.close();
std::string jsonString = contents.str();
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>filePath</code> is the file's path.</p>

<p>It's as simple as that.</p>

<p>Now, to deserialize it into something useful... Well, that's another question, isn't it?</p>
