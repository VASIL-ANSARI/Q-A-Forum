<p>Use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/RandomAccessFile.html" rel="nofollow"><code>RandomAccessFile</code></a>.  This has the methods that you are looking for.  <code>FileOutputStream</code> will only allow you to overwrite or append.  However, note as Murali VP eluded to, this will only allow you to perform direct replacements (byte-for-byte) - and not removal or insertion of bytes.</p>
