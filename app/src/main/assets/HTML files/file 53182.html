<p>The stop condition in your code is incorrect: you stop after <code>n</code> fibonacci numbers have been computed instead of stopping when you have computed a fibonacci number larger than <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a corrected version:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int count_fibonacci(unsigned long long int n) {
    int count = 0;
    unsigned long long n1 = 1, n2 = 1, fib = 1;
    while (fib &lt; n) {
        count++;
        fib = n1 + n2;
        n1 = n2;
        n2 = fib;
    }
    return count;
}

int main(void) {
    unsigned long long n = 0;
    printf("Given number: ");
    scanf("%llu", &amp;n);
    printf("%d\n", count_fibonacci(n));
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It prints <code>5</code> for an input of <code>10</code>, because your fibonacci sequence is: <code>1 2 3 5 8...</code>.</p>

<p>But the standard sequence is usually defined as <code>1 1 2 3 5 8...</code>, and it should return <code>6</code>.  You can get this behavior bu changing the initial state to <code>n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fib = 1</code>.</p>
