<p>A transaction ensures that <strong>all</strong> the commands it contains will either run successfully or rollback.</p>

<p>These types of <code>select</code> statements affect <strong>other</strong> transactions in other sessions. So basically wrapping these in transactions is only a matter of whether you are selecting the data as part of a larger set of commands.</p>

<p>If you only want to select the data you should either use the shared lock or no lock at all and no need to begin a transaction.</p>
