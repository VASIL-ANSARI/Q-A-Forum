<p>The structure represents a Variant, which is here implemented as a C++ union. There are a lot of fields that overlap, such as the bool, float, long, etc. You don't need to set all fields, you only need to set one field and the type.

Which one depends on which function you call; it should tell you what types of input it expects.</p>
