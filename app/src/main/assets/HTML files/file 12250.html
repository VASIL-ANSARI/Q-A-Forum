<pre><code>if( my_object )
    delete my_object;
</code></pre>

<p>is redundant. <code>delete</code> on a <code>NULL</code> pointer does nothing. This is guaranteed by the standard.</p>

<p><code>delete</code> on a pointer that was already deleted causes undefined behavior. That's why you should always remember to assign your pointers to <code>NULL</code> after you delete them:</p>

<pre><code>delete p;
p = NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: As per the comments, I feel I should specify this. If you have multiple pointers to the same object, the assignment to NULL won't make the delete safe. Regardless, it's better to use smart pointers.</p>
