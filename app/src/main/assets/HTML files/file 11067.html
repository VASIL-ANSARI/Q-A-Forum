<p>Yes, and from your description you couldn't have the tagable columns on your tag anyhow since they can have multiple tagable things and vice versa .  You mentioned HABT, but you can't do anything like has_and_belongs_to, :polymorphic => true as far as I know.</p>

<pre><code>create_table :object_tags, :id =&gt; false do |t|
  t.integer :tag_id
  t.integer :tagable_id
  t.string  :tagable_type
end
</code></pre>

<p>Your other tables don't need any columns for object_tags, tags, or tagable.</p>

<pre><code>class Tag &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :object_tags
end

class ObjectTag &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :tagable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
  belongs_to :tag
end

class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :object_tags, :as =&gt; :tagable
  has_many :tags, :through =&gt; :object_tags
end
</code></pre>
