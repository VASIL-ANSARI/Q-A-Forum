<p>No.  LESS has considerably less features than Sass (no functions, no loops).  You would have to use a mixin to do anything remotely like that.  Sass could do it except for the fact that it doesn't have any string manipulation functions built in, so you'd have to write a bit of Ruby code to add those in.</p>
