<p>Assuming that your question relates to the <a href="https://www.mashape.com/passkit/passkit" rel="nofollow">PassKit API</a> on Mashape, you need to append .pkpass to the end to the URL that is returned from the issue request.</p>

<p>The raw URL delivers a contextual response depending on whether or not it is being called from a Passbook capable browser (try accessing the URL via Firefox on on an Android device).  </p>

<p>In your case, <code>[NSData dataWithContentsOfUrl: url];</code> is receiving a HTML response which is causing PKPass to complain that it cannot extract the archive, and subsequently cannot find a signature.  </p>

<p>Appending <code>.pkpass</code> to the URL forces the API to deliver the raw .pkpass bundle.</p>

<p>So if your response is:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "success"        : true,
  "serial"         : "7114189133818574",
  "url"            : "https://r.pass.is/b93NuXKuX1Tj",
  "passbookSerial" : "1fBHoUz9zOOk0yGs47wDC",
  "shareID"        : "2HcFlmRLblKdQZsa4W9zkc",
  "uniqueID"       : "b93NuXKuX1Tj"
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>urlString</code> should be <code>https://r.pass.is/b93NuXKuX1Tj.pkpass</code>.</p>
