<pre><code>int i = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>i is an instance variable and hence will get default value which is 0. So you don't need to assign 0 to it explicitly.</p>

<p>Coming to your question</p>

<pre><code> But my question is which variable first get initialized?
</code></pre>

<p>Then the answer would be i is initialized before j. Because if you see byte codes of your snippet Object is created first which will initialize your instance variables and then constructor is called.</p>
