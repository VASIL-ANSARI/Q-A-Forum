<p>To be honest, I looked into this myself for a long time and was unsatisfied with the built in caching system offered by AWS. Instead, I chose to use Kingfisher <a href="https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher</a> since it is built in swift and well used. I highly recommend it because it is highly customizable but also works perfectly "out of the box"</p>
