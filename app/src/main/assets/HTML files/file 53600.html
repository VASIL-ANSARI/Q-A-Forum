<p>I know that if you have a dependency where you say that you always want the latest version, gradle will have to check all the repositories until it finds one.</p>

<p>If you don't want gradle to check remote repositories and just use its cache, you can use the <code>--offline</code> flag (<a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html#sec:cache_command_line_options" rel="nofollow">see here</a>).</p>
