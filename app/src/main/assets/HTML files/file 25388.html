<p><code>HTTP error (401)</code> means your attempt to authorize failed. Usually it's a problem with the userid/password. Farther into the HTML returned it says:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP Status 401 - No user credentials found
</code></pre>

<p>I think you need to make sure your userid and password are correct.</p>
