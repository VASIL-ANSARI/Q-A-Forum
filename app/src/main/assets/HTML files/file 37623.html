<p>I don't believe the HOME key can be simulated or programmatically executed. As I understand it, this is purely a framework specific event that apps are not privy to. I know if you were to override <code>onKeyDown()</code> that you will never be made aware of the <code>KeyEvent.KEYCODE_HOME</code></p>

<p>I believe you can launch an Intent with the Category CATEGORY_HOME, but I have not tried this.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you're trying to test something like the Activity Lifecycle, perhaps you can simulate a configuration change; such as an orientation change. Or if you are concerned with simply stopping the Activity, perhaps you can call <code>this.finish()</code> where <code>this</code> is the Activity.</p>
