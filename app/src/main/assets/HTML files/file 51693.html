<p>So its look like this is only a problem with your struct?</p>

<p>I would try to set a global variable in your AppDelegate, and then use it in your ViewController.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Create an url variable in your <strong>AppDelegate</strong>.</p>

<p>In your <strong>ViewController</strong> use:</p>

<pre><code>func load() {
    let delegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate as AppDelegate
    let requestURL = NSURL(string: delegate.url)
    let request = NSURLRequest(URL: requestURL!)
    self.webView!.loadRequest(request)
    loadedURL = MyVariables.url
}
</code></pre>

<p>Try it out, it should work. Another idea would be to store it as Singleton, check this out here:</p>

<p>Or (it depends on your data you want to archive) -> store it as NSUserDefaults() </p>
