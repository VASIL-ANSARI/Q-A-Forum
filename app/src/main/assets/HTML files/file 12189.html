<p>If it is an asp.net web application, your bin folders (where you have the dlls) may bring problems when you copy then entire content and put it in a sub folder. This leads you to have 2 bin directories with same dlls and you are going to face problems with that.</p>

<p>If you have the source code with you, why not create a temp folder in your solution and add the required files(asp.net) under that.You may skip copying the common files (images/css/js/user controls etc) and update the copied pages to use the existing ones.</p>

<p>If you dont have the source code, try copying all contents except the bin folder and keep it in the sub directory. You may update the links to your CSS file /Images (in the copied files )to refer the existing CSS/images/js files to avoid duplicate items and then delete the second copy of them (which we end up when we copied to the sub directory)</p>
