<p>You'll never be able to force the OS (with any sort of reasonable effort) to release a socket. </p>

<p>Instead you just want to say you don't care with <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html#socket.socket.setsockopt" rel="nofollow"><code>setsockopt</code></a></p>

<pre><code>s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the option takes place at the <b>S</b>ocket <b>O</b>bject <b>L</b>evel SOCKET (as opposed to the TCP or something else) and you're setting the <b>S</b>ocket <b>O</b>ption REUSEADDR (you're telling the OS that it's OK, you really do want to listen here). And finally, you're turning the option on with <code>1</code>, rather than off (with <code>0</code>).</p>
