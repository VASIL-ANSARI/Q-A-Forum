<p>The reason that happens is because your gesture recognizers on the image view are added during <code>initWithCoder</code>, and your other one is added during <code>viewDidLoad</code> which occurs after <code>initWithCoder</code>. </p>

<p>If you want both to take place, you'll need to implement <code>gestureRecognizer:shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer:</code>, otherwise iOS will just be greedy and take the latest gesture recognizer added if there is more than one for the same gesture (as you are seeing now).</p>
