<p>Micro-optimization #1</p>

<p>If you insist on the conditional checking, I would bypass using the <code>==</code> operator (that I think Javascript uses automatically) and go for the <code>===</code> operator. </p>

<p>The identity <code>===</code> operator behaves identically to the equality <code>==</code> operator except no type conversion is done, and the types must be the same to be considered equal.The <code>==</code> operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. The <code>===</code> operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type <code>===</code> will simply return false. It's this case where <code>===</code> will be faster, and may return a different result than <code>==</code>. In all other cases performance will be the same.</p>

<p>Micro-optimization #2</p>

<p>With respect to the choice between the assignment &amp; conditional checking, it seems logical to go for assignment in the case of using a global variable (like the one you seem to be using). Unless you plan on handling cases in an <code>else</code> situation there's no need to continually check what the current typeof the object or it's value is. </p>
