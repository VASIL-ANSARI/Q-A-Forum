<p>Lots of ways this could be done, including regex (as seen below). This is the most robust method I can think of, although it is more complex than the other methods.</p>

<p><br />
Use <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php" rel="nofollow">parse_url</a> to get the query string from the url (or write your own function).</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-str.php" rel="nofollow">parse_str</a> to convert the query string into an array</p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.unset.php" rel="nofollow">unset</a> the key that you don't want</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.http-build-query.php" rel="nofollow">http_build_query</a> to reassemble the array into a query string</p>

<p>Then reconstruct the Url (if required)</p>
