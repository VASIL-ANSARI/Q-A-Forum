<p>You say you're adding it totally by code, but you're making an IBOutlet to scroll. Did you create it in IB? If not, your problem is that you never instantiate the scroll view. Also, there's no need to create an ivar for scroll, just create the property inside the @interface declaration for your class extension, and refer to it with self.scroll.</p>
