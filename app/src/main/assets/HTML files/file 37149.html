<pre><code>$(function() { // shortcut for $(document).ready

  $(document).on( 'click', '#showFooter', function(){
    $("#slideshow-nav").toggle();
  });

}
</code></pre>

<p>This binds a click to the document object itself. Which we know is going to be there when the document ready function fires. The 'on' method lets you pass in three parameters. First the event to watch ('click'), then an optional delegate ('#showFooter'). When the document is clicked (basically any click anywhere on the page). jQuery will check to see if it originated from the '#showFooter' element. It doesn't matter if the element was added to the page later via AJAX.</p>

<p>finally we pass the function to be executed.</p>
