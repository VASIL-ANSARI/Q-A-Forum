<p>From your question is difficult to guess what is exactly your problem, but if you mean that the PNG is being drawn over the other overlays and you want it to be under them, you can solve it by adding the PNG overlay first to the mapview.</p>

<p>MapView calls the draw method from each overlay by the order that you add them:</p>

<pre><code>mapview.getoverlays().add(overlay1);
mapview.getoverlays().add(overlay2);
</code></pre>

<p>This results in overlay2 being drawn over overlay1.</p>

<pre><code>mapview.getoverlays().add(overlay2);
mapview.getoverlays().add(overlay1);
</code></pre>

<p>This results in overlay1 being drawn over overlay2.</p>

<p>good luck.</p>
