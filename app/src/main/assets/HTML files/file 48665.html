<p>Things like this can be tricky to find, but you can track down causes of this issue with the following steps.</p>

<p>1) Run your app with the following code included before anything else and DevTools (Chrome, in this case) open.</p>

<pre><code>console.profile('cause of reload');

window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function() {
  console.profileEnd('cause of reload');
  debugger;
});
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the reload you're looking for is about to happen, you should be taken to the "Sources" view of Chrome DevTools with the app paused at the <code>debugger</code> line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) Navigate to the "Profiles" tab.</p>

<p>3) Select the profile we created, from the left nav.</p>

<p>4) Choose the "Charts" view from the dropdown menu at the top.</p>

<p>5) Enter Command+F (or Ctrl+F on Windows) and search for "location".</p>

<p>6) Use the up and down arrows in the search box to jump to the last occurring matches for that phrase.</p>

<p>5) Hit enter in the search field to jump to the match.</p>

<p>5) Look back through the call stack for code you recognise.</p>
