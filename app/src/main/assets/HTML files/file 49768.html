<p>Your JSON is mal-fromed which will prevent the server from being able to process your request. Your attributes need to be comma-separated, and your attribute names need to be quoted. </p>

<p>Here is a correctly formatted version of your JSON</p>

<pre><code>{
    "username": "arun.talwar1@yahoo.com",
    "enabled": 1,
    "password": "arun",
    "authority": {
        "username": "arun.talwar1@yahoo.com",
        "authorityType": "candidate"
    },
    "userDetails": {
        "username": "arun.talwar1@yahoo.com",
        "firstName": "Arun1",
        "lastName": "Talwar"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Presumably the 400-BadRequest response was due to the fact that the server could not parse your JSON request.</p>
