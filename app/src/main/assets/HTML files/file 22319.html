<p>There's no such feature a this moment. But...</p>

<ol>
<li>It seems like someone else asked for an option to hide the zoom buttons, and it is already done but seems not documented, see feature request status: <a href="https://github.com/bjornd/jvectormap/pull/136" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bjornd/jvectormap/pull/136</a>.</li>
<li>To allow zoom in/out by code you could and should create a feature request via GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/bjornd/jvectormap/issues/new" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bjornd/jvectormap/issues/new</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I strongly encourage you to create the <em>feature request</em> so the devs behind the project can actually know what are the real needs.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Looking trough the <a href="https://github.com/bjornd/jvectormap/pull/136" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> feature request, <a href="https://github.com/bjornd/jvectormap/commit/b4a237631a331c603b5ec3041db762f04d9bda3d" rel="nofollow">I can see there is a parameter to hide zoom buttons</a>. So you will need to build your maps passing a <code>zoomButtons</code> attribute to <code>false</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$('#map').vectorMap({
  map: 'world_mill_en',
  zoomButtons : false
});
</code></pre>

<p>The other thing you are looking for (zoom in/out via API), I think if you are really sure there's no way to do it, you <em>should</em> create an issue masked as a feature request.</p>

<h2>Edit 2</h2>

<p>Months after my answer was posted, the feature got released <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15361688/439427">see that answer</a>.</p>
