<p>You can use the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize" rel="nofollow">sanitize method</a>.</p>

<pre><code>sanitize(html)
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize/" rel="nofollow">Sanitize gem</a>.</p>

<pre><code>Sanitize.clean(html)
</code></pre>

<p>I tend to prefer the Sanitize gem because it can be used as a before_save filter in your models instead of having to use the sanitize method in each of your views.</p>
