<p>Maybe you can store a hash of a password and encrypt the sensible application JS source code, in order to evaluate it when the user is "authenticated" with the correct key ?</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/12/07/downloading-javascript-as-strings/" rel="nofollow">this</a> article about Google's method about javascript processing. Use an encrypted javascript string source code, and you are client-sided secure ?</p>
