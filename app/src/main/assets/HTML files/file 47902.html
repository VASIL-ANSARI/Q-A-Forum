<p>You can store a <em>constant</em> data in the flash/program memory. If you know that some variables/arrays are actually not changing once initialized, you can declare them as <code>static const</code> in your code and the compiler will place them in the <code>.text</code> section, which is usually going to the FLASH memory. If you have dynamic data that doesn't fit in the memory.. well. You are screwed, unless you can think of optimization (like reusing the same space for different things at different times..). Of course there is a possibility to implement some kind of "swapping" functionality with FLASH, if your part has a programmatic access to the FLASH writing. But it is really not that simple.</p>

  <p>I don't quite understand why TI would make a device which has 16 KB
  FLASH and only 512 Bytes of RAM, when all variables requiring
  read-write operations are stored in RAM. Seems like it is a waste of
  space.</p>

<p>You are getting what you are paying for. Every micro has a specific range of applications it is intended for. If this specific micro is not good for your application, probably it is not in that range.</p>
