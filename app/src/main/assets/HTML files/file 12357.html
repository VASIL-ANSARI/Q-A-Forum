<p>Unfortunately, there is no uniform method to make sure that your site works in every browser. Even if you meet certain coding standards, different browsers may render your page differently. You just have to 1. test your site in common browsers (Recent versions of IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera), 2. see what does not work, and then 3. fix the particular problems by googling around/looking closely. This is just part of web development.</p>
