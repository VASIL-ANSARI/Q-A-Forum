<p>In your simple example, there is no difference between the result of the two cases.  Both accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>The reason for using this structure:</p>

<pre><code>(function()//doing this
{
    them.innerHTML = "Weird&lt;br&gt;";
})();
</code></pre>

<p>Is to create a function scope that can be used to hold private or temporary variables or to create a closure without exposing the variables inside to the outside world.</p>

<p>As for your second question, <code>window.onload</code> fires at a different time than scripts placed at the end of the body because <code>window.onload</code> fires when all synchronous resources needed by the page have finished loading (like scripts and images).  It can be used, either to get notified when all these resources are done loading or it can be used by code that cannot be easily located at the end of the body as a safe time when the page is ready though it is usually not necessary to wait that long just for the DOM to be safe.</p>
