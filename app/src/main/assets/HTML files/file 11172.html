<p>I meet similar problems several days ago. My mapper will down to 0% after reach 100%.</p>

<p>Finally I found that data types definition of map output and reduce input is different. So that copy/shuffle/merge  data flow option between map and reduce will not work, even though hadoop JobTracker retry to do it.</p>

<p>Hope it will be useful for you.</p>
