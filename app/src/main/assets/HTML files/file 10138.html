<p>Probably its a bug in the camera driver you can only fix this if you set up you phone again, yes I know it really shitty, but I had exact the same problem too.</p>

<p>But i choosed to use a custom rom for my device. Atm im using Android Revolution HD 6.1.1

<p>For your secound Question you can take out the source file for the camera app from the package you download with the rom. Probably if you change it, it will work.</p>

<p>Best Regards</p>
