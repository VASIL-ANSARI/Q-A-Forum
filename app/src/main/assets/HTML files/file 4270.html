<p>The only thing I see that affects polygons here is <code>glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);</code>.<br>
You shouldn't have that, because if you plot your vertices backwards, the polygon won't render.<br>
Remove it or actually call <code>glDisable(GL_CULL_FACE);</code> to be sure.<br>
In your case, it's not likely that you want to draw a polygon that you can see from one side only.</p>
