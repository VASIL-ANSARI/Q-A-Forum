<p>Your code won't work. This is not "Java" as you know it. You don't need a main method. What you are probably seeing is the <code>activity_main.xml</code> inside the <code>layout</code> folder. There you will find your <code>Hello, World</code> message, which is probably referencing a string declared at <code>strings.xml</code>, located at the folder <code>values</code>. Both folders are located inside the <code>res</code> folder (RESources).</p>
