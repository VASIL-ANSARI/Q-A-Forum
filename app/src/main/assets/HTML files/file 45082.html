<p>You're getting bitten by operator precedence:</p>

<pre><code>if(c = fgetc(filepointer) != EOF)
</code></pre>

<p>should be:</p>

<pre><code>if((c = fgetc(filepointer)) != EOF)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you had compiled with warnings enabled (e.g. <code>gcc -Wall ...</code>) the compiler would have helpfully pointed out this mistake:</p>

<pre><code>main.c:19:41: warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]
         if(c = fgetc(filepointer) != EOF){
</code></pre>

<p>You would also have been warned about another mistake:</p>

<pre><code>main.c:23:28: warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]
                 if(er = EOF)
</code></pre>

<p>This line should of course be:</p>

<pre><code>                 if(er == EOF)
</code></pre>

<p><hr>
A further problem - you're trying to modify the input file "in place" - this is generally a bad idea (any errors typically mean you are left with a corrupted original file). Furthermore, the way the code is currently written it won't do what you want (as you have seen). A better approach would be to write the output to a new file, and then on successful completion you can delete the old file and rename the new file.
<hr>
As a bonus, some pointers on programming style:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoid globals</li>
<li>don't use <code>goto</code></li>
</ul>
