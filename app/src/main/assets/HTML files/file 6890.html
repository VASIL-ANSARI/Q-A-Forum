<p>Well it would be a lot easier if we could see the WSDL of the service.
But try these steps:</p>

<p>1.Check the WSDL for the isAliveSecure method to see if you have to pass something to it.</p>

<p>2.See what the request you're sending really looks like:</p>

<pre><code>var_dump($soapClient-&gt;__getLastRequest());
var_dump($soapClient-&gt;__getLastRequestHeaders());
</code></pre>

<p>(make sure you're instantiating <code>$soapClient</code> with the option <code>'trace' =&gt; TRUE</code> for these methods or they won't work -> see <a href="http://ch.php.net/manual/en/class.soapclient.php" rel="nofollow">PHP manual</a>).</p>

<p>3.Try sending the request in the form that you're sure should be correct manually via command line, something like:</p>

<pre><code>curl -v -k -d @/path/to/the/file/with/the/request/xml http://service_url
</code></pre>
