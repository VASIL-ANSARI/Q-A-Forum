<h2>Update 19 November</h2>

<p>As of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2015/11/18/announcing-asp-net-5-release-candidate-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET 5 RC1</a> it should now be possible to use coreclr's System.Data.SqlClient on linux provided you have Multiple Active Result Sets turned off.  See the release notes on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2015/11/18/announcing-asp-net-5-release-candidate-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">Cross-platform SQL Client here</a>.
<hr />
It is possible to have ASP.NET 5 running linux communicate to MS MSQL, but perhaps not using the coreclr runtime.</p>

<p><code>System.Data.SqlClient</code> was only flagged as <em>Done</em> on 14 October in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx-progress/blob/master/src-diff/README.md" rel="nofollow">corefx</a>, and beta8 was released October 15.  I'm unsure if it ended up being included in beta8 but the error you have posted is the same as that of beta7 which makes me believe the library is still not included.  Your investigations also seem to point at this.</p>

<p>If this is the case your only option to run it on linux is using the mono runtime (same as beta7).  To do this, remove the <code>"dnxcore50": { }</code> line from your project.json and tell <code>dnvm</code> to target mono rather than coreclr.  This then also requires mono (4.1 or later I think) to be installed on your linux box.</p>

<p>If you don't want to install mono on the box, a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnet/" rel="nofollow">mono-based aspnet 5 docker image</a> is also an option.</p>
