<p>You need to implement a broadcast receiver that is called when the connectivity changes on the device.</p>

<p>When you receive the message you can check for any pending uploads and proceed (you'll need to implement this logic). </p>

<p>Your broadcast receiver needs to handle <code>android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE</code>. How to do this is well document here on SO or a good place to start is <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager.html" rel="nofollow">The Android Connectivity Manager</a></p>
