<p>If you have a <code>template&lt;class T&gt;</code> = <code>template&lt;typename T&gt;</code>, then T is expected to be, well, a <strong>type</strong>.</p>

<p><code>enum CompCriteria</code> is a type, so you can instantiate that template with it. A single value of the enum, however, is not a type, so you can't.</p>
