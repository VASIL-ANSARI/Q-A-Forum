<p>This is a very subjective question. You can use anything to transfer data to mobile devices, even a direct socket binary transfer. But as you have stated, one of the most popular methodologies is to use a REST-ful JSON interface. There are good libraries that support this system both on the client and server. The other option which is not as popular anymore is using XML/SOAP. Many people loathe XML/SOAP at this point, some don't mind. Of course, there are many others I will not mention.</p>

<p>As I stated before though, this is a subjective question. If I were to do this work, I would do REST/JSON, but it certainly is not the only way.</p>
