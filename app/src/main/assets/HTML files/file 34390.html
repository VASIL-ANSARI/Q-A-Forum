<p>probably best to create a new csv from the old one. (untested)</p>

<pre><code>import csv

newlines = []
with open('csvfilename.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:
  reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
  i=0
  for row in reader:
    newlines.append(row[:i] + [1] + row[i+1:])
    i+=1
with open('newcsvfilename.csv','wb') as csvfile:
  writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
  writer.writerows(newlines)
</code></pre>
