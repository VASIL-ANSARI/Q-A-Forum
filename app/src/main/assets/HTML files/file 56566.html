<p>The <a href="http://dev.office.com/reference/add-ins/excel/worksheet" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> was (<a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/commit/66497a02cc485e57c1a68ac025a010711ed8c4fd" rel="nofollow">very</a>) recently updated to clarify this. The ID shouldn't change within the same session (i.e. while the document is open). They do however change between sessions (i.e. when a document is opened and closed). </p>

<p>From the latest documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Returns a value that uniquely identifies the worksheet in a given
  workbook. The value of the identifier remains the same even when the
  worksheet is renamed or moved. Values change with each session of the
  file being opened. Read-only.</p>
