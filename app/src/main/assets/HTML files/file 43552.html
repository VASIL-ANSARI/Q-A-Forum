<p>You need to define the new pointer type.</p>

<p>You static casted x, but the type information is lost after the static cast since at declaration time x is void*.</p>

<p>x will persist to be void* throughout his lifetime.</p>

<p>Here's a working code sample :</p>

<pre><code>     void* x;
     int* ptr;
     x = new int[10];
     ptr = static_cast&lt;int*&gt;(x);
     *ptr = 2;
</code></pre>

<p>OR alternativelly, you can asign and cast in the same line :</p>

<pre><code>    *(static_cast&lt;int*&gt;(x)) = 2;
</code></pre>
