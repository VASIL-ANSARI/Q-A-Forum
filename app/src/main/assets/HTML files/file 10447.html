<p>The message itself refers to a condition that <em>was</em> known to exists only in the simulator. The iOS Simulator does not remove old files (it only updates them).</p>

<p>In recent MonoTouch versions there's another fix now that should prevent even this message to occur (on simulator builds). It's very unlikely that the <em>same</em> condition (stale binaries) is occuring on devices.</p>

<p>The exception behind the error means that that the types inside the assembly (monotouch.dll) could not be registered properly. This should not happen, even less randomly (i.e. <strong>if</strong> it occurs it should be systematically on every execution and on every device, including when testing). Since registration occurs everytime at startup it's hard to see why testing (and Apple app approval) has not catched this.</p>

<p>Please fill a <a href="http://bugzilla.xamarin.com" rel="nofollow">bug</a> report including the exact version of MonoTouch being used and attach a log of the (release) build (add <code>-v -v -v</code> so we'll get more details about the build). Also attach the logs from where you gathered the above message - other lines of the same logs might gives us some clues.</p>
