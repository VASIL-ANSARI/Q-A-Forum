<p>We'd need to see the call into coredll that test.exe is making.  The return address (RA) tells you where in your app the call is coming from, you just have to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sloh/archive/2005/02/28/381706.aspx" rel="nofollow">decode it back to a line of code</a>.  A WAG is that you're passing a struct or byte array into an API call that is unaligned.  Again, without code, we can only guess.</p>
