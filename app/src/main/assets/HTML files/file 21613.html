<p>You may want <code>ipython -i yourscript.py</code>, which will execute your script in the interpreter environment. But this won't let you inspect the local environment where the exception happened, for example local variables within a function â you'll just be able to inspect globals. You probably want this instead:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: %run test.py
&lt;exception occurs&gt;
In [2]: %debug test.py
</code></pre>
