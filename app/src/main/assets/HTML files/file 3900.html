<p>It's a simple, but longer story. To make it short, you can check this article: <a href="http://www.arnebrodowski.de/blog/484-Django-Ajax-comment-deletion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.arnebrodowski.de/blog/484-Django-Ajax-comment-deletion.html</a> which contains a snippet (written with YUI, but its jQuery counterpart would be very similar: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/</a>) that performs AJAX query, which in turn deletes a comment.</p>

<p>The comment deletion view is built into <code>django.contrib.comments.views</code>, and you have to write your own view for deleting tags. It should look roughly like this:</p>

<pre><code>    def delete_tag_view(request, tag):
        tag_to_delete = get_object_or_404(Tag, title=tag)
        tag_to_delete.delete()
        return HttpResponse('OK') # This should really return JSON and/or some relevant HTTP status code
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you need to hook this into your URLconf:</p>

<pre><code>url(r'/tag/delete/(?P&lt;tag&gt;\w+)', 'tags.views.delete_tag_view', name='tag-delete')
</code></pre>
