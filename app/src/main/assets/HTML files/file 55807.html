<p>Sure, it is. The usual pattern for the code is</p>

<pre><code> ClassB classB = classA as ClassB;
 if (classB == null)
 {
     // do something else, probably return
 }
 classB.DoTheThingYouNeedClassBFor();
</code></pre>

<p>Though, as an aside, this situation is a bit of a "code smell". Usually, if you find yourself in that situation, there is room for improvement in your design. If you elaborate on the problem you are trying to solve, perhaps someone can suggest a better solution.</p>
