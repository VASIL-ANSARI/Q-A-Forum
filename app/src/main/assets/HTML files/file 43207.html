<p>The code you write here runs in Auth0 (in the cloud). Which means you'll need to use a hostname or IP address Auth0 can connect to.</p>

<p>If you're using a hostname like <code>DBSERVER01</code> or an IP address like <code>10.10.5.1</code> these are only available within your network and auth0 will not be able to reach them.</p>

<p>Make sure you use the public IP address of your network (like <code>45.19.3.29</code>) or a public facing hostname (like <code>mydb01.mycompany.com</code>).</p>
