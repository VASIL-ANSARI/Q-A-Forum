<p>Whats wrong with <code>has_many :enrollments, :through =&gt; :cohorts</code>? Thats a very natural way to do this.  Otherwise, You'll probably have to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>enrollments = u.cohorts.map(&amp;:enrollments).flatten
</code></pre>

<p>If you look at the SQL behind these, the has_many :through is better.</p>

<p>Since you already have a has_many :enrollments, you can define another relationship with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>has_many :cohorts_enrollments, :through =&gt; :cohorts, :source =&gt; :enrollments
</code></pre>

<p>Check out the options on has_many here: <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_many" rel="nofollow">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_many</a></p>
