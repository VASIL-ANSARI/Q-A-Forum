<p>I was able to get rid of errors by ways described in this <a href="http://openssl.6102.n7.nabble.com/openSSL-and-PKCS-12-certificates-td28100.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>.</p>

<p>It didn't solve my purpose though because the server I was trying to connect is a IIS based server and it only accepts <code>.pfx</code> certificates.</p>
