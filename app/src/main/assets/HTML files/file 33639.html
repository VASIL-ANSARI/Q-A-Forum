<p>As Sasquatch pointed out above, the issue is the delimiter you are using for split.  You want to split by a single comma ',' -- not by the three characters '(,)'.</p>

<p>The way your code is written, tokens only ever has a single value because the split delimiter is wrong.  It is matching the entire string variable list to your toBeAdded string and returning false.</p>
