<p>Without support from the server, JavaScript cannot find a file from a partial filename. What you can do, however, is have a little script on the server that does the partial-filename-matching for JavaScript, and then JavaScript can ask the server to do the match, and then when it gets the match back, it can use that filename.</p>

<p>If you don't mind loading a whole index of all the PDFs at once, you could use this little Python script to generate an index in a nice, JavaScript-friendly JSON format:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# Create an index of a bunch of PDF files.
# Usage: python make_index.py directory_with_pdf_files

import os
import sys
import json


def index(directory):
    index = {}

    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        base, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
        if ext.lower() != '.pdf':
            continue
        for keyword in base.split('_'):
            index[keyword] = filename

    with open(os.path.join(directory, 'index.json'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(index))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    index(sys.argv[1])
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can just load <code>index.json</code> with jQuery or what-have-you. When you need to find a particular PDF's filename, you can do something like this (assuming the object loaded from <code>index.json</code> is in the <code>indexOfPDFs</code> variable):</p>

<pre><code>var href = plotsFolder + indexOfPDFs[value];
</code></pre>
