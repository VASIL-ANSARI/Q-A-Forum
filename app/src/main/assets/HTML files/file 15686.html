<p>I think you are missing one small point.  Facebook needs to have a div like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It is necessary to have this above your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>.  I don't think facebook will work without it.</p>

<p>You may also need to have a call to the <code>FB.init()</code> funciton but I don't think it is always necessary.  So first try the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
