<p>Try this.. look's like you are sending  data object is wrong</p>

<pre><code>data: {"city": cityId }, // If cityID is a string this should do
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>data: '{"city":"' + cityId + '"}',
</code></pre>

<p>There might also be a problem with the way you are sending the url.. Try using a absolute path and check if that works..</p>
