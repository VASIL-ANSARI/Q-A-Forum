<p>The difference is between ORM and non-ORM, not declarative, which is just a helper for the ORM.</p>

<p>Query has a method <code>column_descriptions()</code> that was added for this purpose::</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.column_descriptions">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.column_descriptions</a></p>

<p>the example there seems like it has a typo, says "q.columns" but it should be "q.column_descriptions" (edit: just fixed it).</p>
