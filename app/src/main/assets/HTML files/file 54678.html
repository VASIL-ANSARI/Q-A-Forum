<p>Don't remember thymeleaf very well, but using user the iterator variable seems problematic. Perhaps change it to <code>u</code> and try ${u.name} or *{u.name}. There are differences in scope and whether to use <code>*</code> or <code>$</code>.</p>

<p>EDIT: The code I had does so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div th:each="case,status: *{cases}" class="panel-heading"&gt;
    &lt;span th:text="*{case.name}" &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It's using bootstrap, which is why it's wrapped in divs and spans.</p>
