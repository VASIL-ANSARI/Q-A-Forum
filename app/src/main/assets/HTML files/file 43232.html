<p>I found my mistake.</p>

<p>As manage_pages permission should be reviewed first, I was getting the access token with manage_pages permission from graph explorer. As it turned out, using different access_tokens will give you different user IDs. So, I will have to get my app reviewed.</p>

<p>This different ID thing is because of app_scoped IDs Facebook introduced recently.</p>
