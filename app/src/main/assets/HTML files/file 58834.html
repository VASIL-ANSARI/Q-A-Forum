<p>I can't comment so I'll put this in an answer. There's nothing wrong with your code, runs fine for me. 
Try overriding <code>onStop()</code> to check if it's being called when you're pressing the home button or at some other time.</p>

<pre><code>@override
protected void onStop(){
    super.onStop();
    Log.v("test", "stopped");
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>onStop()</code>is called if a higher priority app needs the memory. <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html#Lifecycle" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html#Lifecycle</a>.</p>

<p>If you really need the app to always remember when the <code>MediaPlayer</code> was paused maybe save it in a file or in <code>SharedPreferences</code>. </p>
