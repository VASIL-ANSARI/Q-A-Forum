<p>Try changing this line:</p>

<pre><code>var networkState = navigator.Connection.CELL, states = {};
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>var networkState = navigator.connection.type, states = {};
</code></pre>

<p>Also add this to your states object:</p>

<pre><code>states[Connection.CELL]     = 'Cell generic connection';
</code></pre>

<p>What the documentation is stating about iOS is that it cannot return the specific cell connection, so it passes a generic cell connection if one is detected.</p>
