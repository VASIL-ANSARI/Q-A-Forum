<p>According to the issue you've linked to, this is a memory limit being reached - which you may well get in any browser with limited memory.</p>

<p>The issue in Chrome is that the XHR doesn't throw an exception, so the error can't be caught and worked around - so it would appear that there is no fix available short of possibly increasing the memory available.</p>

<p>The File API is available with full support in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera and partial support in IE10:</p>
