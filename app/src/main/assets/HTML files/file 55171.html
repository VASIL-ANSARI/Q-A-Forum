<p>This is the way you should do it:</p>

<pre><code>  from ..helper_functions import utility
</code></pre>

<p>This will not work if you run your python program normally due to relative imports.</p>

<p>This is the way you are supposed to run it:</p>

<pre><code>python3 -m helper_functions.utility
</code></pre>

<p>But it's somewhat verbose, and doesn't mix well with a shebang line like #!/usr/bin/env python3.</p>

<p>Although it's not unique. Your package structure is more complex. You'll need to <strong>include the directory containing your package directory in PYTHONPATH</strong>, and do it like this.</p>

<p>from mypackage.mymodule import as_int</p>

<p>You can also do this. But this is not recommanded for beginners.
You just frob the PYTHONPATH in code first with this...</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import os

PACKAGE_PARENT = '..'
SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), os.path.expanduser(__file__))))
sys.path.append(os.path.normpath(os.path.join(SCRIPT_DIR, PACKAGE_PARENT)))

from mypackage.mymodule import as_int
</code></pre>
