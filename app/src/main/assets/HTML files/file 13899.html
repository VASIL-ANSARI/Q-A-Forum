<p>I'm not familiar with the book and from the code you've shown it's hard to say if this is correct or not. It comes down to what <code>LoadTransientState</code> actually does.</p>

<p>The approach you want to take to handling tombstoning is making sure that (as long as it makes sense within the application*) the app/page should be in the same state when the user returns to it as when they left.</p>

<p>So, if <code>LoadTransientState</code> is only concerned with the persistence of information while tombstoning, then it may be appropriate to move it inside the <code>if</code> block.<br>
If it deals with some other form of transient data then probably not.</p>

<p>Hopefully <code>LoadTransientState</code> will contain some logic to make sure it's not setting (or resetting) data that already exists (or has been set) internally and so will avoid any intended consequences of being called unnecessarily.</p>

<p>*Some obvious exceptions being live data, timers (possibly), real-time info, etc.</p>
