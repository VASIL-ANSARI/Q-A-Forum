<p>Just write an IComparer that would work as a chain of comparators.
In case of equality on each stage, it should pass eveluation to the next key part. If it's less then, or greater then, just return.</p>

<p>You need something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int comparision = 0;

foreach(i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
{
 comparision = a[i].CompareTo(b[i]) * comparisionSign[i];

 if( comparision != 0 )
  return comparision;
}
return comparision;
</code></pre>

<p>Or even simpler, you can go with:</p>

<pre><code>list.OrderBy(i=&gt;i.ID).ThenBy(i=&gt;i.Name).ThenByDescending(i=&gt;i.Supplier);
</code></pre>

<p>The first call return IOrderedEnumerable&lt;>, the which can sort by additional fields.</p>
