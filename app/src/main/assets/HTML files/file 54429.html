<p>The problem is that <code>input()</code> will only read until the first new line character. If you want to read multiple lines, you need to put <code>input()</code> in a loop. The problem then becomes how do you know when to break out of the loop? An easy solution would be to look for a flag that the stream of input is done, such as the string "EOF". For example:</p>

<pre><code>print("Paste text from email")

content = ""
line = input("&gt;")
while line != "EOF":
    content += line + "\n"
    line = input("&gt;")

file = open('file.txt','a')
file.write('\n' + '--new email--' + '\n' + content + "\n")
file.close() # don't forget to close your file!
</code></pre>

<p>You would then run the script, paste the email, and then type "EOF".</p>
