<p>Take something simple:</p>

<pre><code>int foo() {
  int  x = 5;
  int&amp; r = x;
  r = 10;
  return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation <em>may</em> use a pointer to <code>x</code> behind the scenes to implement that reference, but there's no reason it has to. It could just as well translate the code to the equivalent form of:</p>

<pre><code>int foo() {
  int x = 10
  return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then no pointers are needed whatsoever. The compiler can just bake it right into the executable that <code>r</code> is the same as <code>x</code>, without storing and dereferencing a pointer that points at <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>The point is, whether the reference requires any storage is an implementation detail that you shouldn't need to care about.</p>
