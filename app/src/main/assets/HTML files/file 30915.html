<p>Training a linear model on a dataset with 1e9 samples and 2 features is very likely to underfit or waste CPU / IO time in case the data is actually linearly separable. Don't waste time thinking about parallelizing such a problem with a linear model:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>either switch to a more complex class of models (e.g. train random forests on smaller partitions of the data that fit in memory and aggregate them)</p></li>
<li><p>or either select random subsamples of your dataset of increasing and train linear models. Measure the predictive accuracy on an held out test and stop when you see diminishing returns (probably after a couple 10s of thousands of samples of the minority class).</p></li>
</ul>
