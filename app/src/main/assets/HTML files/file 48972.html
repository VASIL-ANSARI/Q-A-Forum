<p>What you are doing is fine by replacing the menu from a php file that contains a "partial view" which is your menu HTML. The partial view relies upon the parent page code, so you don't need to duplicate any code from the parent script into the partial view. The partial view can expect there is script code on the parent page it can be used with.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I toggle between large menu and small menu however, the 
  sections contained in home.php that pertain to the id tags in the
  original menu HTML that loaded with home.php no longer work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem you are having though is that you need to ensure that the code on <code>home.php</code> that references these menus uses a parent container as its reference point instead of direct IDs. You are replacing elements (menus), so the bindings are lost when you do that unless you bind on a parent higher up the DOM that doesn't get replaced (remember that events bubble up).</p>

<p>From what I see in your code snippets, it looks like the menu is loaded into the <code>#search</code> container. So just ensure the code in <code>home.php</code> uses that container as the reference point, using something like <code>on</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#search').on('click', '#graphsButton', function() {
    // ...
});
</code></pre>
