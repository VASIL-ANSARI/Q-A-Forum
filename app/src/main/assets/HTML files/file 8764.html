<p>Since <code>char</code> is smaller than <code>int</code>, it would be the same. Except for leading zeros you would find in an <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>  6   int x = 123;
  7 
  8   printf ("Size of int is  %d bytes\n", sizeof(int));
  9   printf ("Size of char is %d byte\n", sizeof(char));
 10 
 11   printf ("Hex value is %x\n", x);
 12   printf ("Hex value is %x\n", (char)x);
 13 
 14   printf ("As for binary value .... google is your friend\n");
</code></pre>

<p>Output is:</p>

<pre><code>Size of int is  4 bytes
Size of char is 1 byte

Hex value is 7b
Hex value is 7b
</code></pre>

<p>As for binary value .... google is your friend
