<p>I made my own keyboard as well using LibGDX TextButtons. Since you are using images and not text, you could use the ImageButton instead. I then used the ChangeListener with the changed() method because it only triggers after pressing and releasing the button, which avoids repetitive characters while the button is being pressed.</p>

<pre><code>keyButton.addCaptureListener(new ChangeListener() {
@Override
    public void changed(ChangeEvent event, Actor actor){
        // key logic here
</code></pre>
