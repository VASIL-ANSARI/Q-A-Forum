<p>Starting from API 9 you have <code>java.net.CookieManager</code> and can set system-wide cookie handler like this:</p>

<pre><code>CookieManager cookieManager = new CookieManager();
cookieManager.setCookiePolicy(CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ALL);
CookieHandler.setDefault(cookieManager);
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, Apache Http client uses its own cookie-handling mechanism. But it should not be the problem because starting from API 9 HttpURLConnection is recommended HTTP client. 
If you use Retrofit from Square you may also like their OkHttp lib - custom URLConnection implementation with lots of useful capabilities.</p>
