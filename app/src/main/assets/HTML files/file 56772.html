<p>If I suppose you know the url for the notebook you want to open you could open it in the following way:</p>

<p>This code should be a code cell in your notebook:</p>

<pre><code>%%javascript
window.open('http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Name_of_the_notebook.ipynb')
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know the complete path (url) to the notebook you should, at least, know the name of the notebook you created. In this case you could do:</p>

<pre><code>%%javascript
var name_of_the_notebook = 'Name_of_the_notebook.ipynb'
var url = window.location.href.split('/')
var newurl = url[0] + '//'
for (var i = 1; i &lt; url.length - 1; i++) {
    console.log(url[i], newurl)
    newurl += url[i] + '/'
}
newurl += name_of_the_notebook
window.open(newurl)
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe the browser will ask if you want to open the new tab.</p>
