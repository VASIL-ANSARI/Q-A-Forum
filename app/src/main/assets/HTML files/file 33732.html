<p>That's the version of the file so that the file wouldn't be there in the cache. </p>

<p><strong>To make you clear:</strong> suppose you have <code>one.js</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="one.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>second time you modify your one.js and to make sure that this wouldn't be there in cache you'd do change the version of the file by querying like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="one.js?v=1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>would take this file without clean refresh the browser takes the one.js file assuming it's a new file <code>one.js?v=1</code> but actually this is taking just <code>one.js</code></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>They're all the same file - that's a query string which forces a non-cached version of the file.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you are seeing all of them while debugging then you can use last one file which is going to take action:</p>

<pre><code>jquery.min.js?2.0.0/eval/seq/511
</code></pre>
