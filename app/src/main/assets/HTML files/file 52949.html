<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.ChainMap" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.ChainMap</code></a>. It does the same thing as <code>MergeDict</code>: keeps a list of mappings and accesses them in order.</p>

<p>However it's generally simpler to just actually perform the merge of the dictionaries. It probably isn't impossible to add copying support to your custom class and just update it.</p>
