<p>First do a change in your Sp ..
Check max number of counts params that any department has..
Now all department will take columns equivalent to max number of params that a department have but having null values..
For Example
If dept1 has 2params and dept2 has 3params than the query will result 3 column in case of dept1 also but its param3 column will contain null or zero..</p>

<p>Now after binding grid you will check if it is dept1 grid then you'll hide param3 column.. </p>
