<p>It must be done in automated way. In each view controller you must define this method:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
</code></pre>

<p>in which you can set in what orientation your controller may be.</p>

<p>In iOS 5 or earlier <code>UIViewController</code> handles only portrait orientation by default.<br>
To handle other possible orientations you must implement this method in your view controller:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
{

    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to define methods to handle rotation:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>- (void)willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration
</code></pre>

<p>Or do it in automated way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Handling View Rotations</p>
  
  <p>In iOS 6, your app supports the interface orientations defined in your
  appâs Info.plist file. A view controller can override the
  supportedInterfaceOrientations method to limit the list of supported
  orientations. Generally, the system calls this method only on the root
  view controller of the window or a view controller presented to fill
  the entire screen; child view controllers use the portion of the
  window provided for them by their parent view controller and no longer
  participate in directly in decisions about what rotations are
  supported. The intersection of the appâs orientation mask and the view
  controllerâs orientation mask is used to determine which orientations
  a view controller can be rotated into.</p>
  
  <p>You can override the preferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation for
  a view controller that is intended to be presented full screen in a
  specific orientation.</p>
  
  <p>In iOS 5 and earlier, the UIViewController class displays views in
  portrait mode only. To support additional orientations, you must
  override the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: method and return
  YES for any orientations your subclass supports. If the autoresizing
  properties of your views are configured correctly, that may be all you
  have to do. However, the UIViewController class provides additional
  hooks for you to implement additional behaviors as needed. Generally,
  if your view controller is intended to be used as a child view
  controller, it should support all interface orientations.</p>
  
  <p>When a rotation occurs for a visible view controller, the
  willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:,
  willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration:, and
  didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation: methods are called during the
  rotation. The viewWillLayoutSubviews method is also called after the
  view is resized and positioned by its parent. If a view controller is
  not visible when an orientation change occurs, then the rotation
  methods are never called. However, the viewWillLayoutSubviews method
  is called when the view becomes visible. Your implementation of this
  method can call the statusBarOrientation method to determine the
  device orientation.</p>
  
  <p>Note: At launch time, apps should always set up their interface in a
  portrait orientation. After the
  application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method returns, the app
  uses the view controller rotation mechanism described above to rotate
  the views to the appropriate orientation prior to showing the window.</p>
