<p>Spring singleton is defined as "per container per bean"</p>

<p>If you want singleton per spring container below is what needs to be done in your bean definition</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id="myBean" class="MyBean"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the singleton per entire application and not per container, then I believe the only way you can do that is implement a Singleton pattern have a private constructor, access/retrieve it from its static method like getInstance. What you can do is allow spring to call a method that can in turn return an object</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id="myBean" class="MyBean" factory-method="getInstance"&gt;&lt;/bean&gt; 
</code></pre>
