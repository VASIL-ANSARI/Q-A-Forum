<blockquote>
  <p>If you specify no FIELDS or LINES clause, the defaults are the same
  as if you had written this:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '' ESCAPED BY '\\'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' STARTING BY ''
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Backslash is the MySQL escape character within strings in SQL
  statements, so to specify a literal backslash, you must specify two
  backslashes for the value to be interpreted as a single backslash. The
  escape sequences '\t' and '\n' specify tab and newline characters,
  respectively.)</p>
