<p>There are a few options</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is the easiest one. set a <code>[DeploymentItem("YourExcelFile")]</code> attribute on your Test class or Test method, that way you can refer to them from your config using a relative path of <code>.\YourExcelFile</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>This one is harder, since MsTest always drops the TestResults folder in the same location (relative to your solution) you can use a <code>..\..\..\..\Project\YourExcelFile</code> path to it. But beware, TFS' Team Build may use a different relative path and before you know it you need to do trickery in the build system for this to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the Excel file to a wellknown location, like <code>c:\TestSources\MyDataSource</code> and map the file to that location using your TFVC Source Control workspace setup. This will allow your test configuration to point to the full path, which it should always be able to find.</p></li>
</ol>
