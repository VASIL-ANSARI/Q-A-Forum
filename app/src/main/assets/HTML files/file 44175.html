<p>If you're children are using State and state is not updating, what about props? does that render just fine?  If the parent changes the state of the children and the children don't reflect that change those child components most likely need a unique key assigned to them which tells React that these items need to be updated when the state is updated on the parent.  I ran into a similar issue where props inside the child updated to reflect the parent but the state of the child would not update.  Once I added keys, the solution was resolved.  For further reading on this check out this blog that initially hinted the problem to me.  </p>

<p>There is also the official documentation from React that explains this situation. </p>
