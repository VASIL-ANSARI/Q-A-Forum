<p>Make sure your nib really really really is called MyViewController_iPad.xib, with that exact capitalization.</p>

<p>Make sure the xib file is in your target's list of things to be copied to the app on build.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure you've no Main Nib setting still in your Info.plist file. </p>

<p>Oh, and one more thing. There is no need for this code:</p>

<pre><code>if ([[UIDevice currentDevice] userInterfaceIdiom] == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone) {
    self.viewController = [[[ocrapiViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MyViewController" bundle:nil] autorelease];
} else {
    self.viewController = [[[ocrapiViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MyViewController_iPad" bundle:nil] autorelease];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Simply call <code>initWithNibName:@"MyViewController"</code>. If your iPad nib is named <em>MyViewController~ipad.xib</em> (note the twiddle, note the lowercase "ipad") it will be chosen automatically when you're on an iPad.</p>
