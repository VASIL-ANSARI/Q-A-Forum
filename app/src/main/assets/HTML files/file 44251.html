<p>As @JB Nizet say, using contains will save you a lot of work. However, It is important to understand what is happening in your code. </p>

<p>First of all, your print-statement does not print the iterator, but the current iterator item. Which is a service in your case.   </p>

<p>Second, you might not have provided custom implementation of the equals(..) method in Service. The default implementation of the equals method compares object references. I suppose, in your example, the services are equal whenever their venues and sessions match, not when their object references match. Therefore if you haven't overridden the equals-method, it might "act strangely".</p>

<p>Btw. whenever you override "equals", you should also override the hashCode method to prevent inconsistencies. This is especially important, if you are going to use the "contains" method from ArrayList.</p>
