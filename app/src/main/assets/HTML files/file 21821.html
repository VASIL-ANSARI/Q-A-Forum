  <p>[Does anyone have any experience] Or with using non-constexpr values for the time period of a clock ?</p>

<p>After reading through the standard (20.11.5, Class template duration), "period" is expected to be "a specialization of ratio":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remarks: If Period is not a specialization of ratio, the program is ill-formed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and all chrono templates rely heavily on constexpr functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does anyone have any experience with wrapping these kind of timers a la std:chrono ?</p>

<p>I've found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12787703/2050986">here</a> a suggestion to use a duration with period = 1, boost::rational as rep , though without any concrete examples.</p>
