<p>You will need to point connection parameters for your application to connect to queue manager on remote machine. For example:</p>

<pre><code>String queueManagerName = "&lt;Remote queue manager name&gt;";
String userID = "&lt;valid user existing on remote machine&gt;";
String password = "&lt;password for user&gt;";
String hostName = "&lt;remote host name&gt;";
String channel = "&lt;Channel name on remote queue manager&gt;";
int port = &lt;port number where queue manager is listening&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>But you will need to configure authentication and authorization on remote queue manager for application to connect. If that is not configured, then you will get MQRC 2035 - NOT_AUTHORIZED errors.</p>
