<p>Your problem is that you passed in <code>&amp;name</code>, which is a pointer to a pointer to the struct. So, in the <code>method</code>, you are accessing the <code>Somestructure **</code> as if it was a <code>Somestructure *</code>.</p>

<p>Just pass in <code>(int)name</code>.</p>

<p>(P.S. the usual way to define a "generic argument" is to use <code>void *</code>.)</p>
