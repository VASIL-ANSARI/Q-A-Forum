<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The issue with the code in the question is that it has an infinite loop at the top. None of the code below this will ever execute:</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    print sock.recv(256)
</code></pre>

<p>(And apparently this particular server doesn't send a message until it's received one first, so it will never send anything.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's a simple working example. If this doesn't help, you'll need to provide more context in your question.</p>

<p>Here's the client:</p>

<pre><code>import socket
s = socket.socket()
s.connect(('localhost', 12345))
while True:
    print s.recv(256)
</code></pre>

<p>Corresponding server code:</p>

<pre><code>import socket
import time

s = socket.socket()
s.bind(('', 12345))
s.listen(0)
conn, addr = s.accept()
while True:
    conn.send("Hello")
    time.sleep(10)
</code></pre>
