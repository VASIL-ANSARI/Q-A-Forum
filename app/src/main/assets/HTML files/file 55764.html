<p>By default, XMLHttpRequests are limited to same domain requests (i.e. request between localhost and localhost or request between paypal.com and paypal.com).</p>

<p>Cross-site XMLHttpRequests (like from localhost to paypal.com) are disabled by default as a security feature in modern browsers, in order to bypass this security feature, the destination server should explicitly allow cross-site requests and this is done by sending back a header called "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" with either * or specific domain as value, for example when a server replies back with the following header:</p>

<pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
</code></pre>

<p>It is telling the browser of visitor that I'm accepting an XMLHttpRequest from <strong>any domain</strong>.</p>

<p>In your case, you are doing a request on https://<strong>svcs.sandbox.paypal.com</strong>/AdaptivePayments/Pay which doesn't allow cross-site requests (no Access-Control-Allow-Origin is present) and thus the browser is blocking XMLHttpRequest from going through.</p>
