<p>The reason it is producing the url <code>/mail/4.3</code> is because <code>mail_path</code> only takes one parameter, so it takes the second as a format. This is because the <code>mail_path</code> url helper that you're using isn't for the <code>DELETE</code> route that you've posted in your question, but some other route.</p>

<p>The Rails Way would be to have nested resources for <code>mail</code> and <code>user</code> like:</p>

<pre><code>resources :users do
  resources :mail
end
</code></pre>

<p>Giving you the route helper <code>user_mail_path(@user, @mail)</code> (or something similar depending on pluralisation of mail) and the URL <code>/users/4/mail/3</code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, to continue on your path you'll probably have to name your delete route:</p>

<pre><code>delete 'mail/:user_id/:id', to: 'mail#destroy', as: 'delete_mail'
</code></pre>

<p>and use <code>delete_mail_path(user_id, mail.id)</code> in your link.</p>
