<p>I'd use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern" rel="nofollow">Observer pattern</a> for this as this is basically what you are looking for. On Android you can implemented it yourself (1 screen of code) or use existing implementations if you wish like EventBus like <a href="https://github.com/square/otto" rel="nofollow">OTTO</a> or <a href="https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus" rel="nofollow">GreenRobot's</a>.</p>
