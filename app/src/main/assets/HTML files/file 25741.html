<p>Not sure if I get the problem right. 
Just as you could reach members i, f with a PTM you can do the same with S. You don't need a separate funcition to access s and s2: a single function will do with an extra argument of type <code>S A::*</code>. </p>

<p>Or if the types must be variable, you can extend your read function something like:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename Stream, typename Class, typename Type, typename Class2, typename Type2&gt;
void read(Stream&amp; s, Class&amp; out, Type Class::*member, Type2 Class2::*member2)
{
    s &gt;&gt; ((out.*member).*member2);
} 
</code></pre>

<p>and use it like <code>read(stream, a, &amp;A::s, &amp;S::u);</code></p>

<p>(I don't have compiler at hand to test it, it may need some touch-up)</p>
