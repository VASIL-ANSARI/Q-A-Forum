<p>When you use <code>$http</code>, this uses an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object which does not adjust the location for the user. It will even follow redirects. You have a couple options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You could return the new location as a field, then in the <code>.then</code> callback, assign <code>window.location</code> to cause a redirect.</p></li>
<li><p>You could use a standard form to post to the resource, then the browser would follow the redirects appropriately.</p></li>
</ul>
