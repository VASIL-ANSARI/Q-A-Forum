<p>You're not going to be able to see something without plugging the histogram into some kind of charting component.  The <code>Histogram</code> that AForge generates is a list of the sums of the values (represented as an array of <code>int</code>s in the <code>Values</code> property) for each line (for <code>HorizontalIntensityStatistics</code>) or column (for <code>VerticalIntensityStatistics</code>).</p>

<p>If you have a perfect binary image of black text on a white background, the pixel rows that represent the leading between lines will be all white, so their value in the <code>VerticalIntensityStatistics</code> will be <code>(imageWidth * 255)</code>.</p>
