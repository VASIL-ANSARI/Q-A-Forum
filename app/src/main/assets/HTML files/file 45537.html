<p>Have you solved that issue?
It looks like implementation does not guarantee the order. So what you might do is to check re callback result (<code>onRealTimeMessageSent</code>) for this message id (called token and retuned by <code>sendReliableMessage</code>), and only when the result is OK, send the next packet.</p>
