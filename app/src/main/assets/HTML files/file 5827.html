<p>One of the things about rules is that they can be executed many, many times.  Particularly if you make an error with your rule conditions.  That obviously has a performance impact.  </p>

<p>I'm inclined then to prefer option A, prepare your facts outside, and insert them into working memory for evaluation.</p>

<p>Certainly, there is also the option of partitioning the rules into data loading rules then business rule evaluation (using Rule flow for instance).   </p>

<p>That would give you declarative control of populating your data outside of code.</p>
