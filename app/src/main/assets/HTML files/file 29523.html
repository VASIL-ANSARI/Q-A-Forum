<p>If you are working under MVVM, one approach is to create a property in the ViewModel which will handle the logic and return a boolean indicating if the checkbox should be visible or not. </p>

<p>The second check box will have to be bound to a property as well, and be sure to do a TwoWay binding so that the property is updated when the checkbox is checked or not.</p>
