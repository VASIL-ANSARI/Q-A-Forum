<p>You definitely need a <code>push()</code> in the right direction, maybe an <code>array_push()</code> in your server page that creates the <code>getJSON</code> response. ;-)</p>

<p>Your response object is currently not an Array, so your <code>$.each()</code> will instead go through each of your properties in your json object and will then not find the expected properties again. </p>

<p>A json object like</p>

<pre><code>[{ "ItemCount":1, "ProductID":"4220002", "ProdMfg":"", "Desc":"", "Quantity":33, "UnitPrice":1, "ExtPrice":33 }]
</code></pre>

<p>where you place your original objects as elements into an array would probably work. </p>
