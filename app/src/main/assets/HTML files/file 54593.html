<p>If I understand right, the job you do is CPU-bound. Now, if you split the job in smaller pieces, you add overhead for each split. However, if this allows you to execute the pieces in parallel, the overall time is reduced. Now, if you split this in more pieces than you can execute in parallel (which is the number of CPUs), you only add overhead! Even worse, you add context switches (including cache invalidation) to the overhead, so the required time may well degrade.</p>
