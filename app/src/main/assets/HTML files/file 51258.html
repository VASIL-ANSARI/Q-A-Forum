<p>So as the case would have it, A little more fiddling resulted in the answer.  When running the command though the standard <code>psql</code> interface, I needed to escape the <code>$</code> to <code>\$</code>.</p>

<p>However, this continued to fail when running:</p>

<pre><code>heroku pg:psql -c "UPDATE users SET encrypted_password = 'hash_with_\$_in_string';"
</code></pre>

<p>The answer to this was to <strong>double escape</strong>  the characters, meaning:</p>

<pre><code>heroku pg:psql -c "UPDATE users SET encrypted_password = 'hash_with_\\\$_in_string';"
</code></pre>

<p>Once both the <code>\</code> and the <code>$</code> are each escaped, the heroku toolbelt properly interpreted the hash and all is well.</p>
