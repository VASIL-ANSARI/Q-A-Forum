<p>You'll have to use a session to have variables float around in between files like that.</p>

<p>It's quite simple to setup. In the beginning of each PHP file, you add this code to begin a session:</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
</code></pre>

<p>You can store variables inside of a session like this:</p>

<pre><code>$_SESSION['foo'] = 'bar';
</code></pre>

<p>And you can reference them across pages (make sure you run <code>session_start()</code> on all of the pages which will use sessions).</p>
