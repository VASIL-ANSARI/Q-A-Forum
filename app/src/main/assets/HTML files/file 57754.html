<p>There are a couple of options on how to approach this, but I think the simplest one is going to be using the UNION operator.  Try this:</p>

<pre><code>Option Compare Database
</code></pre>

<p>Option Explicit</p>

<p>Dim UDA817 As String
UDA817 = "UDA00817_00"</p>

<p>//'MARK_PER_UDA_00817 is a field name in my MASTER table</p>

<p>sql2 = "INSERT INTO MASTER ([MARK_PER_UDA_00817]) " _
        &amp; "SELECT [F4] " _
        &amp; "FROM " &amp; UDA817 &amp; ";" &amp; _
        "UNION " &amp; _
        "SELECT Field 1, Field 2 " &amp; _
        "FROM  tblTable2 "</p>

<p>'// Utilize the UNION operator to concatenate 2 or more SELECT strings</p>
