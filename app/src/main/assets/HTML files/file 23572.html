<p>With your basic assumption that as soon as they hit "Buy Now" they have bought the item, you would need to store some values in a persistent datastore, such as a database or a flat file. Then, depending on what you choose, you can use code similar to the following to hide the button:</p>

<pre><code>if ( hasItemBeenBought( itemId ) )
{
    echo "Looks like you missed out :(";
} else {
    echo "&lt;button&gt;Buy Now&lt;/button&gt;"; // Replace with PayPal specific button
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have to agree with Stacey's comment though, this question is rather broad to just have a simple answer. PHP is stateless and won't remember anything that a previous user has done which is why you'll often find it as part of a *AMP stack (Apache, MySql &amp; PHP).</p>
