<p>Can you encapsulate usage of the framework to small set of functions, that could be described by an interface?</p>

<p>If so, and if you are in an Application-Server Environment, you could do something like this:</p>

<p>Define your Interface and put it to the lib-Folder of your app-server with two factory-methods.
Your app goes to WebArchive1
Framework in Version 1 goes to WebArchive2 and populates factory-method1 from your lib-Folder
Framework in Version 2 goes to WebArchive3 and populates factory-method2 from your lib-Folder</p>

<pre><code>--&gt; lib
public interface MyInterface {
   // do Stuff
}

public class MyFactory {
  private static MyInterface v1;
  private static MyInterface v2;

  public MyInterface getV1() {...}
  public MyInterface getV1() {...}
}

--&gt; WebArchive2
MyFactory.setV1(new Lib());

--&gt; WebArchive3
MyFactory.setV2(new Lib());
</code></pre>
