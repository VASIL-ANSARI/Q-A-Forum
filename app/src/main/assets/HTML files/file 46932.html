<p>I am afraid there isn't one.</p>

<p>Even if there was one, what would you want to see where multiple tables were queried in a join and one or more had NOLOCK which is read uncommitted?</p>

<p>The profiler reports queries at the statement level not the table level so you would have a mix of transaction isolation levels (this is true of the profiler and extended events)</p>

<p>The best you could do is to manually parse the statement start (batch and procedure) and look for the set transaction isolation level.</p>
