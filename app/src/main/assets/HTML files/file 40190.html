  <p>Canât we launch an activity from a service ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can call <code>startActivity()</code> on a <code>Service</code> or any other <code>Context</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If so, will the service keep running in background in a separate thread and the launched activity in foreground as a separate thread ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Java, objects do not run on threads. Methods run on threads. The fact that the activity was launched from a service does not affect this at all. Pretty much everything with both an <code>Activity</code> and a <code>Service</code> by default occurs on the main application thread, and that too does not change because the <code>Service</code> launched an <code>Activity</code>.</p>
