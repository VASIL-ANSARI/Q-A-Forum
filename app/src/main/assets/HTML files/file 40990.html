<p>You don't need to create any extension, as it's possible to disable it easily with TypoScript (Setup field)</p>

<pre><code>config.disableAllHeaderCode = 1
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptReference/Setup/Config/Index.html#disableallheadercode" rel="nofollow">@See the docs</a></p>

<p>of course in such case, you need to add all the header into your template.</p>

<p>Also this flag is usefull, when you want to render i.e. pure JSON (or other data) from your Extbase ext included to the specifig <code>typeNum</code> via bootsrtap</p>
