<p>I ended up creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B/CLI" rel="nofollow">C++/CLI</a> project to wrap the C project to .NET.</p>

<p>I found it much easier to manage the unmanaged code using C++, and I ended up with a nice interop to C# as my class became .NET accessible.</p>

<p>I would recommend this path, and will do it myself - the next time I need to integrate C# with a C lib.</p>
