<p>You cannot do this, because multiple inheritance from classes is not allowed:</p>

<pre><code>class SoftwareEngineer : Employee, System.Object
</code></pre>

<p>Line above will give you compilation error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'SoftwareEngineer' cannot have multiple base classes: 'Employee' and
  'System.Object'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But thus <code>Employee</code> implicitly inherits from <code>System.Object</code> that means <code>SoftwareEngineer</code> also will be inherited from <code>System.Object</code> (you can think of it  as 'vertical' inheritance):</p>

<pre><code>class Employee : System.Object

class SoftwareEngineer : Employee
</code></pre>
