<p>Use the <code>$_REQUEST</code> global variable.  The <code>$_POST</code> variable is only populated if the data was "posted" and <code>$_GET</code> is only populated when the HTTP query string is sent.  <code>$_REQUEST</code> is populated by both methods.  However, you should be more wary of insertion attacks during <code>FORM</code> posting so sanitation/validation of user important remains critical when using <code>$_REQUEST</code>.</p>
