<p>As far as I know, you cannot. You can, however, get the amount of memory used for the program:</p>

<pre><code> Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
 System.out.println("Used: " + (rt.totalMemory() - rt.freeMemory());
 System.out.println("Free: " + rt.freeMemory());
 System.out.println("Total: " + rt.totalMemory());
</code></pre>
