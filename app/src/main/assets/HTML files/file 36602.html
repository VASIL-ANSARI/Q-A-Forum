<p>As far as I know, the latest std::string implementations are using Small String Optimization (SSO) instead of reference counting (because some performance caveats on multicore systems, due to needed locking). SSO consists of having an automatic fixed-sized array for small strings (for, say, 8 characters or so); so, if your string is small, there will not be need to allocate, deallocate memory on the heap.</p>

<p>The problem with SSO is that the performance of moving (using move semantics) a string to other one is not better than copying it if the string is small (because the whole fixed-size array must be copied).</p>

<p>So, use const references or rvalue references when possible and avoid to use pass-by-value.</p>
