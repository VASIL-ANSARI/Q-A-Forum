<p>I don't know if it is possible to detect. One "workaround" is use a task manager (grunt, gulp, whatever) to copy configuration files from on folder to other. Then instead of running "cordova run android" (example) at the command line, you would run a task that copies the config file(s) from one specific folder (i.e.: development or production) an the application read the copied file.</p>
