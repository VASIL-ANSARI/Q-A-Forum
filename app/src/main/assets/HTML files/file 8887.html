  <p>I used to do the transparent background with javax.swing.JLabel this way: </p>
  
  <p>lbl.setBackground(new Color(0, 0, 0, 0));. </p>

<p>That doesn't do anything. A JLabel is transparent by default (ie setOpaque(false)). You may want to read <a href="http://tips4java.wordpress.com/2009/05/31/backgrounds-with-transparency/" rel="nofollow">Background With Transparency</a> to understand how tranparency works with Swing.</p>

<p>I've never used a Label but if it works anything like a JLabel, then I would guess you override the isOpaque() method to return false.</p>
