<p>We build static sites with <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/" rel="nofollow">middleman</a>. There are a lot of features, but mainly it's just a very handy static site generator (for development and production). As a plus middleman is a quite popular thing.</p>

<p>And another known option is a <a href="http://get-serve.com/" rel="nofollow">Serve</a>. It may be useful for rails prototypes or for those people, who already familiar with rails.</p>

<p>But I still prefer middleman because it's more popular (Serve just more younger, not worse).</p>

<p>As about your question: in both tools you can split HAML views into partials, layouts, etc.</p>

<p>Also, take a look at <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/static_website_generation" rel="nofollow">this category</a>. </p>
