<p>The problem is that "Mother Dairy, Bhim Nagri, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India" cannot be found. You can test whether the endpoints can be found by entering them (one at a time) in the <a href="https://google-developers.appspot.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-simple" rel="nofollow">Google Geocoder Sample page</a>.</p>

<p>However, "Bhim Nagri, Hauz Khas, New Delhi, India" <em>can</em> be found, and is fairly close to where "Mother Dairy" is marked on the map.</p>
