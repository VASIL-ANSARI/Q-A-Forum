<p>Blizzard's World of Warcraft I believe implements this beautifully.</p>

<p>Basically, if you try to sign into the game after already being signed in, the first connection is kicked off. </p>

<p>This basically just entails making the session stored on the database. When you store the session data, store a username too. When a user logs in, delete any session records with that users name, and then create a new one for the person logging in.</p>

<p>I wouldn't suggest blocking 'new' people trying to log in, because users don't want to have to go back to another computer they have (possibly miles away) just because they forgot to log out.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are also some other things you might have to think of. Things like sessionid hijacking. If a user just puts a cookie on their system (which is always possible) with the right sessionid, it is possible that they could use the same session on multiple computers. In which case you'd probably want to keep an IP field where you keep the data on who is currently logged on.</p>
