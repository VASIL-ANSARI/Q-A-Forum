<p>I'm surprised you are not getting any warning either.</p>

<p>What you are doing is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa691135%28v=vs.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><em>hiding</em></a> the protected member <code>provider</code> by providing a new declaration for it in the derived class. This is allowed, but you <em>should</em> decorate the declaration with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/435f1dw2.aspx" rel="nofollow">new</a> keyword to make it more explicit that you intended to hide the member and it was not just an accident/oversight.</p>
