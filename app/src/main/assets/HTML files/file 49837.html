<ol>
<li>Both of your projects have to target <code>DNX Core 5</code> if your main (<code>Api</code>) project supports it </li>
<li>You can't reference .net project that has higher version than source one. So both of your projects should target 4.6</li>
</ol>

<p>The way you described the problem I'm not sure if <code>Services</code> is normal (let's call it <em>old</em>) Class Library or ASP.NET 5 Class Library. If it is <em>old</em> then your main project can not target core clr. Just remove this TFM from <code>project.json</code>.</p>
