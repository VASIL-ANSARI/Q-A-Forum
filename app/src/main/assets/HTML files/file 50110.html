<p>You should check out Laravel-Stapler. Very useful for handling image uploads in Laravel. <a href="https://github.com/CodeSleeve/laravel-stapler" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/CodeSleeve/laravel-stapler</a> </p>

<p>Rather then saving an image and checking if it exists you can attach (or "Staple") an image to a model. </p>

<p>An example taken from the docs on how to setup the form is below. </p>

<pre><code> &lt;?= Form::open(['url' =&gt; action('UsersController@store'), 'method' =&gt; 'POST', 'files' =&gt; true]) ?&gt;
    &lt;?= Form::input('first_name') ?&gt;
    &lt;?= Form::input('last_name') ?&gt;
    &lt;?= Form::file('picture') ?&gt;
    &lt;?= Form::submit('save') ?&gt;
 &lt;?= Form::close() ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The model would have something like this in the controller:</p>

<pre><code> $this-&gt;hasAttachedFile('picture', [
        'styles' =&gt; [
            'thumbnail' =&gt; '100x100',
            'large' =&gt; '300x300',
            'pictureCropped' =&gt; '75x75#'
        ],
        'url' =&gt; '/system/:attachment/:id_partition/:style/:filename',
        'default_url' =&gt; '/:attachment/:style/missing.jpg'
    ]);
</code></pre>

<p>Then all you do in the controller is <code>User::create(Input::all());</code></p>

<p>Checking existence of "attachments" is as easy as <code>if ($user-&gt;picture) ...</code></p>

<p>So the saving of the file is already taking care of by Stapler and the cropping is done automatically via the <code>'pictureCropped' =&gt; '75x75#'</code> configuration. This should remove enough of the code that you don't need to make another method.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
