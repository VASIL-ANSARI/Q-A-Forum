<li><p>You can use TIME() to get just the time part of a date.  If the time parts are the same it is an exact multiple.</p></li>
<li><p>For the two hour thing, one way to do it would be to get the minute/seconds part of the date, make sure those are equal, then make sure that the hour parts of the dates are both even or both odd.  For more complicated integer (e.g. 5) hour multiples, you can "fake" doing a mod by dividing the hour parts and checking if the result is an int.</p></li>
