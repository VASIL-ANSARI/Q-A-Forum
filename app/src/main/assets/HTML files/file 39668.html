<p>If I understand your code, you're trying to assign your Students and Faculty to teams by keeping separate arrays of pointers to Person objects presumably Student and Faculty both inherit from Person).</p>

<p>If this is correct, then you want your teams to be made of of arrays of pointers.</p>

<p><code>Person* t1Arr[12]</code></p>

<p>What you have declared instead of are arrays of pointers-to-pointers, which has it's uses, but those are pretty rare.</p>
