<p>I am pretty sure it is dependant on your compiler, perhaps yours is using byte instead of int for bool? Either way you shouldn't have memory allocation problems if you use sizeof() to know how much memory to allocate, for example, if you want to allocate 10 bools worth of memory, don't allocate 10 * 4, do 10 * sizeof(bool) so you can't go wrong.</p>
