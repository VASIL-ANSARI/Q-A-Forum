<p>You have two problems here. The first problem is that you are using <code>std::endl</code>, but that is defined in <code>&lt;ostream&gt;</code>, which is not included.</p>

<p>The second problem is that you are only including the header <code>&lt;iosfwd&gt;</code>, which forward declares many of the iostream types. Forward declaration lets the compiler know that the types <em>exist</em>. However, you are trying to use these types' <em>functionality</em>. Since you are doing that, you should include <code>&lt;ostream&gt;</code>, rather than <code>&lt;iosfwd&gt;</code>. <code>&lt;ostream&gt;</code> contains <code>std::endl</code>, so that should take care of everything.</p>
