<p>You can use Maven + m2eclipse plug-in within Eclipse to get a dependency tree. There is a dependency tree tab within m2eclipse with a very graphical view of the dependencies. However I know Maven has a learning curve. But maybe that's OK. Only you can decide if you will get enough of a return on learning it to make it worthwhile. Other than that, I don't know of any plug-ins off the top of my head that will generate something similar. </p>
