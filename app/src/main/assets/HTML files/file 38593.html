<p>The issue isn't easy to solve because of the fundamental differences in the file systems. (<strong>Edit: Ignore me, I'm clearly on Cough Medicine. As Djon pointed out below</strong>).</p>

<p><em>Windows\Uses\Folder\Structures\Like\This.txt</em></p>

<p><em>Linux/Uses/Folder/Structures/Like/This.txt</em></p>

<p><em>So, the only way to handle this accordingly is to detect the operating system it runs on first, and then build your file paths accordingly.</em></p>

<p>See this question for more details:</p>
