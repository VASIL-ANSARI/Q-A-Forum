<p>One option would be to write it on a local server with PHP/ASP.NET, and then simply invoke PHP or ASP.NET locally to process the page; save the resulting output to html files, and upload those (you could automate this fairly easily via a scripting language). Nothing says the ASP/PHP parser has to be run on page request; it could be run much earlier than that. :)</p>
