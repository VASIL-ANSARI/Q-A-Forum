<p>You're not in <code>NSDefaultRunLoopMode</code> while scrolling a <code>UIScrollView</code>; you're in <code>UITrackingRunLoopMode</code>. So any timer scheduled only for the former won't fire in the latter.  You can add your <code>CADisplayLink</code> to multiple run loop modes by calling <code>addToRunLoop:forMode:</code> repeatedly, or call it once with <code>NSRunLoopCommonModes</code>, which covers both modes. </p>

<p>They talked about this in detail, and other issues with integrating scroll views with GL, at WWDC 2012 in Session 223: "Enhancing User Experience with Scroll Views"; I recommend watching the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/">video</a>, as there's lots of other stuff in there that's likely relevant to your situation.</p>
