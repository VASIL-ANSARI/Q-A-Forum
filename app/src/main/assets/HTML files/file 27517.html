<p><code>CGDataProviderCopyData</code> returns an ownership, like its name says: <em>Copy</em> functions are among those <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/Ownership.html">so documented</a>.</p>

<p>So, you own that data object.</p>

<p>ARC does not manage CF objects by default, and a <code>__bridge</code> cast does not change ARC's memory management of an object: it will not cause ARC to retain the object nor to release it.</p>

<p>Thus, because you used <code>__bridge</code>, you are still obliged to release the data.</p>

<p>Option 1 is to uphold your obligation and release the data yourself, by calling <code>CFRelease((__bridge CFDataRef)data)</code>.</p>

<p>Option 2 is to tell ARC âhere, dispose of this when I'm done with itâ. To do that, you need to use a <code>__bridge_transfer</code> cast to transfer management of the object to ARC.</p>

<p><strong>Choose only one of these options.</strong> If you transfer management of the object to ARC, <em>don't</em> release it yourselfâthe transfer means that you no longer need to do that; you've transferred that responsibility to ARC.</p>

<hr>

<p>While we're on the subject of releasing things: <strong>You do not need to, and should not, release <code>imageRef</code>.</strong> The UIImage owns that and you don't. You will cause a crash if you release it out from under the UIImage that owns it.</p>
