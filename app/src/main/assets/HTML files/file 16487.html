<p>You can only use HierarachyViewer on the emulator and special developer phones bought from google.</p>

<p>Quote from above link</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HierarchyViewer does not work on user builds (i.e. with devices 
  available in stores.) This is for security reasons. If HiearchyViewer 
  was able to work on user builds, any application on your desktop (or 
  even on the phone in some cases) could potentially get access to 
  private information (like logins and passwords.) </p>
