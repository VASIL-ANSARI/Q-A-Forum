<p>You can run the pages on Google Chrome and just observe the console for errors(if there are any). This is because if the pages built in phonegap, run properly on Chrome browser then they will run fine on emulator or actual device. You can activate the <strong>console</strong> by pressing the F12 key.</p>

<p>Also you can try using <strong><code>rel="external"</code></strong> at the end of <code>&lt;data role=button&gt;</code> like <br><code>&lt;data role=button.....rel=external&gt;</code>. It may help to open the pages properly.</p>
