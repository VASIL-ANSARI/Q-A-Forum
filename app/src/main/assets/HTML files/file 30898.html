<p>The <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code> method only returns the current absolute position and dimension of an <em>element</em> (being a canvas, image or any other element).</p>

<p>Just calling it does nothing - it returns an object with some properties you can read and the use for something:</p>

<pre><code>var rectangle = element.getBoundingClientRect();

console.log(rectangle.left, rectangle.top, rectangle.width, rectangle.height)
</code></pre>

<p>and there is also <code>right</code> and <code>bottom</code> for convenience. Note that padding and border is included if those are applied.</p>

<p>If you clear the canvas you will need to redraw everything on it as canvas is a passive bitmap only holding pixels with whatever was draw on it including the image (you are not showing the code of your <code>draw()</code> method so excuse me for being generic here and it's not clear how you intend to use this method in this regard).</p>

<p>(If your image covers the entire canvas you don't event need to clear it, just redraw the image).</p>
