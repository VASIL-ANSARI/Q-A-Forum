<p>As I can see, this is the block that belongs to some 3-d party extension (or smb might have written it). That's why you should locate the block and correct the collection of products it receives via the getBestSellers method.  </p>

<p>If you want to see only the last 3 updated products, the easiest way is to add 'order DESC' by 'updated_at' to the collection</p>

<p>Thus, the first 3 products will be the last updated on the list. It will look like that: </p>

<pre><code>$collection-&gt;setOrder('update_at', Varien_Data_Collection_Db::SORT_ORDER_DESC);
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to get populated some other field, that is different from the 'updated_at', just use its name instead of 'updated_at'. </p>

<p>Note, that you should implement all the changes before the collection gets downloaded. </p>

<p>The block can be find via 'updated_at' or by means of the layout. Additionally, you can search for updated_at inside of the template. Use the most convenient for you method.  </p>
