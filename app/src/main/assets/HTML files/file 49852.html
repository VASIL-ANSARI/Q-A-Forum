<p>You're experiencing "starvation".  Add a small <code>nanosleep</code> call occasionally to give the other threads a chance to run.  Add the call outside the mutex pair (e.g. after the unlock).  Thread 1 is monopolizing things.</p>

<p>You may also want to consider restructuring and splitting up the critical [requires locking] vs non-critical work:</p>

<pre><code>while (more) {
    lock ...
        do critical stuff ...
    unlock ...
    nanosleep ...
    do non-critical stuff
}
</code></pre>
