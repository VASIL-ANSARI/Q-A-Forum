<p>An object-viewing tool (like <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/objdump" rel="nofollow">objdump</a> or <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/177429" rel="nofollow">dumpbin</a>) can disassemble the output object files for you.  Then you can poke around and see what instructions are getting emitted for the functions/methods you care about.</p>
