<p>Your code lacks at least 2 things:</p>

<p>1: When posting with Ajax, you have to send post data. So you have to tell what data you want to send. Most of the time it will be the <em>serialized form</em> data, but it could be anything.</p>

<pre><code>var dataString = 'name=Gr G';
$.ajax(
  {
    url: 'shipprocess.php',
    dataType: 'json',
    data: dataString,
    type: 'POST',
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>2: You expect a return value, but you do not send a return value. In <code>shipprocess.php</code> after processing you should echo somethning like this:</p>

<pre><code>...    
echo 'data received and processed';
...
</code></pre>
