<p>Java was always stingy on new L&amp;F. So new WPF style (developed for Windows 8 apps) is not available yet and i doubt it will be anytime soon.</p>

<p>The latest L&amp;F released and provided together with Java SE was NimbusLookAndFeel. It is based on SynthLookAndFeel, which supposed to be a base for any custom L&amp;F from now on.</p>

<p>There are also native L&amp;Fs with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 2000 and Vista/7 styles (WindowsLookAndFeel)</li>
<li>GTK style (GTKLookAndFeel)</li>
<li>Mac OS style (AquaLookAndFeel)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some good commercial L&amp;Fs: 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3954616/java-look-and-feel-lf">Java Look and Feel (L&amp;F) </a></p>

<p>So if you really want to have such L&amp;F - you will have to modify some existing L&amp;F so it matches WPF styling or wait for a miracle (that someone will release such L&amp;F).</p>
