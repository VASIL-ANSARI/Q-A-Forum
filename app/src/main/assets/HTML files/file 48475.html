<p>Add the chrome webdriver location to your java call:</p>

<p>java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.46.0.jar -timeout=20 -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=C:\path-to\chromedriver.exe</p>

<p>If you decide to use the IE Driver as well, you will need to add it, like:</p>

<p>-Dwebdriver.ie.driver=C:\path-to\IEDriverServer.exe</p>
