<p>Not sure how subdomain factors into this at all. Perhaps you're confusing subdomain with route namespacing (http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#controller-namespaces-and-routing)?</p>

<pre><code>match '/' =&gt; 'site_admin/admin#index'
</code></pre>

<p>Is being selected over</p>

<pre><code>root :to =&gt; 'info#home'
</code></pre>

<p>Because it's defined first in the routes file. They're ostensibly the same thing. </p>
