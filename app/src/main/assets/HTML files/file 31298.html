<p>You're trying to get a SUM of SUMs (noz needed in that case) and you want to reuse an alias, both are not allowed in Standard SQL (without Derived Tables). </p>

<p>If it's only for sorting you simply need to </p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY ms1 + ms0 + ms2 + alt + ust + tg_0_1 + tg_2_3 + tg_4_6 + tg_7 + kg_var + kg_yok DESC
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to display the TOTAL in your SELECT list you need to repeat the calculation:</p>

<pre><code>   sum(case when t.tahmin = 1 and t.result = 1 then 1 else 0 end) * 1 +
   sum(case when t.tahmin = 2 and t.result = 1 then 1 else 0 end) * 3 +
   ....
   sum(case when t.tahmin = 11 and t.result = 1 then 1 else 0 end) * 1 as TOTAL
</code></pre>

<p>or better use a Derived Table:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT username, id, tahmins_no, 
       winnings,
       loses,
       ms1,
       ms0,
       ...
       kg_yok,
       ms1 + ms0 + ms2 + alt + ust + tg_0_1 + tg_2_3 + tg_4_6 + tg_7 + kg_var + kg_yok as TOTAL
FROM 
  (
    your existing query (without ORDER BY)
  ) as dt
ORDER BY TOTAL DESC
</code></pre>
