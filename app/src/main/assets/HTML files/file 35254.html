<p>syntatically, the trailing comma <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions" rel="nofollow">is allowed</a> but doesn't really mean anything.  This is pretty much just a stylistic preference.  I think that <strong>most</strong> python programmers would leave it off (which is the advice that I would also give) but a few might prefer it to make it so that it's easy to add more arguments later.  </p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#calls" rel="nofollow">keep it in there when <em>calling</em> the function</a>.  You'll see this more often with functions which take lots of default arguments:</p>

<pre><code>x = foo(
    arg1=whatever,
    arg2=something,
    arg3=blatzimuffin,
)
</code></pre>

<p>This works for lists and tuples too:</p>

<pre><code>lst = [x, y, z,]
tup = (x, y, z)
tup = x,  # Don't even need parens for a tuple...
</code></pre>

<p>It's particularly nice if you want to format nested stuff nicely:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "top": [
        "foo",
        "bar",
        "baz",
    ],
    "bottom": [
        "qux",
    ],
}
</code></pre>

<p>As when adding things to the list you just need to add/edit 1 line, not 2.</p>
