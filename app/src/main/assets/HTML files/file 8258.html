<p>That depends on whether you're going to reuse the dialog or not. If it's cheaper to just re-create it (you define what's cheaper), use <code>destroyRecursive()</code>. Otherwise, create once and just <code>hide()</code> it any time you need to close it. </p>

<p>Keep in mind dijit will keep all the widgets you create in a registry. So simply letting the dialog variable go out of scope will not make it garbage collectable, and that opens up the possibility of a memory leak.</p>
