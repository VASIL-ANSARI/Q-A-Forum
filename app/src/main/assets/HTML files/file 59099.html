<p>Ok, I solved my own problem and the <strong>general answer</strong> is as follows:</p>

<p>There are two more things that can be changing the path and need to be checked, </p>

<ol>
<li><p>the PHP code of the application might be changing the <code>ini</code> directive, search the code for <code>ini_set(session.save_path</code></p></li>
<li><p>the PHP code might be using the <code>session_save_path</code> PHP command to override the <code>ini</code>. Search the code for that also (and notice the two underscores <code>_</code>!)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And the <strong>specific answer</strong> for my case was that SuiteCRM uses <code>session_save_path</code> command to set its path with a value coming from the file <code>config.php</code> found at the web root. That's where I found the old setting, and changing it solved my problem (for good, I hope).</p>
