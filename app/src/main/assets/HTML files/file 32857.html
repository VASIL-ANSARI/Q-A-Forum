<p>Well first you have to dispatch the event:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;container-&gt;get('event_listener')-&gt;dispatch('acme_image_upload', new MyUploadEvent($imageData, $correlation));
</code></pre>

<p>If you have any listeners on <code>acme_image_upload</code> then the associated method will be called with the event as an argument.</p>

<p>You can dispatch the event from a controller with access to the <code>Container</code> or <code>EventDispatcher</code>.</p>

<p>A good example of a bundle that handles uploads for multiple contexts is this:
<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/oneup/uploader-bundle" rel="nofollow">https://packagist.org/packages/oneup/uploader-bundle</a></p>

<p>It uses events to handle different contexts, as well as supporting some of the most popular client side 'chunk' uploaders.</p>
