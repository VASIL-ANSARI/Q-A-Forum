<p>Sorry a7mad, I am afraid to say that but it is not Possible to Repeat the sound of UILocal Notification.I hope you have checked Other Questions Of SO. All of them have Negative result.</p>

<p>I can give you a suggestion to Call an Alert View Or ActionSheet on Click of "View" Button of LocalNotification and Continue your actions on that Controller as they can be controlled...</p>
