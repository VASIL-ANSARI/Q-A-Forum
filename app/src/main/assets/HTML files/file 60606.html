<p>I use page objects for this, where all "clicky" logic is abstracted into little functions about "user intent". That could be ideal for what you're talking about. I also use globals to inject my browser name into my test_settings in nightwatch.json so I can test on it, or include it in screenshot names. You could use this to decide whether to do your extra click.</p>

<pre><code>...
"ie10": {
        "selenium_host": "10.20.3.161",
        "desiredCapabilities": {
            "browserName": "internet explorer",
            "javascriptEnabled": true,
            "acceptSslCerts": true,
            "ie.ensureCleanSession": true
        },
        "globals": {
            "env": "ie10"
        }
    },
...
</code></pre>
