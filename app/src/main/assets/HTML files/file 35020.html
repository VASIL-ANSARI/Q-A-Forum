<p>why not use a single array and a custom class?
In the real world you would probably choose a dictionary (or a sorted dictionary),
but it looks like an exercise like Sayse wrote.
You can create a simple class that contains the quantity, value per coin, and total value of coins, and use this class for your calculations.</p>
