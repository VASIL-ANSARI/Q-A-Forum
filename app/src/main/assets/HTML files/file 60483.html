<p>Your issue could be when you call <code>Employee.get({employeeId:identity}, ...)</code> prior to deleting the employee. This will load the employee before deletion and it will do a GET request on <code>'http://localhost:8080/SpringRestExample/employee/:id'</code>. </p>

<p>For this query to work properly, you need to provide <code>id</code>, which you haven't done, so it might just be leaving out that part of the URL. You provided <code>employeeId</code>, which is only used for mapping the id parameter to the <code>Employee</code> objects. Try replacing the query above with <code>{id: identity}</code>.</p>
