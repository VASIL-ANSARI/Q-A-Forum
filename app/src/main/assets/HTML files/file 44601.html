<p>Actually two equal string constants have the same address, if they are used in the same translation unit. (A TU is a term from C, basically it means: "The same .m file".) But this behavior is not guaranted and might change in future.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This caveat applies to compile-time string literals as well. Historically, string literals (using the @"..." syntax) have been uniqued across translation units during linking. This is an implementation detail of the compiler and should not be relied upon. If you are using such code, please use global string constants instead (NSString * const MyConst = @"...") or use isEqual:.</p>

<p>BTW: You should use collision free keys. <code>MyKey</code> does not fulfill this. Better use <code>com.MyComponay.MyTarget.MyKey</code> or a equivalent rDNS notation.</p>
