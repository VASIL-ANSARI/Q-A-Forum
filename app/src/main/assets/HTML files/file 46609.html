<p>Most likely you either do not have a Settings bundle or it does not have a Acknowledgements.plist file. If you look at the code for the post_install hook on the page you referenced, you see</p>

<pre><code>FileUtils.cp_r('Pods/Target Support Files/Pods/Pods-Acknowledgements.plist', 'Resources/Settings.bundle/Acknowledgements.plist', :remove_destination =&gt; true)
</code></pre>

<p>You have verified that the Pods-Acklnowledgements.plist file exists. But if you look at your error message, the problem is with the copy destination, not the source.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the <code>remove_destination =&gt; true</code> errors if the destination does not exist. So, first check to see that you have created a Settings bundle in your app. If you have, then I recommend adding a dummy Acknowledgements.plist file to it, so that the post-install hook has something to remove.</p>
