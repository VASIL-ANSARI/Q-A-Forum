<p>First thing, you should use :</p>

<pre><code>[imagePickerCam setCameraOverlayView: overlayView];
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you won't have to manage the order of the subviews, so you can remove the line :</p>

<pre><code>[overlayView bringSubviewToFront:imagePickerCam.view];
</code></pre>

<p>which, by the way, should have been the other way around :</p>

<pre><code>[imagePickerCam.view bringSubviewToFront:overlayView];
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, your overlay view has a height of 480, an you set you UIButton y offset to 480, so the button is out ouf bounds.  Try something like :</p>

<pre><code>UIView *overlayView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame];
UIButton *Button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];
[Button setFrame:CGRectMake(200, self.view.frame.size.height - 80, 80, 80)];
</code></pre>
