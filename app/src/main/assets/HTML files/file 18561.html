<p>Why are you using <code>fb.dialog()</code> to post a status?  </p>

<p>Instead of calling:</p>

<p><code>fb.dialog(AppTestingActivity.this, "feed" , params, new DialogListener() {</code></p>

<p>do:</p>

<p><code>mAsyncRunner.request("me/feed", params, "POST", new RequestListener() {</code></p>

<p>to post to your wall.  </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I forgot that you can also have the user input their own message, which you can do in the fb.dialog().  I would look at our sample code to see how to do it properly which you can see <a href="https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/blob/master/examples/Hackbook/src/com/facebook/android/Hackbook.java#L185" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Notice that there is no <code>link</code> param.  Maybe try removing that to see if it displays your feed story properly.</p>
