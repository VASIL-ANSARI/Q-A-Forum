<p>I'm very new to the Gnu-Arm-Eclipse-Plugin myself and faced the same Problem.
I'm running Kubuntu1404 and have the gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain installed.</p>

<p>Here is what I found out:</p>

<p>The GNU ARM Eclipse plugin links against the newlib-nano by default and if this library is not present in your toolchain you will get this error.</p>

<p>This is done through the linker flag  --specs=nano.specs which you can change through Project->Properties->C/C++ Build->Settings->Tool Settings->Cross ARM C++ Linker(Miscellaneous) .</p>

<p>*.specs files add additional instructions to the linker and so does nano.specs .
It should be located in $TOOLCHAINPATH/arm-none-eabi/lib/</p>

<p>As far as I know the newlib-nano and so the nano.specs file have been removed from recent gcc toolchains. At least it is not in the *buntu build of gcc-arm 4.8.3 .</p>

<p>There is a discussion ongoing on launchpad to include it again in future builds.</p>

<p>A workarround for me has been to use another toolchain like gcc-arm-none-eabi-4.7.3.</p>

<p>Edit: You can download a tarball from <a href="http://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download" rel="nofollow">http://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download</a> but if you run a 64-bit OS you need a few 32-bit libraries.</p>

<p>On *buntu a 
    sudo apt get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0
will do th job.</p>
