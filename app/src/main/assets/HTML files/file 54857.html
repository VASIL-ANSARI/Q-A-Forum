<p>Not sure if you still need the answer but, here's a tip:
The whole point of that specific exercise was to learn the modular arithmetic, which is that if you sum up/multiply the remainders of all of the numbers, you get the same answer as you would using the numbers given, that is if you apply the same number that's after % for all of them.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>14
+ 78
* 9
* 3
+ 4
% 3
</code></pre>

<p>After all of the applied operations, the numbers above % 3 result in 2488.
And so 2488 % 3 = 1.</p>

<p>So if you apply % 3 to each one of the numbers, including the initial one, you get the same answer, using the same operations on their remainders of course and dividing the sum again by 3.</p>

<pre><code>14 % 3 = 2
78 % 3 = 0
9 % 3 = 0
3 % 3 = 0
4 % 3 = 1
</code></pre>

<p>So, you get <code>2 + 0 * 0 * 0 + 1</code> which equals to 1.
And <code>1 % 3 = 1</code> which is the same as <code>2488 % 3 = 1</code>.</p>

<p>My point being, you should apply modulo to every one of the numbers, so you get little numbers and don't even have the big ones you're having problems with.
Hope this was clear enough and hope it helps.</p>
