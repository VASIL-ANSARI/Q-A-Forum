<p>It could be possible that you are seeing this behavior because your call to Thread.Sleep occurs in the using statement. Although I would still expect it to take at least four seconds and you stated that in only one second all of the 10 records were inserted. You could try to remove the call to Thread.Sleep from the using statement to see if the behavior improves...</p>

<p>see: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1032750/c-sharp-exiting-a-using-block-with-a-thread-still-running-onthe-scoped-object">C# exiting a using() block with a thread still running onthe scoped object</a> </p>

<p>I do think that the Threading.Timer is a better option, but I would also think that Thread.Sleep should work as well:</p>

<pre><code>    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
    {
        DoAPIWork();
        Thread.Sleep(4000);
    }

    private void DoAPIWork()
    {
        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection("Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=*****;Integrated Security=true;"))
        {
            movie = api.GetMovieInfo(i);

                if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(movie.title))
                    continue;
                string queryString = string.Format("insert into movie values ('{0}')", movie.title);

                SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(queryString, connection);
                try
                {
                    connection.Open();
                    command.ExecuteNonQuery();
                    connection.Close();
                }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    Debug.WriteLine(ex.Message);
                }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
