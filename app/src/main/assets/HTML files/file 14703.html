<p>The Google Play store does not support trials. You can implement it yourself by storing the usage start date somewhere. If you store it on the device, any user with a rooted device will be able to reset it. You can obfuscate it somewhat to make it harder. You can also store it on a server, but you need some info from the device to associate it with. </p>

<p>Giving apps for free is also not supported. You can develop it yourself if you have some sort of a server and use in-app purchases to enable premium features in a free app. If you want to use paid app, the only way is to actually send people the APK. </p>
