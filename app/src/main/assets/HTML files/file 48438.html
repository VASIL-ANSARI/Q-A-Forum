<p>To perform source code analysis the SQ Java plugin needs bytecode in addition to the source code. Bytecode location for source files is provided thanks to properties <code>sonar.java.binaries</code> and <code>sonar.java.test.binaries</code>. Bytecode (or JAR) locations for third party libs is provided by properties <code>sonar.java.libraries</code> and <code>sonar.java.test.libraries</code>.</p>

<p>If you don't provide correctly those properties then you'll see some 'Class not found' errors. That doesn't prevent to complete the analysis but many SQ Java rules will probably not work and not detect any issue.</p>

<p>(Partial) example:
<code>sonar-runner -Dsonar.sources=src -Dsonar.java.binaries=bin/classes -Dsonar.java.libraries=libs/*.jar</code></p>
