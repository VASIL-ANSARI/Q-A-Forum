<p>I don't know what librarys are out there, but generally there are 2 options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Access the file via the COM-Interface Excel provides</li>
<li>Read the Excel-File (btw: basically .xlsx is a zip-file) manually</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider that for 1. Excel has to be installed on the Computer your program will be running.</p>
