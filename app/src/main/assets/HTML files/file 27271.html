<p>If there was a way to do this, we'd be doing it. The problem is simple -- the program we are running only provides us a single stream of instructions.</p>

<p>Imagine the steps a person goes through to get ready for work in the morning. They get up, take a shower, get dressed, make breakfast, eat breakfast, and so on. With the full list of steps, you could probably figure out efficient ways to overlap the tasks if you had more than one person. One person could pick the clothes while someone else was making breakfast, for example. But if you were only told each step when the previous step was complete, it would be hopeless.</p>

<p>Single-threaded code only tells you each step when the previous step is complete.</p>
