<p>All your code needed was a little push. No need for event broadcasting or anything like that.</p>

<p>The problem was, that the click event listener was working outside Angular's digest loop, and thus Angular watch wasn't working for you.
If you change your directive's code to the following, it will work.</p>

<pre><code>.directive('buttonDirective', function (valueService) {

    var directive = {
        restrict: 'E',
        template: '&lt;button ng-click="inc()"&gt;Inc&lt;/button&gt;',
        link: linkFnc
    };

    function linkFnc(scope) {
        scope.inc = function() {
            valueService.inc();
        };
    }

    return directive;
})
</code></pre>
