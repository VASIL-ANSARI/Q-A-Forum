<p>Docker containers are designed to run a single command. The mysql installer expects the service it registered to automatically be started on the OS bootup, but that's not the case inside of a container.</p>

<p>The proper solution is to split these into two separate containers, one db container, and another nodejs/app container. Link and run the two together with a docker-compose configuration that automatically sets up the host names.</p>

<p>The less ideal option is <a href="http://supervisord.org/" rel="nofollow">supervisord</a> which you can use to run and manage multiple processes inside of the container. You install it just like any other app, configure your db and node app as two services for supervisord to manage, and then launch supervisord as your container's run command.</p>
