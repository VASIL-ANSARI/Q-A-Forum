<p><code>head</code> is just a pointer of type <code>struct node*</code>. An equivalent declaration is:</p>

<pre><code>struct node
{
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};
struct node *head;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that even if you don't declare any variable of the type of the structure you're defining, you must put a semicolon after the closing curly brace.</p>

<p>The origin of this syntax is that the struct is a data type and the way you declare variables is by specifying their data type and their name. Indeed, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>struct {int a, b;} *variable;
</code></pre>
