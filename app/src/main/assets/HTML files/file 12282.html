<p>1: You forgot your problem ;-) i assume, you don't see your location...
there are two ways: 
mapview can show your location -> </p>

<p><code>mapView.showsUserLocation = YES</code></p>

<p>or you add a Annotation to the mapView :</p>

<p><code>[mapview addAnnotation:myLocation]</code></p>

<p>but please read the docs for mkmapview, your implementation is incomplete (missing delegates)
and take a look at the examples</p>

<p>2: not as easy as on google maps javascript api. you have to draw lines from point to point. therefore you need the exact route from google.</p>
