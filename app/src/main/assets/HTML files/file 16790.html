<p>Have you tried setting the UITextView's font to AppleColorEmoji as well? On iOS, it seems that AppleColorEmoji is the only font that will draw scaled-up emoji. Use any other font, and the emoji never get larger than about 20x20 pixels, as you've noticed.</p>

<p>I did my tests using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fonts/id285217489?mt=8">this handy free app called Fonts!</a>, which is a nice way of getting quick feedback on the actual device itself.</p>

<p>I note that the Game Center app seems to be able to mix an interesting font with scaled-up emoji, so clearly it IS possible to do better than the (rather pedestrian) emoji font! I don't know whether this is something special in its code, though, or something special about the font it uses, which looks like a custom one.</p>
