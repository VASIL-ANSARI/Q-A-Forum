<p>Instruments doesn't show where objects are being leaked - it shows where the object that is being leaked is being <strong>created</strong>.</p>

<p>What you can do is to look at how you manage the memory of <code>devices</code> and make sure that you are releasing it correctly.</p>

<p>It's odd that it's showing a leak under ARC - so it would be useful to see some relevant code to see what is being done.</p>
