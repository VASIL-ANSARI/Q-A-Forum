<p>Define what "works" means. Any of those <em>might</em> work, but a valid, standard-compliant, well-formed C++ program has either of the following signatures:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
int main(int argc, char** argv)
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
</code></pre>

<p>So a), c) and d) are wrong.</p>
