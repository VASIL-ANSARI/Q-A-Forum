<p>A simple way to make the ellipse bounce of the edges is to check its edge points against the bounds, and then just invert the proper direction. So, something like this should work, if you'll pardon the pseudo-code</p>

<pre><code>loop used to animate the ellipse
before moving, check the position:

if right-most position == right wall
    invert x velocity
if left-most position == left wall
    invert x velocity
if top-most position == top wall
    invert y velocity
if bottom-most position == bottom wall
    invert y velocity

move ellipse to next position
</code></pre>

<p>This is a pretty simple simulation, but it should give you an idea of how to progress and develop a more sophisticated model. Hope this helps!</p>
