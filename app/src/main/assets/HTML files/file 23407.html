<p>You want to refer to the jQuery object correctly:</p>

<pre><code>var id = $(this).data('id');
</code></pre>

<p><code>$this</code> is read as a variable that hasn't been declared yet, whereas <code>$(this)</code> is the jQuery object wrapper for <code>this</code>, or the item that was clicked.</p>
