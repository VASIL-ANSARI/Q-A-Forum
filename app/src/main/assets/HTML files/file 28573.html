<p>It's a little unclear what your structure is, but if it was the navigation controller that was presented, you should use it to do the dismissal (actually, it will forward the message to its presenting view controller). Try this:</p>

<pre><code>[self.navigationController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
</code></pre>
