<p>The recommended approach for authorization to Google APIs is to use OAuth 2. Google provides standalone libraries for OAuth 2 in a variety of languages (such as Python), as well as more comprehensive client libraries (see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/" rel="nofollow">Python library</a>) that assist with using OAuth 2 with Google APIs such as the Calendar API.</p>

<p>Using a username and password pair is generally referred to as ClientLogin when it's in the context of Google APIs. This practice is deprecated and <em>strongly discouraged</em>.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, there are <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/firstapp" rel="nofollow">simple instructions</a> for using Calendar API v3 with the Python client library on the Google Developers site. However, these instructions are tailored for an application that runs on the command line versus one that operates on a web server, because conceptually and programmatically, this is much simpler to grasp. I would suggest trying this sample first, even though it doesn't do exactly what you want.</p>

<p>There isn't an OAuth 2 on App Engine sample that I'm aware of, but there is an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/source/browse/#hg%2Fsamples%2Fappengine" rel="nofollow">example using the Google+ APIs</a> that is included in the client library samples.</p>

<p>The critical piece of this example, authorizing the user, is nearly identical between an application that uses Google+ APIs versus the Calendar API. The biggest differences will be in the access your application requests on behalf of the user (the scope), which will be something like:</p>

<pre><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me
</code></pre>

<p>and of course the actual calls to the API, which are described in detail in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v3/reference/" rel="nofollow">Calendar API documentation reference</a>. If you tried the simple Calendar API example I linked above, you should be able to apply what you learned there, with the OAuth 2 setup instructions from the Google+ sample, to do what you want.</p>
