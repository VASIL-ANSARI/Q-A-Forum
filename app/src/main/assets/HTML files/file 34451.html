<p><code>getRow()</code> returns 0 if there is no current row. That seems to work in my case.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It returns 0 also if the row has been deleted so not a perfect solution. When I call <code>deleteRow()</code> I will call <code>close()</code> after that. Then I can use <code>isClosed()</code> to check if it's deleted. <code>rowDeleted()</code> is not supported by MySQL JDBC.</p>
