  <p>Are there chances of ThreadB starting dothisOne (or) is it 100% guarenteed that thread A will go for dothisTwo ? </p>

<p>No guarantees at all. I suspect it's <em>more likely</em> that thread A will get to go into <code>doThisTwo</code> instead, because basically there's nothing it needs to do between exiting the monitor and re-entering it - it doesn't need to be rescheduled or anything. But no, it can happen either way.</p>

  <p>If it was class method(static), I believe threadA would go for dothisTwo</p>

<p>Nope - synchronization doesn't care about instance methods vs static methods. Static and instance synchronized methods differ in which monitor they implicitly synchronize against, but that's all.</p>

<p>Basically, if you want two things to happen as a unit (in terms of synchronization), you need to synchronize around the pair of operations, rather than just each operation in turn.</p>
