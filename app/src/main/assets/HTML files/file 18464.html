<p>The only way to do that with a base page class is to use "loaded" event or better method OnNavigatedTo and change visual tree as needed.</p>

<p>PhoneApplicationPage Class derives from UserControl, so it's visual tree is built using InitializeComponent auto-generated method.
It's generated to read XAML and instantiate controls and set root control as a Content of current user control (in this scenario Page).</p>

<p>So you might use it later (not in ctor) or modify tree after this method.</p>

<p>Another option might be creating Style for page and just applying it to all pages.</p>
