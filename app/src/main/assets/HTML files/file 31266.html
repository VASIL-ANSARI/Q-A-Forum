<p>You cannot assume a timer event to be raised with millisecond-precision. The precision depends on a lot of factors, including the load of the system at the time when it needs to fire, the process priority etc. Here, also the clock skew or any clock adjustments come into play, because you're computing an event that will happen a whole day later. </p>

<p>Since I'm assuming that for the event itself, it doesn't really matter that it isn't precise, I'd just save the time of the last event in a variable and use that for computing the next. If you really must make sure you get only one event every night, you'd even have to save the time of the last event in the database. </p>
