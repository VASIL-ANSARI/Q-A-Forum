<p>Your problem is that you have some confusion over what "forward" means. You need to decide which direction forward is. Currently, "forward " is "out of the screen", because you're doing a 2D side scroller and you have all of your enemies facing out of the screen. </p>

<p>However, you're trying to use <code>LookAt()</code> to make the characters look at the player. But then of course they'll turn, because "forward" for each enemy mesh/model is currently the direction facing out from their face.</p>

<p>You have two options. One is to rotate all of your models 90 degrees so that forward is coming out their side. In this case, you could still use LookAt() and then tell the enemies to move forward, but visually they'd still be looking out of the screen. However, the enemies would turn around backwards if you got onto their other side. So probably not a good option.</p>

<p>The other option is that you shouldn't be setting the enemy transform/position using the "forward" vector. Just set the enemy position based on a vector that's the difference between the enemy position and the player position. Subtract the enemy position vector from the player position vector and you'll have a vector pointing in the direction of the player. Normalize it to get a unit direction vector. Then multiply that by the move speed and delta time as you have above. Use that instead of "forward" and your enemies will toward the player. In this case, you don't call the <code>LookAt()</code> at all, because you always want the enemies facing out of the screen.</p>

<p>EDIT: I don't have a copy of Unity, but it should be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (Vector3.Distance(target.position, myTransform.position) &gt; maxdistance)
{
  // Get a direction vector from us to the target
  Vector3 dir = target.position - myTransform.position;

  // Normalize it so that it's a unit direction vector
  dir.Normalize();

  // Move ourselves in that direction
  myTransform.position += dir * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
}
</code></pre>
