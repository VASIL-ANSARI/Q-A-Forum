<p>Are you using javascript to communicate between frames/iframes which point to different domains? This is not permitted by the JS "same origin/domain" security policy. Ie, if you have</p>

<pre><code>&lt;iframe name="foo" src="foo.com/script.js"&gt;
&lt;iframe name="bar" src="bar.com/script.js"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the script on bar.com tries to access <code>window["foo"].Location.toString</code>, you will get this (or similar) exceptions. Please also note that the same origin policy can also kick in if you have content from different subdomains. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/same-origin.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can find a short and to the point explanation of it with examples.</p>
