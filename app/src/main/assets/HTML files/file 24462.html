<p>If you don't have administrative access to Windows, you won't be able to create a scheduled task. Your only alternative is to create some sort of custom task component in your application that checks / stores the last time a script was run. The problem with this is that it relies on user activity and it may not run on the exact date that you want it to.</p>

<p>The other alternative is to find Linux hosting so that you can avail of Cron.</p>
