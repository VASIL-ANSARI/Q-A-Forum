<p>Vertex array objects store a set of buffer names (usually vertex and index buffers) to get vertex data from, as well as how the vertices are layed out in the vertex buffers.</p>

<p>Their main purpose is so that when you want to render a different model from a different set of buffers, instead of binding each buffer and then setting the vertex attribute formats each time, you just bind a different VAO, and all the buffers and attributes are set up for you.</p>

<p>Not only is this more convenient for the programmer, it reduces the number of OpenGL calls required and thus CPU usage, which can clear up a CPU bottleneck.</p>
