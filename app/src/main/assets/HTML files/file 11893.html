<p>I would think that the problem is that you did not specify the full path to <code>Rscript</code> and the user running PHP/Apache just does not know where to search for it.</p>

<p>Update that <code>exec</code> command like (on Linux):</p>

<pre><code>exec("/usr/bin/Rscript &lt;PATH&gt;/test.R");
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, I would suggest installing <a href="http://code.google.com/p/littler/" rel="nofollow">littler</a> for the task later and (based on that) runnning <code>r</code> instead of <code>Rscript</code> for letting things run a lot faster - if installing eg. <a href="http://rapache.net/" rel="nofollow">rApache</a> is not an option.</p>
