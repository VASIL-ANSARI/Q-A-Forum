<p><strike>I'm a fan of third-normal form, where you have separate Student, Class and Grade tables and link them with many-to-many tables like ClassStudent and GradeClass.</p>

<p>But it depends on how you want to maintain it in the future. Ultimately it comes down to future extension and maintainability. Which is why I prefer 3NF.</strike></p>
