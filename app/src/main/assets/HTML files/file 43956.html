<p>This is done so that integers do not take up all the room for other objects. In Ruby all other Objects have even object_id's, they go in between. The integer object_id's are very easily converted to their value:   the last bit (always a 1) is chopped off.</p>

<p>Integers are a bit fake objects, they are no more than an id and a shared list of methods.</p>
