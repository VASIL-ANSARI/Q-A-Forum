<p><code>_ZN4EnvT6NParamEj</code> is <code>EnvT::NParam(unsigned int)</code><br>
<code>_ZN4EnvT6NParamEy</code> is <code>EnvT::NParam(unsigned long long)</code></p>

<p>So you should start with looking at how you include declaration of <code>EnvT</code>. You need to look at what type of an argument of NParam and find where it's redefined.</p>
