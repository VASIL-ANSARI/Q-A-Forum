<p>Firstly, don't <em>ever</em> use <code>list</code> as a variable name as it will override the built in type and could cause trouble later on.</p>

<p>You could do this for the longest words:</p>

<pre><code>for i in lst:
    if len(i) == max(lst, key=len):
        print(i)
</code></pre>

<p>And for the shortest words:</p>

<pre><code>for i in lst:
    if len(i) == min(lst, key=len):
        print(i)
</code></pre>

<p>The first code prints the strings which have the same length as the longest string. The second does the same, but with the shortest strings.</p>

<p>A small optimisation would be to precalculate the max/min length before the loop, so you don't need to recalculate it every time.</p>

<pre><code>maxLen = max(lst, key=len)
for i in lst:
    if len(i) == maxLen:
        print(i)
</code></pre>

<p>The same can be done for the other loop.</p>
