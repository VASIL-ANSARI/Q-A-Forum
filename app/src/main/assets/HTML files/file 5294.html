<p>I can answer part 1 of your question, and i may or may not be able to answer part two if you post the output of EXPLAIN:</p>

<p>In order to select t.* it needs to look in the MYD file - only the primary key is in the index, to fetch the data columns you requested it needs the rest of the columns.</p>

<p>That is, your query is quite probably filtering the results very quickly, its just struggling to copy all the data you wanted.</p>

<p>Also note that you will probably have duplicates in your output - if one row has no refs in t_x, but 3 in x_y you will have the same t.* repeated 3 times. Given we think the where clause is sufficiently efficient, and much time is spent on reading the actual data, this is quite possibly the source of your problems. try changing to <code>select distinct</code> and see if that helps your efficiency</p>
