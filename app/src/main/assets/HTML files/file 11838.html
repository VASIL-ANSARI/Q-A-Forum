<p>You should write the definitions in the cpp file, otherwise, once you include your header file into more than one C++ file(translation unit), you'll get redefinition errors. And #pragma once operates only within one translation unit. So you need a Configuration.cpp file with the following contents</p>

<pre><code>#include "Configuracion.h"

int Configuracion::MAX_ATAQUES = 5;
int Configuracion::DIV_TERRITORIOS = 3;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if your class contains only static member, you have the option of considering having a namespace instead of a class.</p>
