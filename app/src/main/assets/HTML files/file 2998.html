<p>asp.net mvc fully supports all of your requirements but there are few things you should get up to speed on:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You should look at implementing view models to help seperate your domain model from your specific views. <a href="http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2009/04/13/asp.net-mvc-tip-50-ndash-create-view-models.aspx" rel="nofollow">Here is a good link on how to start this.</a></p></li>
<li><p>You need to get up to speed with a client side javascript framework for the ajax work with partial html rendering.  <strong><a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">jquery</a> will do this or <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2009/05/19/ASPNETMVCAjaxBeginForm.aspx" rel="nofollow">ms ajax</a>.  <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2008/01/19/introducing-the-smartbag-for-asp-net-mvc-and-soliciting-feedback.aspx" rel="nofollow">Here is an example</a></strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>To your detailed questions:</p>

<p>Is my way of thinking in accordance with the asp.net mvc methodology?</p>

<p><strong>Asp.net mvc is not going to constrain you at all so essentially this is fully supported</strong></p>

<p>Can you explain/show (not necessarily all of it) how the controller can compile the right combination of partial views and feed these to the parent view?</p>

<p><strong>You can use partial views if you want to seperate bits of code out and can easily refresh them by loading them independently using ms ajax or jquery.  You would have a controller that mapped onto your parent view and can delegate and refresh partial views in ajax calls</strong>.</p>

<p>Can you point me towards an Ajax based solution?</p>

<p>Can you suggest books/links that contain examples of complex views?</p>
