<p>I think your implementation of expanding and collapsing is not the best, because you are just overlaying the controls instead of hiding them.
One of the disadvantages is that the overlaid controls might by focussed by pressing tab and they might have a value which I think it is out of target.</p>

<p>I would suggest another implementation by creating two panels (one for the header and another one for the content) and when the collapse button is pressed then the content's panel will be hidden by sitting its <code>Visible</code> property to  <code>false</code> and its <code>Hight</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>
