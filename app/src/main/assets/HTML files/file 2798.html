<blockquote>
  <p>Every function in JavaScript is
  actually a Function object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Function objects created with the
  Function constructor are parsed when
  the function is created. This is less
  efficient than declaring a function
  and calling it within your code,
  because functions declared with the
  function statement are parsed with the
  rest of the code.</p>
