<p>To monitor basic parameters of the IBM JVM you can could use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3KLZ/com.ibm.java.diagnostics.healthcenter.doc/topics/introduction.html" rel="nofollow">IBM Health Center</a> instead of jConsole. It can be installed either as a add on to IBM Support Assistant, or as plugin to Eclipse (from Eclipse Marketplace).</p>

<p>Depending on your Java version and path level you would need to enable it via generic JVM settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>For Java Version 7 and later, Version 6 service refresh 5 and later, and Version 5 service refresh 10 and later use <code>-Xhealthcenter</code></li>
<li>For Version 6 service refreshes 1 through 4, and Version 5 service refreshes 8 and 9 - use <code>-agentlib:healthcenter -Xtrace:output=perfmon.out</code></li>
</ul>
