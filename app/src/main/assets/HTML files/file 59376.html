<p>You get this error because you don't provide the correct FQN of your class, indeed in your <code>load</code> method, you try to find the class corresponding to <code>pluginName + "." + pluginClassName</code> that will be in your case <code>plugin.PluginImpl</code> but the package name of your class <code>PluginImpl</code> is actually <code>ru.sberbank.school.homework8.plugin</code> such that the real FQN of your class is <code>ru.sberbank.school.homework8.plugin.PluginImpl</code>.</p>

<p>To fix this problem, you need to replace:</p>

<pre><code>Plugin plugin = pluginManager.load("plugin", "PluginImpl");
</code></pre>

<p>With:</p>

<pre><code>Plugin plugin = pluginManager.load("ru.sberbank.school.homework8.plugin", "PluginImpl");
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could modify your method <code>load</code> to add a prefix assuming that you will always retrieve your plugins from the same root package:</p>

<pre><code>public Plugin load(String pluginName, String pluginClassName) {
    String name = "ru.sberbank.school.homework8." + pluginName + "." + pluginClassName;
</code></pre>
