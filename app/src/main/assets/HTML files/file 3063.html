<p>I suppose "unpredictable" means "something in accordance with the standard but different from what the programmer expects when writing code", right?</p>

<p>I guess you can see from the code where objects are being instantiated or copied, even if it's maybe not obvious. It might be hard to understand though.</p>

<p>Some stuff is just implemented in certain ways by (all?) compiler vendors, but it could be done differently. E.g., late binding (aka. calling an overloaded, virtual method) is usually implemented using function pointers in the background. This is maybe the fastest way doing it, but I suppose it could be done differently and that would be unexpected. I don't know any compiler though that does it differently.</p>

<p>Lots of stuff is unexpected in the sense that C++ is overly complex - hardly anybody understands the full language. So unexpected also depends on your knowledge.</p>
