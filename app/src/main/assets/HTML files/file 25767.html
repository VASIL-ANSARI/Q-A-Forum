<p><code>clubs</code> is a list of dictionaries, whereas each dictionary has four fields: name, address, number, and Subway. You will need to encode each of the fields:</p>

<pre><code># Instead of:
#dict_writer.writerow([unicode(s).encode("utf-8") for s in clubs])

# Do this:
for c in clubs:
    # Encode each field: name, address, ...
    for k in c.keys():
        c[k] = c[k].encode('utf-8').strip()

    # Write to file
    dict_writer.writerow(c)
</code></pre>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>I looked at your data and some of the fields have ending new line <code>\n</code>, so I updated the code to encode and strip white spaces at the same time.</p>
