<p>If your configuration has worked before, try to remove all libraries from your project, do a clean build (I don't know if this is necessary, but just to be sure). Then open your project-properties again and add your libraries to the project. Now check after you clicked ok and the project has rebuild, if your libraries are now recognized.</p>
