<p>i've not actually solved the problem - it is still evident on this simplified page for anyone who is interested...

<p>But the following might be useful work-round to someone...</p>

<p>First i upgraded my ad code to the lastest version and set it up to show alternate ads (from amazon in this case). This was a useful alternative to just having empty ad spaces - see this example...
<a href="http://www.haroldstreet.org.uk/waypoints/download/?list=humps" rel="nofollow">http://www.haroldstreet.org.uk/waypoints/download/?list=humps</a></p>

<p>Then for my more important /munros/ page - i've added the following line to the google ad code.  </p>

<pre><code>   google_page_url = "http://www.haroldstreet.org.uk/waypoints/download/?list=munros&amp;area=04";
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to prompt google back into giving closely related ads, and restores the Google adds to my /Munros/ page. </p>

<p>So its not a fix, but a reasonable work-round</p>
