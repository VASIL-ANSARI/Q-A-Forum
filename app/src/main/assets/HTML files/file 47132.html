<p>There's a remove method that accepts an object as the parameter and removes it from the list if it's in the list.</p>

<pre><code>strArray.remove(strRemove);
</code></pre>

<p>The method returns true if the Object was deleted (meaning it was there when you called the method) and false if not, so if you want to remove all instances of the String you can do:</p>

<pre><code>while(strArray.remove(strRemove)){}
</code></pre>

<p>which will remove all the instances of the String in the list until there aren't any more.</p>
