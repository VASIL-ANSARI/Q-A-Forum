<p>Perhaps you should check this 'RawFormat' property of the 'System.Drawing.Bitmap' class as shown <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.image.rawformat.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> on MSDN. If the image is empty, that will throw an exception and you can trap it in that case.</p>
