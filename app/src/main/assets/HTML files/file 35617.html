<p>No need to use <code>@AroundInvoke</code></p>

<p>You must follow the <code>.persist()</code>, <code>.merge()</code>, or  <code>.remove()</code> with a <code>.flush()</code> this will force the exception to be thrown at that spot if one happens. Without flush, JPA closes the transaction at a later period, and that is were the exception is being thrown (out of catch range).</p>

<p>Then when the exception is caught, do this to get the root problem.</p>

<pre><code>while(e.getCause() != null) {
   e = e.getCause();
}
System.out.println(e.getMessage());
</code></pre>

<p>That is where you will see the JPA message</p>
