<p>The struts way to deal with request parameters is to put a property of the same name as the parameter in the ActionForm, and let Struts populate it for you. This way, you don't have to deal with request parameters at all, but rather, are dealing with ActionForm properties.
So, to answer your question, instead of coding
code:<code>&lt;%= request.getParameter("name") %&gt;</code></p>

<p>I would code a the property "name" in my ActionForm with a getName() and a setName() method.
In my jsp, I would then code:
code:<code>&lt;bean:write name="MyForm" property="name"/&gt;</code></p>

<p>OR.. <code>&lt;bean parameter id="username" name="user"/&gt; and &lt;%=username%&gt;</code>
If the jsp is called with a name parameter, struts will automatically populate the form bean with the name property.</p>

<p>This is why there's no struts tag that I know of to display a request parameter.
There is one in jstl, however:<code>&lt;c:out value="${param.name}" /&gt;</code></p>
