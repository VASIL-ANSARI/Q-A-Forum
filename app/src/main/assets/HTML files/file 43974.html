<p><code>%H:%M</code> tells that there will be only two elements separated by <code>:</code>. If you use explode on that you will receive array with two elements therefore when you use <code>$a[2]</code> you get an error. Simply index 2 does not exist. Your array's max index is 1.</p>

<p>From what I see you try also add seconds which you do not use in strftime</p>
