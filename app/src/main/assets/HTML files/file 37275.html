<p>No, if you deploy your app into app-server (like tomcat, glassfish, etc.), then the real .html's that shows in browser located somewhere in app-server folders. </p>

<p>For glassfish it can be "/path_to_glassfish/glassfish/domains/domainXX/applications/APP_NAME/WEB-INF/classes/...".
So, even if you change .html's at your project, you must to redeploy this changes.</p>

<p>Wicket JavaDoc says :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if the configuration type is DEVELOPMENT, resources are polled for
  changes...</p>

<p>Yes, but is holds for resources located at appropriate folders. I think <a href="http://apache-wicket.1842946.n4.nabble.com/Resource-auto-reload-with-the-Quickstart-project-td3665329.html" rel="nofollow">this wicket forum thread</a> will give you some answers of how to implements behavior you want. This post is actually for old wicket version, but I think it is suitable for newer versions too.</p>

<p>In our company we use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/firebug/" rel="nofollow">firebug</a> or chrome console to stylize components right in browser without redeploying app, and this is enough for us, because static components rarely added on the html page.</p>
