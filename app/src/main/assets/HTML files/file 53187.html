<p>You posted no code, so my answer will be an assumption of what could be going wrong.</p>

<p>When you are switching <code>view controllers</code> the <code>search bar</code> is resigning it's <code>active state</code>. One solution you should try is to set it back to <code>active</code> when the view controller <code>reappears</code>. </p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
  [super viewDidAppear:animated];

  //Set the search controller to active

  //Replace self.searchController to however you are referencing the searchController, I will assume its a property of the view controller
  self.searchController.searchBar.active = YES;
}

- (void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated {
  [super viewWillDisappear:animated];

  //Set it to inactive
  self.searchController.searchBar.active = NO;
}
</code></pre>
