<p>You could try to use <code>tolower((unsigned char)option) == 'y'</code> as described on <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_tolower.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_tolower.htm</a> (you need to add <code>#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>Or use a switch statement with fallthrou cases for 'Y' and 'y'.</p>

<p>I suppose if you often have <code>(option=='y' || option =='Y')</code> I suppose the best way is to put it into a separate function in your favourite way and call the function ;)</p>
