<p>In my experience, this won't work in ie7 on the html or body elements. I recommend wrapping your entire document in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and setting it to <code>height:100%</code> and <code>width:100%</code> and controlling overflow with that div instead. Additionally, (and this may be a matter of taste) you should be using <code>removeAttr('style')</code> on the element to return its state rather than changing the css to <code>overflow:visible</code>.</p>

<p>As a side note, this method resolves the issue for iPad as well, which suffers from the same scrolling problem as ie7</p>
