<p>This is a common issue with WM6.5. </p>

<p>I work with devices that use WM6.5 and in my experience this only happens when the application is exited incorrectly, uncleanly or suddenly. When I exit the application properly nothing is overlayed where as when the application exits suddenly (i.e. by an unhandled crash, or by stopping the debugger I have the same result as you are reporting. </p>

<p>To stop it happening you'll need to make sure that you are exiting the program cleanly, otherwise this will persist.</p>
