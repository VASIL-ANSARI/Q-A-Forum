<p>First: WinForms isn't the best choice to create games.</p>

<p>But if you want to or have to you should probably not use multiple forms for this task.</p>

<p>You could create multiple panels in one form and then manipulate their opacity with a timer.</p>

<p>If you create a big game you'll have to create the screens dynamically.</p>

<p><strong>Sample</strong></p>

<p>Here's an example how you can create controls dynamically. You could start to create your own controls for different scenarios (like a control that offers n combo boxes for different answers to a question). Then you could start to define your story with steps and each step would then create the right controls, like a 'decision step' that asks a question and selects the next step depending on the answer.</p>

<pre><code>public partial class Form1 : Form
{
    public Form1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var newButton = new Button { Text = "Click me", Dock = DockStyle.Top };
        newButton.Click += new EventHandler(newButton_Click);
        this.panel1.Controls.Add(newButton);
    }

    void newButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("I was clicked");
        var button = sender as Button;
        button.Click -= new EventHandler(newButton_Click);
        this.panel1.Controls.Remove(button);
    }
}
</code></pre>
