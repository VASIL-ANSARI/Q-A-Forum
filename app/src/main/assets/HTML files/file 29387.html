<p>First, where runningServer is defined? I can't see a </p>

<pre><code>var runningServer;
</code></pre>

<p>anywhere in the first peace of code.
So, if you write a value in prototype.start I doubt you can access it on prototype.stop that is a different scope.</p>

<p>Second, {expressListener}.close() in node 0.6 was just synchronous, they added the callback on the 0.8. So, check the node.js version to be sure that the {cb} is correctly handled.</p>
