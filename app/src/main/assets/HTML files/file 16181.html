<p>If you need to make sure you have a fixed size of the integer value, independent of platform, you could use boost::integers library (see <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/libs/integer/doc/html/boost_integer/cstdint.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>). You could use boost::int64_t or boost::uint64_t for unsigned values</p>
