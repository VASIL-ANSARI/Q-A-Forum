<p>There is no alternate solution when using EDMX and designer. EDMX is fixed to single database implementation. In case of SQL Server it is even worse because it differs between SQL Server 2005 and 2008 dialects (we can expect 2012 coming in future). Once you are using EDMX this tight coupling with database implementation is part of SSDL (database description in EDMX). If you are also using default EF designer from VS you don't have full control over SSDL - it is always recreated when you update model from database or generated database from model. </p>

<p>Current solutions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use SQL Server 2005 in development and VS designer will not overwrite your provider manifest. This configuration should work on SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 as well.</li>
<li>Use code first (EF 4.1 - 4.3.1) instead of EDMX where this is handled automatically at runtime</li>
<li>Don't use VS designer and maintain your EDMX manually or buy some more powerful designer</li>
<li>Create separate SSDL part for SQL Serve 2005 and 2008 and reference them correctly in connection string according to used database implementation. This has many disadvantages like maintaining two almost same SSDL documents and again you cannot use VS designer.</li>
</ul>
