<p>You need to count the number of 1's in a given column. You're loops look pretty good, but include another loop that goes over every cell in a row and adds up the values (no need to check if it's a one, since 0 doesn't add to a count). </p>

<p>To figure out if the value is even, use the modulus (remainder operator), which is <code>%</code>. Basically, this operator works by dividing a number by another number, but instead of giving the quotient it gives the remainder, as a n integer. So <code>5 % 2 == 1</code> is a true statement in Java. You can use <code>count % 2 == 0</code> in your code to figure out if a count is even.</p>

<p>Then use your current loops to print out the even rows.</p>
