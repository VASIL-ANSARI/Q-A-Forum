<p>Do not use an array. Arrays when defined must have a constant length and so if you are adding new entries into an array it is better to use an Arraylist as you can change the length of an Arraylist when adding new elements rather than an array which has a fixed length.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;int[]&gt; newArr = new ArrayList&lt;int[]&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>In place of using a <code>for</code> loop I think a <code>do while</code> loop would work better in this situation. If you selectively need 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th indicies to contain 9 the following should work.</p>

<pre><code>index = 0;
do {
    if (index == 0) {
        newArr.add(9);
        newArr.add(9);
    } else if (index == 1 || index == 4) {
        newArr.add(9);
    }
    newArr.add(Arr[index]);
    index = index + 1;
while (index &lt; Arr.length);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm happy to work around this solution to fit your needs. I hope some part of this has helped.</p>
