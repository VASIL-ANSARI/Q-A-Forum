  <p>Can you help me understand the trade-offs involved here?</p>

<p>It is a tradeoff between:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance - there is a saving from not allocating the temporary array.  However, one would need to do some extensive code analysis and benchmarking to quantify that saving.  (I suspect that in most applications it would be insignificant.  And read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/26/9143050.aspx" rel="nofollow">this link</a> contributed by @Voo!)</li>
<li>Readability - having a bunch of the extra overloads clutters up the javadocs.</li>
<li>Maintainability - having a bunch of overloads that are implemented iun such a way that the temporary object is not required would entail a lot of copy/paste programming, and this makes future code maintenance harder. </li>
<li>Utility - how often would these overloads be used?  I expect that the answer would be "rarely".</li>
<li>Bytecode footprint - these extra overloads would contribute to application bloat for every application using the Guava JAR file.</li>
</ul>

<p>My advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't bug the Guava developers about this.  They've already made up their minds about the tradeoffs.  You'll just be wasting your breath.</li>
<li>If the lack of these classes or methods hurts your application, roll your own additions.  (But try to do it in a way that doesn't involve a private "fork" of Guava ... because you'll probably regret that in the long term.)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>For the record, I think that the Guava developers got this right.</p>
