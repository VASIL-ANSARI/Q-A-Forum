<blockquote>
  <p>Mobile Support for Background Execution in âDirectâ Render Mode â AIR now supports background execution of code on iOS and Android when render mode is set to âdirectâ.  This will allow your applications to perform tasks such as audio playback even when invisible to the user. Due to power and CPU considerations, we recommend reviewing our release notes for additional details and guidance.</p>
