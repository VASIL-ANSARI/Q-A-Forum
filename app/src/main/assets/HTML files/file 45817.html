<p>If I'm not mistaken, the default behavior of Velocity is to remove transforms with null-like values, see <a href="https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/issues/224#issuecomment-51526521" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The problem is that your end value is <code>0deg</code> which is the basically a null rotate transform.</p>

<p>Not sure this will work, but I think if you simply <strong>add 360 to all values</strong> you could trick the system into not cleaning the <code>transform:rotateX</code> at the end.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
As per @Miloshio's comment <strong>it's better to add 0.01 to all values</strong> instead of 360 (not tested).</p>
