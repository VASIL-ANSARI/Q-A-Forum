<p>Screen density is different than screen dimensions.  <code>dp</code> normalizes densities across devices, but they can still have varying screen heights and widths.  The obvious example is tablet vs phones, tablets have the same screen densities as phones but much larger screen dimensions.  Just like that, some phones have smaller screens than others, so you need to take that into account when using fixed height layouts.</p>

<p>To get around this problem, you can take advantage of the <code>width</code> and <code>smallest-width</code> resource buckets and provide different layouts for smaller devices.</p>
