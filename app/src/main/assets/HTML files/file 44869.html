<p>Silly oversight on my part. As i am deploying the test in a web archive i should have included it in that actual archive like below.</p>

<pre><code>libs = Maven.resolver().resolve("org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-core- 
asl:1.9.13")               
.withTransitivity().as(File.class);
archive.addAsLibraries(libs);
</code></pre>
