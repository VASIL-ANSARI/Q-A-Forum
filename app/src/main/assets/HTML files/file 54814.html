<p>Slow Cheetah is something the will run during compilation (your machine or the build server) if you set it up. It will transform the Web.config file and if you publish manually (using Visual Studio or copying the publish output directory) then you will be publishing an already transformed file.</p>

<p>If you are using Octopus deploy to perform your deployment, then you will be providing it with a NuGet package. If you are using Octopack all of the .config files that are of type content will be packaged into the <em>.nuget</em> file. These will be the source files. You may also see a transformed file being packaged up in the <em>/bin</em> in the <em>.nuget</em> file too.</p>

<p>At the point of Octopus performing the deployment, it will perform any config transformations that are relevant using variables it knows about as well as environmental config transformations (dev.config, test.config). Web.release.config will be run and it will apply to Web.config - You should be able to see this in the logs for the deployment.</p>
