<p>I think there can be several solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactor fields you don't need every time into separate models / tables and load them as needed as a 1:1 relation.</li>
<li>Use inheritance to make two models and two dao objects (repositories?) and use factories to instantiate them when needed. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extending dao means overriding all queries and also changing anorm
  parsers which match db results with models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just need to address fields by name, not by column number and provide different repositories different set of fields to fetch. It should be easy to construct SELECT queries, that differ only in set of fields.</p>
