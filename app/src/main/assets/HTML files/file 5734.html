  <p>I have noticed some websites can somehow "sense" what google's search term is.. But I have no idea how this happens. Looking for something in google (i.e. 'french fries') I often end up at pages that quote the search string and say there is no result for it (i.e. 'no result found for french fries'). I was wondering how this happens?</p>

<p>Browsers may (and usually do) send a <code>Referer</code> (yes, it is misspelt) header that gives the URL of the page that linked to the current page. You can parse the query string of that URL to find out the search term.</p>

  <p>I need something similar in my website as all of the information is in different places so google is having trouble putting it all together.</p>

<p>This suggests you need to better structure the information on your website so that search engines can find the right place. i.e. fixing the problem instead of hacking around it.</p>
