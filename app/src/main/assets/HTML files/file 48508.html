<p>It is a little confusing since <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/4cf8a6b082d9bb1789facd996d8265d3908757b2/src/mscorlib/src/System/SerializableAttribute.cs" rel="nofollow">SerializableAttribute is in the .NET CoreCLR repo</a>.  This is the source used for mscorlib.  But all the source isn't included in every variation.  Apparently it was decided to exclude binary serialization from dnxcore50 (see issues corefx <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/1333" rel="nofollow">#1333</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/1347" rel="nofollow">#1347</a> and coreclr <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/1203" rel="nofollow">#1203</a>.  </p>

<p>Consider using the <code>Newtonsoft.Json</code> package for serialization.</p>
