<p>It seems that you have forgotten your mysql root user password. I think you should reinstall WAMPP and then set the mysql root user password from command line. To set the mysql root user password you have to first login to mysql from command line using this command: mysql -u root. When it asks for password just enter. After that enter following commands:</p>

<pre><code>SET PASSWORD for 'root'@'localhost' = password('enteryourpassword');
SET PASSWORD for 'root'@'127.0.0.1' = password('enteryourpassword');
SET PASSWORD for 'root'@'::1' = password('enteryourpassword');
</code></pre>
