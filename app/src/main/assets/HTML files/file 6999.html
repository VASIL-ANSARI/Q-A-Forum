<p>What you've suggested your code does seems to work fine for me:  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ryleyb/h4Ztq/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/ryleyb/h4Ztq/</a></p>

<p>I've used the jsfiddle way of loading the AJAX but other than that, I'm not sure what would be wrong with your code.  Perhaps you can look at my example and figure out what the differences are to your code?</p>
