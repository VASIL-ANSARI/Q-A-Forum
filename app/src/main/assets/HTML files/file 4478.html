<p>The sub query is non correlated so any sensible implementation will only evaluate it once. Note that MySQL does have a problem with <code>IN</code> though where the semantically equivalent</p>

<pre><code>SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
WHERE  price IN (SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop);
</code></pre>

<p>Leads to the sub query being evaluated multiple times.</p>

<p>As far as evaluating performance you would need to look at the <code>explain plan</code> for both in your particular RDBMS.</p>

<p>The most efficient solution might be to use <code>SELECT TOP .. WITH TIES</code> or equivalent if you have a covering index on the <code>price</code> column and your RDBMS has such a construct.</p>
