<p>Based on your memcpy of <code>sizeof(short)</code> bytes, I'm guessing you want to get the first <code>sizeof(short)</code> bytes from where buffer is pointing at.</p>

<pre><code>number = * (short *) buffer;
</code></pre>

<p>will do that for you, as other have pointed out.  </p>

<p>You cannot take the pointer's address and put it in a short, so you need to dereference it to get the value in the memory instead.</p>
