<p>Here's what the code is doing for each row.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the first value as <code>h</code>.</li>
<li>If the current value is greater than <code>h</code>, set it to <code>0</code> and then set <code>h</code> to that value, which is now <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>All subsequent values are positive, so they are greater than <code>h</code> (<code>0</code>), so they get set to <code>0</code> also.</li>
</ol>

<p>What you should do instead:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the maximum value of the row, noting down the index of the maximum value.</li>
<li>At the end of the row, set the maximum value to <code>0</code> using the index stored in step 1.</li>
</ol>
