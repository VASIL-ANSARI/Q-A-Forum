<p>You needn't add an external dependency just for rate-limiting, as your use case is rather straightforward.</p>

<p>I can think of two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modify the script (that currently wakes up every minute and makes 10-20 API calls) to wake up every second and make 5 calls (sequentially or in parallel).

<ul>
<li>In your current design, your API calls might not be properly distributed across 1 minute, i.e. you might be making all your 10-20 calls in the first, say, 20 seconds.</li>
<li>If you change that script to run every second, your API call rate will be more balanced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Change your Python script to a long running daemon, and use a Rate Limiter library, such as <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ratelimit" rel="nofollow">this</a>. You can configure the latter to make 1 call per x seconds.</li>
</ul>
