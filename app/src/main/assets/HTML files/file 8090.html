<p>As far as MVC applications are concerned, WebMatrix is little more than a text editor. WebMatrix is designed to work primarily with the Web Pages development model, which is based on the Web Site (folder-based projects) approach as opposed to the Web Application approach (pre-compilation). MVC is therefore not supported.</p>
