<p>For the simple wsgi application in <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/" rel="nofollow">PEP 333</a>:</p>

<pre><code>def simple_app(environ, start_response):
    status = '200 OK'
    response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
    start_response(status, response_headers)
    return ['Hello world!\n']

application = simple_app
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, you don't <em>have</em> to do any setup at all.  You just have to make sure that mod_wsgi can find an <code>application</code> object that conforms to wsgi in your module.</p>

<p>For security reasons, you really ought to define your application in another module outside any directories published by apache, and limit the code in your wsgi file to the minimum required to import that module and bind the wsgi application within to the <code>application</code> variable.</p>
