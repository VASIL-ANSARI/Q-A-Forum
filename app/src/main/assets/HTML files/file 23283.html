<p>What's the purpose of your encryption? By using a certificate encrypted by the database master key, as it appears to be the case, any user or application can decrypt the data. You are not providing cryptographic protection, you only offer access protection (grant/deny/revoke access to data and/or keys). Cryptographic protection would require your <em>user</em> to specify the password required to unlock the root of the key hierarchy. What you're doing has valid use (loss of media protection) but it can be handled 1 million times better by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb934049.aspx" rel="nofollow">Transparent Database Encryption</a> or by <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/bitlocker" rel="nofollow">BitLocker</a>.</p>

<p>As for your problem: just open the key in the session (ie. when you open the connection). There is zero reasons to try to open it on-demand on per-statement access.</p>
