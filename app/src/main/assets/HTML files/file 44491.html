<p>I've found the problem. It's caused by incorrect wildcard precompile settings in your <code>config/initializers/assets.rb</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( *.js )
</code></pre>

<p>So, specify only the <code>.js</code> files you need to include in your views explicitly instead of using wild cards would solve the problem.</p>
