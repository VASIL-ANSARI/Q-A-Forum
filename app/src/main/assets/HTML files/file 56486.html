<p>The problem is simple: there are two assumptions systems in SymPy, called the old-style and new-style assumptions. They don't interact quite well, yet.</p>

<p>The old-style assumptions define predicates on symbols, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>x = Symbol("x", positive=True)
</code></pre>

<p>deduction is then performed on generic expressions with methods such as <code>.is_positive</code></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x.is_positive
True
</code></pre>

<p>The latest version of SymPy has linked the old-style assumptions to the new-style ones, so you can now query</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ask(Q.positive(x))
True
</code></pre>

<p>Older versions of SymPy would return <code>None</code>, as the two assumptions systems were not linked at all.</p>

<p>The problem is that this relation is <strong>not yet</strong> reciprocal: the old-style assumptions system is not aware of assumptions defined with the new-style assumptions system. You can verify it yourself:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; with assuming(Q.positive(y)):
...    print y.is_positive    
None
</code></pre>

<p>The random variable <em>Normal</em> requires the standard deviation parameter to be positive, verification is done with the old-style assumptions. Therefore your case fails.</p>

<p>Note that the positivity condition on the standard deviation is likely to get relaxed to a non-negativity condition in the next SymPy version (that is, allow the positivity-indefinite case to be accepted).</p>
