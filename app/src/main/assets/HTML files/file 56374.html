<p>You are getting negative values because after completion of <code>work timer</code>, your <code>clearInterval</code> is not actually clearing out your timer. Now, your previous timer is already set and <code>break timer</code> is also initialized due to which both are running simultaneously and setting values.<code>finaltime</code> is already reached when break timer is set so negative values are coming. </p>

<p>One more thing convert <code>milliseconds</code> to seconds in <code>getTimeInSeconds()</code>. Suppose, present time is <code>15:59:40</code> and you are starting the timer for <code>1 minute</code> then what will happen is something different. For first <code>20</code> seconds it will run good but after that your minutes resets to <code>0</code> and this will set your minutes to <code>60</code> your are setting timer for <code>1 minute</code> but end up with <code>60 minutes</code>.</p>

<p>One more thing in equality check condition</p>

<pre><code>if(finalTime === getTimeInSeconds()){
}
</code></pre>

<p>you are setting <code>finalTime</code> using <code>finalTime = sessionVal * 60 + currentTime</code> it works but you are setting alert dialog box. Suppose , someone click ok after <code>5 seconds</code> now your timer won't run for <code>60 seconds</code> instead runs for <code>55 seconds</code> because 5 seconds are already elapsed. Don't know how you want your time to process after clicking alert whether to start time after clicking or just go on as it is going . just telling. </p>
