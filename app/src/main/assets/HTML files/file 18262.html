<pre><code>select t1.sec, t1.type, count(*) from table1 as t1 
join table2 as t2 on t1.sec = t2.sec and t1.type = t2.type
group by t1.sec, t1.type
having count(*) &gt; 1
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: That's not quite what you asked, that will show which ones have multiple records but they will be grouped.</p>
