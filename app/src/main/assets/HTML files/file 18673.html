<p>On the official page for that library there is a short description of solution for your problem: <a href="http://platform.twit88.com/news/60" rel="nofollow">http://platform.twit88.com/news/60</a>. I don't know if that would fix your problem though. I would find the source code of the library and debug through it to see the reason for the error. </p>

<p>hm... can't find the source code anywhere. So get in touch with the authors and ask them. </p>

<p>If that does not work out, I would change the library to something else. I have used <a href="http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">QrCode.Net</a> with MVC successfully and have some sample code how to integrate it to MVC, if you like.</p>
