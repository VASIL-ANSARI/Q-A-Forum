<p>If I understand your question right, you want to check if a button is toggled on or off before running the if statement right? In that case, I would declare a BOOL in your header file</p>

<pre><code>@property BOOL toggle;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your implementation file when the user presses the button the target of the button should have the code:</p>

<pre><code>if(self.toggle == TRUE){
    self.toggle = FALSE; 
    //and any visual UI change you want to show that the button is now off
}else{
    self.toggle = TRUE;
    //and any visual change you want to show that the button is now on
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your <code>-(IBAction)</code> your code becomes:</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)move2;{

    if (self.toggle){
        c2.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"imgres-3.jpg"];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And that should work.</p>
