<p>You could write it in a non-compressed format like BMP. BMP saves raw color bytes in rows. So you would load first row of tiles, read their separate pixel rows and write it as composite single row in output image. This way, you can have open only few tiles and imediately write down the output image.</p>

<p>But I don't know how to write it as compressed image, like JPG or PNG. But I'm sure some specialised software exists for that.</p>
