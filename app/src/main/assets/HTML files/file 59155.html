<p>Do two separate <code>left join</code>s:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE a
    SET a.campaign_name = coalesce(cidss.Campaign_Name, cidlc.Campaign_Name),
        a.Campaign_ID = coalesce(cidss.Campaign_ID, cidlc.Campaign_ID)
    FROM database.dbo.table a LEFT JOIN
         carb.dbo.carb_lookup_campaignid cidss
         ON cidss.Campaign_ID = a.Campaign and
            cidss.spend_source = a.Traffic_Source LEFT JOIN
         carb.dbo.carb_lookup_campaignid cidlc
         ON cidlc.Campaign_ID = a.Campaign and
            cidlc.Campaign_Name = a.Campaign and
            cidss.Campaign_ID is null
     WHERE cidss.Campaign_ID is not null or cidls.Campaign_ID is not null;
</code></pre>

<p>Each individual <code>LEFT JOIN</code> can take advantage of the appropriate index <code>(Campaign_ID, spend_source)</code> and <code>(Campaign_ID, Campaign_Name)</code>.</p>
