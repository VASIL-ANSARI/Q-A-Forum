<p>If ODOMETER is truly the odometer reading then this should work:   </p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
 VEHICLE_ID, 
 DRIVER_ID,
 SUM(AMOUNT) as Total_Amount, 
 MAX(ODOMETER) - MIN(ODOMETER) as DistanceTravelled, 
 SUM(LTR) As Total_Ltr
FROM Fuel_Filling 
 WHERE 
 COMPANY_ID = @COMPANY_ID 
 AND VEHICLE_ID = @VEHICLE_ID
 AND DATE_TIME BETWEEN @FROM_DATE AND @TO_DATE 
 GROUP BY VEHICLE_ID, DRIVER_ID
</code></pre>
