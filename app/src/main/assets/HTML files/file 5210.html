<p>Signals is an event messaging implementation, much like Smalltalk/Objective C <strong>Messages</strong> or <strong>Events</strong> in various other (e.g. C#) lanugages.</p>

<p>You can use them for a wide variety of tasks, take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer Pattern</a></p>

<h2>Why would you use the Observer Pattern?</h2>

<p>The benefits are largely organisational, when you work with large applications it's is important to apply patterns of reuse that help maintain development team coherence.</p>

<p>When the implementation of a particular pattern becomes de facto (or close to) it's especially useful because it means that lead up times for new team members are likely to be expedited, not only if they have used the implementation before, but also because the popularity of the implementation will mean that there are widespread resources, and documentation available to speed learning.</p>

<p>From a pure code perspective, ALL patterns appear as bloat, but when you begin to understand that upwards of 60% of the costs involved in software development are in maintenance life-cycle, it is well worth the additional code to gain coherence.</p>

<p>The other benefit is to aid in software reuse, depending on the style of implementation, the Observer Pattern can assist in modularising and decoupling classes from one another. I would suggest that this is also an organisational benefit, in as much that different teams can build components more easily, or simply because components are easier to replace.</p>
