<p>You have not escaped the closing bracket in your range block.</p>

<p>The following code will match opening bracket, any text and a closing bracket:</p>

<pre><code>$output = preg_replace("/\([^\)]+\)/", '', $input);
</code></pre>

<p>For those who can't read regex:</p>

<pre><code>\( //Opening bracket. The "\" is escaping the bracket so we can select it
    [ //This tells regex to select a range of characters
        ^ // This is a logical NOT character
        \) // So, select anything that is not a closing bracket. (remember to escape it)
    ]+ // select none or more characters
\) //closing bracket
</code></pre>
