<p>It doesn't work because <strong>:hover</strong> effects can't directly be used on touch-devices. </p>

<p>A possible solution is to add a click event listener to the links, by adding this javascript (it uses jQuery, so make sure you include the jQuery library):</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
   $('nav &gt; ul &gt; li').on('click', function(){
       //
   });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This solution is, however, not very elegant and is not really user-friendly, because you can't close the subnav using this method. I'd recommend writing some custom javascript to make sure the navigation works with all user cases (e.g. tapping outside the navigation to close etc.)</p>
