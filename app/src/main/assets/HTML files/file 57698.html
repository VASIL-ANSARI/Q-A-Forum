<blockquote>
  <p><strong>&rdquo;</strong> The value of a failed [dynamic] cast to pointer type is the null pointer value of the required result type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless, it's a good idea to use <code>nullptr</code> in order to communicate clearly to readers of the code.</p>

<p>Note that a failed <code>dynamic_cast</code> to reference type throws an exception, since there's no such thing as a null-reference.</p>

<hr>

<p>In order to check if an object <code>o</code> of statically known polymorphic type <code>Base</code> is really a <code>Derived</code>, you can use a <code>dynamic_cast</code> directly in an <code>if</code> condition &ndash; there's no need to compare it explicitly to anything:</p>

<pre><code>if( auto pd = dynamic_cast&lt;Derived*&gt;( &amp;o ) )
{
    // Use pd here
}
</code></pre>
