<p>I'm guessing you probably have just the javaee.jar in your classpath, which has the definitions of the javax.mail.* classes but not the actual implementation.</p>

<p>You should download the javamail api if you dont already have. Found <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
