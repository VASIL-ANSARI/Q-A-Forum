<p>You can dispatch the function, asynchronously, onto another queue.  This will ensure that the main queue isn't blocked performing the scheduling and will prevent the UI from becoming unresponsive:</p>

<pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIOââRITY_BACKGROUND, 0)) {
        scheduleFutureLocalNotifications()
    } 
}
</code></pre>
