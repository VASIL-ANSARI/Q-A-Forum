<p>Assuming you're using XWork's <code>DefaultActionInvocation</code> implementation, it's done there, by the <code>init</code> method. Pulling that out is a bit of a pain because it's layered underneath action proxies and action proxy factories in both XWork and S2.</p>

<p>That said, I'd be <em>very</em> hesitant at making a change like this; it has system-wide implications and is counter to essentially <em>everything</em> about XW/WW/S2.</p>

<p>(Unrelated, but singleton nature isn't what defines a controller, it's the <em>responsibilities</em> that define what a component is.)</p>
