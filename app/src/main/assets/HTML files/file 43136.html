<p>You can try increasing the cache size. Last time I tested this, networking code wouldn't cache if the received data exceeded 5% of the total cache size (though, annoyingly, I have yet to see Apple clearly articulate the rules that are applied during caching). </p>

<p>Anyway, if you look at the app delegate in the sample AFNetworking project, that shows and example of how to specify the cache size:</p>

<pre><code>NSURLCache *cache = [[NSURLCache alloc] initWithMemoryCapacity:4 * 1024 * 1024 diskCapacity:20 * 1024 * 1024 diskPath:nil];
[NSURLCache setSharedURLCache:cache];
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the default RAM cache is only 0.5mb and the disk cache is 10mb. By increasing that RAM cache to 4mb, like shown above, or larger, and you should be able to cache your 103kb image (assuming that all the other criteria, such as header fields of the response and the like, permit it).</p>
