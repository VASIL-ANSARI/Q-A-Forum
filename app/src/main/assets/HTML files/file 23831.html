<p>First: please be aware that your code is wide open to SQL Injection! You should sanitize the user input.</p>

<p>If you want to remember how many questions the user has already answered, you need to store that information somewhere. If your users have no accounts on the page, there is no secure way to do this, you need you store this client side â and so the user can trick you by just using a second browser.</p>

<p>One way of doing this is the session library of PHP (<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php</a>); whenever the user answers a question you increase his session counter by one:</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
if(!isset($_SESSION['questions_answered'])) {
  $_SESSION['questions_answered'] = 1;
} else {
  $_SESSION['questions_answered']++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And before you ask a question you check the counter:</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
if(isset($_SESSION['questions_answered']) &amp;&amp; $_SESSION['questions_answered'] &gt;= 50) {
    echo 'You have already answered 50 questions';
} else {
    // ask him a question
}
</code></pre>

<p>To show the user his score, you should store his session id (<code>session_id()</code>) in the DB together with his answers. When the user clicks the check-button you query the DB for his answers, check them and show the result.</p>

<p>To store the session ID in the DB you should add another column, e.g. <code>userSessionId</code> to the table. When you insert the data, you just add the user's session ID to the query:</p>

<pre><code>$query = "INSERT INTO
        radio (questionId, userSessionId, Option1, Option2, Option3)
    VALUES (
        ".$questionId.",
        ".session_id().",
        '".$Option['Option1']."',
        '".$Option['Option2']."',
        '".$Option['Option3']."')";
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally you should work with a question ID and store it with the answer, otherwise you won't be able to check the answer...</p>
