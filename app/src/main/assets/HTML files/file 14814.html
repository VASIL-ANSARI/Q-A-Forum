<h1>jQuery === JavaScript</h1>

<p>So calling a function in jQuery is exact the same as calling a function in JavaScript.</p>

<p>The only thing jQuery does is create easy-to-use methods and functions to speed up your JavaScript development. For example, the <code>window.onload</code> event is replaced by a <code>$(document).ready()</code> event.</p>
