<p>The purpose of the cref attribute is to link to the documentation for a type. But there is no documentation for concrete generic types, so it's not surprising that the generated cref attribute is for the generic type definition. Your concern is that you want to display something different that what is in the link. You can do that when using the  element, because the content of the element is the text of the link. But in the  element, the content of the element is the description of when the exception occurs. So I don't think there is a way to do what you are looking for.</p>
