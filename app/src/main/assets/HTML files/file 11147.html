<p>Apple uses Private APIs for partial page curl. If you want a partial page curl animation like in Maps app, you can use an animation of type:</p>

<pre><code>animation.type = @"pageCurl";
</code></pre>

<p>If you are not targeting for the app store, you can probably use this. To apply a partial page curl yourself would be a tedious task and would require advanced Core Animation and Open GL stuff. </p>

<p>But, if you just want a normal full page curl, not a partial one, you can use this documented method:</p>

<pre><code>+ (void)setAnimationTransition:(UIViewAnimationTransition)transition forView:(UIView *)view cache:(BOOL)cache; 
</code></pre>

<p>and set the transition as: </p>

<pre><code>UIViewAnimationTransitionCurlUp/UIViewAnimationTransitionCurlDown
</code></pre>
