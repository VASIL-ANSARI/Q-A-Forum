<p>If you are using SOAP-UI tool (Must have tool for web service developers)
 then you can use it for giving Authentication information.
There is Tab on bottom side of request where you can give values in header.
Then using TCP-IP monitor you can check the actual request coming in 
and you can see how to give those values in SOAP Headers.</p>
