<p>Your second attempt is trying to use <strong>HTML</strong> entities in CSS âÂ obviously that doesnât work. You can use an escaped character instead:</p>

<pre><code>content: '\25BC';
</code></pre>

<p>(It must be in hexadecimal.)</p>

<p>However, you can (and <em>should</em>) simply use the character ââ¼â directly âÂ you just need to save and open your file using the same, agreed on encoding. You fail to do so, and as a consequence the symbol is garbled. The best encoding to use is UTF-8, which is the agreed-on default encoding on the web, on Linux and for many other applications. However, some Windows editors still need to be told to please use this encoding manually.</p>
