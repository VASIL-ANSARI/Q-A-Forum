<p>The login page is likely been requested from the browser cache. Disable it by creating a <code>Filter</code> which is tied to the <code>FacesServlet</code> and has basically the following lines in the <code>doFilter()</code> method, so that you don't need to repeat it over all pages which you'd like to prevent from being cached.</p>

<pre><code>response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1.
response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0.
response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies.
</code></pre>
