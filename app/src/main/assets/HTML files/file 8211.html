<p>Make sure that your app isn't relying on the table cells to remember their selection state -- your app should be keeping track of what is and isn't selected somewhere other than in the views.</p>

<p>Your table data source's <code>-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> method is called each time the table needs to display a new cell, that is, a cell that wasn't visible before. That's your chance to configure the cell properly. It should check the data for the table, determine if the cell is supposed to be selected, and set the selected state appropriately.</p>
