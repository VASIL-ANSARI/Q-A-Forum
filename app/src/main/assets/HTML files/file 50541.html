<p>SSIS samples your data to get an idea of each column. It will use the max length of the sample to determine the "proper" field size. Of course this causes constant issues.</p>

<p>Can you add something to order your data to make the longest first?</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY LEN(LongFIELD) DESC 
</code></pre>
