<p>From the documentation of <code>mysql_connect()</code> of the <a href="http://in2.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.php" rel="nofollow">PHP Manual</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If a second call is made to mysql_connect() with the same arguments,
  no new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of
  the already opened link will be returned.</strong> The new_link parameter
  modifies this behavior and makes mysql_connect() always open a new
  link, even if mysql_connect() was called before with the same
  parameters. In SQL safe mode, this parameter is ignored.</p>

<hr>

<p>This (<code>mysql_*</code>) extension is deprecated as of <code>PHP 5.5.0</code>, and will be removed in the future. Instead, <strong>Prepared Statements</strong> of <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.prepare.php" rel="nofollow"><code>MySQLi</code></a> or <a href="http://in2.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepare.php" rel="nofollow"><code>PDO_MySQL</code></a> extension should be used to ward off SQL Injection attacks !</p>
