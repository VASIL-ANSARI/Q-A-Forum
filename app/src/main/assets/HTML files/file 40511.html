<p>Update - If you look at:</p>

<p><a href="http://reveng.sourceforge.net/crc-catalogue/16.htm#crc.cat-bits.16" rel="nofollow">RevEng 16-bit CRC Catalogue</a></p>

<p>there's a link to:</p>

<p>The first three labeled as CRC-CCITT operate on data sent or received MSB to LSB using the polynomial 0x11021. The only difference is the starting value:</p>

<p>CRC-CCITT (XModem) - crc initialized to 0x0000, same as prefixing by 0x0000.</p>

<p>CRC-CCITT (0xFFFF) - crc initialized to 0xFFFF, same as prefixing by 0x84CF.</p>

<p>CRC-CCITT (0x1D0F) - crc initialized to 0x1D0F, same as prefixing by 0xFFFF.</p>

<p>So my guess is that you want to use one of these three.</p>
