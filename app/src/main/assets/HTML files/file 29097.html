<p>You should rework your JSON - you have multiple keys with the same name, try to do <code>print_r($result)</code> to see what I am talking about - PHP will override the "stop_time_update" key time after time and you will be able to access only the last entry. Instead, you should organize your JSON like that:</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
  "id" : "421356",
  "trip_update" : {
    "trip" : {
      "trip_id" : "421356",
      "start_time" : "12:05:00",
      "start_date" : "20130926",
      "route_id" : "15"
    },
    "stop_time_update" : [{
       "stop_sequence" :70,
      "departure" : {
        "delay" : 240,
        "time" : 1380215057
      },
      "stop_id" : "6090"
    }, {
       "stop_sequence" :71,
      "departure" : {
        "delay" : 240,
        "time" : 1380215075
      },
      "stop_id" : "6095"
    }]
  }
}]
</code></pre>

<p>then you will be able to iterate through your data like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($result[0]-&gt;trip_update-&gt;stop_time_update as $update)
{
     $time = $update-&gt;departure-&gt;time;
     ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you cannot change the data structure, then what probably could help you is a PULL parser - one that does not return parsed data structure, but allows you to use a data stream instead - this way you could iterate over each node. The only one I managed to find is an extension to PHP:</p>
