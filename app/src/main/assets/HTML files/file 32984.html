<p>If I were you, I would do it two different ways.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a Console Table and have entries related to all consoles. </p>

<p>1.1.  Create a Game_Console Table and have entries related to Gameid and Consoleid as a Key, so that duplicates are not possible. </p>

<p>1.2  Join Game and Console using Game_Console to retrieve data faster by using possible indexes as well.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have another column called Console in the same game table and have data with comma separated values like XBOX360, PS3, XBOXONE, PS4(etc). </p>

<p>1.1 Write a user defined function to split the Comma separated value. See this article I wrote for splitting a string <a href="http://sqlsaga.com/sql-server/split-function-in-sql-server/" rel="nofollow">http://sqlsaga.com/sql-server/split-function-in-sql-server/</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's pretty much you can do about it unless you have other ways in mind.</p>
