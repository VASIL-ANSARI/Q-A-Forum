<p>Putting every connection on a thread is very bad, and is apparently a common mistake that beginners do. Every thread costs about 1 MB of memory, and this will overkill your program for no good reason. I did ask the very same question before, and I got <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31503638/c-boost-asio-start-ssl-server-session-in-a-new-thread">a very good answer</a>. I used boost ASIO, and the server/client project is finished since months, and it's a running project now beautifully.</p>

<p>If you use C++ and SSL (to secure your connection), no one will see your logic, since your programs are compiled. But you have to write your own communication protocol/serialization in that case.</p>
