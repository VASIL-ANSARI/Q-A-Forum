<p>You can't return anything but the address because what you can return is only <em>one</em> value. An array often contains more than one value. </p>

<p>You could return the value at position 0 of the array for example, but not all the different values at once.</p>

<p>And whoever posted that "workaround" obviously has no clue. This creates another array and copies the content from the original array into the new array, then returns <em>that</em> array's address.</p>

<p>However, you don't need to return the elements of an array, the array reference allows you to access the elements.</p>

<p><code>returnArray()[0]</code> gets the first element of the returned array (reference).</p>

<p>To print the elements, you can iterate over the array:</p>

<pre><code>for (int x : returnArray()) { 
  System.out.println(x);
}
</code></pre>
