<p>I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do here, but in the tstep loop, fw should be changed by collision, but it's never actually USED until after it's changed again by wbrzeg (whatever that is). So, in your code, it doesn't actually MATTER if fw is being updated by collision...</p>

<p>It's possible that this is just a typeo in your example somewhere, but fixing that might help someone who actually understands your problem (ie not me)...</p>
