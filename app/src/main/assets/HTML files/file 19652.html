<p>Got the same problem. It seems Apple is working on that.<br>
Running the <code>exec</code> file in the Terminal is the simplest way to run your program. However, it is possible to display your input in the built-in console. You must type your digits (only the first of them will be displayed), then select another output in the drop-down menu and select "Target output" again.</p>

<p>Hope it will be solved soon.</p>
