<p>If it <em>really</em> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;myid&gt;1234&lt;/myid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...you can extract it like this:</p>

<pre><code>Matcher match = Pattern.compile("&lt;myid&gt;(\d+)&lt;/myid&gt;").matcher(str);
</code></pre>

<p>...and then use the matcher repeatedly, getting the value from the capture group.</p>

<p>But <strong><em>there's a reason</em></strong> everyone is telling you to use a proper parser. There are lots of ways the above can fail, both matching inappropriately and failing to match when it should.</p>

<p>The proper solution is to make the XML valid, and then parse it, and use XPath or similar to read the values.</p>

<p>If you really have some tool requiring you to send it invalid XML, you need to replace that tool. More likely, though, it's some misunderstanding.</p>
