<p>The reason is because the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.image.getthumbnailimage.aspx" rel="nofollow">Image.GetThumbnailImage</a> function that you are using is only intended to make low quality images.</p>

<p>See these remarks from the MSDN documentation on GetThumbnailImage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The GetThumbnailImage method works
  well when the requested thumbnail
  image has a size of about 120 x 120
  pixels. If you request a large
  thumbnail image (for example, 300 x
  300) from an Image that has an
  embedded thumbnail, there could be a
  noticeable loss of quality in the
  thumbnail image. It might be better to
  scale the main image (instead of
  scaling the embedded thumbnail) by
  calling the DrawImage method.</p>
