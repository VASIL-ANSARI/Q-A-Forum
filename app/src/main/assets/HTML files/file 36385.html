<p>Problem Solved:
In the S3-Log-Bucket, I was mentioning the entire path specific to my bucket.. Like I have my bucket and there are multiple folders in it. So I was mentioning the entire path to it but BOTO doesn't expect that to happen. Hence I just had to mention the bucket name only instead of mentioning the entire path.</p>

<p>Previously I was doing--> </p>

<pre><code>log_bucket = Bucket/Inner Folder 1/Inner Folder 2/.../ which was wrong
</code></pre>

<p>Correct way of doing it--> </p>

<pre><code>log_bucket = Bucket
</code></pre>
