<p>Nice to see that it works for your case. Now as an answer instead of a reply:</p>

<p>Maybe just an idea, but instead of compiling the generated files, could you instead wrap them in a namespace? e.g:</p>

<pre><code>namespace autogen1 {
#include "autogenerated1.cpp"
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'd obviously need to exclude the autogenerated files from compiling (as those are now pulled in through the include), but you now have access to all members of both autogenerated files, simply by prefixing the calls with the appropriate namespaces.</p>

<p>It looks a bit hackish (but not as bad as your own solution ;-) )</p>
