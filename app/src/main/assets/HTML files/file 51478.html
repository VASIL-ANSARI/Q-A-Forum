<p>Thanks to all. I don't know exactly where was the problem, but creating the servlet with the wizard of Eclipse (which actually generates exactly the same code) works perfectly; which meant, another bug to the list of Eclipse. </p>

<p>By the way, I had tried before to clean and rebuild the application at least a dozen times, both the application and server, but still giving the same error; so that's it, I guess it will be a error of Eclipse.</p>
