<p>I am not exactly sure what you want, but that logic will always evaluate to <code>true</code>.  You might want to use AND (&amp;&amp;), instead of OR (||)</p>

<p>The furthest statement that is ever tested is (<code>$str != "danielle"</code>) and there are only two possible outcomes as PHP enters the block as soon as a statement yields true.</p>

<p>This is the first:</p>

<pre><code>$str = "dan";

$str != "joe" # true - enter block
$str != "danielle" #ignored
$str != "heather" #ignored
$str != "laurie" #ignored
$str != "dan" #ignored
</code></pre>

<p>This is the second:</p>

<pre><code>$str = "joe";

$str != "joe" # false - continue evaluating
$str != "danielle" # true - enter block
$str != "heather" #ignored
$str != "laurie" #ignored
$str != "dan" #ignored
</code></pre>

<p>If the OR was changed to AND then it keeps evaluating until a false is returned:</p>

<pre><code>$str = "dan";

$str != "joe" # true - keep evaluating
$str != "danielle" # true - keep evaluating
$str != "heather"  # true - keep evaluating
$str != "laurie" # true - keep evaluating
$str != "dan"  # false - do not enter block
</code></pre>

<p>The solution doesn't scale well though, you should keep an array of the exclude list and check against that do:</p>

<pre><code>$str = "dan";
$exclude_list = array("joe","danielle","heather","laurie","dan")
if(!in_array($str, $exclude_list)){          
    echo " &lt;a href='/about/".$str.".php'&gt;Get to know ".get_the_author_meta('first_name')." &amp;rarr;&lt;/a&gt;";
}
</code></pre>
