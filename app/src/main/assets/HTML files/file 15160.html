<p>What I think @TarunMaheshwari is trying to say is that instead of having 3 activities (eg. classes with <code>extends activity</code>), replace it with <code>extends fragment</code> (obviously there are other minor changes you might have to make for the code to work) and then create a main activity (with <code>extends FragmentActivity</code>) that has the static footer you want which can call on the 3 different fragments.</p>
