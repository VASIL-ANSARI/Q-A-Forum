<p>this is absolutely wrong here: </p>

<pre><code>colorpick.getValue().hashCode()
</code></pre>

<p>hashcode is a specific code generated by the JVM to manage hash numbers related to instances and hash-tables... and has NOTHING to do with colors..</p>

<p>this should be more than ok</p>

<pre><code>colorpick.getValue()
</code></pre>
