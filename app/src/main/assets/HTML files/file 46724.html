<p>It seems that the issue, or at least part of it, is that starting in the 2.x series of the <strong>.NET Driver for MongoDB</strong>, the Target Framework Version changed to 4.5.</p>

<p>So there are two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you really need to get this working in SQL Server 2008 or 2008 R2, then you can grab the source code for 1.10 version of the <strong>.NET Driver for MongoDB</strong>, found at:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/tree/v1.10.0" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-csharp-driver/tree/v1.10.0</a><br>
That is the last version to use .NET Framework Version 3.5.</p></li>
<li><p>Since it seems that the 2.x series of the <strong>.NET Driver for MongoDB</strong> does work in the newer versions of SQL Server (2012 and newer, I assume), you do have the option of:</p>

<ul>
<li>installing SQL Server 2014 (or soon to be 2016) Express Edition (the free version)</li>
<li>loading a 2.x version of the <strong>.NET Driver for MongoDB</strong> onto that Express Edition instance</li>
<li>and then setting up a Linked Server from the SQL Server 2008 instance to the SQL Server 201[2,4,6] Express Edition, and hence use the Express Edition as a proxy</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
