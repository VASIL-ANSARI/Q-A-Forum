<p>Try renaming the variable <code>list</code> into something that's not a reserved word or built-in function or type.</p>

<p>What's confusing to beginners - and it happens to everyone sooner or later - is what happens if you redefine or use in unintended ways a reserved word or a builtin.</p>

<p>If you do</p>

<pre><code>list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>you re-bind the name <code>list</code> to no longer point to the builtin <code>list</code> data type but to the actual list <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> in the current scope. That is almost always not what you intend to do. Using a variable <code>dir</code> is a similar pitfall.</p>

<p>Also do not use additional parantheses <code>()</code> around the square brackets of the list assignment. Something like <code>words = ['wer', 'werwe', 'werwe' ,'wer we']</code> suffices.</p>

<p>Generally consider which names you choose for a variable. <code>students</code> is descriptive, helpful commentary, <code>list</code> is not. Also if <code>list</code> currently holds a list, your algorithm might be changed later on with the variable holding a <code>set</code> or any other container type. Then a type-based variable name will be even misleading.</p>
