<p>This is because getText() is an object and may not have a assignment and is null. The difference between primitives and Objects is primitives cannot be null, but have a default value such as a int being 0 and a boolean being false. So when your getting what I assume will be the Text object the only thing you can do is below in code.... </p>

<pre><code>    /*
     * Retrieve Edit Text Values
     */
    EditText simpleEditText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editLat);
    Text text = simpleEditText.getText();
    String textString;
    if(text != null){
     textString = text.toString();
    } else {
       // Handle missing text object
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing wrong with null checking and handling. This is your only solution unless you own the android API and and change the library yourself. </p>
