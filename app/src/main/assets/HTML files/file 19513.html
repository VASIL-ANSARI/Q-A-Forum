<p>You can't easily achieve what you want, since you are joining the same table twice, and SQL needs an alias to disambiguate them.</p>

<p>You could, however, create a view for table <code>data</code>, and use the view instead of the table name in one of the <code>data</code> joins.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>select data.time,
    vData.time,
    data.Signal,
    drivers.name,
    drivers.lastname,
    vehicles.vehicle,
    data.Reg
from data 
inner join vData on data.id != vData.id and data.serial = vData.serial
inner join drivers on data.FK_ID_driver = drivers.ID_driver
inner join vehicles on data.Reg = vehicles.Reg
where TIMEDIFF(vData.time, data.time) between '00:15:00' and '00:30:00';
</code></pre>
