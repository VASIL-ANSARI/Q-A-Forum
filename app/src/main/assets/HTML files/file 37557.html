<p>What are you using to access AD? I'm assuming <code>System.DirectoryServices</code></p>

<p>What account is you app pool running as &amp; what version of IIS? Assuming IIS7 or greater, you're probably using <code>AppPoolIdentity</code> which means you're accessing AD as anonymous user. Change the identity to <code>NetworkService</code> &amp; it should use the machine account of your web server.</p>

<p>If you need privileges to do activities, then you'll need to use a specific account. If you're  using <code>AccountManagement</code> Objects, then specify the credentials in a context class. If you're using classes in <code>Protocols</code>, then you do it using the connection. MSDN &amp; Google have plenty of examples.</p>

<p>You should understand the security implications of the approach you use, as with all things security related.</p>
