<p>That would be <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>object[]</code> respectively, if you take the weak typing nature of <code>NSMutableArray</code> and <code>NSArray</code> into account.</p>

<p>Arrays and lists in C# (at least for .NET 2.0 and above) can also be strongly-typed, so depending on what kind of object you're storing you can specify that type. For example if you only have <code>NSString</code> objects in an <code>NSMutableArray</code> in your Objective-C code, you'd use <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code>, and if you have them in an <code>NSArray</code>, you'd use <code>string[]</code> with a fixed size instead.</p>

<p>To quickly initialize and populate a list or an array in C#, you can use what's known as a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384062.aspx">collection initializer</a>:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; list = new List&lt;string&gt; { "foo", "bar", "baz" };
string[] array = { "foo", "bar", "baz" }; // Shortcut syntax for arrays
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><code>string</code> in C# is immutable, just like <code>NSString</code> in the Foundation framework. Every time you assign a new string to a variable, you simply point or refer the variable to a different object.</p>
