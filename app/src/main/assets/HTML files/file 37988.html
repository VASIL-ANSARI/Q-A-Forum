<p>After some searching, I manage to get a ugly solution , it seems the problem is caused by each page is dynamic add to page, however, the jquery "on" is not working and I have no idea about it. Finally this code is works.</p>

<pre><code>   $('#data_table').dataTable({
            "fnDrawCallback": function() {
                $('.showDetail').unbind('click');
                $('.showDetail').on('click', function() {
                ...........
                });
            }
        });
</code></pre>
