<p>You're assigning your click handlers to the elements referenced by these two variables:</p>

<pre><code>epidural_analgesia_INFO
effects_of_yoga_INFO
</code></pre>

<p>but both variables are initialised to reference <code>document.images[0]</code>. So clicking that image triggers both handlers. Should the second one perhaps use an index of <code>1</code> to get the second image?</p>

<p>(As an aside, why use <code>addEventListener()</code> when you seem to be using jQuery?)</p>
