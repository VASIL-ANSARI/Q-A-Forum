<ul>
<li>11PM is 23 hours, not 11. </li>
<li>Time can't be both greater than 11pm and less than 7am.</li>
<li>You're comparing strings and not actual time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's an example using DateTime() which make the logic a little bit clearer.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$curTime = new DateTime();
$am = new DateTime('07:00');
$pm = new DateTime('23:00');
if(($curTime &lt; $pm) &amp;&amp; ($curTime &gt; $am)){
   echo "Working...";
   //some code here...
}else{
   echo "Sorry! this app not working at this time. Please use this app between 11pm to 7am &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks";
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>
