<p>To avoid rounding issues with floats (and doubles), for currency you should be using NSDecimalNumber's.  All of your existing code listed in your question with work with them.  Simply get rid of your float and use the following line instead:</p>

<pre><code>NSDecimalNumber *t1 = [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:@"999999.99"];
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that there are other ways to create NSDecimalNumber's, depending on how you populate your variables.)</p>
