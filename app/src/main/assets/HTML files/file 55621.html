<p>Since yo are using SeleniumWebdriver, you probably have this as a data structure: <code>List&lt;WebElement&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Lists are part of the java.util.Collection framework and therefore it is not very hard to implement a sorting. Something like this could work, if list contains the <code>List&lt;WebElement&gt;</code> and the float values that you want to sort after are in an attribute called <code>toSortAfter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Collections.sort(list, new Comparator&lt;WebElement&gt;(){
@Override
public int compare(WebElement e1, WebElement e2){
    String fl1Str = e1.getAttribute("toSortAfter");
    String fl2Str = e2.getAttribute("toSortAfter");

    if (fl1Str != null &amp;&amp; fl2Str != null){
       float f1 = Float.parseFloat(fl1Str);
       float f2 = Float.parseFloat(fl2Str);
       if (f1 &lt; f2){
         return -1;
       }
       else if (f1 &gt; f2) {
         return 1;
       }
    }
    return 0;
}
});
</code></pre>

<p>I leave better handling of Exceptions to the interested reader... Also, note that I wrote this out of my head and without a Java-Compiler at hand. So there might be syntax or other mistakes.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em></p>

<p>Without the knowledge of the HMTL nodes you are collectiong it is not possible to help you any further. It might be, that the attribute is called differently, of that the float value is not an attribute altogether. If is it the content of the Elements, you can access this with WebElement.getText() method.</p>
