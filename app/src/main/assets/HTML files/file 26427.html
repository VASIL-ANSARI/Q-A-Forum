<p>There isn't anything built into Ruby, but you can use <code>ffmpeg</code> to strip the audio from the video. Check out the gem <a href="https://github.com/streamio/streamio-ffmpeg" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/streamio/streamio-ffmpeg</a>. This will also require you to have <code>ffmpeg</code> and any dependencies installed on your production machine. You may want to consider moving this into a background process (delayed_job) or putting a progressbar so the user doesn't wonder why it is just churning but not displaying results immediately. You can use something like polling or some type of notification to let the user know once the audio file is ready for streaming/downloading.</p>
