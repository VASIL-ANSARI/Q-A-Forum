<p>Not sure about requirejs-rails, but with RequireJS it's pretty easy.</p>

<pre><code>define(['dep1', 'dep2'] , function ($, otherLibrary) {
    return function () {
        // your module code
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>Where 'dep1' and 'dep2' are other RequireJS modules that your module depends on. You can depend on as few or as many as you like. The var names you pass to the actual function ($ and otherLibrary in this example) are the names that those libraries will be assigned to within your module.</p>

<p>Anyone using RequireJS will be able to require your module this way, based on how the file is named and the folders it's in. </p>

<p>For instance, if this file was called "my-super-lib.js" inside of the <code>libs</code> directory, another module could just pass <code>libs/my-super-lib</code> to its dependency array and everything will be set up.</p>

<p>Update: just remembered you mentioned coffeescript. Same idea, but to be clear:</p>

<pre><code>define ['dep1', 'dep2'], ($, otherLibrary) -&gt;
    () -&gt;
        // your module code
</code></pre>

<p>If you're into that. ;)</p>
