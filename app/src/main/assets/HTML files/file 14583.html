<p>Because the index in the DB and in the given example is <em>sorted</em> alphabetically. The raw table / book is not. Then think: How do <em>you</em> search an index knowing it is sorted? I guess you don't start reading at "A" up to the point of your interest. Instead you skip roughly to the POI and start searching from there. Basically a DB can to the same with an index.</p>
