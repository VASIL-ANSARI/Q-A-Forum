<p>If this code wasn't written by you and declares a non-public static class (side-note: it defaults to <strong>package-protected</strong>, which is very different to <strong>protected</strong>), chances are the writer intends to hide the class from your use. In short, there is no way to access the class from outside the package, and you probably shouldn't be trying to.</p>
