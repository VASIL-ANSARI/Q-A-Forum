<p>Your selector is wrong. The span has 3 different classes - ss-icon-user, num-students, and left. Your selector is looking for elements with the ss-icon-user class which have a child "num-students" TAG with in turn has a child "left" TAG. If you want to select multiple classes, you would do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>var students = $('.ss-icon-user, .num-students, .left');
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this could potentially pull back multiple entries if more than one element has all three of these classes.</p>
