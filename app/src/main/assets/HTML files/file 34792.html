<p>You can't.</p>

  <p>I think dispatchKeyEvent method exist in Activity class and not Exist in Service class. </p>

<p>Correct. Services do not have a UI and therefore do not have key events to be dispatched.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to dispatch a key event from a service. <code>dispatchKeyEvent()</code>, to the extent that anyone uses it, is for simulating key events in an activity's own UI. Your service is welcome to tell your activity to dispatch a key event. You might use an event bus implementation (e.g., greenrobot's EventBus) for this.</p>
