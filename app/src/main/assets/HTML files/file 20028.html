<p>You simply need to keep calling <code>getchar</code> to consume the characters you don't want from the stream.  If you know there's always a single additional character then it is as simple as making one additional call to <code>getchar</code>.  </p>

<p>If you want to remove multiple characters from the stream or deal with situations where the input may actually contain something you really need you can do something like the code below instead of your <code>choice = getchar()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>do
{
  choice = getchar();
} while(choice=='\n'); // Add any other characters you may want to skip
</code></pre>

<p>This will keep removing characters (in this case only if they are newline) but leave choice set to the first non-removed character.</p>

<p>By the way, you can't compare strings like that (<code>!= "all"</code>) use the C string compare functions, e.g. <code>strcmp()</code>.</p>

<p>More generically the C++ istream ignore can be roughly written in C as something like the code below; call with <code>stdin</code> to skip characters from the standard input:</p>

<pre><code>int ignore(FILE *stream, int n, int delim)
{
  int c;
  while(n&gt;0)
  {
    c = getc(stream);
    if(c==EOF || c==delim)
    {
      return c;
    }
    n--;
  }
  return(c);
} 
</code></pre>
