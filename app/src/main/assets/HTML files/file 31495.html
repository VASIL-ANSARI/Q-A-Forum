<p>Assuming that your sub string will not have duplicates, you could use an <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/" rel="nofollow"><code>unordered_set</code></a>. So you essentially iterate over your <code>s[]</code> and for each character, you will check if the set contains that particular character. </p>

<p>The <code>unordered_set</code> allows O(1) searching, so your algorithm should run in O(n) (n = size of <code>s</code>).</p>

<p>When you find a character in the set which is also within the array, you remove it and continue traversing the array. If by the time your are done traversing the array the set is empty, then you know that your array contains that substring. You can also check to see that the set is not empty each time you remove a character from it, this should reduce execution time.</p>
