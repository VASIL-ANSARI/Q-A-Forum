<p>In your constructor, you're asking for quite a lot of stack for a small processor:</p>

<ul>
<li>24 <code>Pawn</code>s - however big they are</li>
<li>64 <code>int</code>s for <code>board</code></li>
</ul>

<p>How big is a <code>Pawn</code> in bytes?</p>

<p>You might run out of stack.  Check out <a href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php?topic=82772.0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> for more discussion on types of memory and how to see if you've run out of stack/heap.  <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/CorruptArrayVariablesAndMemory" rel="nofollow">Another useful page on Arduino memory</a></p>

<p>1224 bytes is quite a lot of the 2048 (IIRC) that's available in total!</p>

<p>Also - are you calling <code>new</code> at all - that'll use the heap which is RAM also.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Sounds from your comments that you've allocated them <em>twice</em>, once in the class and once on the stack inside the function - did you mean to do that?</p>

<p><strong>More edit:</strong></p>

<p>Don't allocate things in a header.  <code>extern</code> then or prototype them, or put them in the class.  But don't allocate them there!</p>

<p>If you have <code>Pawn myPawns[24]</code> inside the class, you don't need to declare it in the constructor.</p>
