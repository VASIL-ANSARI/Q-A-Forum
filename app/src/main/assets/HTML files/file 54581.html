<p>In the transaction 2.0.0 namespace the xml element is named <code>&lt;tx:enable/&gt;</code> not <code>&lt;tx:enable-annotations/&gt;</code>. This is not related to the error you described though.</p>

<p>The error says that you do not have the correct Aries JPA bundle installed. Be sure you install all necessary features like in <a href="https://github.com/cschneider/Karaf-Tutorial/blob/master/tasklist-blueprint-cdi/features/src/main/resources/features.xml" rel="nofollow">this example</a>.</p>

<p>The dependencies in the pom cover only the build time. At runtime you have to provide the dependencies as karaf features or individual bundles.</p>

<p>Also make sure you use the newest Apache Karaf. Older versions did not include the aries transaction 2.0.0 bundle.</p>
