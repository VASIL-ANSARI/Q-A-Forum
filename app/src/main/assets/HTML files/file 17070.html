<p>Off the top of my head....</p>

<p>Slow/Intense start up code. This will probably be in Program, a constructor of an object created at startup or the Show/Load events of the first form.</p>

<p>A Database/Internet based connection at start up, <strong>especially</strong> if that connection is unable to connect. It never fails to surprise how many people write synchronous network related code and complain of their app being slow.</p>

<p>A large number of libraries being loaded, this is an odd one since the performance profiler don't always show what you are waiting for.</p>

<p>Note that ALL of the above can be run within a start up/splash screen with a progress bar.</p>
