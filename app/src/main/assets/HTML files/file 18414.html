<p>It stops there because a comparison with strings is done alphabetically. This means <strong>2L9</strong> is less than <strong>2L900</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>1L9 &lt;= foo &lt;= 2L9 &lt;2L900
</code></pre>

<p><strong>foo</strong> is all you will get in this case. Another example could be,</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE name BETWEEN "A" and "Bart"
</code></pre>

<p>You would get a name like Baracus, since <strong>Bara</strong> is less than "Bart", but not Bartholomew (which is alphabetically greater than Bart). </p>

<p>So if you want the 2L900, you will have to set the maximum possible element you want, i.e <strong>2L900BR</strong></p>
