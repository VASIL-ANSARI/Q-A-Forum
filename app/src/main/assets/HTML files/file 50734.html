<p>I think @skywalker has a very good point, but if you want to do it with ajax like now:</p>

<p>In your <code>php</code> file where you save the <code>session</code> change it to</p>

<pre><code>session_start();

// make sure previous value has been deleted // &lt;--- not needed
unset($_SESSION['word']);

$_SESSION['word'] = $_POST['word']; 

session_write_close();  //&lt;---------- Add this to close the session so that reading from the session will contain the new value.
</code></pre>

<p>To explain: the <code>session</code> is stored in files on the server. When you edit the session, the files are locked for writing but not for reading. When the server did not write all the changes yet to the session files and the next php script tries to read the session, you will get the 'old' values. To force the server to write all changes to the session, close the session for writing before reading with the next script.</p>
