<p>It is sorting a list by a pair of values. Since it's sorting a list there aren't any key, value pairs, but more two values next to each other. 
The way it's written it sorts by the second value in reverse, <strong>then</strong> sorts by the first value in normal ascending order.</p>

<p>Here it is demonstrated:</p>

<pre><code>l1 = [[2,2],[3,1],[1,2],[4,1]]

l1.sort(key=lambda(k,v):(-v,k))

l1
=&gt; [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 1], [4, 1]]
</code></pre>
