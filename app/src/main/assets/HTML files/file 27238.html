<p>This doesn't require anything special. When you log in with the user, you are assigned a certain directory that you start in. on Shared hosting packages on a linux environment.</p>

<p>This is generally:</p>

<pre><code>/home/username/ 
</code></pre>

<p>then from there, you can choose whatever directory, like:</p>

<pre><code>'/public_html/'.$ftpFolder.'/.'$fileName;
</code></pre>

<p>If you only want the PHP to execute after the form has been submit, then you need to perform a conditional. You can check as many or as little posted variables as you want.</p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_POST['server'])):
    //your logic.
endif;
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to know what directory you're set into by default, you can use</p>

<pre><code>ftp_pwd();
</code></pre>

<p>which returns the present working directory for the FTP connection.</p>
