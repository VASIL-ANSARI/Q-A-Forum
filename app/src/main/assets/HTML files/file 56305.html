<p>When I was using eclipse I went through this. I never found a solution of using jar directly but I followed the following steps to include this library.</p>

<p>To add any library the steps are:</p>

<p>1) Eclipse -> Import -> Existing Android Code into workspace.</p>

<p>2) Add your_sdk_path\extras\android\support\v7\appcompat to your Eclipse workspace.</p>

<p>3) Right click on your project in Eclipse and select properties.(The window you have shown in the pic)</p>

<p>4) Select Android -> Library -> Add.</p>

<p>5) Select the imported project(appcompat) and Save.</p>

<p>I hope this might help. For any query feel free to ask.</p>
