<p>This isn't making a copy. Both <code>newArray</code> and <code>appDelegate.originalArray</code> refer to the same object. You would need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableArray *newArray = [appDelegate.originalArray mutableCopy];
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that I'm using <code>NSMutableArray</code> and <code>mutableCopy</code> to ensure the copy is mutable (i.e. supports adding and removing items)</p>
