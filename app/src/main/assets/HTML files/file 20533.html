<p>You made two mistakes in implementing one of the tedious asyncore methods:</p>

<pre><code>def writable(self):
    len(self.buffer) &gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>This method returns <code>None</code> (because you forgot the <code>return</code> part of that statement).  The first mistake is that <code>None</code> has a false boolean value, so <code>Connector</code> is never considered writeable.  The second mistake is that you need to check for writeability during the attempt to establish the connection.  Since <code>writable</code> always returns false, including during the connection attempt, no progress is ever made to establish the connection.</p>

<p>I recommend checking out <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/" rel="nofollow">Twisted</a> instead.  It doesn't make you implement low-level buffer management yourself and connection setup code yourself and as a result actually produces more efficient code that's shorter and easier to write.</p>

<p>asyncore should really be considered a historical artifact and never actually used.</p>
