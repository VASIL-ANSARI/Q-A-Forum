<p>If Form1 is your application's Main Form then you should use --> <code>Appliction.MainForm</code>. That way you don't need the parameter.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I was not trying to be obtuse and not answer your question. You can create a singleton with parameters using multiple constructors, however, I would try to avoid it.</p>

<pre><code>private Singleton(param1,param2) 
public static Singleton MyInstance(param1,param2)
</code></pre>
