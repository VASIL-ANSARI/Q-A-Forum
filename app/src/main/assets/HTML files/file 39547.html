<p>You cannot keep someone from viewing your CSS; however, you can <em>minify</em> your CSS which makes it harder to read, and gives you the added performance boost by shrinking the size of your CSS. I would recommend miniifying your code when deploying to your test and production environments, keeping your local and/or devlopment environments non-minified helps you debug your code quicker.</p>

<p>There are online tools that allow you to minify your CSS manually, or you can automate the process of minifying it with tools like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" rel="nofollow">grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" rel="nofollow">gulp</a>.</p>
