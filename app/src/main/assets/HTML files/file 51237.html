<p>I didn't read to deeply but maybe you can do it a bit more uncomplicated.</p>

<p>Maybe you just save time and date of last time the task was running/completed and/or force-stopped to shared preferences. On App start you can read this from shared preferences and calculate if there is a need to reschedule it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps a bit</p>
