<p>In Scala PairRDD is a Tuple type and you can access its members with <code>_1</code>and <code>_2</code>. However Java does not have built in Tuples so you have to use methods to get these members. It should look like this, since Java always requires parentheses on any function.</p>

<pre><code>JavaRDD&lt;String&gt; corpus = sc.wholeTextFiles("docs/*.md").map(a -&gt; a._2());
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: It seems that in Scala an implicit parameter is passed to the <code>map</code> method, which means you have to pass it explicitly in Java. See <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.4.0/api/java/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.html#map(scala.Function1,%20scala.reflect.ClassTag)" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the Java Doc and <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.2.0/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD" rel="nofollow">here</a> for the Scala documentation. </p>

<p>Edit 2: After a few hours of fumbling the answer was found, it had to be a JavaRDD.</p>
