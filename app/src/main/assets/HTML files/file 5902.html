<p>I have some experience with Tesseract...
a simple google of 'training tesseract' reveals this page:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract</a>
where you must choose which version of tesseract you wish to train..
While 3 is the latest version, it's brand new and thus people are still ironing out any issues - im still using version 2.4. Anyways, you'll see there are about 9 steps in training tesseract for a particular 'language' (or what should have been called 'fonts' or 'character-sets'). You could also just use the existing 'eng' language - but it depends on your application. For example, in my application I would have to do the document analysis and take a particular region and want to OCR a 13-character string of numbers - and I needed high accuracy - and I didn't want it reading '5' as 'S' and '0' as 'O' etc, so it was logical to create a particular 'language' of my particular font-set consisting only of the characters 0..9, whereas you might not care if you get extra 'noise</p>
