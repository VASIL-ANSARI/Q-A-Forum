<p>No, it is not currently supported. Parts of it work and parts of it don't.</p>

<p>You can find a starting point at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jdhardy/django-ipy-patches" rel="nofollow">http://bitbucket.org/jdhardy/django-ipy-patches</a>, but I really need to add some documentation.</p>

<p>Help getting it running would be appreciated!</p>
