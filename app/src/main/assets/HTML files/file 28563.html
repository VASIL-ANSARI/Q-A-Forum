<p>Ok. I have found the problem. But still don't know why... I removed the SocketFactory lines and it's done.</p>

<p>The working code is this:</p>

<pre><code>Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("mail.smtp.host", "cpanel4.onofis.com");
props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
props.put("mail.smtp.port", "465");
</code></pre>
