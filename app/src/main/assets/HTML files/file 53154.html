<p>This is because compiler cannot "see" the evaluation on <code>while()</code> statement will definitely be <code>true</code> and <code>name</code> will be assigned in the <code>while</code> block for the first time.</p>

<p>Change your</p>

<pre><code>string name;
</code></pre>

<p>into</p>

<pre><code>string name = ""; //or string.Empty
</code></pre>

<p>Although as human we can read easily that the while block is going to be executed for the first time:</p>

<pre><code>string name; //unassigned
int i = 0;
while (i == 0) //will enter
{
    Console.Write("What is your name?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ");
    name = Console.ReadLine(); //name will definitely be assigned here
    ... something else
}
Console.WriteLine("Good Morning, " + name); //compiler cannot "see" that the while loop will definitely be entered and name will be assigned. Therefore, "name" is unassigned
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>compiler cannot see that</em>, thus giving you the error.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could also change the <code>while</code> block to <code>do-while</code> to force the compiler to see that the <code>name</code> will be assigned (Credit goes to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/152602/lee">Lee</a>):</p>

<pre><code>string name; //unassigned
int i = 0;
do //will enter
{ 
    Console.Write("What is your name?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ");
    name = Console.ReadLine(); //name will definitely be assigned here
    ... something else
} while (i == 0);
Console.WriteLine("Good Morning, " + name); //should be OK now
</code></pre>
