<p>Oxygene doesn't attempt to be source compatible with Delphi. What's more the runtime libraries used by the various Oxygene flavours differ entirely from those used by Delphi. So you won't find any serious libraries that have single source that can compile on Oxygene and Delphi.</p>

<hr>

<p>The way that RemObjects have developed Oxygene on different platforms is quite interesting and radically different from the approach taken by Embarcadero with Delphi.</p>

<p>With Delphi the goal is that you can single source development for all the platforms. That is made possible by the FireMonkey framework which presents a common interface to all platforms. Obviously you need to vary some elements of an app to account for device differences.</p>

<p>With Oxygene, each platform is targetted separately. So for Windows, the runtime is .net. For Java it is the JVM and for Apple platforms you target Cocoa.</p>

<p>All this means that you cannot expect to write a GUI app in Oxygene and have it work on multiple platforms. </p>

<p>So not only can you single source your app between Delphi and Oxygene, you cannot readily single source multiple Oxygene targets.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, you can probably port to Oxygene or FPC without too much trouble. But maintaining single source is liable to mean a lot more effort. Whether that's worth the effort is debateable. In the long run you'll want a codebase in one of Delphi, FPC, Oxygene, or even something radically different. But you won't want your code spread out over multiple languages.</p>
