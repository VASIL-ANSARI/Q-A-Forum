<p>What is your sql server ? some companies change the server name from local host to something else to security purpose - Well but if its saying access denied for user that is may be your are connecting to wrong database ? that is </p>

<pre><code>mysql_select_db(SQL_DB)
</code></pre>

<p>Are you sure you are using the correct database name ? and you are able to log into your SQL account with same username and password ? well if the problem still persist trying using the root account of SQL the super admin hope you are on your local computer or have a dedicated server.</p>

<p>Why don't you try using them in this form -</p>

<pre><code>$con = mysql_connect("host name","username","password");
$db = mysql_select_db("database name",$con);
</code></pre>
