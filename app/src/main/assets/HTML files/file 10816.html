<p>Definitely defining new exception for all different cases. </p>

<p>Imagine you are implementing an interpreter/compiler. You gonna have modules as SemanticVerifier, Interpreter, CodeGenerator (and others of course). You want to know what kind of exception gonna be thrown when your program crash. Oh there it's Semantic! there look it's a bug in the Interpreter! And you want the user to know so he can report a more precise bug.</p>

<p>I personally think it leads to a better design if you have separate exceptions for every module.</p>
