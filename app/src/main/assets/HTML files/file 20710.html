<p>I'm not sure if I got it right. But why don't you just add another union like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE newtable AS (
SELECT @rownum:=@rownum+1 as rownum, name, age FROM (
    SELECT 1, "Jordan", 6
    UNION ALL
    SELECT name, age FROM clubAmembers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT name, age FROM clubBmembers
)
) AS atable
</code></pre>
