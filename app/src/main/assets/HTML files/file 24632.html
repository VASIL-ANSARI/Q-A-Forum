<p>mysql_query returns a resultset-identifier, you should not check it against NULL or false, but should count the numer via mysql_numrows.</p>

<p>Also you should use mysqli_functions since mysql_* is deprecated (at least folks here are repeating that over and over again). FALSE only comes in an error, not in an empty set.</p>
