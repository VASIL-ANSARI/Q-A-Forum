<p>Is it because you are doing <strong>return</strong> confirm? seems like the return statement should prevent the rest of the code from firing. i would think an if statement would work</p>

<pre><code>if (!confirm(...)) { return false; } _doPostBack(...);
</code></pre>

<p>Can you post all the js code in the OnClick of the link?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: aha, forgot that link button emits code like this </p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="javascript:__doPostBack()" onclick="return confirm()" /&gt;
</code></pre>
