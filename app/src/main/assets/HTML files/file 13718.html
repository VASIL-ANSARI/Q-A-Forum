<p>Since you're getting to a point of abstracting this schema to mimic actual datatypes, it might stand to reason that you should simply create new table sets per-survey instead. Benefit will be that the locking will lessen and you could isolate heavy loads to outside machines, if the load becomes unbearable.</p>

<p>The single-survey database structure then can more accurately reflect your real world conditions and data input handlers.  It ought to make your abstraction headaches go away.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with creating tables on the fly. In some configurations, soft sharding is preferable.</p>
