<p>What do you expect? Look at your code:</p>

<pre><code>int randimage=arc4random_uniform((int)self.myimage);
return [self.myimage objectAtIndexedSubscript:randimage];
</code></pre>

<p><code>arc4random_uniform</code> can return anything between 0 and its argument. The argument is <code>self.myimage</code> - an <em>object</em>. Its value is not an integer, but you are forcing it to be one. What you are getting is thus the memory location of this object, which could be any number at all. So you wind up with a huge number, way outside the actual number of elements in the array. You probably mean <code>self.myimage.count</code>, don't you?</p>
