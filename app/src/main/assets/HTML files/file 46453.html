<p>first_or_create works this way that it will first search the database for the attributes in where clause. if found it will not create new, if fails it will create new one. Now even for new user, the query does not know that the given uid and provider exists or not so it has to run the query first to make sure. see this <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/v3.2.1/ActiveRecord/Relation/first_or_create" rel="nofollow">http://apidock.com/rails/v3.2.1/ActiveRecord/Relation/first_or_create</a>. 'tries to load the record first if fails then create.' </p>
