<p>As noted by my earlier comment, I had the exact same problem earlier today.
What solved it for me was replacing: </p>

<pre><code>compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:9.0.0'
</code></pre>

<p>with </p>

<pre><code>compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:9.0.0'
</code></pre>

<p>This change was suggested from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37380974/app-stops-responding-after-resuming-from-background-sometimes-could-firebase-be">this Stack post</a></p>

<p>Note: If you're using more than just the <code>location</code> from the <code>play-services</code> library, make sure to include the other components like</p>

<pre><code>compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-games:9.0.0"
compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-plus:9.0.0"
compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:9.0.0"
</code></pre>
