<p>If you want to get user input with a popup, you may use <code>JOptionPane.showInputDialog</code>. It will essentially instantiate a <code>JDialog</code> with an input text field and OK/Cancel buttons.</p>

<p>If you don't like this "pre-made" library method, you have to roll your own <code>JDialog</code>: make it modular and generic, so that if in the future you need the same tool you won't have to make it from scratch or copy/paste.<br>
Please note that you can have a dialog <em>without the external frame</em> (if you are looking for something less intrusive than a window, like a tooltip). See <a href="http://www.stupidjavatricks.com/?p=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.stupidjavatricks.com/?p=4</a>.</p>

<p>I don't see other options.</p>
