<p>Other browsers can be more forgiving of errors in your files than IE. IE will encounter an error and simply stop processing. By default, it will not notify you. Here is your error:</p>

<p>Message: Expected ')'
Line: 41
Char: 243
Code: 0
URI: <a href="http://azzyh.dk/newgen/area/member/indextest.php" rel="nofollow">http://azzyh.dk/newgen/area/member/indextest.php</a></p>

<p>If you run Firebug, you will see Firefox report the same error as well.</p>
