<p>It is saying: Don't rely on the "self-documenting" feature of unsigned types to show that they are only supposed to be positive. Use signed types and check the values.</p>

<p>The following will terminate correctly when i "wraps" around because -1 is equal to INT_MAX in this case.</p>

<p><code> for (unsigned int i = 9; i != -1; i--) </code></p>
