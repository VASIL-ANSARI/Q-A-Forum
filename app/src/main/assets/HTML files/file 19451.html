<p>Since I do not know what <code>enum_with_shift</code> is I cannot answer your question directly. </p>

<p>But you are right. You cannot extend enums. The reason is that enum is just a regular class that extends <code>java.lang.Enum</code>. Since there is no multiple inheritance in java you cannot extend any other class.</p>

<p>I can suggest you either use regular classes or extend <code>java.lang.Enum</code> directly. 
Take a look on my article: <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/enum-tricks-dynamic-enums" rel="nofollow">http://java.dzone.com/articles/enum-tricks-dynamic-enums</a>
I gave an example how to do this. </p>
