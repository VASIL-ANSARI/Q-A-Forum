<p>You can iterate through the properties of metrics, using e.g. <code>for .. in</code>, and create a list of users. Then it can be sorted.</p>

<pre><code>var users = []
var metrics = json.users.metrics

for (var userId in metrics) {
    var user = metrics[userId];
    user["userId"] = userId;
    users.push(user);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the format you expect, however, you cannot do it, as object properties cannot be sorted (as far as I know).</p>
