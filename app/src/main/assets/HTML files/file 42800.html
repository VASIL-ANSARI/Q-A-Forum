<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_blocked.xml" rel="nofollow">Java related site</a> Starting with Java 7 Update 51, trying to run unsigned Java applications generates error messages and prevents executing the applet.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions about the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/security/rsa_signing.html" rel="nofollow">Oracle proper solution</a> (I my experience I had to get a valid certificate from a trusted root like <a href="http://www.verisign.com/static/030998.pdf" rel="nofollow">Verisign</a> and then used this certificate to sign my applet jar) but if you can't do this way, try the suggested workaround in the correspondent section.</p>

<p>Obviously, as stated by the Java site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is highly recommended not to run these types of applications. However if you still want to run these apps, run only if you understand the risks and implications.</p>
