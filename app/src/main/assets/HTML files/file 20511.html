<p>When you try to connect directly to mysql Database from command line does it work?</p>

<p>What OS is your VM running? If its a Unix then is there a mysqld process runnning?</p>

<p>In any case this may not have anything to do with Python. Your code snipppet looks ok. You just need to resolve the connectivity issue. Look at this page for details on how you could get to to the root of this problem.</p>

<p>I hope that this helps.</p>
