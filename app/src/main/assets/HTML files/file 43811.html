<p>The crucial step here is that the head is not <code>None</code>. Only the data of the head's <code>Link</code> node is <code>None</code>, and it points to itself via its <code>next</code> attribute. As mentioned in the answer you linked to, that would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.head = Link(None, None)
    self.head.next = self.head
</code></pre>
