<p>The way you solve this particular problem is to have a binding on <code>ButtonPress</code> and <code>ButtonRelease</code> that sets a flag. Then, in your binding for <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> (or any other event) you check for that flag.</p>

<p>However, while the button is pressed you won't get any <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> events. This is because the widget you clicked over grabs the pointer and owns it until you release the button. The only <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> events you'll get while the button is pressed are when you enter the widget you originally clicked on.</p>

<p>What you want to do instead is bind to <code>&lt;B1-Motion&gt;</code>. You can then use the x/y coordinates of the event and <code>winfo_containing</code> to determine what widget you are over.</p>

<p>That being said, trying to simulate selection over a row of labels is a lot of work for very little benefit. Why not just use a text widget that already has selection built in? You can tweak it so that it looks like a bunch of labels (ie: make the background the same color as a frame) and you can turn editing off. That might be an easier way to go.</p>
