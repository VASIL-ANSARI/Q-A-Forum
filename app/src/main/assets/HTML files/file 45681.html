<p>Kudos for trying to solve a simple problem yourself.  It's obvious that you are new to the idea of databases, and quite frankly, you're doing this the wrong way.</p>

<p>Let's talk about how your initial approach can be improved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each post would contain the user's name and phone number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps instead of posts, we have one database table to store employee information.</p>

<p>You'll find tons of information on databases and how to use them with your wordpress account with a simple google search.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to be able to not only pull these names from wordpress via a loop to display onto my page, but also to be able to add or remove the new entries, along with their phone number, to this php contact form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, if you had a database to store employee information, this is basic.</p>

<p>For example, an <code>employees</code> database table may have the following columns:</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>name</li>
<li>phone</li>
<li>created_at</li>
<li>updated_at</li>
</ul>

<p>Since <code>PHP</code> has built in functions for communicating with a <code>MYSQL</code> database (which is most likely what WordPress is already using), you can do things like:</p>

<p>Get all employee data</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM employees</code></p>

<p>Get a certain employee's data</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = '$name'</code> </p>

<p><code>$name</code> is a variable that can be set via <code>POST</code> request from a WordPress form</p>

<p>Update a certain employee's data</p>

<p><code>UPDATE employees SET phone = '+15555555555' WHERE name = '$name'</code></p>

<p>Remove a certain employee's data</p>

<p><code>DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 5</code></p>

<p>You are also able to do things like:</p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE created_at &gt; '3/1/2015'</code></p>

<p>Which will return all employees that were added after <code>3/1/15</code>.</p>
