<p>Dynamic SQL <strong>can be slower</strong> than a stored proc, but not always, and has gotten much better as SQL Server has matured.  Whenever possible, non-dynamic SQL should be used as it is cleaner and easier to maintain.  However, dynamic SQL does have its place (ORM tools like Entity Framework and NHibernate use dynamic sql almost exclusively).  Cursors should be avoided if at all possible, but SQL does support a WHILE loop that can be used instead.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @Identity int = SELECT MIN(ex.Identity) FROM Example ex
DECLARE @TableName varchar(200)
DECLARE @ColumnName varchar(200)
WHILE @Identity IS NOT NULL BEGIN
    SELECT
        @TableName = ex.TableName,
        @ColumnName = ex.ColumnName
    FROM
        Example ex
    WHERE
        ex.Identity = @Identity

    /*
        build and execute your dynamic sql here
    */
    SET @Identity int = SELECT MIN(ex.Identity) FROM Example ex WHERE ex.Identity &gt; @Identity
END
</code></pre>
