<p>There is no way to programatically execute copy and paste tasks from a web application, as this would pose an obvious security risk.  However, if you are looking to make it easier for users to copy data from the web application to their clipboard, you can use something like <a href="http://zeroclipboard.org/" rel="nofollow">ZeroClipboard</a>, which uses Flash to implement the copy functionality.</p>
