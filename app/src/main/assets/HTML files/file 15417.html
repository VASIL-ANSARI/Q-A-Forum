<p>Does the generated project has a reference to <code>monotouch.dll</code> ? If not then you'll need to add one manually.</p>

<p>I created a new <em>Universal</em>, <em>Single View Application</em> project using MonoDevelop 3.0 and it worked without issue (and the reference to <code>monotouch.dll</code> is present).</p>
