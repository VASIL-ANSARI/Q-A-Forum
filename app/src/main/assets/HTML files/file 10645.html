<p>You can't do this by default. However, you can implement your own checker which checks for these methods.</p>

<p>The first option is to use Miscellaneous->Regexp. This is obviously only possible if you can find violations with a regexp. You will need to set illegalPattern = true. This would be a good place to start, I think.</p>

<p>The second options is to create your own check. See <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/writingchecks.html" rel="nofollow">Writing Checks</a>.</p>

<p>There are limitations to writing checkers. The first and most important is that you can't see other files. There isn't any cross checking. From the site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>You cannot determine the type of an expression.</li>
  <li>You cannot see the content of other files. (although you can save processed files for use later)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>This means that you cannot implement some of the code inspection
  features that are available in advanced IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA. For
  example you will not be able to implement a Check that finds redundant
  type casts or unused public methods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you couldn't check for instance that the java is calling one method which has an alternative with a Locale. You could use a blacklist of methods which you're not allowed to call. So for instance calls to new FileWriter() would check the number of parameters passed, or such like.</p>
