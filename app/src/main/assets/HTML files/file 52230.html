<p>I was using gulp for a while, but switched to using webpack, and even though I was including react in webpack I was still loading the external files. This ended up being what was causing issues, because there were two versions of react loaded, so I just had to attach a handle to React to the window so I could access it from my other javascript file, and everything is working now.</p>
