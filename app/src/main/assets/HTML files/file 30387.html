<p>To get all the rows where the post has at least one address tag:</p>

<pre><code>select *
from t t1
where exists (select 1
              from t t2
              where t2.post_id = t1.post_id and t2.meta_tag = 'address'
             );
</code></pre>

<p>If you want <em>exactly</em> one, there are various approaches.  Following the same logic:</p>

<pre><code>select *
from t t1
where 1 = (select count(*)
           from t t2
           where t2.post_id = t.post_id and t2.meta_tag = 'address'
          );
</code></pre>

<p>If you really want only the *post_id*s that have one address tag:</p>

<pre><code>select post_id
from t t1
group by post_id
having sum(t1.meta_tag = 'address') = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>(Or make that <code>&gt; 0</code> if you are looking for any <code>address</code> tag.)</p>
