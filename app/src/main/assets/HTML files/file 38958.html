<p>I suspect the problem is due to how you are initializing the object graph in your implicit constructor for the <code>Main</code> class.</p>

<pre><code>private ObjList objList = null;
private ObjContainer dataSource = ObjContainer.createData();

private TabWindow tabWindow = new TabWindow(objList);
</code></pre>

<p>When you create <code>tabWindow</code> and pass <code>objList</code> to the constructor it copies the reference to <code>null</code>. When you subsequently initialize the <code>objList</code> later in code it only affects that field specifically, not the reference inside <code>tabWindow</code>, as they are completely separate at that point. You need to rearrange the initialization logic somewhat to ensure that <code>objList</code> references something real before you pass it to another object.</p>

<p>All of this relates to how references are passed in Java, see this question for more on the topic: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value">Is Java &quot;pass-by-reference&quot; or &quot;pass-by-value&quot;?</a></p>
