<p>I normally deal with issues like this through the <code>logging</code> module in the standard library, which is quite good, but I'll assume you have good reason for wanting this.</p>

<p>I would be surprised if the PyDev console supported full terminal emulation.  At least under Helios on Windows, I've had no problem with Unicode display, but terminal escapes are another matter.</p>

<p>If you know specifically which terminal you want to use, you can run <code>sleep 3600</code> in it and then do this in your test driver:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
def redirect_terminal(ttypath):
  term = open(ttypath, 'w+')
  sys.stdout = term
  sys.stderr = term
</code></pre>

<p>Trying this in the interactive interpreter, which will likely be a bit different from running it in PyDev, I get this in the initial terminal (note local echo and prompt still returned here):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; redirect_terminal('/dev/pts/0')
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()
&gt;&gt;&gt; raise TypeError
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and this in the <code>/dev/pts/0</code> terminal:</p>

<pre><code>['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', '__package__', 'redirect_terminal', 'sys']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError
</code></pre>

<p>While I did not try any terminal escapes here, they are just byte sequences that get printed like any other, so they should be printed on the remote terminal.</p>

<p>I cannot manage to collect input from a different terminal in the interactive interpreter.  When I try, input is still read from the initial terminal.</p>
