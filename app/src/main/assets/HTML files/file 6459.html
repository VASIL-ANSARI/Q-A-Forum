<p>You could try making a background that simulates a dotted line and then use that on your paragraphs. Just make sure its height has the same value as the paragraph's <code>line-height</code> attribute so it matches the rows properly.</p>

<p>For example, if you want your line to be a 3px dash with a 1px space, you would then make a 4px wide by X pixels high image (where X of course is the height of your text line), and just have it repeat.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
