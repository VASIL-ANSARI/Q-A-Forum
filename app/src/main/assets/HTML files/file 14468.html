<p>I believe Sergio is correct in his comment. If your JS comes before the page's markup, then the selector <code>$(#plusanswer')</code> runs before that element exists. You can verify this with the code</p>

<pre><code>console.log $('#pluganswer').length
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this, wrap your code in jQuery's document ready wrapper, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ -&gt;
  # the rest of your code goes here
</code></pre>

<p>This looks a bit magical, but here's how it works: When you pass a function to the jQuery object, <code>$</code>, it runs that function only after the <code>document</code>'s "ready" event fires. So, again assuming that your code precedes your markup, you should get this behavior:</p>

<pre><code>console.log $('#pluganswer').length    # 0
$ -&gt;
  console.log $('#pluganswer').length  # 1, because the page's markup is loaded
</code></pre>
