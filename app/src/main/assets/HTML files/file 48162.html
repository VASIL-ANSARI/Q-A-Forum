<p>You cannot instantiate an abstract class, in other words, if you have...</p>

<p><code>abstract class MyAbstractClass() { ... }</code></p>

<p>...you cannot do the following...</p>

<p><code>MyAbstractClass object = new MyAbstractClass();</code></p>

<p>While you can get the same result with a private constructor, with an abstract class you can still have other classes extending your abstract class which then CAN (potentially) be instantiated.</p>

<p>The typical use for something like this is to have an abstract base class. For example, imagine you might want to store Data about Cars and Motorcycles. Then you might have a common base class <code>Vehicle</code> for both your classes <code>Car</code>and <code>Motorcycle</code>. Even if <code>Vehicle</code> does not have any abstract methods, you might not want anyone to create a pure "Vehicle" object, but only <code>Car</code> and <code>Motorcycle</code> objects. Thus you make your Vehicle class abstract and get exactly that.</p>
