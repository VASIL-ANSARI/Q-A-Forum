<p>I suspect you might want this instead:</p>

<pre><code>select top 1 td.* from trans_det order by b.[1] union all
select top 1 td.* from trans_det order by b.[2] union all
select top 1 td.* from trans_det order by b.[5] union all
. . .
select top 1 td.* from trans_det order by b.tv
</code></pre>

<p>This will return the set of rows with a minimum for each value.</p>
