<p>Logically it doesn't need to since the first condition being false makes the entire statement false.  It's technically called a "short-circuit evaluation".  This is why you should't create <code>t2</code> and <code>t3</code> conditions that create side effects and assume they are happening every cycle of the loop.</p>
