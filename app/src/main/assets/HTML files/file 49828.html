<p>The problem is that you checked out a very old version of the client library. Go ahead and checkout the <code>v1-master</code> branch from github:</p>

<pre><code>git clone -b v1-master https://github.com/google/google-api-php-client.git
</code></pre>

<p>I would also suggest following the instructions in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/quickstart/service-php" rel="nofollow">Hello Analytics API php</a> to help get you started.</p>
