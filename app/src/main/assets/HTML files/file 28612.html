<p>If I'm reading your question correctly, you want to insert a record if the user record is not already present but, if it is, you don't really want to do anything. if this is case then you might find the <code>INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE...</code> form of <code>INSERT</code> useful.</p>

<p>This command will insert data a record if a <code>UNIQUE</code> or <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> is not already present but update when one is encountered. Have a look at <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/insert-on-duplicate.html" rel="nofollow" title="this link">this link</a> for the details.</p>

<p>I do have to agree that 500 items is a lot of data to retrieve when someone logs is. Alwya retrieve the minimal information you need to and ensure that the relevant fields are indexed for speed of search (e.g., login, email addresses etc)</p>
