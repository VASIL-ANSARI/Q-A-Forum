<p>By default, phpMyAdmin does not perform any kind of sort, and just shows the rows as they are stored in the database. Sometimes rows get inserted "out of order", but you can fix this:</p>

<ul>
<li>navigate to the table in question</li>
<li>click 'operations'</li>
<li>at the top left, under "Alter table order by", select your key and your order, and click 'go'</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an ongoing maintenance thing that you will need to do from time to time, but it should solve your issue for the most part.</p>
