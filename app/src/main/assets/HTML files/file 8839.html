<p>All bytes in <code>buffer</code> that have not been filled in by the <code>Read</code> call will be zero; this is standard C#.</p>

<p>If every last one byte in there is zero, only two things can be responsible:</p>

<ul>
<li>You read real null bytes from the stream (unlikely)</li>
<li><code>Read</code> does not read anything (in which case it returns <code>0</code> -- you should <strong>definitely</strong> be checking the return value)</li>
</ul>
