<p>According to Wikipedia </p>

<p>Deleting a node with two children: Call the node to be deleted N. Do not delete N. Instead, choose either its in-order successor node or its in-order predecessor node, R. Copy the value of R to N, then recursively call delete on R until reaching one of the first two cases.

<p>You can try by successor node as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>get successor of node to delete (current)</li>
<li>connect parent of current to successor</li>
<li>connect successor to the left child for current</li>
</ol>
