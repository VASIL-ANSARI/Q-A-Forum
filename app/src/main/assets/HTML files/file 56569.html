<p>Pyparsing let's you build up a parser by stitching together smaller parsers using '+' and '|' operators (among others). You can also attach names to the individual elements in the parser, to make it easier to get at the values afterward.</p>

<pre><code>from pyparsing import (pyparsing_common, CaselessKeyword, Optional, ungroup, restOfLine, 
    oneOf, SkipTo)

int_qty = pyparsing_common.integer

# compose an expression for the quantity, in its various forms
"""
{n}
{n}PCS
{n}PC
{n}PCS.
{n}PC.
Lot of {n}
"""
LOT = CaselessKeyword("lot")
OF = CaselessKeyword("of")
pieces = oneOf("PC PCS PC. PCS.", caseless=True)
qty_expr = Optional(LOT + OF).suppress() + int_qty("qty") + Optional(pieces).suppress()

# compose expression for entire line
line_expr = SkipTo(qty_expr)("text1") + qty_expr + restOfLine("text2")

tests = """
    Send me 1000 widgets pronto!
    Deliver a Lot of 50 barrels of maple syrup by Monday, June 10.
    My shipment was short by 25 pcs.
    """

line_expr.runTests(tests)
</code></pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre><code>Send me 1000 widgets pronto!
['Send me', 1000, ' widgets pronto!']
- qty: 1000
- text1: ['Send me']
- text2:  widgets pronto!


Deliver a Lot of 50 barrels of maple syrup by Monday, June 10.
['Deliver a ', 50, ' barrels of maple syrup by Monday, June 10.']
- qty: 50
- text1: ['Deliver a ']
- text2:  barrels of maple syrup by Monday, June 10.


My shipment was short by 25 pcs.
['My shipment was short by', 25, '']
- qty: 25
- text1: ['My shipment was short by']
- text2: 
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:
Pyparsing supports two forms of alternatives for matching: MatchFirst, which stops on the first matched alternative (which is defined using the '|' operator), and Or, which evaluates all alternatives and selects the longest match (defined using '^' operator). So if you need a priority of the quantity expression, then you define it explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>qty_pcs_expr = int_qty("qty") + White().suppress() + pieces.suppress()
qty_expr = Optional(LOT + OF).suppress() + int_qty("qty") + FollowedBy(White())

# compose expression for entire line
line_expr = (SkipTo(qty_pcs_expr)("text1") + qty_pcs_expr + restOfLine("text2") |
             SkipTo(qty_expr)("text1") + qty_expr + restOfLine("text2"))
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the new tests:</p>

<pre><code>tests = """
    Send me 1000 widgets pronto!
    Deliver a Lot of 50 barrels of maple syrup by Monday, June 10.
    My shipment was short by 25 pcs.
    2. I expect 22 pcs delivered in the morning
    On May 15 please deliver 1000 PCS.
    """
</code></pre>

<p>Giving:</p>

<pre><code>2. I expect 22 pcs delivered in the morning
['2. I expect ', 22, ' delivered in the morning']
- qty: 22
- text1: ['2. I expect ']
- text2:  delivered in the morning


On May 15 please deliver 1000 PCS.
['On May 15 please deliver ', 1000, '']
- qty: 1000
- text1: ['On May 15 please deliver ']
- text2:
