<p>From partial read of your code - you are missing a copy constructor in <code>WrapperMultiContainer</code></p>

<p>See, if you don't write the copy constructor, the default will be used. This copies the pointer. And since now two classes will have the same pointer and both will delete it on destructor - you get segmentation fault.</p>

<p>But again, only read half the code.</p>

<p>Edit: also do an <code>operator=</code> for the same reasons.</p>
