<p>Found it! The root cause was indeed my options but not in the way I thought. I was missing the $ArrowNavigatorOptions. The mystery DIV is still being inserted but everything now works correctly. </p>

<p>The take-away lesson for me is that jssor seems to fail quietly in the sense that rather than generate a console message about the missing option it simply did nothing.  </p>
