<p>Let's have a look at what will happen if we define <code>XList</code> this way:</p>

<pre><code>class XList : public QList&lt;X&gt; {};
</code></pre>

<p>The following will work as expected:</p>

<pre><code>  XList* x = new XList;
  delete x;
</code></pre>

<p>However the following won't:</p>

<pre><code>  QList&lt;X&gt;* q = new XList;
  delete q;
</code></pre>

<p><code>QList&lt;X&gt;</code>'s destructor will be called but not <code>XList</code>'s, if any. That's what a virtual destructor in the base class will do for you.</p>

<p>If you never use heap allocations you should be fine, but you're preparing a trap for the maintainer following you (or even yourself in a few months).</p>

<p>Make sure this assumption is documented and make <code>XList</code>'s <code>new</code> operator private to prevent heap instantiation as you mentioned.</p>

<p>The safe alternative would be making <code>QList&lt;X&gt;</code> a member of your <code>XList</code>, that is: prefer encapsulation to inheritance.</p>
