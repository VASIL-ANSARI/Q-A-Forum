<p>Not my area, but I think FIPS 186 uses 160 <strong>bit</strong> key and salt (or seed).  That's only 20 bytes. </p>

<p>In any case, the <code>System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator</code> will happily fill a byte array of any length for you. And it's considered safe for Cryptographic work. </p>
