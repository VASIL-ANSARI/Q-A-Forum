<p>maybe its only reachable form a range dns server in your network , check with nmap:</p>

<p>nmap -A stockholm.serverdhse2.se -p 9000</p>

<p>wich give me a :</p>

<p>Failed to resolve given hostname/IP: stockholm.serverdhse2.se.</p>

<p>to make sure its a dns issue, try with the ip.
 If connects successfully with the ip you got it: "dns problem"</p>
