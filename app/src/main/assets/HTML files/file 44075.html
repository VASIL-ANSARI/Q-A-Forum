<p>The select is reset and the error disappears because the form is still posted. The value that you return from the function doesn't stop the submission.</p>

<p>You should use the <code>onsubmit</code> event on the form instead of <code>onclick</code> on the button. Use <code>return</code> in the event code to convey the value from the function back to the event:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method="get" action="Chairman.php" onsubmit="return checkDropdown()"&gt;
</code></pre>
