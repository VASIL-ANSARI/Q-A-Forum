<p>Without any feedback on the error you are getting, I can guess that one of the problems is with the file name. You should specify the absolute path to your log4j2.properties file when you are setting the system property:</p>

<pre><code>System.setProperty("log4j.configurationFile","/absolute/path/to/log4j2.properties");
</code></pre>

<p>In this way the logger system will know exactly where to find your file.</p>
