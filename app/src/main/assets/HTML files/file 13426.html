<p>You can avoid the whole Google Maps and API Key mess if you don't mind the user leaving your application and just run the app directly.  They can still hit the back key and end up in your application again.  The code to do this is:</p>

<pre><code>Linkify.AddLinks(lblAddress, MatchOptions.MapAddresses); 
</code></pre>

<p>However, this only works on a TextView.  If you want to do it on a button click, you'd have to do a bit more investigating.</p>
