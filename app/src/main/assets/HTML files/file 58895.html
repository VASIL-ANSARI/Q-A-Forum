<p>It seems the test/unit libraries are being loaded instead of the RSpec libraries. Review the contents of spec/spec_helper.rb and spec/rails_helper.rb, and the 'require' statements in the spec files to ensure that they match the instructions in the Hartl tutorial. Also, make sure you are using the current tutorial, and the recommended Ruby and Rails versions.</p>
