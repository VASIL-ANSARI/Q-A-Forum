<p>When you execute the <code>commit</code> statement, all the cached data from SGA (commited and uncommited) goes to the online redo log files of your database. This work is done by LGWR (Log writer process). So all the data (even undo data) is protected by the online redo log files. The DBWR (DataBase WRiter) process uses lazy algorithm to store your data to the data files. It writes data into the data files every 3 sec (by default, you can customize this value) or if your buffer is filled up to 80% or if a checkpoint occurs.</p>

<p>So if you loose electricity, next time during the database starting your data from online redo will be roll-forwarded from the online redo log files and then roll-backed all the uncommitted transactions (your undo data is also protected by online redo log files).</p>

<p>About your example, if you don't commit your transaction, you will not find the updated data after the database recovering. If your <code>A</code> value has been changed by a different DML, this data also will be stored in online redo log files, so at first your update will be roll-forwarded then the DML that changed the <code>A</code> value will be roll-forwarded.</p>
