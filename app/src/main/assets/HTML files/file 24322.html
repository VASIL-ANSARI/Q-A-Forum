<p>Replace your  tags with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" ...
</code></pre>

<p>using a application/javascript mime type isn't the standard approach.  </p>

<p>Check your code for syntax errors (run it in Safari, or Chrome etc with the console open to see them).  I find that when things don't work in PhoneGap it's usually because a JS error has crept in somewhere.</p>

<p>Remove all the scripts except the thing you're trying to test (lines to set the deviceready event, and the function it runs), then introduce each block of code and script one-by-one to see when it stops.  That way you can isolate the block of code that is causing the problem.</p>
