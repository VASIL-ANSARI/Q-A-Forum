<p>Use a <code>Map&lt;Integer,Integer&gt;</code>. The key would be your index and the value the value of the list.</p>

<p>For your subList requirement, perhaps <code>TreeMap&lt;Integer,Integer&gt;</code> would work, as it keeps the keys sorted and makes it easy to iterate over a sub-list.</p>

<p>Of course this means you can't use the <code>List</code> interface. If you must use the <code>List</code> interface, you can make your own <code>List</code> implementation backed by a <code>TreeMap</code> (for example, <code>list.add(5,3)</code> would call <code>map.put(5,3)</code>).</p>
