<p>You will have to use Count(). You can run two queries like</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(ID) FROM Table WHERE Name='Paul' 
</code></pre>

<p>one you have get the count, then run the query with select clause</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID FROM Table WHERE Name='Paul' LIMIT 1
</code></pre>

<p><code>Count()</code> function is not inefficient at all if you are using it like <code>COUNT(ID)</code>, because most probably <code>id</code> is primary key and have an index. MYSQL wont even have to access the table.</p>
