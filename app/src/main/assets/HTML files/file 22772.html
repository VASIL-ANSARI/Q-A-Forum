<p>Session stores item as objects. As long as your class inherits from Object (which it does) you can store it there. Quick caveat, it stores that object using Serialization, so your class must be serializable.</p>

<p>Add a property to your class like so:</p>

<pre><code>public cStudent CurrentStudent
{
    get {
        if(Session["CurrentUser"] == null)
            return null;

        return (cStudent)Session["CurrentUser"];
    }
    set {
        Session["CurrentUser"] = value;
    }
}
</code></pre>
