<p>This is almost a duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2910426/heterogeneous-queries-require-the-ansi-nulls">this question</a>. Note that the error message returned in that case was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heterogeneous queries require the ANSI_NULLS and ANSI_WARNINGS options
  to be set for the connection. This ensures consistent query semantics.
  Enable these options and then reissue your query</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188048.aspx" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> does in fact say that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SET ANSI_NULLS should be set to ON for executing distributed queries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190368.aspx" rel="nofollow">same comment</a> for SET ANSI_WARNINGS. I suspect that as Ãlvaro suggested, your PHP code is hiding an error and there's a very good chance that it's the one mentioned above. <a href="http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/6387/what-is-a-heterogeneous-query">This question</a> on the DBA site goes into much more detail.</p>
