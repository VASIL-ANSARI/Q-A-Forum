<p>You are trying to get read file from other server.</p>

<p>Whatever file you want to read, you must have to give full server path as the the file,</p>

<p>for example see below lines.
My following line is not working proper if i haven't give a proper path.
<code>$a = file_get_contents('google.com');</code> - Not working proper
<code>$a = file_get_contents('google.com');</code> - Not working proper.</p>

<p>Instead write following lines to get proper results,</p>

<p><code>$a = file_get_contents('http://www.google.com');</code> - It works good. So try this way.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
