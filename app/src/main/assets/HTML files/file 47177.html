<p>Because the executable file is in your personal Documents folder, the local service account doesn't have access to it.</p>

<p>The easiest resolution would be to change the permissions on the Debug folder to give SERVICE read and execute access, with inheritance enabled.  From the command line:</p>

<pre><code>icacls Debug /grant SERVICE:(OI)(CI)(RX)
</code></pre>

<p>(Because Windows does not do traverse checking in the default configuration, you do not need to change the permissions for the parent folders.)</p>

<p>Another option is to copy the executable file to a public location (such as inside Program Files) and install it there, but you then have to remember to manually update the copy each time you recompile.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> yet another option, as you suggest, is to change the account to local system so that the service is running with administrative privileges.  Best practice is to run services with the least privilege necessary, but at this stage it doesn't matter much.</p>
