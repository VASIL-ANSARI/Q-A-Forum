<p>Something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek" rel="nofollow"><code>seek()</code></a> to get something like the last 4096 bytes of a file.</li>
<li>See how many newlines you have in those bytes. If you have <code>n</code> or more, then you're done. If you have fewer, then read the previous 4096 bytes until you're done.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure if there's a built-in way to do this.</p>
