<p>You can declare a BOOL variable in shouldAutoRotate method and that is set when it is called and then in the selector method for showing and hiding the subview you can use a simple if condition that weather view is rotated or not.</p>

<p>like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(viewRotated)
{
    subView.hidden = YES;
}
viewRotated = NO;
</code></pre>

<p>Edit Part:<br>
I am not sure whats going on in this code but its working perfectly in one of my apps who's ipad coding was done by my friend. </p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)interfaceOrientation
{
    if(UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait(interfaceOrientation))
    {
        [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                                 selector:@selector(keyboardWillShow:) 
                                                     name:UIKeyboardWillShowNotification
                                                   object:nil];
        [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self 
                                                 selector:@selector(keyboardWillHide:)
                                                     name:UIKeyboardWillShowNotification
                                                   object:nil];
    }
    else
    {

        [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self 
                                                        name:UIKeyboardWillShowNotification 
                                                      object:nil];
        [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self 
                                                        name:UIKeyboardWillShowNotification 
                                                      object:nil];
    }
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you can add the notification again if your UIKeyboardWillHideNotification is not fired by add those notification again in this method.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)didRotateFromInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)fromInterfaceOrientation
</code></pre>
