<p>Not familiar with easycgi but often times getting SQL Server can be a lot of work. If you can create a database at easycgi the best thing to do is script out your database in SQL server 2008 using this process <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/eric_johnson/archive/2010/03/08/script-data-in-sql-server-2008.aspx" rel="nofollow">SQL Server 2008 script data</a></p>

<p>You'll then have everything for your database in a file.  It's scripted and then run that at easy cgi if they have a way to run scripts. Otherwise sometimes you can connect your SQL SErver management studio directly to your database there.</p>

<p>You'll get a temp URL probably at easycgi, make sure that is in PortalAlias table in your SQL Server database.  </p>

<p>Update your web.config in two spots to connect to your new database, upload your files to the web server.</p>

<p>Again, never used easycgi, but hope this helps.</p>
