<p>The problem is that you're trying to find the views with <code>findViewById</code> before the Activity's layout has been inflated. Read more about an Activity's lifecycle in the Android developer docs about <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activities</a>.</p>

<p>Do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity{

    private EditText title;
    private EditText body;
    private View layout;

    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.main);

        title = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.txtTitle);
        body = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.txtBody);
        // also , the line below is incorrect, the findViewById method requires
        // that you use an id(R.id.somthing) and not a layout resource like you do
        layout = (View) findViewById(R.layout.main);

        // Rest of your code.
</code></pre>
