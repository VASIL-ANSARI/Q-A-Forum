<p>As far as I understand you have Excel file and you want to convert it 
to Microsoft Project file using C#. </p>

<p>I did not find any built in functionality , so I think you have following options</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy third party component</li>
<li>Create functionality that will do conversion based on office automation</li>
</ol>
