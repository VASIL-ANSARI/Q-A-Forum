<p>You could set : pointer-events: none; to the child elements and that could work, but this does not work in IE10 or below. But you could use this polyfill.

<p>Just an option, which might solve your issue. If your inner elements have background transparent, then in IE it will automatically fall through without the polyfill.</p>
