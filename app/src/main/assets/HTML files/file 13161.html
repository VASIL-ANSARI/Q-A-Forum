<p>You can handle the link clicks with Javascript. Once you get a click, you would only change the main content (whatever the main <code>div</code> or block is) and keep the sidebar intact. So, it's kind of like "pseudo-links." I don't think you actually go to another page, but the content of the current page is changed.</p>
