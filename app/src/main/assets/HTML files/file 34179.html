<p>You can still count and group dates, as long as you have a way to determine the part of the date you are looking for.</p>

<p>In Access you can use <code>year</code> and <code>month</code> for example to get the year and month part of the date:</p>

<pre><code>select year(mydate)
,      month(mydate)
,      count(*)
from   tableX
group
by     year(mydate)
,      month(mydate)
</code></pre>
