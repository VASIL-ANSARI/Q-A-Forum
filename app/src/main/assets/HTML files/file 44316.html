<p>Just what it says. <code>ReaderListener</code> requires you to have an <code>onLoadFinish()</code> with the signature <code>public void onLoadFinish(DocumentState.OPEN state)</code>, apparently.</p>

<p>With regards to your overall problem, pass the <code>SharedPreferences</code> into the constructor of <code>SimpleDocumentReader</code>, which holds onto it in a data member and uses it in <code>onLoadFinish()</code>. </p>
