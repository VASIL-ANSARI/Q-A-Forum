<p>This is an example of a "set-within-sets" query.  I like to solve these using <code>group by</code> and <code>having</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select bookmark_id
from bookmarktag bmt
group by bookmark_id
having sum(tag_id = 2) &gt; 0 and
       sum(tag_id = 3) &gt; 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Each condition in the <code>having</code> clause is looking for one of the tags that you specify. Each requires that the tag appear at least one time.</p>
