<p>I am guessing this is the minimal version of your issue -</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def blah():
...     return 1
... blah()
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 3
    blah()
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt; blah()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'blah' is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>In the python shell/IDLE , you need to enter a newline (empty line) after a block has ended, so that python can interpret the block (this is valid for any blocks, like function definition, loops, <code>with</code> block, etc etc).</p>

<p>In the above, when I copied and pasted the code- </p>

<pre><code>def blah():
    return 1
blah()
</code></pre>

<p>Without spaces, it would give the syntax errors , as there is not newline after the definition of function. One way (as you already observed) is to copy paste the function and function call separately (and make sure function gets defined by pressing enter/adding a newline at end) . (I am not sure if this is some kind of bug in the python shell, but it has been like that for both Python 2.x as well as Python 3.x ) .</p>

<p>Please note this is only when copy pasting code to the shell, not when saving your script as a .py file and running it , when running the code as a script, then newlines are not needed (though it would be better to put them for readability) .</p>
