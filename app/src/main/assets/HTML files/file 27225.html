<p>I don't think that the relations are complex: an author can create a book and a book can contain entries. Your schema allows the possibility that anybody can create an entry in a book that they didn't create - if you don't want this, then remove the 'author_id' field from the 'entries' table.</p>

<p>But what is your real question?</p>
