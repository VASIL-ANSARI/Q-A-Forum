<p>This is absolutely possible. You have to do all permutations possible for e-g there are two operands a,b and only one operator <code>-</code>. In this case possible permutations are <code>a-b</code> and <code>b-a</code>. If all permutations are done and you can't get the number, there must be a result like <code>number can't be arrived</code> (one of the possible output) from this function.  </p>
