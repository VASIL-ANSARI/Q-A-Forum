<p>You know, your question is really open-ended. There are loads of different ways to do it. </p>

<p>I would probably subclass <code>TemplateView</code>, overwriting the <code>dispatch</code> method to set a different template based on the scenario. </p>

<p>To figure out how your logic fits in with the various CBVs, I recommend the <a href="https://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/1.8/django.views.generic.base/TemplateView/" rel="nofollow">Classy Class-Based-Views</a> resource, so you can see which methods are called where.</p>
