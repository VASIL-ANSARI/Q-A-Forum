<p>If I understand correctly you are having new_issue as a child entity of some other entity with field to store aggregated cost from new_issue.
In this case you should have PostOperation plug in (Create/Update/StateChange) on new_issue and your fetch xml should be aggregate fetch xml which will search for all the new_issue where lookup field id equal to parent entity ID and then aggregate the cost. In case of Delete you have to handle it in slightly different way.
