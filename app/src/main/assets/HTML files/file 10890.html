<p>It looks like you're running PHP in safe mode or with certain functions disabled. For security reasons web hosts often disable file commands.</p>

<p>You could discuss your requirements with your web host - some are flexible enough to enable the functions for you if you ask nicely.</p>

<p>Otherwise you'll have to achieve it without using the disabled file commands. One way would be to create a <code>textarea</code> in an HTML form in which you paste the CSV. SUbmit it to your PHP script which then runs the MySQL import.</p>

<p>Hope that helps</p>
