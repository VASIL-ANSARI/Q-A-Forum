<p>You've <code>synchronized</code> an instance method. It will synchronize on the instance itself. However each of your <code>Thread</code>s is using a different instance, ie. they are each <code>synchronized</code> on a different object and therefore not blocking each other.</p>

<p>You need to share your <code>Test</code> instance</p>

<pre><code>Test a = new Test("A");
Thread t1 = new Thread(a);
Thread t2 = new Thread(a);
</code></pre>

<p>or use <code>synchronized</code> on a different shared object. You can do this either by passing a lock object as a constructor argument or using a static field reference.</p>
