<p>Using all these nested child contexts is almost certainly the wrong approach. For the most part you only want the one main context while on the main thread, however if you have a whole bunch of changes that only make sense when done and saved together then you can use a temporary child context for that. When you save the child context then immediately save the main context too to get it onto disk. Think of it like a database transaction.</p>

<p>If you have changes coming in from a background process you can either create a private child context, or a completely seperate private context straight off the persistent store coordinator - you will have to manually merge changes into the main context in the second case though. Use <code>managedObjectContextDidSaveNotification:</code> for that.</p>
