<p>Akka.NET is probably a bit more heavy weight than it needs to be at the current stage.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Each element in an <code>ActorPath</code> currently have a complete copy of its prefix elements. so there  is atleast some redundant bytes as strings and lists going on right there.
(we have a task to refactor this)</p></li>
<li><p><code>ActorCell</code> and it's related classes all use concurrent dictionaries to store child actorrefs, which will be inefficient memmory wise, we are working on porting the scala childcontainer trait.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So expect memory consumption to go down as we get closer to an 1.0 release.</p>

<p>What profiler did you use? e.g. if you are using windows task manager you are guaranteed to see incorrect numbers du to .NET's aggressive pre allocation for memory.</p>

<p>Also, have a look at the new <code>ReceiveActor</code> <a href="http://akkadotnet.github.io/wiki/ReceiveActor">http://akkadotnet.github.io/wiki/ReceiveActor</a>
This doesn't use the <code>message.Match().With(...)</code> notation, and thus, will be lighter on the GC due to not allocating any pattern matching objects for each received message.</p>
