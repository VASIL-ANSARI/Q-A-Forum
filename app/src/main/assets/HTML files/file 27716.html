<p>I have managed to implement what I need to get this working. I have gone with the purely Grails approach and so have my own implementation of userDetails, an instance of which is returned by my custom userDetailsService. 
One thing to look out for, if getting  a proof of concept working, is to make sure that you are reading back your password in the format you are storing it in. Spring Sec will hash your password to compare against what is in your database and so you will not successfully load a user if your storing your password as plain text. One way around this is to use the following config in resources.groovy.</p>

<pre><code>passwordEncoder(PlaintextPasswordEncoder)
</code></pre>

<p>But of course I would not advocate this as being the long term solution from a security point of view.</p>
