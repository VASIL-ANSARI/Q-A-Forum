<p>Based on your comment, it sounds like you're spawned a bunch of threads to work with a RateGate object that gets disposed before those threads are done using it.  i.e. the threads are still running after your code exits from the using block.
UPDATE: if you do what you described in your comment; but don't use a using block you don't get the problem.  the exception I witnessed was actually an ObjectDisposedException; which would make sense if the RateGate was disposed before code was done using it...</p>
