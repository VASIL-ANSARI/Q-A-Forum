<p>You could create a <code>user</code> dict which has like <code>items_in_hand</code> which would be <code>0</code>.
whenever you try to pick up an item,check if <code>items_in_hand</code> is less than 3 then increment it. </p>

<p>For better code quality you can add the <code>index</code> variable also in that <code>user</code> dict.</p>

<p>so you code would be like</p>

<pre><code>user = {'index':1 , 'items_in_hand' : 0}
if a =='grab':
    if  user['items_in_hand'] &lt; 3:
        print("You grabbed the item")
        user['items_in_hand']+=1
    else :
        print("you dont have space")
</code></pre>

<p>i havent added any error checking code. </p>

<p>NOTE: the best approach would be to use <code>objects</code> but one step at a time.</p>
