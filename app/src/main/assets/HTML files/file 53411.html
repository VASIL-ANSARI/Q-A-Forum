<p>See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/">PEP 498 <em>Literal String Interpolation</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The expressions that are extracted from the string are evaluated in the context where the f-string appeared. This means the expression has full access to local and global variables. Any valid Python expression can be used, including function and method calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the expressions are evaluated as if they appear in the same scope; locals, closures, and globals all work the same as in other code in the same context.</p>

<p>You'll find more details in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings">reference documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Expressions in formatted string literals are treated like regular Python expressions surrounded by parentheses, with a few exceptions. An empty expression is not allowed, and a <code>lambda</code> expression must be surrounded by explicit parentheses. Replacement expressions can contain line breaks (e.g. in triple-quoted strings), but they cannot contain comments. Each expression is evaluated in the context where the formatted string literal appears, in order from left to right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you are trying out a 3.6 alpha build, please do read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html"><em>What's New In Python 3.6</em> documentation</a>. It summarises all changes, including links to the relevant documentation and PEPs.</p>

<p>And just to be clear: 3.6 isn't released <em>yet</em>; the first alpha is not expected to be released until May 2016. See the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/">3.6 release schedule</a>.</p>
