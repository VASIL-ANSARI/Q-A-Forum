<p>Declare three variables and read them from the file with a chained extraction</p>

<pre><code>ifstream inFile("biodata.dat");

std::string date; // since your values are so large
char mf;
double d;

while (inFile &gt;&gt; date &gt;&gt; mf &gt;&gt; d) {
    // use the vars here
}
</code></pre>

<p>You will have to use something large enough to store the numbers.  You can use a <code>long long</code> if that's big enough but it may not be large enough.  You could check for this with a <code>static_assert(std::numeric_limits&lt;long long&gt;::max() &lt;= SOME_MAX_EXPECTED_VALUE, "long longs are too small");</code></p>
