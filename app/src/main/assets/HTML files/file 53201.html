<p>You should use something which is called port forwarding.  Some details are here (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding" rel="nofollow">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding</a>) 
For example, say you wanted to connect from your laptop to <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntuforums.org</a> using an SSH tunnel. You would use source port number 8080 (the alternate http port), destination port 80 (the http port), and destination server www.ubuntuforums.org. :</p>

<pre><code>ssh -L 8080:www.ubuntuforums.org:80 &lt;host&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>&lt;host&gt;</code> should be replaced by the name of your laptop. </p>

<p>This is done for whole computer so you dont need to do this from r studio. </p>

<p>Offcourse you need to forward your port to 3036. But you need special privilige on the server.  Because on most hosting you can only connect from localhost (for example from php) </p>
