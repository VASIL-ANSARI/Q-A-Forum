<p>What you could be doing is using the print media type in your stylesheet. It would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>@media print {
    p {
        font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        font-size: 18px;
        color: red;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe you already use this media type and put it in your mobile styling? Might want to put it above any responsive input and see how that works out?</p>
