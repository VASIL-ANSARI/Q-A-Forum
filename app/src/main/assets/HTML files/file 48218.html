<p>Based on the link @putvande supplied, I was able to create the following in my class. I added a canvas to the constructor to make it work. Sorry for the long code block though.</p>

<pre><code>class Camera {
  constructor(video, canvas, height=320, width=320) {
    this.isStreaming = false;  // maintain the state of streaming
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;

    // need a canvas and a video in order to make this work.
    this.canvas = canvas || $(document.createElement('canvas'));
    this.video = video || $(document.createElement('video'));
  }

  // streamTo and getStream are more or less the same.

  // returns a new image element with a still shot of the video as streaming.
  takePicture() {
    let image = new Image();
    let canv = this.canvas.get(0)
    var context = canv.getContext('2d');
    context.drawImage(this.video.get(0), 0, 0, this.width, this.height);
    var data = canv.toDataUrl('image/png');
    image.src = data;
    return image;
  }
}
</code></pre>
