  <p>I understand that basically I can call fastcgi_finish_request(); and then continue executing php script.</p>

<p>Yes, that's all you have to do.</p>

<pre><code>$obj = new controller();
echo $o-&gt;getResult();
fastcgi_finish_request();
do_facebook_thing();
</code></pre>

<p>To convince yourself it is working, do this:</p>

<pre><code>echo "Test";
fastcgi_finish_request();
sleep(10);
</code></pre>

<p>If you remove the second line, then you will see that the browser has to wait 10 seconds.</p>
