<p>Per my experience, assumption that you created the webapp for using Flask via creating a Flask template from gallery on Azure old portal or from marketpacke on Azure new portal, so that the template project for Flask called <code>FlaskWebProject</code> would be created by following the webapp. You can see the template project at the path <code>\site\wwwroot</code> of the Kudu console <code>http://&lt;your-webapp-name&gt;.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore, you need to cover the project with your project called the same name via Git. Your project directory must be in the root path of Git repository.</p>

<pre><code>The root path of Git repo
|- FlaskWebProject
   |- ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then, it will cover the old project when you pull the git repo via continuous deployment on Azure.</p>

<p>If using Visual Studio as your default IDE, you can refer to the doc <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-python-create-deploy-flask-app/" rel="nofollow">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-python-create-deploy-flask-app/</a>.</p>
