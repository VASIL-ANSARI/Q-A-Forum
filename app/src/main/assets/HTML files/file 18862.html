<p>If you see <code>&lt;?php echo $the_user-&gt;id; ?&gt;</code> in the output, it means that your document is not parsed by PHP.</p>

<p>Check the file extension, check that it is indeed send to PHP in your webserver configuration.</p>

<p>For example if you add PHP tags in a .js file, it won't be passed to PHP, if you are using Apache, you would have to add:</p>

<pre><code>AddType application/x-httpd-php .js
</code></pre>

<p>or set your variables in the HTML and send it as a parameter to the external Javascript.</p>
