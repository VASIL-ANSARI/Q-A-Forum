<p>If you just want to record how long it takes to get the basic page source, you can wrap a <code>HttpWebRequest</code> around a <code>stopwatch</code>. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>    HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(address);

    System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch timer = new Stopwatch();
    timer.Start();

    HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();

    timer.Stop();

    TimeSpan timeTaken = timer.Elapsed;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this will not take into account time to download extra content, such as images. you will have to dig deeper to do that and the question had no code so i can not guide you anymore down that path. But this example will work well if you just want the source with minimalistic code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you can also log all this information if you turn on trace</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have control over the ASP.NET page, you could turn on Trace. There you will get a bunch of information about the Page lifecycle( including time stamps), and other useful profiling information.</p>

<p>Turn on trace for a page in the Page directive at the top of your aspx file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Trace="true" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or dynamically in code:</p>

<pre><code>Trace.IsEnabled = true;
</code></pre>

<p>Or globally in the app setting this in web.config:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
 &lt;system.web&gt;
  &lt;trace enabled="true" requestLimit="40" localOnly="false"/&gt;
 &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you then can use a tool like <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd919274" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's LogParser</a> or any other to read the xml trace file. You could also use <a href="http://trace%20listeners" rel="nofollow">trace listeners</a> within your code. Just another thought :)</p>
