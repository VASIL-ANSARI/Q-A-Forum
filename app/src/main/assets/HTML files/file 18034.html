<p>Well, because you havenât acquired an access token before calling the method â¦?</p>

<p><code>FB.getLoginStatus</code> provides you with a fresh user access token, provided the user has authorized your app before.</p>

<p>But if you skip this step of interaction with Facebook â where do you expect a valid access token to come from?</p>

<p>Right, there is none â and therefore you are getting the error message, stating <em>exactly that</em> â¦</p>
