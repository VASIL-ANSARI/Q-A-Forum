<p>Table view cells are <em>reused</em> when you scroll, i.e. <code>dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier</code>
can return a cell that was previously used to display a different row.</p>

<p>Therefore you have to set the contents
explicitly, even in the else-case:</p>

<pre><code>} else {
    //nothing should appear in these cells
    cell.textLabel.text = @"";
}
</code></pre>
