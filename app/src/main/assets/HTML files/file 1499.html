<pre><code>for (lineno, line) in enumerate(stream):
    if '/' in line:
        # some matching etc which results in getting the
        # machine name, an interface and the data for that interface
        key=str(hostname)+":"+r.groups()[0][0:2]+r.groups()[2]
        dict[key + ":" + lineno]=str(line[3])
</code></pre>

<p>You won't end up with it smoothly increasing this way, but each dictionary key will be unique, and the numbers associated with each hostname+interface pair will be increasing.  You could make the keys lexically sortable by changing the last line to <code>dict[key + ":" + ('%06d' % (lineno,))=str(line[3])</code></p>
