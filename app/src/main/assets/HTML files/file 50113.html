<p>You should rename your question "how to read strings of unknown length"...
Here is an example of one way to do it.. there are slightly more efficient ways but I tried to keep it simple.</p>

<p>This code will read characters from <code>stdin</code>, and store them into <code>s</code>, allocating memory as necessary.. up to any size, until it either reads <code>delim</code>.. set to be a string of three <code>0</code> characters in a row, reaches EOF (end of file), or hits the limit of memory allocation size on your system.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main() {

    char c, *delim = "000";
    int i = 0, delimlen = strlen(delim);

    /* start out with 2 bytes of memory.. in reality the operating system */
    /* will allocate a lot more than that...                              */
    /* using calloc rather than malloc so that memory is initially nulled */
    char *s = calloc(2, 1);

    /* read characters one at a time from stdin */
    while((c = fgetc(stdin)) != EOF) {
        /* place character into the next position in the string array.. */
        /* and add 1 to i so it indexes the next position in the array  */
        s[i++] = c;
        /* add null terminator */
        s[i] = 0;

        /* did we get delimiter? */
        if(i &gt;= delimlen &amp;&amp; !strcmp(s+i-delimlen, delim))
            break;

        /* increase size of memory s points to, if necessary */
        s = realloc(s, i+2);
    }
    printf("we got input: %s", s);
    /* once you are TOTALLY done with s, free the memory so that it can be used again */
    free(s);
    exit(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if your input is coming from the terminal (keyboard) not from a file or pipe, it will wait for you to hit "enter" before passing input to the program.  So, you won't see your delimiter until then.  If that is a problem, look at this:</p>
