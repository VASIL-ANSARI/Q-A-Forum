<p>I would take a look at the source at this <a href="http://gmaps-utility-gis.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/v3test/mvc/poly_bind.html" rel="nofollow">Google Code project with v3 API examples</a>. </p>

<p>It seems to basically add a simple class that handles binding arrays, and then uses that with the bindTo call.</p>
