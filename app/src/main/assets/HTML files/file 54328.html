<p>You may want to use <a href="https://github.com/nsarno/knock" rel="nofollow">knock</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth" rel="nofollow">devise_token_auth</a> in an API context. Be carreful, your email seems to be invalid. I don't know Postman but the POST parameters should live in the body of your HTTP request.</p>
