<p>The reason of my problem is that when I use the curl_easy_cleanup(curl) and then curl_easy_init I change the sessionID, so the cookie that I've saved are no longer good. So I use at the first curl_easy_init, then I make all my request in my functions, and at the end of my program I use curl_easy_cleanup. To clean the CURL OPTION you can use: curl_easy_reset(). I've update this post for people that can have my same problem. </p>
