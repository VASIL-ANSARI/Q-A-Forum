<p>Looks like it is image-maps based, appear to be using a product from a company called "Fluid Retail" from here:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>If I were writing this from scratch it I'd probably ignore the rotating aspect for now and concentrate on getting the color customisation bit right first.</p>

<p>If you had SVG versions of your products that would be a good starting point.</p>

<p>You could then convert your <a href="http://davidlynch.org/blog/2008/03/creating-an-image-map-from-svg/" rel="nofollow">SVG to image maps</a> or maybe do something equivalent with <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/australia.html" rel="nofollow">Raphel JS</a>.  You can find lots of JavaScript color pickers around and could integrate one of these with your product image customisation tool.</p>

<p>Once you've implemented the code to read and remember the color choices, transitioning to different displays of your product images should be achievable.</p>

<p>An image map JavaScript library like <a href="http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/" rel="nofollow">ImageMapster</a> could also be useful to you.</p>
