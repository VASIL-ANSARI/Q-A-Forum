<p>I think this is expected if you use a thread pool, which keeps threads hanging around (probably with an idle loop, causing them to show up as 'running').</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html" rel="nofollow">The docs</a> say that swingworkers can only execute once, so re-attaching them isn't possible. They aren't threads themselves, but executed on a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html#execute%28%29" rel="nofollow">worker thread</a>. </p>

<p>You could limit the number of threads in the pool by using an ExecutorService.
See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8356784/whats-the-maximum-number-of-swing-worker-threads-that-can-be-run">this SO question</a> for more details.</p>
