<p>changing my .htaccess to</p>

<pre><code>Options +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9]*)/?([a-zA-Z0-9]*)?/?([a-zA-Z0-9]*)?/?$ index.php?controller=$1&amp;action=$2&amp;arg=$3 [NC,L]
</code></pre>

<p>solved that issue. 
the magic line is <code>RewriteBase /</code></p>

<p>seems like the server was really looking for the index.php in the wrong place. </p>

<p>hope this helps other people having the same problem... :)</p>
