<p>Android Fragmentation is inherent to GooglePlay. If  you want to bypass it or make a workaround, you'd have to publish on a different app store than GooglePlay. Fortunatelly for you, GooglePlay is #13 in China, so aiming for one of the top5 might give you better results.</p>

<p>But this is really not something you can actually do something about. You can fix <code>Fragment</code> and <code>FragmentManager</code> related issues easily; but not the Android Fragmentation issue - because that's what (ecosystem) fragmentation really is.</p>
