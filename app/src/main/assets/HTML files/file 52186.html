<p>The idea behind this is simple.
The hosting class take as a template parameter the hosted one.</p>

<p>Once it has it, it just derive from the latter:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt;
template class Host : public T
{
};
</code></pre>

<p>As the rules of inheritance specifies, all public members are accessible from the deriven class.</p>

<p>If you want to chain more properties, use multiply inheritance.</p>

<p>Simple and awesome, right?</p>
