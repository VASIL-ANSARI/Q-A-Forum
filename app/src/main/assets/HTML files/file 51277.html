<p>The correct way to do this is to add a <code>unique</code> constraint on the name field, and then use <code>insertWithOnConflict()</code> with a last argument of <code>CONFLICT_FAIL</code>. That's actually the default behavior. Your insert will fail if it would otherwise cause a constraint violation (<code>insert()</code> will return -1).</p>

<p>If you don't want to do that, there's no magic. Query your DB for a row with the given name field. If you are returned >0 rows, don't perform the insert.</p>

<pre><code>Cursor c = db.query(..., "name=?", new String[] {theName}, ...);
if (c.getCount &gt; 0) {
  // don't do it
  return;
}
</code></pre>
