<p>I have had the same issue a couple of times. Both times it started when I was loading an IBDesignable nib onto the storyboard when the nib was not able to fit on the view (ie I had a button off of the UIView but still in the nib). Once I fixed that xCode still gave me errors so I restarted Xcode until it randomly quit giving me the error. </p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I just killed all processes named "Interface Builder Cocoa Touch Tool", restarted Xcode and the error went away. Don't know if this will always work or not.</p>
