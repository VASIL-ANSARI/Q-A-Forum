  <p>Q1: Can we precisely know when the autorelease pool will be "drained" or "purged"? </p>
  
  <p>Q2: Does this happen at the end of OS/GUI methods such as didSelectViewController? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the autorelease pool is drained once per the event loop. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q3: Must someone who calls getAdviceFromGame retain the object sent back by my method before using it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that someone wants to keep the object after that particular event cycle, yes. If not, you don't have to, because the <code>autorelease</code>d object is guaranteed to be alive until your current event-dealing method returns.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note that I did not put "New" in my method name because the caller does not own the object sent back by the method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very good! But I also recommend you to change the method name from <code>getAdviceFromGame:ofLine</code> to <code>adviceFromGame:ofLine</code>. Usually in Cocoa, <code>get...</code> is used when something is returned by a pointer passed as a method argument, just when you used <code>[pGame getBytes:&amp;readByte range:range];</code>.</p>

<p>As for the second part, you can use instead of your lines</p>

<pre><code>[cardSymbol autorelease];

// Return the string.
return [NSString stringWithString:cardSymbol];
</code></pre>

<p>the sequence</p>

<pre><code>NSString*s=[SString stringWithString:cardSymbol];
[cardSymbol release];
return s;
</code></pre>

<p>or even just</p>

<pre><code>return [cardSymbol autorelease];
</code></pre>

<p>because <code>NSMutableString</code> is a subclass of <code>NSString</code>. But just one object in the autorelease pool won't matter much, even on the iPhone.</p>
