<p>I suspect that this doesn't actually have anything to do with .NET. In your code, you have</p>

<pre><code>ReturnUrl = "http://localhost:25806/Facebook/ExternalLoginCallback"
</code></pre>

<p>However, the value in the query url you provided is </p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:18774/vacatures/ExternalLoginCallBack
</code></pre>

<p>In your Facebook application's settings on facebook.com, there is a field for return URI. This value is probably different from what you have here. You must change one of them so that they match. That is what the error is explaining.</p>
