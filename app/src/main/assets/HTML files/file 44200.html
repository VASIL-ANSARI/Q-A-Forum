<p>A Webapi controller is created on each request (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25175626/asp-net-web-api-why-are-controllers-created-per-request">ASP.net Web API: Why are controllers created per request?</a>) so this means that any variables that are instantiated within the webapi controller constructor will be recreated on each request. A static service will still retain its value between requests because its lifetime is not controlled by the webapi controller.</p>

<p>To have a non-static service, you will have to introduce another way to control the lifetime of the service. Look at dependency injection <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/hands-on-labs/aspnet-mvc-4-dependency-injection" rel="nofollow">http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/hands-on-labs/aspnet-mvc-4-dependency-injection</a> to get a better idea of how to do this. The easiest way to get around your issue is to use an IoC container such as <a href="http://www.ninject.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ninject.org/</a>.</p>
