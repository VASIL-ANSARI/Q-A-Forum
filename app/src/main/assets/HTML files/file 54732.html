<p>I see you have two Team entries. I believe the issue might be because you have the "Personal Team" option selected under your Project settings page.</p>

<p>In Xcode, in the Filesystem sidebar, select the Project node, select your main Target, and choose the non-Personal Team entry. Ensure you have a device selected so you can provision it, then rebuild and rearchive, then it should work.</p>
