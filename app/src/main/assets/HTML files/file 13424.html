<p>send the UDID or mac address with the initial login details to your server.  create a unique token for this user/UDID (or mac) combination and send it back(encrypted) to the device if username/pass is successful.  on subsequent access, the device sends the encrypted token and UDID/mac (over secure connection) for re-authentication. </p>

<p>if you want to put paranoid people at ease about tracking UDID, you could instead use the UDID/mac to salt the encrypted token, but this wont be as secure, but should do the job still.</p>
