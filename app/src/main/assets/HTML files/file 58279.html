<p>The answer is: <strong>You can't.</strong> You can not flip a background image using just CSS. </p>

<p>Possible Solutions for you :</p>

<p>Looking at your problem, if you do not want to repeat your image, then set </p>

<pre><code>background-repeat: no-repeat
</code></pre>

<p>And you can also set </p>

<pre><code>background-size: cover; 
</code></pre>

<p>so that the image covers 100% of your container. </p>

<p>And if you want the flipped image at the bottom of your container then edit the existing image in photoshop and use that as the background image.</p>
