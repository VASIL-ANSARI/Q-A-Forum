<p>Assuming you're storing the winner of a championship as the primary key/id of the holder, something like this should work.  You might want to add in another join to get the actual name of the team from another table though.</p>

<p>Because LEFT join will only select rows from the 'right' table when there is a match, everything that doesn't have one should come back as NULL.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, [holder] 
FROM championships AS c
LEFT JOIN title_history AS h ON c.winner = h.id
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDITED VERSION:</strong></p>

<p>With further insight into your tables and from your comment, maybe try this subselect:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT friendly_name, 
       (SELECT winner FROM title_history WHERE championship = c.id ORDER BY date_from DESC LIMIT 1) 
FROM championships AS c
ORDER BY name
</code></pre>

<p>If I understand your structure correctly, that ought to get the last winner of each championship?</p>
