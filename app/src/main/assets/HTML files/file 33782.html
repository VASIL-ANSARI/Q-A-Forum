<p>Not the best solution, but I don't have time for LINQ right now. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim extensions As New List(Of String)
extensions.Add("*.png")
' And so on, until all are in...

Dim fileCount As Integer
For i As Integer = 0 To extensions.Count - 1
  fileCount += Directory.GetFiles(txtPath.Text, extensions(i), SearchOption.AllDirectories).Length
Next
</code></pre>
