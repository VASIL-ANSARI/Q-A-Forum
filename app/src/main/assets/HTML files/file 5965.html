<p>Those bookmarkes are called bookmarklets, just FYI :)</p>

<p>And no, there is no way to set up an icon for them. This is because the browser automatically looks for the favicon on the link the bookmark is pointing to. The way it finds this favicon is by either accessing the page itself and looking at the meta data in the HTML, or alternatively by going to domain/favicon.ico</p>

<p>As you can see, there is no way for the browser to perform those steps on a bunch of javascript code.</p>
