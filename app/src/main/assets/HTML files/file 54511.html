<p>Unless I see all your code all I can do for you is give you a sample in return, I don't know what you're trying to do but it seems in this case you're looking for this.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;  
#include &lt;fstream&gt; 
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std; 

int main()
{ 

  string Display = "";
  ofstream FileOut;
  ifstream FileInput;

  FileOut.open("C:\\Example.txt");

  FileOut &lt;&lt; "This is some example text that will be written to the file!";

  FileOut.close();

  FileInput.open("C:\\Example.txt");

  if (!FileInput)
  {
      cout &lt;&lt; "Error File not Found: " &lt;&lt; endl; 
      return 1; 
  }

  while (!FileInput.eof())
  {
      getline(FileInput, Display);
  } 
  FileInput.close();
  cout &lt;&lt; Display &lt;&lt; endl; 

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Simply put if you're currently working wit ha text document </p>

<p>use <code>getline()</code></p>

<p>When you use getline() it takes two arguments the first will be in this case your ifstream object, as in what you're using to open the file. The second will be the string you're using to store the contents in. </p>

<p>Using the method I outlined above you'll be able to read the entire file contents.</p>

<p>And please next time as it was said above outline your problem more in depth and if you provide us with all of your code we may better assist you!</p>
