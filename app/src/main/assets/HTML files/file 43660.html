<p>There is no such a thing as <code>$scopeProvider</code>, scopes are created using the <code>$new</code> method, every scope has access to this method through inheritance (delegation to be precise). When you ask for a <code>$scope</code> in a controller, the <code>$scope</code> is created dynamically using it's parent <code>$scope</code> <code>$new</code> method and injected under that name. To invoke the aforementioned behavior for a different name you would have to play with angular internals.</p>
