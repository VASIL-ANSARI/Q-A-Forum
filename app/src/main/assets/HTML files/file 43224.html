<p>The major difference is exactly the same as the difference between running code in Node vs running code in a browser, generally speaking. In the browser you have a DOM implementation and access to implementations of various web standards. In Node you do not. (You can use something like jsdom but it is not a complete implementation of the DOM.) What determines whether you'll want to run Mocha in Node or in the browser is the type of code you are trying to test.</p>

<p>Other than this, if you run Mocha in a browser, you are restricted to the HTML reporter.</p>
