<p>That's probably because the stream isn't flushed. On some platforms, it is flushed after every output, but on others, it is not.</p>

<p>So, if you flush it you'll get <code>0</code> as output:</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; flush; // 'flush' flushes the stream = displays everything immediately
</code></pre>
