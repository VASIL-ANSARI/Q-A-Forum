<p>You will need to get well acquainted with Quartz 2D / CoreGraphics. This guide is a good start for you <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/Introduction/Introduction.html</a></p>

<p>The task you have described can be as simple or as complicated as you want. From letting the user use their fingers to erase the area around the photo by dragging their finger around (easy) to you trying to detect high contrast areas that help you guess where to cut (pretty complicated).</p>

<p>If you choose the former, you will essentially want to create a clipping mask based on user touches so have a look at the touchesBegan, touchesMoved and touchesEnded methods of UIView.</p>

<p>For the clipping mask, this is probably a good simple example to get you started <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4526336/how-erase-part-of-uiimage">How erase part of UIImage</a></p>

<p>Good luck with it, it sounds like a fun (if not challenging) project.</p>
