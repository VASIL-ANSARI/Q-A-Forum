<p>Well, your line 1 certainly looks straight forward enough.  Assuming the error line and number is not erroneous, it makes me think there is a hidden character in the first spot of your js file that is throwing IE for a fit.  Try opening the file in another text editor that may support display of normally hidden characters.  Sometimes copying/pasting the source into a super-basic text-editor, like Notepad, can sometimes strip out non-displayable characters and then save it back into place directly from Notepad.</p>
