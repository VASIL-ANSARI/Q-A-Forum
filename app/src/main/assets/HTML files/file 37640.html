<p>Have you installed ruby before and maybe forgot about it? It looks like it's trying to find the gem in the C:/Ruby200-x64/bin folder which probably doesn't have it.
Try checking your programs and uninstall all versions of Ruby &amp; install again ver 1.9.3 - that works best on windows from what I gathered. </p>
