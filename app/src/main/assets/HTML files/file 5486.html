<p>Well friends, I seem to have hacked together a solution for this issue: 
I linked the entire 'src' folder from the main project into the one for the test project.  Now, when it goes searching for the particular package my file is located in, it finds the file in its own source tree first.  Hooray!</p>

<p>Why does this work? I haven't a clue, perhaps someone could enlighten us to that fact.<br>
Does it work? For now...</p>
