<p>I agree, that licensing page is not very straightforward and doesn't do much to alleviate concerns.</p>

<p>Consider using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zxing/" rel="nofollow">ZXing</a> if you are worried about this.  It's licensing questions page is more clear.  I have released an app that uses this library and know that Apple does not (at this time) seem to have an issue with it.</p>

<p>PS: I know this did not answer your question, but what I'm trying to say is: I don't think anyone on SO would venture to provide an authoritative judgement based on that document, so I'd look for alternatives.</p>
