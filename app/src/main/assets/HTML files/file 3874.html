<p>This API is behaving properly but often appears incorrect the first time you encounter this behavior. Omitting the <code>\</code> after the volume letter has special semantics.  It will replace the volume specifier with value passed into the last call to <code>SetCurrentDirectory</code> for that volume.  How this is remembered is discussed here</p>

</ul>

<p>In this case the last value passed in was either <code>c:\</code> or the current directory simply hadn't been set.  Hence the call actually became the second version</p>

<pre><code>Directory.Exists("c:\\temp\\foo")
</code></pre>

<p>This correctly evaluated to true</p>

<p>Why this happens for <code>Directory.Exists</code> is that deep, deep down in the function it uses <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364963%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">GetFullPathName</a> which relies on this behavior (see the linked documentation). </p>
