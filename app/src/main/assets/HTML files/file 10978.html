<p>It's doable (assuming you're using the standard UIWebView component to render the page), and there are a few ways you could go about it. Among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could download the HTML and parse it via Objective-C string handlers before loading it into the UIWebView</li>
<li>You coud use load the HTML as-is and use the UIWebview's <code>stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:</code> message to "inject" javascript onto the page, manipulating the DOM itself</li>
<li>You could go the Opera route, and pre-render the page via a server-side proxy before downloading it to the client.</li>
</ul>

<p>How far down the rabbit hole you want to go would be up to you, of course. Easy is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
