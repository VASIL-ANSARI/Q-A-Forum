<p><strong>DON'T DERIVE FROM STRING</strong></p>

<p>std::string, that is, basically the whole basic_string template is not designed to be derived from. There are zillions of articles about that already. It doesn't have any virtual functions so there is nothing to override. The best you can do is hide something. Best is to use composition/aggregation! That is, just keep a member of type string in your class and forward the calls! Again, just to make sure</p>
