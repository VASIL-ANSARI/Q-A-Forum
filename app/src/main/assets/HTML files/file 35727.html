<p>After numerous attempts at finding a highly-compatible library to get the most effective and efficient control of a touch device, I ended up using 'touchSwipe' by 'Ramp Interactive'. You can get it here:</p>

<p>Of course, considering it is a jQuery library, you will need to also add jQuery library to your project, if you haven't done so already.</p>
