  <p>Tiered Compilation</p>
  
  <p>Tiered compilation, introduced in Java SE 7, brings client startup
  speeds to the server VM. Normally, a server VM uses the interpreter to
  collect profiling information about methods that is fed into the
  compiler. In the tiered scheme, in addition to the interpreter, the
  client compiler is used to generate compiled versions of methods that
  collect profiling information about themselves. Since the compiled
  code is substantially faster than the interpreter, the program
  executes with greater performance during the profiling phase. In many
  cases, a startup that is even faster than with the client VM can be
  achieved because the final code produced by the server compiler may be
  already available during the early stages of application
  initialization. The tiered scheme can also achieve better peak
  performance than a regular server VM because the faster profiling
  phase allows a longer period of profiling, which may yield better
  optimization.</p>
