<p>It seems that the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3064559/how-is-vector-implemented-in-c">relocation of the vectors</a> are taking much of the time. Adding to vectors are not O(1) operations. Try to change the vector to a basic C type array, and you will notice the difference. Also, what I see from the values, it is no way exponential. A higher polynomial maybe.</p>
