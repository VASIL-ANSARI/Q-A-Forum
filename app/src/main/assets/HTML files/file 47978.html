<p>Ok, I found that there was actually a hidden file in this project, <code>.project</code>, which has for instance:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;buildCommand&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.ResourceManagerBuilder&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;arguments&gt;
  &lt;/arguments&gt;
&lt;/buildCommand&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... which means this had been built with Eclipse with ADT plugin ( <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html</a> ), the support for which is now discontinued in favor of Android Studio ( <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/migrate.html" rel="nofollow">Migrating to Android Studio | Android Developers</a> ).</p>

<p>Knowing this, then I simply found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15718907/how-to-create-build-xml-for-an-android-project">How to create build.xml for an Android project?</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14951644/ant-command-does-not-generating-apk-file">ant command does not generating apk file</a>, from where I tried the command:</p>

<pre><code>/path/to/sdk/tools/android update project -p $PWD
</code></pre>

<p>... which finally did create <code>build.xml</code> that is used by the <code>ant</code> system - which seemed to pass (but the build itself failed due to unresolved library dependencies, which is a different topic).</p>

<p>There seems to be no easy way to convert an <code>ant</code> based project to a <code>gradle</code> one from the command line - and even the migration path through the Android Studio may/will require manual changes.</p>
