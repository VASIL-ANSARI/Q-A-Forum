<p>If you want to sequence an animation after the end of another, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>box.fadeIn('slow').delay(200).animate({
                backgroundColor: '#EFE9A8',
                borderColor: '#F7B64D',
                color: '#AD771F'
            }, 1200);
</code></pre>

<p>Your jsFiddle can not work because it doesn't have the color animation plugin. Anyway, even if I add jQuery UI (which now includes the color animation plugin), I can't make it work with jsfiddle. I think there's an issue with jQuery UI in jsFiddle.</p>

<p>Edit: Try it with jsbin: <a href="http://jsbin.com/xadiwuxo/1/edit?html,css,js,output" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/xadiwuxo/1/edit?html,css,js,output</a></p>

<p>Edit2: in fact jsfiddle works if you use the correct jQuery UI version. I think you need at least jQuery UI 1.9.x. The jsFiddle above uses jQuery 1.x (edge) and therefore is limited to jQuery UI 1.8.9.</p>
