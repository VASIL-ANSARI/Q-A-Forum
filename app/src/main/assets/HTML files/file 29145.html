<p>There are numerous ways that you can accomplish this depending on what your end goal is.  Here are the 2 most common ones.</p>

<p>This is the basic process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Page loads with the initial dropdown populated with options, let's say Category (Car, Truck, SUV) and the item drop-down disabled.</li>
<li>User selects a value from the first drop-down, there are a few ways to handle this:</li>
</ol>

<p>AJAX (the most seamless experience with fewest page loads):</p>

<ol>
<li>Using Javascript send an ajax request to a PHP script (or any other handler) containing the value of the selected option from the category drop-down as either a post or request parameter.</li>
<li>Retrieve the values for the item drop-down based on our category, these could be from our database, a variable, a static file, or any other means that you can come up with</li>
<li>Return our values as a response to the AJAX request (json, xml, plaintext, whatever fits best for you and you're most comfortable using)</li>
<li>Using Javascript (or you could use a library like jQuery) we insert the returned options from our AJAX request into the item drop-down and enable it so the user can make a selection.</li>
<li>From here we can either continue using AJAX requests and responses or POST the form a return a final page, or whatever your particular usage calls for.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't want to use AJAX, you could very easily POST the form to a Server-side handler, get the value from the category drop-down, locate your values for the item drop-down and then render your HTML response in which you set a value for the category drop-down and disable it (so the user would have to use the back button if they would wanted to change the category) and populate the item drop-down.</p>
