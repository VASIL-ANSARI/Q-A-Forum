<p>From the documentation for UIWebView, it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important: You should not embed UIWebView or UITableView objects in
  UIScrollView objects. If you do so, unexpected behavior can result
  because touch events for the two objects can be mixed up and wrongly
  handled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A more appropriate approach would be to add your UIWebView to a UIViewController with a UIScrollView (or UITableView) underneath. I'd be conscious of the amount of space you'll have left though for the scroll view though, especially if you're dealing with the iPhone.</p>

<p>Hope that's a nudge in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>After looking into this (I was sure there would be a way), it seems the best approach I managed to come up with is to add your UIWebView to the header view of a UITableView.</p>

<pre><code>    //create webview
    _webView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 280.0)];

    //load request and scale content to fit
    [_webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.stackoverflow.com/"]]];
    [_webView setScalesPageToFit:YES];

    //add web view to table header view
    [[self tableView] setTableHeaderView:_webview];
</code></pre>

<p>This adds a UIWebView to the header of the table view before the cells are displayed underneath. Note that a table header view (and footer views also) are different from section headers (and footers) so you can still use these two if you are using UITableViewStylePlain.</p>

<p>Be sure to attenuate the frame of the webview to allow for any cells underneath to be visible or else the user will not be able to scroll the tableview as any touches will be intercepted by the webview.</p>

<p>This still goes against the UIWebView documentation (stated above) but, in practice, this implementation actually works fine as long as the webview does not cover the entire scrollable region of the view.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of the test app I made: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/g7Okq.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Hope that helps :)</p>
