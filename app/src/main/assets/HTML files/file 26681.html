<p>This a very vague questions, so I'll just list a few points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your data model should not be concerned with server security.  Build your data model accurately for your application and lock down access to the db and tables as much as possible.  These are separate concerns.</li>
<li>Use encryption for data that only the end user is allowed to know.  Passwords, for example, get one-way encryption.</li>
<li>MySQL's auto increment is sufficient for most use cases.  The only time I sometimes have the application generate IDs is on <a href="http://docforge.com/wiki/Programming_for_database_replication" rel="nofollow">multi-master replicated databases</a> where I need more centralized control or have unique requirements.  This isn't always necessary since you can set the autoincrement starting number separately for each server and not worry about the servers generating conflicting IDs.  There is sometimes a performance drawback to generating your own IDs, e.g. generating a GUID takes longer than incrementing an integer.</li>
</ul>
