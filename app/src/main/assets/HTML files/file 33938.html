<p>I believe you can, you have to disable a security feature in php that allows only local includes. Then you will need to have a static IP or dynamic dns setup to point to your local. Your local will then need to be setup to share the file. I don't recommend this though as it opens a lot of potential security holes. Here is some more info:</p>

<p>The security setting you are looking for is: allow_url_include

<p>If you are going to go this route I would highly recommend blocking all connections to your localhost other than a single white listed IP address.</p>
