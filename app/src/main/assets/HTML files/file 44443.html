<p>There are lots of options here. Test and profile some to see which gives you the best tradeoff between the visual effect you want and performance.</p>

<h3>1. Use a particle system</h3>

<p>Drawing hundreds of circles per second sounds a lot like a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SCNParticleSystem_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/SCNParticleSystem" rel="nofollow">particle system</a>, particularly if their placement follows a specific pattern. Set the <code>particleImage</code> to a bitmap of a circle (with sufficiently high resolution that you don't get pixelation upon scaling), and use a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SceneKit/Reference/SCNParticlePropertyController_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/SCNParticlePropertyController" rel="nofollow">property controller</a> to animate the size.</p>

<h3>2. BYO particle system</h3>

<p>If <code>SCNParticleSystem</code> doesn't fit the bill, you can do roughly what it does â draw billboarded sprites and adjust their size. Use an <code>SCNLookAtConstraint</code> to face a plane toward the viewer, map a circle texture onto it, and animate the <code>scale</code> of the containing node.</p>

<h3>3. Use a parametric geometry</h3>

<p>Make an <code>SCNCylinder</code> or <code>SCNSphere</code> and transform it so that the circular cross section is oriented toward the camera. (Flatten it in other dimensions if that matters.) To make it grow, animate the node's <code>scale</code>. </p>

<p>To show only an outline, use a shader modifier â a good way to get an outline effect in shader code is to test the dot product of the view direction and the surface normal, drawing your outline color only when they are nearly perpendicular.</p>
