<p>Regarding your questions:</p>

<p>.1. suppose my index page(value="/index", method=RequestMethod.GET) has 10000 hit a day, Does it mean that for each coming get request, An object of UserCredential will be created? (I want to know about object life cycle)</p>

<p><em>Yes, but it is tied to the http request scope and the object will be eligible for garbage collection as soon as your page is rendered. 10000 is a fairly small number for the JVM to handle.</em></p>

<p>.2. Is there any methodology for us to bind a @ModelAttribute object with the second method (checkCredential) only (just when we want to submit a form)?</p>

<p><em>Depends on your flow - I am assuming you are using a spring form tag to show validation errors back to the user if the user or password don't conform to certain standards you have, if that is the case you will need to set the <code>@ModelAttribute</code> to populate your domain object at the point of redirection back to your index page. 
If on the other hand you don't intend to show feedback to your user with the original values that have been set by the user then you don't to set the ModelAttribute, you can totally ignore it and use normal <code>form</code> html elements instead of spring tag.</em></p>

<p>.3. If in my case I just have to use @RequestParam to fetch my input values, how I can validate the @RequestParam without using BindingResult and return them back to the view for show?</p>

<p><em>I wouldn't recommend this, a wrapper type is way better and will be validated with the registered validator and the <code>BindingResult</code> will cleanly have the validation errors that you can directly carry over to the UI. If you absolutely want to validate the <code>@RequestParam</code> on your own, you can call the validator yourself. There are ways to set more model attributes to carry back the validation exceptions and present on the UI.</em></p>
