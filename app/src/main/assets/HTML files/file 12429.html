<p>You can wrap the 3rd party library to avoid compile-time dependency, but the 3rd party library must be there at runtime.</p>

<p>The easiest way would be to simply have delegating methods (IDEs can create these automatically):</p>

<pre><code>public class DefaultMyConfig {
    private Config delegate;
    public MyConfig(Config delegate) {
        this.delegate = delegate;
    }
    public String foo() {
       return delegate.foo();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can define an interface that is the same as the <code>Config</code> interface, and then implement it in <code>DefaultMyConfig</code>, or you can stay with a class only.</p>
