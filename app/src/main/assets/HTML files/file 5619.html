<p>No, there's no hidden stack allocation going on there. <code>"Hello"</code> is static data, and ends up in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment" rel="nofollow">.data segment</a> of your program.</p>

<p>This also means the string is shared for all calls to <code>getText</code>. A common use when this would be acceptable is if you have a large list of error messages that map to error codes. Functions like <code>strerror</code> work like this, so that you can get descriptive error messages for standard library error codes. But nobody is supposed to modify the return value of <code>strerror</code> (also because it is <code>const</code>). In your case, your function definition should read:</p>

<pre><code>const char *getText()
</code></pre>

<p>If you do want a private copy of the string returned, you can use the <code>strdup</code> function to make a copy:</p>

<pre><code>return strdup("Hello");
</code></pre>
