<p>You can't go two levels up. You can only decide to call your parent. That class is then responsible for calling its parent in turn.  </p>

<p>Note that all constructors (except for the root constructors in <code>Object</code>) call a super constructor. If you don't specify it explicitly, or, as @PaulBellora adds, the first statement is a <code>this()</code> call to another constructor of your class, the compiler inserts a <code>super()</code> call as the first statement in every constructor.</p>
