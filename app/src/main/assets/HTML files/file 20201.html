<p>While in the example you've given, the empty tuple and ellipsis give a similar result, in general they serve different purposes. When indexing an array, <code>A[i, j, k] == A[(i, j, k)]</code> and specifically <code>A[...] == A[(Ellipsis,)]</code>. Here the tuple simply serves as a container for indexing elements. This can be useful when you need to manipulate the index as a variable, for example you can do:</p>

<pre><code>index = (0,) * A.ndim
A[index]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that because the tuple is the container for indexing elements, it cannot be combined with other indices, for example <code>A[(), 0] == A[[], 0]</code> and <code>A[(), 0] != A[..., 0]</code>.</p>

<p>Because an array <code>A</code> can be indexed with fewer indices than <code>A.ndim</code>, indexing with an empty tuple is a natural extension of that behavior and it can be useful in some situations, for example the above code snipit will work when <code>A.ndim == 0</code>.</p>

<p>In short, the tuple serves as a container for indexing elements, which is allowed to be empty, while the Ellipsis is one of the possible indexing elements.</p>
