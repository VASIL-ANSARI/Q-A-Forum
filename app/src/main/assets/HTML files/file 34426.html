<p>You have the problems that Jonathan mentions but the problems that really keep this from working are that the test condition is for the wrong strings and the wrong condition. The correct test is:</p>

<pre><code>if (strcmp((asciiArt+j)-&gt;artistName, (asciiArt+pos_min)-&gt;artistName) &lt; 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the comparison is between pos_min and j and that j is now used for the first argument.</p>
