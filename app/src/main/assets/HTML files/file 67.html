<p>A ThreadStateException is thrown because you're trying to start a thread that's not in a startable state. The most likely situations would be that it's already running, or that it has fully exited.</p>

<p>There are potentially a couple things that might be happening. First is, the thread might have transitioned from Running to StopRequested, which isn't fully stopped yet, so your logic doesn't create a new thread, and you're trying to start a thread which has just finished running or is about to finish running (neither of which is a valid state for restarting).</p>

<p>The other possibility is that the thread was aborted. Threads which are aborted go to the Aborted state, not the Stopped state, and of course are also not valid for restarting.</p>

<p>Really, the only kind of thread that is still alive that can be "restarted" is one that's suspended. You might want to use this conditional instead:</p>

<p><code>if (this.mThread == null || this.mThread.ThreadState != ThreadState.Suspended)</code></p>
