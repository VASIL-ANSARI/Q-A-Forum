<p>In order to Facebook you dont get an exceptions but often a warning/logoutputs, in there you can see what happens during the login process. If you would have a keyhash problem, then you would definetely get an warning exception.</p>

<p>Please check your logcat for hints.</p>

<p>A very good sample is this <a href="https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/tree/master/samples/Hackbook" rel="nofollow">Hackbook</a></p>
