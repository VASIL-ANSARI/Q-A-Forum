<p>You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb338641.aspx"><code>Contains()</code></a> for that.  It will feel a little backwards when you're really trying to produce an <code>IN</code> clause, but this should do it:</p>

<pre><code>var userProfiles = _dataContext.UserProfile
                               .Where(t =&gt; idList.Contains(t.Id));
</code></pre>

<p>I'm also assuming that each <code>UserProfile</code> record is going to have an <code>int</code> <code>Id</code> field. If that's not the case you'll have to adjust accordingly.</p>
