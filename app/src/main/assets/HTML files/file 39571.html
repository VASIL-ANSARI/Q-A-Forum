<p>You can use Environment.NewLine:</p>

<pre><code>myString = myString.Replace(' ', Environment.NewLine);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a platform-independent line-replace. Don't use '\n'.</p>

<p>Environment.NewLine basically outputs "\r\n" for non-Unix platforms, and "\n" for Unix platforms. You are not on a Unix platform, so it is not outputting correctly.</p>

<p>You will run into a lot of weird problems if you use \n, and/or \r\n\ in the future. It's best to just use Environment.NewLine. This works on MessageBox.Show() dialogs, in StreamWriter, StreamReader, etc. </p>

<p>You can port the code anywhere, whereas if you were to use \n or \r\n, you'd be restricted to the platform which supports it. </p>
