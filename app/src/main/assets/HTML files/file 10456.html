<p>There are two ways I can think of off the top of my head.</p>

<h2>1 - Have each thread contain a collection of clients.</h2>

<p>Instead of only 1 client per thread.  Try having a collection of X clients per thread.  Then loop through the clients moving each one.</p>

<h2>2 - Truely distribute your clients</h2>

<p>Use a JMeter or other distributed testing suite to spread threads across multiple computers.</p>
