<p>The code above is not complete, but I assume that the function on top where you do <code>$client = new SoapClient("http://59.38.606.10:8080/smsengine/smsws?WSDL");</code> is actually the wall function. If so, then what that function returns, i.e. <code>$result</code> actually has the status you need. So with this code snippet (assuming $sperm is a typo and should actually be $perm, the response from the wall function), you get the response from <code>wall()</code>, which is an object and has the status you need. </p>

<pre><code>$perm = wall();
$status = $sperm-&gt;return; //outputing the status
// Here I want to capture the $status variable and put it in a db below
echo "$status";
</code></pre>

<p>If that's right, then before calling <code>grabdetails</code> in the wall function, you actually have the status and you can send it to the function like this:</p>

<pre><code>grabdetails($message_sent, $mobilenumber, $result-&gt;return);
</code></pre>

<p>And then change the definition of the <code>grabdetails</code> to receive the status as well and use it in the DB insert. </p>
