<p>Hard to understand your question/problem but I will throw something...</p>

<p>When you create dynamic controls you need to create them on Init event so when ViewState is applied he finds the controls and sets their values. If you are not creating the controls in Init but later, you will found out that the control doesn't have the supposed value!</p>
