<p>Not built into knockout, no (at least, not as far as I know). It has a mechanism (throttling) that limits how often view model changes are propagated through, but obviously that's not what you're after. Arguably you should have a member on your view model that you bind through to your element, and then it's your responsibility to update your view model periodically.</p>
