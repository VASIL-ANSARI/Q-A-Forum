<p>Did you register the 2nd activity in the manifest file?
If you could post your manifest file too it would be helpful in diagnosing the issue.</p>

<p>All activities used in the application must have an entry in the manifest file in order for android to actually launch them.</p>

<p>Additional Activities that don't need to show up in the launcher can be registered in the manifest file like this (from the application I'm currently working on)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:name=".LineupActivity"&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With ".LineupActivity" in the example replaced with whatever the class name of your activity is.  In your case <code>.LocationScreen</code>.</p>
