<p>I'm not sure how to add a colorbar to your image before you save it like you want to, and I'm not even sure if that's possible. But I can provide you with a way to plot your image, add the colorbar, and save it, but format it the way you want. Try something like the following</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(figsize = (W,H)) # Your image (W)idth and (H)eight in inches
# Stretch image to full figure, removing "grey region"
plt.subplots_adjust(left = 0, right = 1, top = 1, bottom = 0)
im = plt.imshow('out.jpg') # Show the image
pos = fig.add_axes([0.93,0.1,0.02,0.35]) # Set colorbar position in fig
fig.colorbar(im, cax=pos) # Create the colorbar
plt.savefig('out.jpg')
</code></pre>

<p>I can't guarantee that this will work without having something to test it on, but it should be in the right direction for what you want.</p>
