<p>Bandwidth is very variable, it is virtually impossible to know what bandwidth you have available at any given time on a wireless device. Is it on a cellular network or wifi network? Are you alone using those networks or are others using them too? There are many variables in this equation and the short answer is no, unless you have a very controlled environment.</p>

<p>You can of course tell your application programmatically to not use more than X KB/s and apply an algorithm to control that, but I feel that is not your question.</p>
