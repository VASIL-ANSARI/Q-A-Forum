<p>Another user has reported this as an issue on Dapper's github site. Seems like it's a deliberate optimisation specifically around enums in Dapper, so I've changed my database model rather than trying to change the mapping code. I looked at trying to modify Dapper itself, but the source code of Dapper is optimised like nothing I've ever seen, emitting opcodes to perform conversions in the most performant way possible - no way I want to start trying to work out how to make changes there.</p>
