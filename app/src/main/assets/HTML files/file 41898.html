<p>If your class is opaque then it can't do <em>anything</em>. Like windows handles, it can only be passed to functions that <em>do</em> know how to use it.</p>

<p>The simplest way would be to declare your type as void * and re-cast it to your desired object within the function. Another way would be to keep an array of objects and take an index as the parameter, as HWND and contexts do.</p>

<p>However, this is not a good way to go.</p>
