<p>You want a "nonce", a unique value that is generated when the form is requested, then checked and invalidated when the form is submitted so that it can not be resubmitted.</p>

<p>There is already <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795970/how-does-this-php-nonce-library-work">a question</a> which discusses the FullThrottle nonce library for PHP, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/638494/stop-data-inserting-into-a-database-twice">another question</a> about preventing the double-insert that typically happens when forms are submitted twice.</p>

<p>You should also be submitting the form via POST, and then redirecting the browser so that it requests the results via GET.</p>
