<p>The <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_yearweek" rel="nofollow"><code>YEARWEEK</code></a> function lets you pass the mode to it as well. The only downside is that it returns the year and week-in-year combined together:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT YEARWEEK('2013-01-01', 7);

&gt;&gt; 201253
</code></pre>

<p>You can get around that with <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/string-functions.html#function_substring" rel="nofollow"><code>SUBSTRING</code></a>, though, if you really need just the year separately:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SUBSTRING(YEARWEEK('2013-01-01', 7), 1, 4);

&gt;&gt; 2012
</code></pre>
