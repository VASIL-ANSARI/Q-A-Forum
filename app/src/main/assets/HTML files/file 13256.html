<p>The event <code>ItemCheck</code> is raised when the checked status of an item is <em>about to be  changed</em>.  It isn't changed already. Let me show that with an example. The CheckedListBox contains 3 items "A", "B" and "C". No item is checked. Now the user checks the item "A". The event <code>ItemCheck</code> is fired. The property <code>CheckedItems</code> contains no item. In the event args <code>e</code> (of type <code>ItemCheckEventArgs</code>) you can find the index of the item which checked state is changing, a property <code>CurrentValue</code> containing the checked state before and a property <code>NewValue</code> containing the new checked state. If the user then checks item "B", the event is fired again. This time the property <code>CheckedItems</code> contains one item "A". a.s.o.</p>

<p>BTW: You can set the property <code>NewValue</code> in the ItemCheck event. This gives you the possibility e.g. to prevent an item to be checked.</p>
