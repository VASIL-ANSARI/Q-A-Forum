<p>Yes and No.</p>

<p>I certainly makes sense to limit the length of lines, since long lines are hard to read. And monitor space is still limited. I often work on a laptop or two smallish 19" displays. With multiple editors open, long lines start to disapear on the right.</p>

<p>The specific limit of 80 characters (or the more strict version of 72) today is kind of arbitrary. And a team should decide on what works for them.</p>

<p>Probably 120 characters makes more sense, so it fits into tweet with some space for hashtags ;-)</p>
