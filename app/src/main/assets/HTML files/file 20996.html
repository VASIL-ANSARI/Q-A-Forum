<p>Basically you will get instances and public IP-s, then you will compare if instance contains any public IP address.</p>

<p>Here is the code which will do that for you:</p>

<pre><code>                AmazonEC2 ec2 = AWSClientFactory.CreateAmazonEC2Client();

                //Create instance request
                DescribeInstancesRequest request = new DescribeInstancesRequest();
                DescribeInstancesResponse response = ec2.DescribeInstances(request);

                //Create ip address request enumeration
                DescribeAddressesRequest daRequest = new DescribeAddressesRequest();
                DescribeAddressesResponse daResponse = ec2.DescribeAddresses(daRequest);
                var publicIps = from ips in daResponse.DescribeAddressesResult.Address select ips.PublicIp;

                //List of the instances which has public IP
                List&lt;RunningInstance&gt; publicIpInstances = new List&lt;RunningInstance&gt;();

                //Iterate over instances and check if they have public IP
                foreach (Reservation ri in response.DescribeInstancesResult.Reservation)                    
                    publicIpInstances.AddRange(ri.RunningInstance.Where(inst =&gt; publicIps.Contains(inst.IpAddress)));
</code></pre>
