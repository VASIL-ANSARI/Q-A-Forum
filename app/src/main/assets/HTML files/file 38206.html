<p><code>$( data ).appendTo</code> is the problem.   </p>

<p>From the documentation: "With .appendTo(), on the other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted into the target container."</p>

<p>In other words, <em>data</em> has to be an html element or html markup which will be inserted into another element.</p>
