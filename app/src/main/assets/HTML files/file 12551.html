<p>I think you have to use</p>

<pre><code>setAdapter(adapter); 
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>setListAdapter(adapter);
</code></pre>

<p>Just try... Hope it works..</p>

<p>setListAdapter() isn't a method you can call on an Activity (it is available on ListActivity but you're not using that). You're going to have to add a ListView into your layout (/res/layout/passwordscreen) and then find it and call setAdapter on that.</p>
