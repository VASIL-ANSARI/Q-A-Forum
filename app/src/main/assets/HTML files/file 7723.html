<p>Use Firebug or equivalent tool to ensure the request is being made successfully and that you are receiving a response.</p>

<p>My guess would be that since you are specifying an absolute url, the request is being seen as a cross-domain request. If the script you are requesting resides on the same domain the javascript is on, shorten the url to <code>/twitter/redirectFollow.php</code>, otherwise you will have to use a data-type of JSONP. <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">See docs</a></p>
