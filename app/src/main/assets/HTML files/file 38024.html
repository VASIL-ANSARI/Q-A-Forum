<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to force a Save As dialog automatically when a link is
  clicked via code from the server side, you have to send the file back
  through code using Response.TransmitFile(), Response.BinaryWrite() or
  streaming it into the Response.OutputStream and add a couple of custom
  headers to the output.</p>
  
  <p>The optimal way to do this is to use Response.TransmitFile() to
  explicitly send the file from your ASP.NET application and then add
  the Content Type and Content-Disposition headers. Note thought that
  Response.TransmitFile() in recent versions of IIS can only serve files
  out of the virtual folder hierarchy of the Web site or virtual. For
  files outside of the virtual path you have to stream into the
  OutputStream().</p>
  
  <p>Assuming your file does live inside of the folder hierarchy here's how
  you can force the Save As dialog for output sent with TransmitFile():</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>Response.ContentType = "image/jpeg";
Response.AppendHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=SailBig.jpg");
Response.TransmitFile(Server.MapPath("~/images/sailbig.jpg"));
Response.End();
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>This will cause a Open / Save As dialog box to pop up with the
  filename of SailBig.jpg as the default filename preset.</p>
