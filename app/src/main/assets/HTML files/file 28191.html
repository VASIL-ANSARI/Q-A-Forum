<p>Shame on you for even writing such a title to a question.</p>

<pre><code>html,body { height: 100%; width: 100%; }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>As to why removing the doctype makes it work, I honestly don't know. However, your body element has no height on it and therefore could potentially end up hiding things that overflow it's bounds (which are effectively <code>width: 100%; height: 0;</code>) and indeed it does this, although at strange places, which is why your image is sometimes cutoff.</p>

<p>I see that you already have the <code>html</code> height set to 100%, but you also need to set the body height to 100% as well.</p>
