<p>Adding hosting views with separate graphs to a top-level view is certainly the easiest way to do this. If this works in your app without running out of memory or significantly affecting performance, this is the recommended approach.</p>

<p>The alternative is a single hosting view and graph. Since you'll only have one plot area to work with, you'll need to adjust the plot space(s) used in each subgraph so the data for each one appears in the appropriate section of the graph. Use the <code>visibleRange</code> to limit the length of the axes to keep them separate. You'll also need to filter the data for each plot so it doesn't go outside the desired area.</p>
