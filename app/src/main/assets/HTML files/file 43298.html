<p><code>SmtpFailedRecipientException</code> Represents the exception that is thrown when the <code>SmtpClient</code> is not able to complete a Send or SendAsync operation to a particular recipient.  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.smtpfailedrecipientexception%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">MS Link</a></p>

<p>I assume it's an external SMTP client , so when sending  the mail
,it will not validate external mail address immediately. It is later after
the external node send back error message will it popup message sending
fail error. The SmtpClient component will close the communication with
server right after the message has been sent out, but not trace the
sequential message delivery status. <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/asp-net/answers/631019-smtpfailedrecipientexception-s-how-works" rel="nofollow">MS Answer</a></p>
