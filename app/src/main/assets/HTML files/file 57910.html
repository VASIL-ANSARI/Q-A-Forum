<p>tl;dr Don't link the third-party framework in your application target's <em>Build Phases</em>. Use <code>Link Frameworks Automatically</code> instead.</p>

<hr>

<p>To make this a little more clear, let me give an example. There is a third-party framework called CrashReporter.framework. The custom framework is called HockeySDK.framework (which links to CrashReporter.framework). Then I have my application called WeatherApp (which links to HockeySDK.framework).</p>

<pre><code>CrashReporter.framework  &lt;---
    ^                        |
    |                        |
    |                      X X X   NO! DONT'T LINK THIS!
HockeySDK.framework          |
    ^                        |
    |                        |
    |                        |
WeatherApp  -----------------
</code></pre>

<p>I <strong>do not</strong> link CrashReporter.framework in the <em>Link Binary With Libraries</em> section of <em>Build Phases</em> in the WeatherApp target (even though Weather app needs CrashReproter.framework to build). I go to the <em>Build Settings</em> of the WeatherApp target and ensure <code>Link Frameworks Automatically</code> (and <code>Enable Modules (C and Objective-C)</code> if on iOS) is set to <code>Yes</code>. </p>
