<p>In order to cover both cases, you might just need to add the following into your menu selection to be sure that it is covered.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
    switch (item.getItemId()) {
    case android.R.id.home:
        //Manually go up with a call.
        return true;
    default:
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }
}
</code></pre>
