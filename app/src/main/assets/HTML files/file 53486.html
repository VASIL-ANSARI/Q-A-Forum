<p>How about</p>

<pre><code>^.*?(\b\w+\b)(.*?\1).*?$
</code></pre>

<p>It matches a word (captures it), and the matches anything up to that same word (<code>\1</code> is a back reference to the first capture).</p>

<p>The result is two capture groups - first holds the actual word, and second - the rest up to and including the second word.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If you want to make sure there's only one word in between, and (as I assume) are interested in only the two words, this is an alternative solution:</p>

<pre><code>^.*?(\b\w+\b)[.,]\s*(\w+)\s*\1.*?$
</code></pre>

<p>It captures the first word in the same way, matches a <code>,</code> or a <code>.</code> followed by <strong>a</strong> word which in turn is followed by the first. It only captures the two words.</p>
