<p>Your paintComponent method appears to be doing too much and too little: too little in that it's not drawing Shapes, and too much in that it's trying to do things with the static boolean fields that it shouldn't. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"...and what to put in the paintComponent to store the shapes." </p>
</blockquote>

<p>this shouldn't be part of the paintComponent method. This method is for drawing items on the component and nothing more. It should not be used for program logic. The code for storing shapes should be in your mouse listener type code, not in paintComponent.</p>

<p>I think that all you need in paintComponent is simply this:</p>

<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    super.paintComponent(g);
    Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;
    for (Shape shape : shapes) {
        g2d.draw(shape); // !! added
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As a couple of side notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>you've got much too much static code within your A1 class, including static fields, and most all of it should be instance code, and most of the code within the main method should be removed and placed into a constructor. The main method should be very small.</li>
<li>You'll want to rename your Canvas class to something different as this creates a potential name clash with a core Java class, <code>java.awt.Canvas</code>, and might confuse others or even the compiler should you move this class to another package in the future.</li>
<li>You can combine your MouseListener and MouseMotionListener code into a single class that extends MouseAdapter. This will simplify your code, and allow you to avoid posting empty method stops.</li>
<li>Since your drawing selections are mutually exclusive, I would use JRadioButtons or JToggleButtons all held in a single ButtonGroup, so that the user can easily see what selection is currently active, and so that selection of one button turns off selection of all the others.</li>
</ul>
