<p>You could pretty quickly hack together a program that grabs the output of <code>rake routes</code> and then parses the output to put together a list of the URLs.</p>

<p>What I have, typically, done for load testing is to use a tool like <a href="http://webload.org" rel="nofollow">WebLOAD</a> and script several different types of user sessions (or different routes users can take).  Then I create a mix of user sessions and run them through the website to get something close to an accurate picture of how the site might run.</p>

<p>Typically I will also do this on a total of 4 different machines running about 80 concurrent user sessions to realistically simulate what will be happening through the application.  This also makes sure I don't spend overly much time optimizing infrequently visited pages and can, instead, concentrate on overall application performance along the critical paths.</p>
