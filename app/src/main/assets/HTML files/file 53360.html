<p>The only way to do this is to download the .deb file from the <a href="http://dl.hhvm.com/ubuntu/pool/main/h/hhvm/" rel="nofollow">repository</a> and install it as part of your script using <code>dpkg -i</code>. To do so, you require being able to run <code>sudo</code> as <code>dpkg -i</code> has to be run as root.</p>

<p>While doing this, remember that most Travis tests are run on Ubuntu 12.04, which only gets up to HHVM-3.6. You'll need to opt into the trusty beta to be able to run newer versions.</p>
