<p>I don't know how proficient you are in OpenLayers, but the project is certainly not underdocumented. There is an extensive api documentation and also numerous examples that should help to get you started.</p>

<p>But now back to your problem: likely, this is a projection issue. Panoramio returns WSG-84 (GPS) Coordinates for all the photos it found, and the openstreetmap baselayer of your map is in Spherical Mercator projection ('EPSG:900913').
So you have to convert the coordinates from WSG-84 to Spherical Mercator using something like</p>

<pre><code>var curPic = panoramio.photos[i];

var panLonLat = new OpenLayers.LonLat(curPic.longitude, curPic.latitude);
panLonLat.transform(new OpenLayers.Projection("EPSG:4326"), new OpenLayers.Projection('EPSG:900913'));
</code></pre>

<p>and then use the converted point for your geometry</p>
