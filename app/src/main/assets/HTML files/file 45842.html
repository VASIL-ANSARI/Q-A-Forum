<p>I would take the implementation provided in this answer:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538060/proper-use-of-the-idisposable-interface">Proper use of the IDisposable interface</a></p>

<p>And in derived types override the <code>Dispose(bool disposing)</code> method if the derived type needs to also dispose of stuff, remembering to call base. If it doesn't need to, then simply do nothing with the base implementation.</p>

<p>Make sure it makes sense to expose the need to call <code>Dispose</code> on this type's public contract, it could be a sign of a leaked abstraction (though not always).</p>

<p>This would at the very least be a good start.</p>
