<p><code>Sonar</code> will build your project and run Test cases for analyze code based on your rules. So if your test cases and build required more memory you will have to provide that. There are several options. First one is increase Heap size which you already tried. And also you can clear the build space and rebuild the source. If you don't want to tun test cases you can skip test cases to save memory. </p>
