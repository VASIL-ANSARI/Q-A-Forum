<p>nice name by the way. So I was in the same position a while ago. </p>

<p>use this for your get image method, just tweak it and use it to benefit you:</p>

<pre><code>public class ImageLoader {

    public BufferedImage load(String path){
        try {
            return ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(path));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        return null;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a been making a game that uses individual pixels to load those pixels and then put tiles where certain pixels are located in the map. If you would like to take my code snippet from there let me know and ill hook you up :P</p>
