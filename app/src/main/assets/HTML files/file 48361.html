<p>From the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#metadata" rel="nofollow" title="App Store Review Guidelines">App Store Review Guidelines</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developers who attempt to manipulate or cheat the user reviews or chart ranking in the App Store with fake or paid reviews, or any other inappropriate methods will be removed from the iOS Developer Program</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think offering the user to remove ads by writing a review would fall in the category of paid reviews.
Also I was not able to find a way of detecting an AppStore review.</p>
