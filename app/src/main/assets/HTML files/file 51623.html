<p>From the <a href="http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/anaconda_settings/#toc_5" rel="nofollow">Anaconda configuration docs</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>your Anaconda plugin will be able to lint, complete and analyze any package and module that your configured python interpreter is able to see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if you're importing local files like so:</p>

<pre><code>from ..lib import module
</code></pre>

<p>for example, you don't need to add anything special to the configuration, because as soon as you import the package Anaconda will analyze it (within several seconds, depending on size) and be ready to offer autocomplete. However, if you have a path like <code>/opt/company/modules/python</code> that is not already in Python's <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, you can add it to Anaconda using the <code>"extra_paths"</code> list:</p>

<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>"extra_paths":
[
    "/opt/company/modules/python"
]
</code></pre>

<p>and any modules contained therein will be seen and processed.</p>
