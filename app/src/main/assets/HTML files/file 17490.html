<p>In order to determine whether the images got corrupted or not, compare the images received by the server with the corresponding ones on your Android device.</p>

<p>In order to determine why the images got corrupted, you may run WireShark or tcpdump on the server and snoop an upload. Careful examination should reveal if the problem is</p>

<ul>
<li>within the server software (you see the complete image in the network traces), or </li>
<li>in the device or the network (you see a broken image in the network traces).</li>
</ul>

<p>You also may experiment with image sizes (in terms of bytes) and check if there is a size boundary from which on you see problems. That might give clues on where to look further</p>
