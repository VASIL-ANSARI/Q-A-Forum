<p>To paraphrase the code given:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set 2 variables to nothing. (This is so that there can be checks done later. <code>int?</code> could be used if you want to use <code>null</code> for one idea here.</li>
<li>Start loop through values.</li>
<li>Get next value.</li>
<li>If the minimum isn't set or the new value is lower than the minimum, replace the second lowest with the former lowest and lowest with the new value that was entered.</li>
<li>Otherwise, check if the new value isn't the same as the minimum and if the minimum isn't set or the entered value is lower than the second lowest then replace the second lowest with this new value.</li>
<li>Once the loop is done, if either minimum value isn't filled in then output there isn't such a value otherwise output the second lowest value.</li>
</ol>

<p>Imagine if you had to do this manually. You'd likely keep track of the lowest value and second lowest value as you went through the array and the program is merely automating this process. What is the problem?</p>

<hr>

<p>This is a rough translation of what your friend gave you that isn't that hard to translate to my mind.</p>

<pre><code>        int enteredValue;
        int? smallest = null, secondSmallest = null;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i = i + 1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("VpiÅ¡i " + i+1 + " Å¡tevilo: ");
            enteredValue = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            if (smallest==null || enteredValue&lt;smallest) {
                  secondSmallest=smallest;
                  smallest = enteredValue;
            } else if (enteredValue!=smallest &amp;&amp; enteredValue&lt;secondSmallest) {
                  secondSmallest= enteredValue;
            }
        }
</code></pre>
