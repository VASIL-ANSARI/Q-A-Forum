<p>basic problem is your system.out.println is outside the for loop, you are going to get at most 1 result, i've redone the basic structure for you below, </p>

<p>also I'm rusty with Java but equals operator I'm pretty sure is == not = (single = is assignment)</p>

<p>also what is splitText, you don't define it or assign its value</p>

<pre><code>if  (x==true){
  String[] Text = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Input string").split(null, 20);
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; Text.length; i++) {
    String memes = (Text[ i ]);
    Thread.sleep(500);
    System.out.println(splitText);
  }
}
</code></pre>
