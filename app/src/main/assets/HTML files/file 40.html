<p>There are three ways to do this, depending on your needs. You could use the old-school C way and call fopen/fread/fclose, or you could use the C++ fstream facilities (ifstream/ofstream), or if you're using MFC, use the CFile class, which provides functions to accomplish actual file operations.</p>

<p>All of these are suitable for both text and binary, though none have a specific readline functionality. What you'd most likely do instead in that case is use the fstream classes (fstream.h) and use the stream operators (&lt;&lt; and >>) or the read function to read/write blocks of text:</p>

<pre><code>int nsize = 10;
char *somedata;
ifstream myfile;
myfile.open("&lt;path to file&gt;");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);
myfile.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Note that, if you're using Visual Studio 2005 or higher, traditional fstream may not be available (there's a new Microsoft implementation, which is slightly different, but accomplishes the same thing).</p>
