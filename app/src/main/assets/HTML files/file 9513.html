<p>further reading tells me that pop3 doesn't support setting/getting these flags, only deleting messages.</p>

<p>it does seem that pop3 supports setting the flag (since i could see the flag had been set successfully in the webmail program) but could not subsequently read the flags state.</p>

<p>thankfully my mail server supports imap which does everything as expected. I just had to change my code from <code>mailSession.getStore("pop3")</code> to <code>mailSession.getStore("imap")</code>.</p>
