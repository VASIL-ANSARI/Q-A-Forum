<p>I'm not certain about the specifics on the Rackspace side of things that would result in this. Within excon the resolution to ip happens within <code>Excon::Socket#connect</code>. Not sure how much you know about the nitty-gritty of these things, but thought I would at least point you in that direction in case it might help: <a href="https://github.com/geemus/excon/blob/master/lib/excon/socket.rb#L167" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/geemus/excon/blob/master/lib/excon/socket.rb#L167</a></p>

<p>That just stays at the socket level at least at presently (we just look this up once at socket connect, and don't propagate it to the data hash). You shouldn't need to override this though (at least in my experience the default behavior is the right one). I'd probably just recommend filing the issue on github against fog at this point (<a href="https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/new" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/new</a>) so that I can point Rackspace folks at it.</p>
