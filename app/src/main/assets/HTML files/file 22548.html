<p>Ok, Im found the solution. I extensively revised My code.</p>

<p>The problem is this:</p>

<pre><code>    include ("conexion.php");
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason if you have the connetion parameters in other document this document sent the headers before the headers in this part:</p>

<pre><code>    header("Content-type: text/xml;charset=utf-8");
</code></pre>

<p>So you need to set this parameters in your grid php document and make sure that you sent the headers in this line.</p>

<p>And that's it... </p>

<p>So many people have this question problem maybe this is the solution for that. </p>
