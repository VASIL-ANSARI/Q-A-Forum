<p>Problem solved, stupid mistake, in IE developer tools I didn't look at the console. There I saw that a variable wasn't correctly defined... <em>epic facepalm</em>.</p>

<p>To be more precise:
My extension function for jQuery to change the placeholder text had a line:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).addClass(placeHolderStylingClass);
</code></pre>

<p>But the variable <em>placeHolderStylingClass</em> was not set in the function, this was a stupid copy/paste mistake from my setPlaceholder function.</p>
