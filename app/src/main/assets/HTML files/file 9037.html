<p>Yes - in the first approach, the <code>Thread</code> object will be eligible for garbage collection as soon as the underlying thread has completed.</p>

<p>In the second approach, if the instance of <code>Bar</code> is still <em>not</em> eligible for garbage collection, that will prevent the <code>Thread</code> object from being garbage collected. I doubt that that will have any impact on the underlying OS thread, mind you.</p>

<p>I wouldn't think about the GC implications though - I'd concentrate on readability. Do you need a reference to that background thread for some reason? If so, go with the second approach so that it's available to you. If you <em>don't</em> need it, it would be pointless having it as a field.</p>
