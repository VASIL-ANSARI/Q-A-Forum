<p>I have <em>no knowledge</em> about the library u have mentioned.I would just suggest u to use <strong>Sliding Drawer</strong>. Simply Because u want to show animation all u have to do is to add ur WebView inside the Sliding Drawer.All u have to do is to add <strong>slidinganimationclose</strong> for the 1st one and open the next accordingly.</p>
