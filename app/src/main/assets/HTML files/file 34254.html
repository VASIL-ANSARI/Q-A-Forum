<p>I Think I may have found it... 
The Line <code>jProgressBar1.setMaximum(SourceCode.getLineCount());</code> in the "goButtonActionPerformed() method" was originally used as I wanted this to count to a maximum, but not a percentage on the lines counting. 
After I was setting "progress()" to 100, the "Done" method was calling and ending the routine.
I changed this back to a percentage but left the line above in error. When I removed this, it is now working ok. Lesson learned eh?</p>
