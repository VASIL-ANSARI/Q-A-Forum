<p>Calculate using linear intercepts</p>

<pre><code>   y = mx + c
   y2 = gx + d
   mx + c = gx + d
   mx - gx = d - c
   x(m - g) = d - c
   x =&gt; (d-c)/(m-g)
</code></pre>

<p>Then test whether the returned value is in the domain of x. Once x is found, calculate y and test it's in the range of both the lazer and the rectangle</p>
