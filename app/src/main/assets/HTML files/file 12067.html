<p>Let me first say that in this answer, you may get more sympathy then fact.  I've been struggling with these same issues. While I was able to get reproducible results for a particular test, I found that the results varied according to whether or not I ran one versus multiple specs, and within or without spork. Sigh.</p>

<p>In the end, I found that 99.9% of my issues disappeared if I simply enabled caching in my test.rb file. That might sound odd, but after some thought it was "correct" for my application.  The great majority of my tests are <strong>not</strong> at the view/request layer, and for the few that are, doesn't it make sense to test under the same configurations that the user views?</p>

<p>While I was wrestling with this, I wrote a <a href="http://tech.thereq.com/post/13437077944/unit-testing-your-rails-3-1-caching-with-rspec">blog post</a> that contains some useful test helpers for testing caching.  You might find it useful.</p>
