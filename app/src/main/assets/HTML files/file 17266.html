<p>Found the answer... the problem was because I was trying to send two separate emails using the same attachments collection.</p>

<p>The email sending logic was in a function that was called like so:</p>

<pre><code>SendEmail(from, to, subject, body, attachments)

If SomethingOrOther Then
   SendEmail(from, someoneElse, subject, body, attachments)
End If
</code></pre>

<p>My (cheesy) workaround was to just create two attachments lists, one for the first call to SendEmail, another one for the second call.</p>
