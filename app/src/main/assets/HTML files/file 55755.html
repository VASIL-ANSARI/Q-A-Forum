<blockquote>
  <p>Which way to communicate is "the best" one for the described case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You only cite two options, since "Aidl" and "Binding" are the same thing. You use AIDL to describe and implement the client-side proxy and the server-side stub for cross-process service binding.</p>

<p>Given that you want call-and-response, binding is probably a better choice. Note, though, that there is no IPC approach that supports "complex objects" very well, outside of using <code>Parcelable</code>, <code>Serializable</code>, or converting the object graph into JSON or something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What happens when Service A wants to delegate/send a message to Service B and Service B is not running?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you call <code>startService()</code> or <code>bindService()</code>, Android forks a process for App B and creates an instance of the service (invoking its <code>onCreate()</code>) method. At that point, the behavior is the same as if the process and service had already been running.</p>
