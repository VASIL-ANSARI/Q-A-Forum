<p>If you want to copy (and possibly truncate) a C-style string, then I would use <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/strncpy" rel="nofollow">strncpy</a> instead of "strcpy()".</p>

<p>One limitation of strncpy() is that it will <em>not</em> null-terminate the string if the #/characters exactly equals the copy length.  This is by design, but it's a potential "gotcha" if you don't expect it.  Simply add a second statement that puts a NULL character at the final position:</p>

<pre><code>char first_ten_alphabet[10];
string str = "abcdefghijklnopqrstuvwxyz";

strncpy(first_ten_alphabet, str.c_str(), sizeof(first_ten_alphabet));
first_ten_alphabet[sizeof(first_ten_alphabet)-1] = '\0';
</code></pre>
