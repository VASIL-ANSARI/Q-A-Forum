<p>Type information does not exist at runtime with C++. (Except when enabling RTTI but it is still different than what you need)</p>

<p>A common idiom is to create a virtual <code>clone()</code> method that obviously clones the object which is usually in some prototypical state. It is similar to a constructor, but the concrete type is resolved at runtime.</p>

<pre><code>class Object
{
public:
    virtual Object* clone() const = 0;
};
</code></pre>
