<p>I'm not sure why your code doesn't work in FF3, but I got it to work by adding the domain to the beginning of the URL and also by removing the leading slash.</p>

<p>So, if it's possible for you to either add the domain or use relative paths in that location, it should work. For example, the generated line might look like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;input type="button" onclick="window.location='http://www.example.com/Authorized/Accounts/0/1/'+search.value" value="Search" /&gt;</code></p>
