<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2547737/1711796">Static methods are initialized in the order they are given in code</a>.</p>

<pre><code>public static final TheKing theKing = new TheKing();
private static final int this_year = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR);
</code></pre>

<p>So the above would initialize <code>theKing</code> first, which calls the constructor, which uses the uninitialized value of 0 of <code>this_year</code>. If you were to change it to:</p>

<pre><code>private static final int this_year = Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR);
public static final TheKing theKing = new TheKing();
</code></pre>

<p>it would work fine.</p>

<p>Or if you remove the <code>static</code>, <code>this_year</code> would get initialized as the object <code>theKing</code> is created.</p>
