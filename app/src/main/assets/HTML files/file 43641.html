<p>Take out the <code>sleep</code> command (you must <em>never</em> <code>sleep</code> the main thread - the Watchdog process will kill you dead, and besides, you are wrongly freezing the whole interface). Instead: show the alert, then use delayed performance (as in my <code>delay</code> utility <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24034544/dispatch-after-gcd-in-swift/24318861#24318861">here</a>) to play a sound.</p>

<p>(There are other problems with your code; in particular, you will also need to find a new way to play the sound twice, since you must not use <code>sleep</code>; this, too, can be accomplished using <code>delay</code> - nested.)</p>
