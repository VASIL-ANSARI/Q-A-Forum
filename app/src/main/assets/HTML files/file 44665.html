<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13833463/how-do-i-generate-a-random-hex-code-that-of-a-lighter-color-in-javascript">This stack answer</a> seems like it would work good for you. One such answer uses:</p>

<pre><code>var randomColor = (function lol(m, s, c) {
    return s[m.floor(m.random() * s.length)] +
        (c &amp;&amp; lol(m, s, c - 1));
})(Math, '3456789ABCDEF', 4);
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/tWyq6/27/" rel="nofollow">JS Fiddle</a> from the answer above.</p>

<p>Edit:
Change this line to change how light/dark you'd like the random color to be (changing to ABCDEF will make them lighter):</p>

<pre><code>})(Math, '3456789ABCDEF', 4);
</code></pre>
