<p>The Configuration file and the Settings are not the same thing. The configuration file is the one named <code>[Appname].exe.config</code> that should be in the same location as the application.</p>

<p>The settings are stored in the user store separately, and I'm not aware of any method to check if they exist by a file name anyway.</p>
