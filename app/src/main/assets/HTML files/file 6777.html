<p>Some tabs drivers use the mouse input message extra info to send, well, extra information. I think WACOM does this for sending pen pression.</p>

<p>This information can be queried using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644937%28v=VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">GetMessageExtraInfo Function</a></p>

<p>Maybe you should check if there's something interesting with your pad, but it's probably vendor specific, if anything is even available which is not certain.</p>
