<p>SQLFiddle doesn't work right now, but I'll try to explain you how to accomplish your goal.</p>

<p>First, you need to know the week for each <code>tint</code> date with WEEKOFYEAR() function. This value helps you to sum every week separately. Then, you can make a query like this: </p>

<pre><code>select WEEKOFYEAR(tin) as numWeek,
           DATE(tin) as dateJob, 
           DAYOFWEEK(tin) dayOfWeek,
           usr,
           job,
           (IF( ISNULL(tout), UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), UNIX_TIMESTAMP(tout) ) - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(tin)) as DiffInOut
    from wtime;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can group your data using with every field (numWeek, usr, dayOfWeek, dateJob and job) to get the detailed query:</p>

<pre><code>select numWeek,
       usr,
       dayOfWeek,
       datejob,
       job,
       sum(DiffInOut)
from
  (
    select WEEKOFYEAR(tin) as numWeek,
           DATE(tin) as dateJob, 
           DAYOFWEEK(tin) dayOfWeek,
           usr,
           job,
           (IF( ISNULL(tout), UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), UNIX_TIMESTAMP(tout) ) - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(tin)) as DiffInOut
    from wtime
  ) result
group by numWeek, usr, dayOfWeek, datejob, job
</code></pre>

<p>and later make an union to get only info per week..</p>

<pre><code>union
select numWeek,
       usr,
       dayOfWeek,
       null,
       null,
       sum(DiffInOut)
from
  (
    select WEEKOFYEAR(tin) as numWeek,
           NULL as dateJob, 
           8 dayOfWeek,
           usr,
           job,
           (IF( ISNULL(tout), UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), UNIX_TIMESTAMP(tout) ) - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(tin)) as DiffInOut
    from wtime
  ) result
group by numWeek, usr, dayOfWeek
order by numWeek, usr, dayOfWeek;
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that SQL Fiddle works for you.</p>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>| numWeek |   usr | dayOfWeek |                    datejob |     job | sum(DiffInOut) |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------------------------|---------|----------------|

</code></pre>

<p><strong>PD:</strong> Field <code>8 dayOfWeek</code> is a little trick to order week row correctly.</p>

<p><strong>PD2:</strong> My query with your SQL Fiddle example, throws this result:</p>

<pre><code>| numWeek |   usr | dayOfWeek |                    datejob |     job | sum(DiffInOut) |
