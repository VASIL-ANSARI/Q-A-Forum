<p>The button's layout properties override your frame settings, since by definition <code>viewWillLayoutSubvies</code> is called <em>before</em> the layout pass. You should just set </p>

<pre><code>self.topMenuView.menuBtn.hidden = YES;
</code></pre>

<p>and use autolayout constraints (in the interface builder or in the code) between <code>menuBtn</code>, <code>searchbarBtn</code> and <code>topMenuView</code> to make sure your buttons grow as needed. </p>

<p>As a general rule, we should strive to create interface so that views will correctly position themselves provided their inner state is correctly set and correct constraints are formed, without explicit corrections on our part.</p>
