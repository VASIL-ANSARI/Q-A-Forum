<p>If you already know the process names you want to go for, you can go with this.</p>

<pre><code>    Process[] processMame = Process.GetProcessesByName("yourProcess");
    if (processMame.Length &gt; 0)
    {
        /// You got your process here
        /// Do whatever you want 
    }


    Process[] processlist = Process.GetProcesses();
    foreach (Process process in processlist)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Process: {process.ProcessName} ID: {process.Id} Path: {process.MainModule.FileName}");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You might want to make sure your app runs on administrator mode to do so. If you want the executable path you'd find it here on <code>process.MainModule.FileName</code></p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>I tried out opening a running executable and I was right on the fact that I would end up in an access violation even if Im administrator as that file is being used by other process now. </p>

<p>My suggestion would be if you want to check out an existing process, kill/dispose it, open it and do whatever you're supposed to do and if you feel this is not harmless, you restore it back.</p>

<p>You might need to make sure that your app has administrator privileges through manifest defined <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756929.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<h3>For going for processes in current session:</h3>

<p>If you want to have the processes in current active session (current active user who is logged in), you might want to go for something like:</p>

<pre><code>    Process[] runningProcesses = Process.GetProcesses();
    var sessionId = Process.GetCurrentProcess().SessionId;

    var currentSessionProcesses = runningProcesses.Where(c =&gt; c.SessionId == sessionId).ToList();

    foreach (var process in currentSessionProcesses)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Process: {process.ProcessName} ID: {process.Id} Path: {process.MainModule.FileName}");
    }
</code></pre>
