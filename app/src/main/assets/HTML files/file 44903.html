<p>I'm afraid not. Here's a similar question:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10578803/upload-file-from-client-to-server-without-openfile-dialog">upload file from client to server without openFile dialog</a></p>

<p>The main issue is security. The browsers don't want to be a vector for viruses that would steal files from people's machines. </p>

<p>Your choices are limited to having users drag and drop files or select them from a dialog. Chrome also has a feature which will let users drag and drop folders not just files (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10578803/upload-file-from-client-to-server-without-openfile-dialog">upload file from client to server without openFile dialog</a>), but i think still only Chrome supports that and the user still has to at least choose or drag the folder.</p>
