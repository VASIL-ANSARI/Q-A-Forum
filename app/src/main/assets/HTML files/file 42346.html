<p>In the first, it looks your app.js should be started with something like:</p>

<pre><code>var app = ons.bootstrap('store', ['onsen'])

app.controller('StoreController', function($scope) {
...
});
...
</code></pre>

<p>The list of items should be defined as a attribute of $scope variable of StoreController. Otherwise it wouldn't be accessible by angular directives. </p>

<p>Ons-navigator element should be inside of element block managed with StoreController. I would move "ng-controller='StoreController as store'" attribute to body element.</p>

<p>Another mistake i met is ons-template element should be defined outside of ons-navigator block.</p>
