<p>According to Mandrill support:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you noticed, the render API call does not currently support
  Handlebars templates. While I can't provide an exact ETA for when the
  render API call will work with Handlebars, I can tell you that it's
  something that our developers are working to extend support for very
  soon.</p>
  
  <p>I would suggest keeping an eye on our <a href="https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/" rel="nofollow">Mandrill API Documentation</a>
  as that support will be noted there as an additional parameter for the
  call as soon as it is supported.</p>
