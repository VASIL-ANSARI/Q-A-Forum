<p>It's not binding to nil the object if you have already released it and if you are releasing means that you are not using ARC.Releasing the object simple means that its count is decreasing by 1 or zero in some case and still you can perform operation on it but the outcome would be nothing.(compiler doesn't give error message).</p>

<p>nil ensures that all the reference from that object to other objects are compensated or nil.(A good programming practice).</p>
