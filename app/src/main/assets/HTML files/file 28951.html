<p><a href="http://iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/27065-how-to-dynamically-create-text-field-uitextfield.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a>'s a tutorial on how to create UITextField from code.</p>

<p>The way you should implement it is, add the first text field, set it's delegate to self, and in the textFieldDidBeginEditing: method, you create another text field, sets it's delegate and create a button next to it. If you want to delete it, I would suggest adding the same tag for both UITextField and it's respective delete UIButton, then when a button is tapped, remove all views with that tag from the superview.</p>

<p>I would suggest trying everything step by step:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a UITextField from code</li>
<li>Creating UIButton from code</li>
<li>Setting a tag to UIView (superclass of both UIButton and UITextField).</li>
<li>Implementing UITextField delegate method.</li>
<li>Adding a custom method to a UIButton (delete method).</li>
<li>Remove UIView from view based on tag.</li>
</ul>
