<p>Yes, you can have multiple main queue context mocs, for exactly the reason you say - you create a temporary editing context for editing data which is then saved or discarded depending on user action. </p>

<p>As for mixing and matching with your operation queue contexts - that shouldn't be a problem. If you're merging back to the parent context, then any child contexts will pick up that data the next time they fetch. </p>
