<p>The Rapid Application Development (RAD) in Alfresco SDK is delivered by the spring loaded library.</p>

<p>Long story short, you need to run your project using the shipped OOTB run.sh / run.bat depending on your OS.</p>

<p>The run script will check if the spring-loaded jar is already present in your repo, run profile setup if it is not present to go fetch it, and then run <code>mvn integration-test -Prun</code> or <code>mvn install -Prun</code>, I do not remember which is called on the script but it should be one of those two</p>

<li>Please note that <a href="https://www.alfresco.com/blogs/developer/2016/03/04/introducing-alfresco-sdk-2-2/" rel="nofollow">RAD is not available in SDK-2.2</a> as it is not compatible with it and would prevent the repo from starting</li>
<li>SDK 2.2 is only available for alfresco 5.1.x code base (and it is the only viable option for developing 5.1.x extensions)</li>
