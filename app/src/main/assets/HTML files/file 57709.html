<p>Seems like your JAR contains native libraries that were not built for Android (but rather Linux, BSD, SunOS). You should look for JAR that contains ELFs (*.so files) that were built with Android NDK.</p>

<p>I'm not sure, but probably <a href="https://github.com/java-native-access/jna/tree/master/lib/native" rel="nofollow">here</a> you can find proper native binaries.</p>
