<p>The operating system started the application.</p>

<p>You did not necessarily start any processes. The determination of whether a new process is required, or whether the required app is already running, is handled by the operating system.</p>

<p>However, since your automation tool presumably knows the package(s) being tested, you should be able to use <code>ActivityManager</code> to find information about those processes and <code>PackageManager</code> to kill them (if they are in the background and you hold the proper permission).</p>
