<p>You have already found the answer. If you just want to visit, you can use filter with a predicate that always returns true; if you are super defensive you can use any predicate and use an or function with an alwaysTrue in the filter itself; just add the <code>or</code> at the end to avoid shortcircuiting. </p>

<p>The problem is that even though I agree that conceptually Predicate and Consumer are different since a Predicate should be as stateless as possible and not have side effects while a consumer is only about the side effects, in practice the only syntactic difference is that one returns a boolean (that can be ignored) and the other void. If Guava had a Consumer, it would need to either duplicate several of the methods that take a Predicate to also take a Consumer or have Consumer inherit from Predicate.  </p>
