<p>You can just define an <code>extern</code> pointer somewhere in the kernel (say, in the <code>sockets.c</code> file where you're going to use it).  Initialise it to <code>NULL</code>, and include a declaration for it in some appropriate header file.</p>

<p>In the part of the code that does the <code>copy_from_user()</code>, allocate space for the array using <code>kmalloc()</code> and store the address in the pointer.  Copy the data into it.  You'll also want a mutex to be locked around access to the array.</p>

<p>The memory allocated by <code>kmalloc()</code> will persist until freed with <code>kfree()</code>.</p>
