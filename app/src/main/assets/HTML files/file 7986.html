<p>Your record isn't loaded in the first place. To check if it's loaded, do:</p>

<pre><code>if ($inquiry-&gt;loaded()){...
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you can check what query has been run by doing:</p>

<pre><code>echo $inquiry-&gt;last_query();
</code></pre>

<p>So you can manually check what exactly is being returned to ORM.</p>

<p>The main problem here is that you're using <code>save()</code> instead of being more strict and using <code>create()</code> / <code>update()</code>. If you used <code>update()</code>, ORM would throw an exception complaining about the record not being loaded.</p>

<p>Save is basically a proxy to these methods, relying on the loaded state.</p>

<p>(I assume that you're using Kohana 3.1 since 3.0 ORM doesn't have separate update / create methods at all)</p>
