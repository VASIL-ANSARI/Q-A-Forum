<p>I would go with some version of the second option. Basically this is a variation of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx" rel="nofollow" title="MVVM">MVVM</a> pattern which is considered the "right" way to do WPF/Silverlight code. Basically you should have a ModelView object for each "screen" (View) that wraps the model and exposes the model in a format specific to the View so it does exactly what the View needs and NO MORE.</p>
