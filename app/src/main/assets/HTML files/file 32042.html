<p>If you are on a work group with a PC named SERVER and another PC named CLIENT, you have to choose what security you are going to use.  STANDARD vs NT AUTHENTICATION.</p>

<p>First, did you check to see if the server is active on the default port?</p>

<p>Did you try the following commands on the server from a command shell.</p>

<pre><code>cd c:\temp
netstat -a -n -o &gt; netstat.txt
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Search for port 1433, is it open and listening?</strong>  </p>

<p>Second, did you make sure that TCP/IP is enabled for both the server and native client.  Disable named pipes.  Make sure shared memory is enabled.</p>

<p>I assume you can connect to the engine logged onto the SERVER via SSMS.  <strong>Correct?</strong></p>
