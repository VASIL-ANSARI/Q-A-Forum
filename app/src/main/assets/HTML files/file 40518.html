<p>It seems Apple changed this recently so that the app knows whether you are using Sandbox or Production based on how the app was deployed. It wasn't that way before.</p>

<p>"Store Kit connects to the sandbox environment when you launch your application from Xcode, from your test device (iOS), or from the Finder (OS X). It connects to a production environment for applications that were downloaded from the App Store."</p>
