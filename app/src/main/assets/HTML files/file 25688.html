<p>You dont need to use use hashmac, but just hash like sha256. Point in hashmack is that is used when key is used to authenticate message, but it is not needed for password salting, (hashmac takes extra parameter that is key)</p>

<p>All you need is </p>

<pre><code>sha256(password + salt)
</code></pre>
