<p>No way. I've just read in the documentation, that trailing zeros are not accepted. From the Documentation at <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Working+with+Dates" rel="nofollow">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Working+with+Dates</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can optionally include fractional seconds if you wish, although trailing zeros are not allowed and any precision beyond milliseconds will be ignored</p>
