  <p>Error message appearing in console clearly says that, <code>services</code>
  dependency isn't exists in the module.</p>

<p>You have injected incorrect service name in <code>maincontroller</code> controller factory function, basically you were trying to to inject <code>services</code>(module name) instead of <code>xrmservice</code>(service name)</p>

<pre><code>function ($scope, services, utils) {
</code></pre>

<p>should be</p>

<pre><code>function ($scope, xrmservice, utils) {
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Additional</strong></p>

<p>Do follow Inline Array annotation of DI, as you were already used the same in your <code>xrmservice</code> service JS file, so that in future you don't need to go back and change that when you face javascript minification related issues.</p>

<p><strong>Controller</strong></p>

<pre><code>ctrls.controller('maincontroller', [ '$scope', 'xrmservice', 'utils',
    function ($scope, xrmservice, utils) {

         //code goes here
         //....
    };
}]);
</code></pre>
