<p>These curly braces define an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/anonymousclasses.html" rel="nofollow">anonymous inner class</a>.</p>

<p>This allows you to be able to override <code>public</code> and <code>protected</code> methods of the class you are initiating. You can do this with any non-<code>final</code> class, but is most useful with abstract classes and interfaces, which can only be initiated this way.</p>

<p>(To qualify that last sentence, interfaces with only one non-<code>default</code> method can be initiated using lambda statements in Java 8, circumventing this design method.)</p>
