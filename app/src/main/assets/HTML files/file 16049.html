<p>Let me suggest something quite different.</p>

<p>Building a custom solution would not be excessively hard for an experienced programmer, but it is probably impossible for an inexperienced or even intermediate programmer to produce something robust and reliable.  </p>

<p>Have you considered a DBMS?</p>

<p>For small data sets it will all be cached in memory.  As it grows, the DBMS will have some very sophisticated caching/paging techniques.  You get goodies like sorting/prioritisation, synchronisation/sharing for free.</p>

<p>A really well-written custom solution will be much faster than a DBMS, but will have huge costs in developing and maintaining the custom solution.  Spend a bit of time optimising and tuning the DBMS and it starts looking pretty fast and will be very robust.</p>

<p>It may not fit your needs, but I'd suggest having a long hard look at a DBMS before you reject it.</p>
