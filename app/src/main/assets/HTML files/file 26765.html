<p>This looks a bit odd:</p>

<p><code>return array(
            array('author.name, university.name, ... ', 'safe', 'on'=&gt;'search'),</code></p>

<p>Rules for these attributes name should be in their own class, i guess. I don't think you can define validation rules for another model in a model Class. I think this will make Yii think there's a database column called 'author.name'.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<p>you have this code:</p>

<p><code>'$data-&gt;university-&gt;author-&gt;nome'</code>. Shouldn't it be <code>-&gt;name</code> ? </p>

<p>Add the error in your native language as you see it too, please.</p>
