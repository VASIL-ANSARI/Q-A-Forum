<p>Short answer: It does not matter if you return or not.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-promise-constructor" rel="nofollow">spec</a> tells us that the return value of the executor is not used. It is only checked if the call returned an abrupt completion. (throwing an Error causes an abrupt completion )If a abrupt completion happend the promise is rejected. </p>
