<p>SpringVaadinIntegration, that you probably use, does not require all elements to be @Components, only UI has to be annotated.</p>

<p>Your wizard and it's steps should not be components in this case, if you really need to inject dependencies into them you can use @Configurable annotation, which allowes to inject dependencies to classes not managed by Spring (some more configuration needed to make it work). Just create wizard and steps as new objects when you need them.</p>
