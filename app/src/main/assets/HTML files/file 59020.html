<p>There are no correct answer on this question. When you call <code>Task.Run(..)</code> - you pass your action to Thread Pool, which has own scheduler. That scheduler will decide when it will run your action. So, it can run several as parallel, but, sometimes not. If you really want to run something parallel, you should use <code>Thread</code> or something like Parallel Extensions.</p>

<p><strong>Upd.</strong> To start separate thread you can use </p>

<pre><code>var thread = new Thread((() =&gt; { /*...*/ }));
thread.Start();
</code></pre>

<p>BUT! Be aware that for short-time operations and when you have to run many tasks - use Threads is not a good choise. In that cases <code>Task.Run</code> - will better. In common, I suggest to use Threads only for long-running calculation actions. </p>
