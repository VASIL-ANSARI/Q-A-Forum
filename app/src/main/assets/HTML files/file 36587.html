<p>I have had the same problem debugging some of our older scripts that make extensive use of the <code>eval()</code> function.
This causes many scripts to be displayed within the <a href="https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Script_Panel#Script_Location_Menu" rel="nofollow">Script Location Menu</a>. (Each dynamically generated script is represented there.)</p>

<p>A possible solution, given that it was caused by the number of files in my instance, might be to see if you can bypass the problem entirely by utilizing fewer source files for the same code. Using a 'built' version of whatever frameworks you use might alleviate the problem. (Particularly if they still are debug-able in a built form.)</p>

<p>If that does not work, you might try debugging using Firefox' built-in debugger (available via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>. (Or switch to another browser to do the debugging, but that is obviously a far less desirable solution.)</p>
