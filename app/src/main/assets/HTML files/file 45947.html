<p>So...for those who had the same problem, the answer is nothing like what I expected, but it seems to be the right answer.</p>

<p>It looks like my Samsung Galaxy S3 is at fault for the error right now.</p>

<p>Tested both the application I work on and the test application on my Samsung and on my Motorola.The Motorola doesn't trigger any error, while the Samsung does.</p>

<p>The only problem is that before I make a fresh reinstall of the AS ,the Motorola was getting the same error.</p>

<p>I will consider this as the right answer at this moment, but if things change and I encounter the problem again,I will be back with fresh information.</p>

<p>Thank you for the help ,to those who replied.</p>
