<p>Your situation is different from mine, but a similar solution may be in order.</p>

<p>Again, because Android will destroy and recreate on an orientation change I initially had issues with Async tasks doing network communication. Obviously I shouldn't be creating new requests on every orientation change when the first one is still executing.</p>

<p>To save some network usage and headaches I just 'handle' the orientation change myself. By placing this code in your AndroidManifest.xml </p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:name=".whatever" android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you allow Android to keep the current context, with views and variables etc. What happens is the layouts will resize themselves but if you designed correctly then you should be ok.</p>

<p>AFAIK the only thing I am preventing Android from doing is using specialized layouts based on the orientation of the device (which I don't need) and so far I have not been hit by the forewarned impending doom. </p>
