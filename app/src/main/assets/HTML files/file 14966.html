<p>I'm not sure what this exception tries to tell. I think that EF can only apply the ?? operator to a mapped object, because everything must be translated into SQL. It has not information of CompanyModels, so it does not know what to do with it.</p>

<p>If so, I think you can solve it by first setting a property, say A, like this:</p>

<pre><code>...
AddressTwo = x.address_2,
A = x.a1.FirstOrDefault() ?? x.a2.FirstOrDefault() ?? 
    x.a3.FirstOrDefault() ?? x.a4.FirstOrDefault(),
...
</code></pre>

<p>and giving the <code>OfficeModels</code> class a Company property like this:</p>

<pre><code>public CompanyModels Company
{
    get
    {
        return A != null ? new CompanyModels {Id = A.id, Name = A.name} : null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(I got a similar query working).</p>

<p>As for the second question: EF can not handle enums, so you'll have to work with integers there. Look around here at Stack Overflow for EF + enum work-arounds.</p>
