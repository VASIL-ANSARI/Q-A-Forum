<p>Look at the Servlet 3.0 Async API. In particular, <code>ServletRequest.startAsync()</code> will return you an <code>AsyncContext</code> object which you can "hand off to your own machinery", and then return from your servlet doGet()/doPost()/etc. without terminating the connection.</p>

<p>There are then various patterns for sending data back to the client. I believe your "own machinery" can just fetch the <code>ServletResponse</code> from the <code>AsyncContext</code> and write to it. Another approach is to call <code>dispatch()</code> on the <code>AsyncContext</code> which will cause your doGet()/doPost() method to be called again.</p>
