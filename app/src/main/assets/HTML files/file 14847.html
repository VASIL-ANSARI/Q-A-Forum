<p>Aggregate functions (<code>COUNT(), AVG(), SUM(),</code> etc) cannot appear in the <code>WHERE</code> clause, owing to when they are calculated.  Instead, they belong in a <code>HAVING</code> clause:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    customers.customerNumber as 'Customer ID',
    customers.customerName as 'Customer Name',
    count(orders.orderNumber) as 'Total Orders Placed'
from customers
left join orders on customers.customerNumber = orders.customerNumber
group by
    customers.customerNumber
HAVING count(orders.orderNumber) &gt; 3
order by 
    3 asc
</code></pre>
