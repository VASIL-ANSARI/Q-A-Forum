<blockquote>
  <p>To "present" an application to the user, we need a least one of its activities to be in resumed state, and for this we need the underlying Linux process up and running, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few ways in which the user can see an app's UI without the app having a currently running process, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The app can have an app widget on the home screen</p></li>
<li><p>The app can have a <code>Notification</code> in the status bar, or on a Wear device</p></li>
<li><p>The app can have an entry in the recent-tasks list</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My interpretation is that "applications may seem present" refers to something like these.</p>
