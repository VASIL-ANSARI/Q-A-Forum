<p>Measure the elapsed time between sending the request and getting back the response.  Then, divide that value by 2.  That gives you a rough value of one-way latency.  If you add that to the time value from the server, you'll be closer to the true server time.</p>

<p>Something like this should work:</p>

<pre><code>function syncTime() {
    // Set up our time object, synced by the HTTP DATE header
    // Fetch the page over JS to get just the headers
    console.log("syncing time")
    var r = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var start = (new Date).getTime();

    r.open('HEAD', document.location, false);
    r.onreadystatechange = function()
    {
        if (r.readyState != 4)
        {
            return;
        }
        var latency = (new Date).getTime() - start;
        var timestring = r.getResponseHeader("DATE");

        // Set the time to the **slightly old** date sent from the 
        // server, then adjust it to a good estimate of what the
        // server time is **right now**.
        systemtime = new Date(timestring);
        systemtime.setMilliseconds(systemtime.getMilliseconds() + (latency / 2))
    };
    r.send(null);
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Interesting aside</em>:  John Resig has a <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/accuracy-of-javascript-time/">good article</a> on the accuracy of Javascript timing.<br>
  It shouldn't cause a problem in this case, since you're only concerned about your time being off by ~1 second.  A 15 ms difference shouldn't have much effect.</p>
