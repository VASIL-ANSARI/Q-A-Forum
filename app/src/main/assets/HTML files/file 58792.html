<p>If you disable a control, its children are disabled. Since a <code>StackPanel</code> is not interactive, there is no reason to disable it other than to disable its interactive children. </p>

<p>If you want to enable a control A while its parent B is disabled, you can't do that. B cannot be the parent if you want to enable A while B is disabled. </p>

<p>For a workaround, you can put them both in a <code>Grid</code>, with the <code>TextBox</code> defined last, to superimpose the <code>TextBox</code> on top of the <code>StackPanel</code>. Then it will be within the <code>StackPanel</code>'s area but it won't be a child of the <code>StackPanel</code>. </p>
