<p>This is probably way too late, but just did it with jQuery myself.</p>

<p>In your .js or bottom of your template:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $("img").addClass("img-responsive");
});
</code></pre>

<p>and it will use your Bootstrap <em>img-responsive</em> class for all images that were added in the editor.</p>
