<p><code>0xc0000005</code> is an access violation exception, something in the code is trying to access memory that doesn't belong to it (or doesn't exist).</p>

<p>Since <code>mscorwks.dll</code> is part of .Net, (I think) and will have been thoroughly tested, both by Microsoft and their "field testers" (i.e., users), it's more likely to be a problem in your <code>xxx.exe</code> application.</p>

<p>You might want to try running it under a debugger so you can more easily figure out exactly what the problem is. Debugging is usually more revealing than post-mortem analysis, <em>especially</em> for a generic problem like this that could have a thousand different causes.</p>
