<p>For what you are describing, you just need to set the form's Autoscroll property to true. (It is under the "Layout" section). Right-click on the form and select "Properties"</p>

<p>This will add scroll bars if the form doesn't fit into the current window size. No code is required. The scroll bars will only appear when there is a control outside the current view.</p>

<hr>

<p>Reading your description again, what you might be looking for is a large panel in your form. Add a Panel to your form and make set the location to 0,0 and the size to 992,1403. Then add your controls to the panel. Don't forget to set the form's Autoscroll as mentioned above.</p>
