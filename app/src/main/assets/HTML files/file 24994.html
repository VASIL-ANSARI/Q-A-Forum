<p>What you need is a join.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT table.column_in_table
FROM table
INNER JOIN table_with_same_values
ON table.column_in_table = table_with_same_values.column_in_that_table;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm still not clear what you're trying to ask. Your question is a bit verbose. Some additional info <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
