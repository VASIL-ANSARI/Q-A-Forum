<p>I don't think there's such a thing as a <em>defacto</em> templating system for Python, there's quite a wide variety of them.</p>

<p>Personally, I haven't tried out Cheetah yet, but had some very successful experiences with <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/" rel="nofollow">Jinja2</a>, and there's also alot of buzz around <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/" rel="nofollow">Mako</a>. Both of these are more focused on generating HTML code, but there's really no impediment on using them for anything else. 
I would go with the one that provides the most comfortable syntax for what you're used to.</p>
