<blockquote>
  <p>server thinks 'tweets' in interests/tweets is an ID, so it cannot find an ID with value 'tweets', but I cant figure why is it searching that url when I gave it interests/:id/tweets</p>

<p>That's because by calling the <code>query</code> method on your <code>Tweets</code> service you don't supply an <code>id</code>. In your controller you invoke it like that:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.tweets = Tweets.query({id: 4});
</code></pre>
