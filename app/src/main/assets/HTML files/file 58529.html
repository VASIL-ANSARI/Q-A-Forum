<p>After the redirect a request <strong>different</strong> than the POST one for which the email was sent will be served.</p>

<p>So you need to <strong>persist</strong> the information about the email being sent across requests, saving it in the POST request handler code and retrieving it in the subsequent GET request handler code (be it the redirected one or any other one for that matter).</p>

<p>To persist the info you can, for example, use the user's session (if you already have one, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37134540/passing-data-between-pages-in-a-redirect-function-in-google-app-engine?noredirect=1">Passing data between pages in a redirect() function in Google App Engine</a>), or GAE's memcache/datastore/GCS. </p>

<p>Once the info is retrieved you can use it any way you wish.</p>
