<p>Well you could use the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request2" rel="nofollow">HTTP_Request2</a> PEAR package. It is quite good and supports all HTTP-methods. I guess I call this the minimal-invasive solution.</p>

<p>If you want to use cURL there is another way (untested, but it should work):</p>

<p>Edit <code>/var/cpanel/easy/apache/profile/makecpphp.profile.yaml</code> and search for the entries with "Curl" in it. Just change the "0" to "1". After saving the file you should be able re-compile the cPanel PHP with <code>/scripts/makecpphp</code></p>
