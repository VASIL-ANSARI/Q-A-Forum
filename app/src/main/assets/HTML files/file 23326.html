<p>Mhh, since you use OpenCV you may be interessted in this approach which is based on matrix manipulation on pixel scale:</p>

<p>1) Create a binary picture (black/white), therefore you initialize a black picture (or just a zero-matrix of desired size).</p>

<p>2) Since you already got your points unsorted (and therefore the matrix indices), you can do a for loop. So for every point you change the color of the pixel in the binary image to white. If you have to take care of memory you can use a sparse matrix.</p>

<p>3) To get the sorted list in x or in y you just walk trough the corresponding row/column of your binary image and return the column/row of every white pixel.</p>

<p>As a result you end up with a nice binary image and your sorted points.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Since you want to do some averaging in one component, this can be handelt by a boolean expression such that you set one coodinate within the desired range to the specific value. A second solution would be, that you rotate your input image before extracting the points. In OpenCV rotations are already implemented, you only have to find out the angle.</p>
