<p>See the below modification. I added variables to track the indices of the min and max. At the end of your loop you can simply print out <code>maxIndex1</code>, <code>maxIndex2</code>, <code>minIndex1</code>, and <code>minIndex2</code>.</p>

<pre><code>double max = m[0][0];
double min =  m[0][0];

//declare variables to track the indices of the min and max
int maxIndex1 = -1;
int maxIndex2 = -1;
int minIndex1 = -1;
int minIndex2 = -1;

System.out.println("The matrix is : ");
for(int i = 0; i &lt; m.length; i++)
{
    for ( int j = 0; j &lt; m[i].length; j++ )
    {
        System.out.printf("   " + "%6.1f " , m[i][j]);
        if (m[i][j] &gt; max)
        {
            max = m [i][j]; 
            //record the indices of the new max
            maxIndex1 = i;
            maxIndex2 = j;  
        }  
        else if (m[i][j] &lt; min)
        {
            min = m [i][j];
            //record the indices of the new min
            minIndex1 = i;
            minIndex2 = j;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you have two values that are equal and are tied for the max value in the array, this will only record one of the two. If you wanted to record the positions of all ties for min / max, you could change this to save a list of co-ordinates instead of a single co-ordinate.</p>
