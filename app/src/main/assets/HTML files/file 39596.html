<p>They way you're calling it <em>should</em> work properly, and I don't know why it isn't. Perhaps Eclipse is trying to accept arguments in an odd way that your batch script handles correctly but <code>subprocess.call()</code> doesn't, but that's entirely conjecture on my part.</p>

<p>As a alternative, you can try calling it with the <code>shell=True</code> argument and make your argument list a string instead:</p>

<pre><code>call_string = "C:/eclipse/eclipsec -nosplash --launcher.suppressErrors -application org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.core.headlessbuild -data {} -import {}".format(workspace_dir, project_dir))

subprocess.call(call_string, shell=True)
</code></pre>

<p>This will cause your default shell to parse the arguments instead of doing it natively in Python, which is very similar to your batch script workaround.</p>
