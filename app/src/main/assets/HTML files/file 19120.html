<p>The event object contains a "popup" attribute that has a private attribute called "_source" which is the object that the popup is bound to (i.e. the marker).  Since _source is supposed to be private this doesn't seem like the right way but I'm not sure how else to do it.</p>

<pre><code>map.on('popupopen', function(e) {
  var marker = e.popup._source;
});
</code></pre>
