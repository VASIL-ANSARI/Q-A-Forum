<p>you can play with the string functions</p>

<p>idea is  get the last char from your projectB :</p>

<p>if you have  'task1', the last char is '1'
then you can create a new char'A' by  ASC code of '1' + 16
after that you can replace the old string or make new string 'taskA'    </p>

<p>a little lazy did no find the exact functions you need lol</p>
