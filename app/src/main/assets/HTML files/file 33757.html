<pre><code>$array = explode("|", $_COOKIE['cart']); 
foraech($array as &amp; $element) {
   $element = explode(",", $element);
}

// example - echo an image
echo $array[1][3]
</code></pre>

<p>but to be honest you should keep it in <code>$_SESSION</code>. you can store arrays, objects, long strings etc. there and user is not able to change its contents</p>

<li><p><strong>Cookies are not good for storing complex data</strong></p></li>

<li><p><strong>There is limit 4096 bytes per one cookie</strong></p></li>
</ul>
