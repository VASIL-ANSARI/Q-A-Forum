<p>Binary search only works on sorted arrays. It is not finding the value:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If value is not found and value is less than one or more elements in array, a negative number which is the bitwise complement of the index of the first element that is larger than value. If value is not found and value is greater than any of the elements in array, a negative number which is the bitwise complement of (the index of the last element plus 1).</p>
