<p><strong>First assuming you care about maintaining order:</strong> here's the way I tend to do it if I'm using a list-comp:</p>

<pre><code>seen = set()
myList2 = [x for x in myList1 if x not in seen and not seen.add(x)]
</code></pre>

<p>Or alternately</p>

<pre><code>from collections import OrderedDict
myList2 = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(myList1))
</code></pre>

<p>Both of these approaches are O(n).  You have to be careful when doing this operation not to make your algorithm O(n**2) by doing repeated membership tests (or <code>index</code> searches) against a <code>list</code>.</p>

<p>If you <em>don't</em> care about order, you really just want to just do:</p>

<pre><code>mySet = set(myList1)
</code></pre>
