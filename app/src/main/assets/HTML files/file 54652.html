<p>It looks like you using underscore js functions but you haven't included the library, so once you include the library the code will work. You can add this line inside head tag.</p>

<p><code>&lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

<p>Based on what you wanted i have created a fiddle.</p>

<p>CSS was written using SCSS preprocessor in the link you shared,  but I am not sure if plunkr supports SCSS, so i converted it to plain css and now everything works fine. </p>
