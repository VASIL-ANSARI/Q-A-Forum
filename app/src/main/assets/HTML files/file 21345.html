<p>You might try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>create procedure [dbo].[sp_Search]
   @Bool1 bit = null, 
   @Bool2 bit = null,
   @Bool3 bit = null,
   @SearchTerm nvarchar(30)
as
begin
   select 
        CompanyID,
        CompanyName,
        Label,
        Bool1,
        Bool2,
        Bool3    
    from Contract Companies
    where (CompanyName like @SearchTerm or Label like @SearchTerm)
        and (Bool1 = @Bool1 or @Bool1 is null)
        and (Bool2 = @Bool2 or @Bool2 is null)
        and (Bool3 = @Bool3 or @Bool3 is null)
end
</code></pre>

<p>This will get matching records for each bool when present, and all records otherwise.</p>

<p>It is noted that this <a href="http://sqlinthewild.co.za/index.php/2009/03/19/catch-all-queries/" rel="nofollow">may not be the best performing method</a> of dynamically checking values, but they're bits here (<a href="http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/12888/should-i-index-a-bit-field-in-sql-server">often not indexed</a>) and I think it fits very elegantly.  There are alternatives discussed in that article.</p>
