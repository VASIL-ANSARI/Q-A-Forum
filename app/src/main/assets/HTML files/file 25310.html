<p>Yes, it's utterly vulnerable. In <code>$_FILES</code>, the following parameters are under <strong>USER</strong> control:</p>

<pre><code>['type']
['name']
</code></pre>

<p>it is beyond trivial to forge an upload, allowing such things as:</p>

<pre><code>['type'] = 'image/jpeg';
['name'] = 'nasty_hacking_script.php';
</code></pre>

<p>and boom, they're through your (laughable) security. Since you're allowing the user-defined file extension to get through your system, and only doing a trivial time-based renaming, you'll end up with something like</p>

<pre><code> 1234567890.php
</code></pre>

<p>in your site's document root. Given the name is time-based, it's also trivial for the attacker to simply poke at your server and guess what the exact time-of-upload was, e.g.</p>

<pre><code> for($i = 1234567800; $i &lt;= 124000000; $i++) {
     see_if_url_exists("$i.php");
 }
</code></pre>

<p>until they find their script. Now they have <strong>TOTAL</strong> control of your site, and most likely the server as well.</p>

<p>In short, your code provides about as much security as a piece of wet toilet paper. It is BEYOND dangerous.</p>
