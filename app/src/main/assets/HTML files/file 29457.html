<p>The general consensus with jQuery plugins is to release two versions. The original, uncompressed code, and then another minified version. Indeed, this is the approach that the authors of the jQuery library themselves have adopted, for example:</p>

<p><strong>Uncompressed ></strong> <a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js" rel="nofollow">http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js</a><br />
<strong>Minified ></strong> <a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js" rel="nofollow">http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js</a></p>

<p>You should know the difference between the two terms <code>minified</code> and <code>obfuscated</code>, but generally:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_%28programming%29" rel="nofollow"><strong>Minification:</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Minification (also minimisation or minimization), in computer
  programming languages and especially JavaScript, is the process of
  removing all unnecessary characters from source code without changing
  its functionality. These unnecessary characters usually include white
  space characters, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block
  delimiters, which are used to add readability to the code but are not
  required for it to execute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_%28software%29" rel="nofollow"><strong>Obfuscation:</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In software development, obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating
  obfuscated code, i.e. source or machine code that is difficult for
  humans to understand. Programmers may deliberately obfuscate code to
  conceal its purpose (security through obscurity) or its logic, in
  order to prevent tampering, deter reverse engi neering, or as a puzzle or recreational challenge for someone reading the source code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in short, <code>minification != obfuscation</code>. The idea of releasing a minified version is to reduce the filesize, and this can often be achieved using a combination of minification and onfuscation.</p>
