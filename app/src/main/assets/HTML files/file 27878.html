<p>A few suggestions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Element IDs <strong>must</strong> be unique. You shouldn't use "t" for each input ID. You could change it to <code>id="t_$i_$x"</code> or something like that to make it unique.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to let your server side script know that <code>t</code> is an array. To get <em>all</em> of the values from the form submitted, change the <code>name=t</code> in the<code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element templates to <code>name="t[]"</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 2 will break your validation function. I would change <code>onchange=ty()</code> to <code>onchange="ty(this)"</code>. You will then have to change your <code>ty()</code> function implementation to:</p>

<pre><code>function ty(el) {
    if(!/^-?\d*$/.test(el.value)) {
        alert("Number of heads per model value must be numeric!");
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>This consequently simplifies your function by removing the need to get the element again (you simply pass an instance of it in when you call it in the <code>onchange</code> event).</p></li>
<li><p>This isn't necessarily required, but it's a good practice to always enclose your HTML tag attribute values in quotations, as I've shown in my suggestions above.</p></li>
</ol>
