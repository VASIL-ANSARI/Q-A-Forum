<p>I'm guessing it's because the command prompt window is immediately closing. You can avoid this by adding <code>Console.ReadLine();</code> after your <code>WriteLine</code> statement. This will wait for you to press return before closing the prompt window.</p>

<p>Alternatively, assuming you're using Visual Studio, you can run the build without a debugger attached by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - Based on the extra information added that you're using ASP.NET and not a console application.</p>

<p>Firstly, what are you trying to achieve? If you want to output debug information, then you can <code>Debug.WriteLine</code> instead of <code>Console.WriteLine</code> </p>

<pre><code>System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Hello World");
</code></pre>

<p>This will output the text to the "Output" window at the bottom of Visual Studio (by default).</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong> Since you just want to write random text to the page, you can use </p>

<pre><code>HttpContext.Current.Response.Write("Hello World");
</code></pre>

<p>There are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11866025/sp2010-httpcontext-response-write-not-working-for-linkbuttons-onclick-event">sometimes issues</a> with <code>Response.Write</code> but it should be okay for what you want to do here.</p>
