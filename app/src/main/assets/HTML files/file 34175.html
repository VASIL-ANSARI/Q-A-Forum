<p>You can't have an anonymous function that is assigned to nothing. There is no use since because it is not assigned, you can't call it by a variable name and since it as no name, you can call it by its name.</p>

<p><code>(function(){})</code> will work because the parenthesis are evaluating the function and returning a function reference. You can then call that function with <code>.call()</code>, <code>.apply()</code> or <code>()</code>.</p>

<p>The last one is completly different, it call directly the function. It is the same as the second method, but with a direct call.</p>

<p>List of good function declaration (<em>ok there is also expressions, shhh</em>):</p>

<pre><code>function name(){};
(function(){}); //Can't call that function latter since it has no reference.
var name = function(){};
var name = (function(){});
var name = function otherName(){};
</code></pre>
