<p>In java, unless the method is static, you need to synchronize externally in order to ensure the method is only called by one thread at one time.</p>

<p>You can also synchronize the method itself on a static variable of the class.  E.g.</p>

<pre><code>public class myClass
{
  private static Object myLock = new Object();

  public void myMethod()
  {
    synchronized(myLock)
    {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
