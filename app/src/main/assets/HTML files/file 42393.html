<p>The OP wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At last the way to reach my solution has been using the Travelport test tool writing my xml requests and passing a string containing the xml.</p>
  
  <p>Needed for authentication:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;credentials["login"]=$user;
$this-&gt;credentials["password"]=$pass;
$this-&gt;credentials["traceid"]=$traceid; (branchcode)
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Then I create the soap client:</p>

<pre><code>$client = new SoapClient("galileo/air_v20_0/Air.wsdl", $this-&gt;credentials);
$rsp=$client-&gt;__doRequest($this-&gt;request, $this-&gt;credentials['location'], $this-&gt;credentials['soapaction'], $this-&gt;credentials['soap_version']);
</code></pre>
  
  <p>And this covers my needs :)</p>
  
  <p>Now I'm trying to pass the request info using SoapClient and WSDL functions in this post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14748125/wsdl-functions-with-the-same-name-how-to-choose-one/14991027?noredirect=1#14991027">WSDL functions with the same name. How to choose one?</a></p>
