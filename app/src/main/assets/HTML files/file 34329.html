<p>Well I gave a quick shot to your question. I shall explain how I accomplished this task. There could be a better approach too. As far as what I understood from your question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your major concern is to keep the length of a word to 15 and also to keep
  them distinct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code snippet below does that exactly. I first read the file <code>anyFile.txt</code> which shall contain all the words having 15 letters or more only. I assume from your question that you have already created this kind of file. I kept the contents of this file into <code>english_words</code>.</p>

<p>Then I declared a <code>charList = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']</code>. Well in my code I am simply using these <code>6</code> letters for creating distinct words. You can use more if you like. More is better.</p>

<p>Then I loop over every word using a for loop. In loop first I strip the word to keep its length up to 15 letters. Then I call my <code>checker()</code> to do the heavy stuff.</p>

<p>The <code>checker()</code> will first check if the word is already present in <code>oldWordList</code> if yes then it will generate a new distinct word. I used recursion to double check if the newly created word is distinct or not. If the word is not in the <code>oldWordList</code> then I simply append it to a <code>newWorldList</code>.</p>

<p>This <code>newWorldList</code> will contain all the distinct words at last.</p>

<p>How are distinct words being generated? 
Well the code is simple. First I am converting the word which is a string to a List <code>tempList = list(item)</code>, so that I can modify it. Then here
 <code>tempList[randomIndex] = charList[randomChar]</code> 
I am selecting a random letter from <code>charList = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']</code> and then assigning it to a random position in the <code>tempList</code>.</p>

<p>Code snippet:  <em>Please see: The code snippet is quick and dirty feel free to improve it further.</em></p>

<pre><code>import random

fo = open("anyFile.txt","wb")
english_words = set(w.lower() for w in open('distinct_words_only.txt').read().split())

for item in english_words:
    if len(item) &gt; 15:
        fo.write(item+'\n')
fo.close()


def checker(item):
    randomIndex = random.randrange(0,15)#Random number to decide which position in word
    randomChar = random.randrange(0,6)#Random number to pick a letter from charList
    if item in oldWordList:
        print 'Yes %s is present already'%item
        tempList = list(item)#Convert string to list
        tempList[randomIndex] = charList[randomChar]#Generate random word
        item = "".join(tempList)#Covert list back to string
        checker(item)#Recursion to double check
        print 'Newly created word %s'%item
    else:
        print '%s is distinct'%item
        newWordList.append(item)

english_words = set(w.lower() for w in open('anyFile.txt').read().split())
charList = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']
oldWordList = []
newWordList = []
for item in english_words:
    item = item[0:15]
    print 'Append item to oldWordList %s '%item
    checker(item)
    oldWordList.append(item)

print oldWordList#Will contain the original 15 letters words 
print newWordList#Will contain distinct 15 letteres  words
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Testing the code:</strong> Create a file named as <code>'distinct_words_only.txt'</code> with the following content and execute the script code:</p>

<pre><code>averybigblackdogwithdots
averysmallwhitecatwithatail
averytinygreymousewithanose
averytinygreymousewithabignose
averybigblackdogwithdots
averybigblackdogwithdotts
averysmallwhitecatwithalongtail
averytinygreymousewithanosee
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbb
</code></pre>

<p>When the script is executed you shall see the <code>print newWordList</code> will show you a list of distinct words with length of 15 letters in console.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation:</strong> I just wanted to point out that there is a limitation in creating distinct words too using replacement method like what I did. Eg: Consider a word of 2 letters and if you are allowed to use 2 letters for creating all the possible words then you can only generate 4 different words.</p>

<p><strong>Eg:</strong>
Word = IN, replacement letters are A,B</p>

<p>Distinct words could only be: IA, IB, AN, BN. Because in replacement method we can only replace a letter without changing their position. We can only replace I or N with A or B. We can't do something like NA, NB, AI, BI etc. using replacement method.</p>

<p>I hope this was a bit helpful.</p>
