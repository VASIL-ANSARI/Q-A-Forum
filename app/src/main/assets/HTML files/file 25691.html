<p>On page reload, your JS application gets re-initialized and starts all over again, so you cannot have a callback.</p>

<p>However, what you can do is add a hash fragment to the URL before reloading. </p>

<pre><code>window.location = window.location.href + "#refresh";
window.location.reload();
</code></pre>

<p>Then, on page load, check if the hash fragment exists. If it does, you'll know you just refreshed the page.</p>
