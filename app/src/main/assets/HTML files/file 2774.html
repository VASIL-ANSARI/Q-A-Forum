<p>Have you looked at the <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothAdapter.html" rel="nofollow">BluetoothAdapter</a> class?  It seems like you can do everything you need via that class, unless I misunderstand the question.</p>

<p>As for initiating a connection to a specific device, won't the phone auto-pair with the known device once you enable bluetooth?</p>
