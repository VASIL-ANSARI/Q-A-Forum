<p>I'm totally new to react/redux, but I face the same problem as you, so I create a small APP with a login page.</p>

<pre><code>// On your Login.JS you could implement the component lifecycle

componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    if (nextProps.isAuthenticated){
        this.context.router.push({pathname:'/'});
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, when your 'action' send to the 'reducer' the type: LOGIN_SUCCESS your going to change the corresponding state and when your component 'receive props' your going to check and redirect. I hope this small example help you.</p>
