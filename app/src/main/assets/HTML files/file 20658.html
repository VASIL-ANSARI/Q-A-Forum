<p>Use the delegate-based API. I realize it's more code, but the convenience API is clearly not adequate to meet your needs (i.e. mockable with OCMockito).  Furthermore, don't worry about the "overhead" of allocating one ancillary per request. I feel quite confident that there will be dozens of objects allocated behind the scenes in the system frameworks by virtue of your calling <code>+[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:queue:completionHandler:]</code>; you shouldn't be concerned. That said, a single object can be the delegate for more than one request, so you needn't necessarily have more than one.</p>
