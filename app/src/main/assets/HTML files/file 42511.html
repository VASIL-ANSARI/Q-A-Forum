<p>You may have a look at <a href="https://github.com/refactorthis/GraphDiff" rel="nofollow" title="GraphDiff">GraphDiff </a> </p>

<p>According to this <a href="http://blog.brentmckendrick.com/introducing-graphdiff-for-entity-framework-code-first-allowing-automated-updates-of-a-graph-of-detached-entities/" rel="nofollow">dedicated blog entry</a>, it seems to fit your needs :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Say you have a Company which has many Contacts. A contact is not
  defined on its own and is a One-To-Many (with required parent) record
  of a Company. i.e. The company is the Aggregate Root. Assume you have
  a detached Company graph with its Contacts attached and want to
  reflect the state of this graph in the database.</p>
  
  <p>At present using the Entity Framework you will need to perform the
  updates of the contacts manually, check if each contact is new and
  add, check if updated and edit, check if removed then delete it from
  the database. Once you have to do this for a few different aggregates
  in a large system you start to realize there must be a better, more
  generic way.</p>
  
  <p>Well good news is that after a few refactorings I've found a nice solution to this problem.</p>
