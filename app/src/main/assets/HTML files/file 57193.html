<p>The <code>HttpServletRequest</code>object cannot be changed.
But you can add additional attributes to it, using <code>HttpServletRequest.setAttribute()</code> method.
This is useful, when you forward the request to another page:</p>

<pre><code>RequestDispatcher dispatcher = httpServletRequest
    .getRequestDispatcher("/url/to/new/page");
dispatcher.forward(httpServletRequest, httpServletResponse);
</code></pre>

<p>The receiving servlet then can read the additional attributes, you set.
It has to be in the same web application on the same server instance.</p>
