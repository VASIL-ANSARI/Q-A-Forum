<p>Bit of googling found me <a href="http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~mcmahon/CS241/c241man/node83.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> which says the following on the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that negative integers are not printed as such in octal or hexadecimal. Rather, the internal bit patterns are interpreted as always being positive values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>If</em> this is accurate, it would make sense that <code>showpos</code> would do nothing, why show a <code>+</code> in front of a number that is always positive?</p>
