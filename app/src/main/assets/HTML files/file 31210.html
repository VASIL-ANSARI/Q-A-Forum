<p>The operating system is wise to these sorts of tricks, and most are remediated now. Te general idea is <code>setuid</code>, <code>sudo</code> and friends don't use an unprivileged user's environment.</p>

<p>The following offers more reading:</p>

</ul>

<p>If all you want is a <code>setuid</code> binary to break into the system:</p>

<ul>
<li>shutdown the computer</li>
<li>mount the hard drive</li>
<li>rename <code>ls</code> (or other program like <code>date</code>)</li>
<li>copy <code>sudo</code> to <code>ls</code> (or other program like <code>date</code>)</li>
<li>unmount and reboot</li>
</ul>
