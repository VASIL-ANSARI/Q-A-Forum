<p>To un-indent, highlight the line and hit <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>. Or just position to the beginning of the line and hit <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.</p>

<p>Also, hitting <kbd>Tab</kbd> will enter the correct number of spaces to align at the next 4-space boundary.</p>

<p>To make sure indentation is correct, you can highlight an area of code and select Edit -> Advanced -> Format Selection, or you can just go to the end of a block, remove the ending brace, and add it back. The IDE will reformat your code.</p>

<p>So, if you have this:</p>

<pre><code>void foo()
{
  f();
     int q = 32;
   for (; q &gt; 0; --q)
     {
    // really messed up indentation
   }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Then deleting and re-adding that final <code>'}'</code> will reformat the entire method.</p>
