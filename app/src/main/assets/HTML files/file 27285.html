  <p>Is there a way to do this purely in python (i.e. without markup)? Thank you.</p>

<p>You never <em>need</em> to use kivy language (I assume that's what you mean by markup), though it's highly recommended where possible because it makes lots of stuff easier.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, to actually answer your question, all you have to do is add your gridlayout widget to your screen widget, something like</p>

<pre><code>mainscreen = MainScreen()
mainlayout = MainLayout()
mainscreen.add_widget(mainlayout)
</code></pre>

<p>Then when you set the current screen in your screenmanager to be mainscreen, you should see the GridLayout.</p>

<p>Edit: In case it's unclear, this is in general the way you add widgets to other widgets. When you see an example in kv language like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MyScreen&gt;:
     GridLayout:
         ...
</code></pre>

<p>...ultimately that gets translated to something much like the above example code - an instance of MyScreen is created and a GridLayout is added to it with add_widget.</p>
