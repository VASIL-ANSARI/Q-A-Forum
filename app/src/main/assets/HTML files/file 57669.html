<p>You will need to write all your feature files on the <code>features</code> folder.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to write a feature for <code>functional</code> testing, you can create a file named <code>welcome.feature</code> and put it in <code>features/functional</code> folder.</p>

<p>And for Unit testing, Behat doesn't have assertions per-se. So, you may want to use PHPUnit's assertions. As PHPUnit comes bundled with new Laravel apps, it's already available, and all one needs to do to access the assertions is import the class in the FeatureContext class of Behat, as follows:</p>

<p><code>use PHPUnit_Framework_Assert as PHPUnit;</code></p>

<p>You will then have access to assertions and write your tests.</p>
