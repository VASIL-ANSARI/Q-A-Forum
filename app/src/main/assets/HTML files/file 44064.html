<p>If you want <code>MapA</code> and <code>MapB</code> (it would be really helpful if you followed <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP-8</a>) to be distinct models, proxy models won't help you. A proxy model is a model that is different in Python, but in the database it is exactly the same as the model it inherits from. Creating a proxy model that doesn't directly inherit from a single concrete model (one that has a table in the database) is an error.</p>

<p>What you're looking for is an abstract base class:</p>

<pre><code>class Tools(models.Model):
    ...

    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class MapA(Tools):
    ...

class MapB(Tools):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>An abstract model does <em>not</em> create its own table in the database. Instead, it is as if everything defined in <code>Tools</code> has been defined in both <code>MapA</code> and <code>MapB</code>, but the <code>Tools</code> class is otherwise ignored. This allows you to specify all the methods and fields just once, but still have two separate tables in the database. </p>
