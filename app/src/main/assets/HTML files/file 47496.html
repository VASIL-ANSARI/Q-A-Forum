<p>How to access your database depends on the database you are using and the server side programming language. From the tags you used in your question I assume you are using the mysql database provided by clear db through the Azure Management Portal. You can not access your database right from JS. As you are using VS I guess you are using asp.net on the server side. If using asp.net this article might help: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178371%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178371%28v=vs.100%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>If you created a ms sql database through the SQL Database service in MS Azure you also need to check the firewall settings to allow access from your app.</p>
