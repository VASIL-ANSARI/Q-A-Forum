<p>First thing you can "GET" a variable as long as you can see that in the URL. e.g: exmaple.com?std_id=Boo</p>

<p>In code you do something:</p>

<pre><code>$std_id = $_GET['std_id'];  //$std_id will be Boo
&lt;form action="std_edit.php?edit_id=&lt;?php echo $std_id; ?&gt;"&gt;
            &lt;input class="std_edit" type="submit" name="edit" value = "Edit"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>If you want some variable it has to be there in URL.
Taking sample example above, you cannot do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$std_id = $_GET['id'];
</code></pre>

<p>Reason, id is not there in URL.</p>
