<a href="http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com/documentation" rel="nofollow">http://ajaxmin.codeplex.com/documentation</a><br>
by using this you would be able to use this third party tool as the minifier<br>
after downloading the tool you have 2 options <br>
1. edit the MSBUILD file to include building the js as per build event <br>
OR 2. to attach this tool to VS and assign a key compbination to it.. this way you would be able to minify whenever you want just like we do F5 OR Cntrl-Shift-B</p>

<p><br>Attaching to VS is easy just to to external tools and in the Tools menu and add this tool with the required params </p>
