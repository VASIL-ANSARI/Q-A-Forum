<p>It's the feature through which user can give voice commands to navigate through the app.<br>
here is an overview of how it works : <br>
you can say <b>"search on basis of [ any] language"</b> which will filter up questions on based on that language .(refer to tags section to know more...)<br>
also you can sort questions based on title,body,date, time,votes count,answers count by simply giving voice command to <b>"sort by title"</b> or so<br>
also you can navigate to app settings,tags,users by giving voice commands as <b>" go to settings or show all users or show all tags"</b> <br>also you can see your own posted questions by saying <b>"show my questions" or simply "my questions"</b> <br>and can refresh things up by just saying <b>"reset or reset all "</b><br> as well as can post questions by just commanding <b>"i want post or add a new question"</b><br>
