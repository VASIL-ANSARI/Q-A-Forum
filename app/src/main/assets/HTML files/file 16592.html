<p>Not sure about the first point, but to detect browser in printing mode, you can do the same as for screen. Either use Modernizr and conditionally add classes to  for supported features, then make targeted CSS rules like:</p>

<pre><code>body.whateverfeature .yourrule { }
</code></pre>

<p>or if it's just IE you want to test for, use something like h5bp does:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--[if lt IE 7]&gt; &lt;html class="no-js lt-ie9 lt-ie8 lt-ie7" lang="en"&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>     
     
  </p>
