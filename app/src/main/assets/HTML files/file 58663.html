<p>Well, short answer - no.</p>

<p>Most android apps are developed using Java as the programming language, with a mark-up language which could be comparable to HTML (but is <strong>not</strong> HTML) to build the basic UI structure of most screens.</p>

<p>Certain aspects of HTML are still used in Android apps, for example, when we'd like to construct a label with styling (such as a bold word in the middle of a sentence, etc). Also, Android is capable of presenting a <code>WebView</code> which can display HTML and run JavaScript. There's also a way to leverage HTML to make apps which can run on both Android and iOS with only 1 development cycle. These apps are good on cutting costs, but usually fall short on performance.</p>

<p>Games, however, usually do not rely on HTML due to the high reaction time required of them, and their intensive graphic requirements.</p>

<p>Some developers develop games for Android using the basic Android APIs available, such as <code>Canvas</code>, or OpenGL-ES. Others chose to opt for game development tools such as Unity.</p>
