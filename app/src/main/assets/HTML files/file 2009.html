<p>Bezier splines do not (necessarily) go through their control points, but Catmull-Rom splines do.  They require an extra pair of control points beyond the set that you want to interpolate (one before, one after).</p>

<p>The CakeJS package (http://code.google.com/p/cakejs/) has a Catmull-Rom facility, though I don't know much about it other than that it apparently exists.</p>
