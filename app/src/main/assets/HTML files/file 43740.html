<p>Have a look at AdView's <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/AdView.html#getMediationAdapterClassName()" rel="nofollow">getMediationAdapterClassName</a> method.  If the impression has gone to third-party mediation, that will return the name of the adapter class that's in use.  It may return null in some cases where AdMob fill is chosen, so check for that as well.</p>
