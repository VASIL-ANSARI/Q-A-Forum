<h3>Idiomatic version of a bare Struct type class in Java</h3>

<pre><code>public class Coordinate
{
    public final int x;
    public final int y;

    public Coordinate(@Nonnull final int x, @Nonnul final int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public String toString() { return String.format("%d/%d", this.x, this.y); }

    public int hashCode() { return this.toString().hashCode(); }

    public boolean equals(@Nullable final Object o) { return this.equals((Coordinate)o); }

    public boolean equals(@Nullable final Coordinate c) { return this.x = c.x &amp;&amp; this.y == c.y; }
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The above class is pretty much the bare minimum to operate in general
  programming cases with standard library containers and behave
  correctly. <code>.equals()</code> and <code>.hashCode()</code> are important when working
  with <code>Map</code> containers especially. <code>.toString()</code> is a nice way to get a
  nice human readable representation and a consistent <code>.hashCode()</code> at
  the same time.</p>
  
  <p>This design also eschews <code>setters</code> and <code>getters</code> since it is immutable they are just
  syntactic overhead.</p>
  
  <p><code>getters</code> in this design are just fine performance wise because the <code>JIT</code> compiler will
  eventually inline them because of the use of <code>final</code> is a hint to the optimizer.</p>
  
  <p>I just chose not to include them for space and style reasons.</p>

<p>Not much can beat an immutable data only structure in normal cases, and you get <code>thread</code> safety with no locking/synchronization issues as a bonus.</p>
