<p>actually i turn my comment as an answer for feed back:</p>

<p>IE specific filter should stand last, so it is not overide by a next one.</p>

<p><strong>Activex should also allowed to run</strong></p>

<p>and of course, it should be in quirk mode ...</p>

<pre><code>img.desaturate {
    -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%);
    filter: grayscale(100%);
    filter: url(desaturate.svg#greyscale);
    filter: gray;
}
</code></pre>
