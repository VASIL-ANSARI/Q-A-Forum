<p>which version of SQL Server and which datatype are you using? There are 6 "date and time" <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187752.aspx" rel="nofollow">data types</a> on SQl Server 2008: </p>

<pre><code>date
datetimeoffset
datetime2
smalldatetime
datetime
time
</code></pre>

<p>maybe the one you are using is not supported in Java or by the drive you are using. Specially if you are using <code>Date</code> which is new in SQL Server 2008</p>
