<p>Give the table an id in the HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table id="mytablename"&gt;
    &lt;!--table stuff here--&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then in your CSS, reference it by id</p>

<pre><code>#mytablename {
    /*lots of css rules*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>The rules you define in the css will ONLY apply to that one id. And you won't have to worry about it applying to any other table, as id's cannot be used multiple times like classes can. </p>

<p>(The answer above works very similar to setting a class, with slightly different syntax)</p>
