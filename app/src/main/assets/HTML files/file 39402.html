<p>The position is based on left and top values of the div. They are counted including the border, so the div doesn't actually move, but the div (including its border) grows.</p>

<p>To prevent this, the easiest solution would be to always give it a border, but make that border transparent:</p>

<pre><code>.marker-cluster-div {
  border: 10px solid transparent;
  border-radius: 50%;
}

.selectedMarker {
  border-color: gold;
}
</code></pre>
