<p>You used the comma operator and the behavior is normal.</p>

<p>An expression with comma operator <code>A, B</code> means that first evaluate <code>A</code>, ignore its result, then evaluate <code>B</code> and the result of comma operator will be its value.</p>

<p>If you want to show "%s, Drawing", print it.</p>

<pre><code>printf("%-29s\n","%s, Drawing");
</code></pre>
