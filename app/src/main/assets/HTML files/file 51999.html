<p>Let's say you have sys and blabla module missing. With current setting it will throw exception when it tried to load sys. And it will not even reach <code>import blabla</code>. So you wouldn't know if the module missing or not if previous module is missing. If you really really want the feature you want, you can wrap every single <code>import module</code> with exception handling for all module import. But it seems to me that's over kill. As idjaw mentioned, you should be able to see from stacktrace if any module is missing. </p>
