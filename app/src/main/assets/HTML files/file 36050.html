<p>If your dictionary is inside Page.Resources then your page is in scope and you can reference elements on the page. If you remove it to a separate file then your page is no longer in scope. </p>

<p>Think of this like a private field in a C# class. It is available to anything inside the class. But other classes don't even know it is there, and cannot use it. Same concept.</p>

<p>If you need a solution then you need to include the data template in the resources of the page that holds the element to which you want to bind. Similar answer for code-behind. </p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
