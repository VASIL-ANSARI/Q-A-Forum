<p>I think you have answered your question yourself here. You know why :)</p>

  <p>how do devs who deal with ad tags test
  their rendering? It gets really
  annoying if the ads stop rendering
  after a few refreshes.</p>

<p>In my experience most of the ads render properly so never had an experience where I had to check it properly. But why do you need to refresh it multiple times? Try to do as many changes as you want and then refresh.</p>

<p>Another option is to use tools like firebug where you can edit the html rendered and play with it. Once you get a proper design you can change your original file. </p>
