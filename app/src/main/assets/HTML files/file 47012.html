<p><strong>dkh:</strong></p>

<p>We can see from the snippet below that <code>dkh</code> is just the first 8 characters of the AppsFlyer key.</p>

<pre><code>obj = com.appsflyer.f.a().b("AppsFlyerKey");
// [...]
if (((String) (obj)).length() &gt; 8)
{
    hashmap.put("dkh", ((String) (obj)).substring(0, 8));
}
</code></pre>

<p>As for how it used- in the code you posted, it isn't. Given that the code you posted starts off with creating a <code>StringBuilder</code> that is initialized with a URL, it is probably a safe guess that the hashamp that is being built is also related to that URL.</p>

<p>When dealing with API calls, the most common use for a hashmap is as HTTP parameters (e.g. via GET or POST). Thus my assumption is that all these hashmap entries are simply parameters sent to the AppsFlyer API. Some are used to provide information about the user's device, and some (such as <code>dkh</code>) are probably used by AppsFlyer to associate the device information with your account.</p>

<p><strong>uid</strong></p>

<p>The code snippet doesn't provide enough information to glean anything meaningful about how <code>uid</code> is generated. All we really know is that it isn't null and if comes from some other function in the AppsFlyer SDK based on this snippet:</p>

<pre><code>s = com.appsflyer.k.a(context);
// [null check]
hashmap.put("uid", s);
</code></pre>

<p>Given the context of <code>dkh</code> above and the general consensus amongst programmers that "uid" stands for "user ID," I would assume this is a user identifier that will also be sent to the API.</p>

<p><strong>af_v</strong></p>

<p>I think applying some formatting to the code snippet will help:</p>

<pre><code>obj = (String)((Map) (obj2)).get("appsflyerKey");
String s1 = (String)((Map) (obj2)).get("af_timestamp");
obj2 = (String)((Map) (obj2)).get("uid");
obj = com.appsflyer.j.a(
    new StringBuilder()
        .append(((String) (obj)).substring(0, 7))
        .append(((String) (obj2)).substring(0, 7))
        .append(s1.substring(s1.length() - 7))
   .toString()
);
a.put("af_v", obj);
</code></pre>

<p>Starting from the top, we know that <code>obj</code> is our AppsFlyer key again. <code>s1</code> is a timestamp of some sort. <code>obj2</code> is our uid from above.
The String that we end up putting into <code>af_v</code> is made up of these three parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first 7 characters of the AppsFlyer key (<code>obj1</code>)</li>
<li>the first 7 characters of the uid (<code>obj2</code>)</li>
<li>the last 7 characters of the timestamp</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this is probably all just sent to the API, and the real use is known only to people on the AppsFlyer team. It might be an identifier for a particular request- the fact that it is based on a particular user, timestamp, and API key means that it is likely fairly unique for each request and squishing (only part of) them together into one string probably isn't particularly useful data for anyone to look at.</p>
