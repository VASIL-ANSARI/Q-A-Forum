<p>That's not possible, because Yii does (and <a href="https://github.com/composer/installers/pull/71" rel="nofollow">will</a>) not use custom <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-do-i-install-a-package-to-a-custom-path-for-my-framework.md" rel="nofollow">composer installers</a>, which would be required to make this work.</p>

<p>To quote from the composer installers README:</p>

<p>This also applies to the framework package itself and I'd strongly recommend you <strong>not</strong> to change this behavior. </p>
