<p>In PHP, the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php" rel="nofollow">header</a> method is how you send HTTP headers back to the user's browser.  The Location header instructs the browser that the requested item has moved to a new location and thus the browser should redirect the user to the new location.  In short, this is an HTTP redirect.</p>

<p>From the PHP side, your server will first see a request to the file above, and then a second request for the path "user/". Depending on how your web server is configured, this could go to the same PHP file, or to a different PHP file for processing.</p>

<p>Specifically the hash sign ("#").  This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier" rel="nofollow">fragment identifier</a> within a URL and is traditionally used to scroll a user to a specific portion of a page. So taking the example "user/#/home", this user would be redirected to page "user/", and then the browser would try to scroll to the anchor "/home" on the resulting page.</p>
