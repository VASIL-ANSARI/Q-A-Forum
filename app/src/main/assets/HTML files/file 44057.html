<p>Default value for <code>textAlign</code> is <code>start</code> (there is no <code>initial</code>). A value that isn't recognized is simply <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#text-styles" rel="nofollow">ignored</a> (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The textAlign IDL attribute, on getting, must return the current
  value. On setting, if the value is one of start, end, left, right, or
  center, then the value must be changed to the new value. <strong>Otherwise,
  the new value must be ignored.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
