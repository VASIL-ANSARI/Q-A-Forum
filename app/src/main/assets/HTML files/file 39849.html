<p>Your old fragment is still attached until the <code>onPostExecute</code> of your <code>AsyncTask</code> isn't finished. I don't see you have it in your <code>AsyncTas</code>k but I'll assume you have. After the <code>AsyncTask</code>'s <code>OnPostExecute</code> method is finished the transition you want is happening.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<p>Detach your current fragment (in <code>OnPostExecute</code>) and replace it with another by calling the FragmentManager and commiting the new fragment. A way to do this in a certain point of <code>DoInBackground</code> is just to return this boolean value and let the <code>OnPostExecute</code> finish this process.</p>

<p>Also it's a good pratice to follow the guideliness for <code>AsyncTask</code> and implement all relevant methods (4 of them to be exact)</p>
