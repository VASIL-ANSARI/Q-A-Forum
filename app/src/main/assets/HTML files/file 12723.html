<p>Try <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/" rel="nofollow">Protovis</a>, which seems to be the successor of Prefuse and may be a good alternative option. It is written in JavaScript, but a <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/protovis-java/" rel="nofollow">Java Graphical Toolkit</a> is available.</p>

<p><a href="http://d3js.org/" rel="nofollow">D3.js</a> is the successor of Protovis today. (Recommended by Protovis.)</p>
