<p>The easiest way would be to transform your two vectors such that they lie in the <code>(u, v)</code> plane; then apply your method above; then transform back to the original coordinate space.</p>

<p>This requires you to construct a rotation matrix:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take the cross product of your two vectors to get the mutual normal vector; call this <code>cross_1</code>;</li>
<li>Define that <code>this</code> points along the <code>u</code> axis;</li>
<li>Take the cross product of <code>this</code> and <code>cross_1</code> to get a vector <code>cross_2</code>, which is the direction of your <code>v</code> axis.</li>
<li>Normalize each of these three vectors; call them <code>this_norm</code>, <code>cross_2_norm</code> and <code>cross_1_norm</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>These three vectors can be written as a 3x3 orthonormal matrix (each of the vectors is a 3-element column vector):</p>

<pre><code>R = [ this_norm cross_2_norm cross_1_norm ]
</code></pre>

<p>Now: you can multiply your 3d vectors <code>this</code> and <code>other</code> by this matrix, and you will get vectors which have the form</p>

<pre><code>[  u  ]
[  v  ]
[  0  ]
</code></pre>

<p>i.e. a 3-dimensional column vector with zero as the third element (or, at least, you should. I may have forgotten to transpose the 3x3 matrix above).</p>

<p>So, you can obviously discard the third element, and have 2-element column vectors:  you can store these in <code>Vector2d</code>. And so you can apply your method above to do the interpolation.</p>

<p>That gives you a <code>Vector2d</code> which interpolates in the <code>(u, v)</code> plane. You can transform that back to the <code>(x, y, z)</code> space by attaching a zero third element to it, and pre-multiplying by <code>R'</code> (which is the inverse of <code>R</code>, since it is orthonormal).</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, you need to handle degenerate cases, like zero and (anti-)parallel vectors. In these cases, one or both of the cross products are zero, meaning you can't normalize them; simply pick arbitrary directions instead.</p>
