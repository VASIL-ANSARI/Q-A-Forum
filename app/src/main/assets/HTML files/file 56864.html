<p>The problem here is that your data values are being read as strings and not arrays.</p>

<p>I created an example fiddle using your chart options and your JSON data directly inserted: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/brightmatrix/143bzv1s/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/brightmatrix/143bzv1s/</a></p>

<p>The chart works correctly with the format as follows. Notice there are no quote marks around the data arrays.</p>

<pre><code>series: [
    {"name":"2012","data":[692101643,716334837,776991835,769420169 ]},
    {"name":"2013","data":[860859252,825852169,895524501,892930333 ]}
]
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this is helpful for you!</p>

<p>Also, thank you very much for including sample data in your question. That was <strong>extremely</strong> helpful.</p>
