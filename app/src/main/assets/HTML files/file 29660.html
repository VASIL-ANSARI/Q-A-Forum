<p>Keep track of the previous line read in in a String variable, which you can initialize as an empty string. When you read in each line, check whether it's <code>equals()</code> to the previously stored line in that variable. If so, do what you want to do, like <code>Thread.sleep()</code>. Otherwise save the current line into that variable. In code:</p>

<pre><code>    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.txt"));
    String foo = "";
    String old = "";
    while((foo = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        if(foo.equals(old)) {
            System.out.println("Sleeping...");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } else {
            old = foo;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
