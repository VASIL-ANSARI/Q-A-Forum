<p>From what I can gather you want to build a low pass filter by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move to the frequency domain. (Fourier transform)</li>
<li>Remove undesired frequencies.</li>
<li>Move back to the time domain. (Inverse fourier transform)</li>
</ol>

<p>Looking at your code, instead of doing 3) you're just doing another fourier transform. Instead, try doing an actual inverse fourier transform to move back to the time domain:</p>

<pre><code>y_smooth = ifft(yfft, N)
</code></pre>

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html" rel="nofollow">scipy signal</a> to see a bunch of already available filters.</p>

<p>(Edit: I'd be curious to see the results, do share!)</p>
