<p>This really has nothing to do with Java 8. If you have different objects which all implement the same interface, let's call it <code>MyInterface</code>, then you can create an array like this:</p>

<pre><code>MyInterface[] myArray = new MyInterface[size];
</code></pre>

<p>And you can assign those objects to elements of this array. Of course, you can only use methods that are either in the definition of <code>MyInterface</code> or in the definition of <code>Object</code> - unless you cast your members back into their original class.</p>

<p>The same is true for lists. You can define a list:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;MyInterface&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;MyInterface&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can add any object that implements <code>MyInterface</code> to this list, with the same limitation on what you can do with the members when you <code>get()</code> them from that list: only methods of <code>MyInterface</code> and <code>Object</code>, unless you cast back.</p>
