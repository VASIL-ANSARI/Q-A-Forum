<p>I am not sure if I understood you correctly. But if you want to have several previews you can choose Preview then click "+" at the bottom left corner of the preview window to add the second preview and set it to landscape orientation. As far as I know you cannot preview 2 view controllers at the same time. Hope it helps :)</p>
