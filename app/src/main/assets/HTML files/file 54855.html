<p>I had a similar issue to this which was down to Android's view recycling. </p>

<p>(A good explanation of it is available <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11945563/how-listviews-recycling-mechanism-works#answer-14108676">here</a>)</p>

<p>To resolve I simply reset the animation in the item's OnResume method as I didn't need to retain the animation for the item which has scrolled out of view.</p>
