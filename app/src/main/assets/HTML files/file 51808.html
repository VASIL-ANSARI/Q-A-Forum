<p><strong>MapFragment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use it if you want to add a map into Activity class (not fragment
because it will create a nested fragment and itÂ´s a mess).</li>
<li>Use SupportMapFragment if you want to support just android versions
lower than v12.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MapView</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use it if you are going to add a map into a fragment. (you need to
update each lifecicle to MapView).</li>
</ul>

<p>In your case as your using the fragment it is better to use the map view. That way you will avoid cascading fragments when you don't have to.</p>
