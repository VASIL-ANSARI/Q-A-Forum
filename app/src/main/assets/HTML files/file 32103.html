<p>I've had similar issues in the past. Most of the time its components and references that your custom class is trying to load.</p>

<p>The two step solution that works most often for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move the constructor of your custom class to another function, then call that function in in the constructor of your list (or class)</li>
<li>Add the following before the function call in the constructor but after the Initialize component. (I use this for user controls and isn't really valid in your case, but depending on how you set stuff up. It could be useful)</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<pre><code>if (System.ComponentModel.DesignerProperties.GetIsInDesignMode(this))
return;
</code></pre>

<p>Both steps help the xaml designer from loading components that may have issues with the being in a debug state.
@Heinzi is pretty much spot on with "something" throwing errors, usually (in my experience) its something buried that you wouldn't expect.</p>
