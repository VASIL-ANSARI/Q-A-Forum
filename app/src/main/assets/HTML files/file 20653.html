<p>i don't see in your code where the comparison is taking place, but i can tell you this about java:</p>

<p>when comparing 2 strings in java, don't use ==, use the string class .equals method, or compareTo or something like that. the reason is, in java, two strings are only == if they refer back to the same object. Java will often do this on its own when you create strings, if you create a string called "name" and then elsewhere in a program create another string called "name" it'll look around and say "hey, he already made one called name, let's use a pointer to that" this can confuse people because it makes it so that == often is true, but it's unreliable.</p>

<p>so my guess would be that since one of the strings is being received from outside the program, they are not referring to the same string object, and therefore not ==.</p>

<p>if i misunderstood the question i apologize :)</p>
