<p>You have to actually create a <code>UINavigationController</code>, and have it be part of your controller hierarchy, before you can use <code>pushViewController:animated:</code>.  You should really try setting this up in a NIB, instead of code, but in your code you can try this in place of your current <code>vc2</code> initialization:</p>

<pre><code>UIViewController *vc2 = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:[[AuthorViewController alloc] init]];
</code></pre>
