<p>You should use the same WHERE statement for SELECT. It will return the modified rows, because your UPDATE did not change any columns used for lookup:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE tbl_name
SET session = session + 1
WHERE id_account = 17 AND password = 'apple';

SELECT *
FROM tbl_name
WHERE id_account = 17 AND password = 'apple';
</code></pre>

<p>An advice: never store passwords as plain text! Use a hash function, like this:</p>

<pre><code>MD5('apple')
</code></pre>
