<p>Those question marks means that it is PreparedStatement. Such statements are good for both server and client. Server has less work because it is easier to parse such statement, and client do not need to worry about SQLInjection. Client prepares such query, builds buffer for input values and calls it.</p>

<p>Also such statement is executed very quick compared to "normal" queries, especially in loops, importing data from csv file etc. </p>

<p>I don't know what ODBC C++ library you use while ODBC is strictly C library. Other languages like Java or Python can use it too. I think the easiest is example in Python:</p>

<pre><code>cursor = connection.cursor()
for txt in ('a', 'b', 'c'):
    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM test WHERE txt=?', (txt,)) 
</code></pre>

<p>Of course such PreparedStatement can be used in INSERT or UPDATE statements too, and for your example it can look like:</p>

<pre><code>cursor.execute("INSERT INTO t_testblob (filename, apkdata) VALUE (?, ?)", filename, my_binary_data)
</code></pre>
