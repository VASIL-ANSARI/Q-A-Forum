<p>You have to chain animations and run a sequence of <code>animateWithDuration:</code> one after another. Because each animation can only interpolate between two values of the same property, current or start value and end value or new.</p>

<p>For the starter use <code>animateWithDuration</code> completion block to schedule next animation and change background color to next color.</p>

<p>The other important thing is that Text field's background color might not be animatable which means you have to work directly with <code>CALayer</code>. Take a look at similar questions on SO:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3762561/how-to-animate-the-background-color-of-a-uilabel">How to animate the background color of a UILabel?</a></p>

<p>FYI: CoreAnimation provides more advanced tools for animations such as <code>CAKeyframeAnimation</code> which allows to interpolate value between multiple values in sequence.</p>
