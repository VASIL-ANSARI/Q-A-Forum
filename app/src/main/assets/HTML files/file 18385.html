<p>I would use another approach which is easier I think. </p>

<p>Create 300 timer thread, each running 1 sec after the previous. The main loop is executed in almost an instant so the error factor is very low.
Here's a sample Demo:</p>

<pre><code>import datetime
import thread
import threading

def foo():
     print datetime.datetime.now()
     print threading.active_count()

for x in range(0,300): 
     t = threading.Timer(x + 1, foo)
     t.start()
</code></pre>

<p>This code output should look like this:</p>

...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, each thread is launched about 1 sec after the previous and you are starting exactly 300 threads. </p>
