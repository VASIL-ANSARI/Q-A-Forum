<p>Asio's error detection and reporting is a fairly thin layer, often propagating all information it has been provided by the underlying system call.  On failure Asio will populate a <code>boost::system::error_code</code> if the application is capable of receiving it, such as for asynchronous operations or synchronous operation overloads with the <code>error_code</code> parameter; otherwise it will throw an exception containing the <code>error_code</code>.  The <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/asynchronous_operations.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> explicitly mentions asynchronous operations, but the same <em>"as if"</em> behavior is often applicable to synchronous operations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unless otherwise noted, when the behaviour of an asynchronous operation is defined "as if" implemented by a POSIX function, the handler will be invoked with a value of type <code>error_code</code> that corresponds to the failure condition described by POSIX for that function, if any. Otherwise the handler will be invoked with an implementation-defined <code>error_code</code> value that reflects the operating system error.</p>
  
  <p>Asynchronous operations will not fail with an error condition that indicates interruption by a signal (POSIX <code>EINTR</code>). Asynchronous operations will not fail with any error condition associated with non-blocking operations (POSIX <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>, <code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EINPROGRESS</code>; Windows <code>WSAEWOULDBLOCK</code> or <code>WSAEINPROGRESS</code>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To further investigate an error, consider using the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/networking/bsd_sockets.html" rel="nofollow">BSD API mapping documentation</a> to determine which OS calls are being made.  One can then use the appropriate OS documentation to determine the conditions for which an error occurs and the values.  The mapping between error codes and Boost.Asio error codes is located within <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/asio/blob/boost-1.61.0/include/boost/asio/error.hpp#L115" rel="nofollow"><code>asio/error.hpp</code></a>, but the mapping is normally fairly straight forward.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendto.2.html" rel="nofollow"><code>sendto()</code></a>, a return value of <code>EINVAL</code> may not provide insightful information.  One could further diagnose the problem via attaching a debugger and examining the arguments for validity when Asio makes the <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/asio/blob/boost-1.61.0/include/boost/asio/detail/impl/socket_ops.ipp#L1270-L1304" rel="nofollow">system call to <code>sendto()</code></a>.</p>
