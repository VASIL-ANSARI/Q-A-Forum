<p>You need to import the <code>generate</code> method from where its coming from in the js file. </p>

<p>Add an import statement to the to of the file pointing to the module supporting this generate method. </p>

<p>Looking at the file, this is currently commented out: </p>

<pre><code>// var ecc = require('../dist/0.1/ecc');
</code></pre>

<p>Try un-commenting it. </p>

<p>Note, this has to be commented when used in HTML as a JS file.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Just saw your changes. Maybe you're using an outdated ecc module. As the error states there is no <code>generate</code> method in the ecc file. </p>

<p>Alternatively, install the latest ecc via npm using <code>npm install eccjs</code> and replacement <code>var ecc = require('../dist/0.1/ecc');</code> with <code>var ecc = require('eccjs');</code></p>
