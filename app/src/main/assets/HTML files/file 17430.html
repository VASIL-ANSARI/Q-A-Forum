<p>Have the ajax call directed to your server, with the user's email.<br>
From there, use the API (you downloaded) to add the email, and return the outcome of their response to your client.  </p>

<p>When you do it behind the scenes (your server to theirs), there is no security risk, as you are not exposing your API key.</p>

<p>Client side code:</p>

<pre><code>Ext.Ajax.request({
    url: 'add_mail_to_chimp.php',
    params: {
        email: theUser_sEmail
    },
    success: function(response){
        var text = response.responseText;
        alert ('yay' + text);
    }
});
</code></pre>
