<p>When a program tries to access memory it has no privileges, the <code>Linux Kernel</code> interrupts the program by sending a signal called <code>SEGSEGV</code>. In your <code>fgets</code>, may be you are exceeding the memory you have allocated for your pointer by inputting too much text. Signals is one way <code>Linux Kernel</code> communicate with the programs (processes in correct sense). It's kind of exception.</p>

<p>Since, you are dealing with files. It's worth checking if your file actually exists. May be you don't have privileges to read the file and hence getting the error.</p>

<p><code>/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6</code> is a shared library on your <code>Linux</code> system in which <code>fgets</code> function resides and <code>0xb7d79a67</code> is (I guess) main memory address your program doesn't have privileges may be goes beyond the file length. </p>

<p>The <code>segmentation-fault(SEGSEGV)</code> can occur when you access protected memory areas, or the memory areas which are used by other programs and hence your program doesn't have any right to access.</p>
