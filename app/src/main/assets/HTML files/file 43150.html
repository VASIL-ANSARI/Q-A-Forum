<p>If you read Java objects as stream in REST method you need to Deserailize the stream to object ( I dont know why and how u managed to do so). Instead try sending java object as JSON or XML and after consuming in REST method convert into object using by parsing XML/JSON . If you use frameworks like Jersey it fairly simple by specifying request mime-type</p>
