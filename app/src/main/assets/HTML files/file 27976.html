<p>Have you tried simply to change the default connection in <code>app/config/database.php</code>?</p>

<pre><code>'default' =&gt; 'db2'
</code></pre>

<p>If it's not the case then please provide more information on the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
So it seems you have all connections hardcoded in the models. Try updating the models like that:</p>

<pre><code>    protected $connection = 'db2';
</code></pre>
