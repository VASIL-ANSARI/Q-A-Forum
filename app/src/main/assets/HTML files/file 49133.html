  <p>Is this code correctly synchronized ?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>meaning that result should be different each execution of the code (0,1,2,3) .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why should that be true? You provide no justification whatsoever for this claim.</p>

<p>The code is incorrectly synchronized which means that there are many possible results. You are taking a fact -- <strong>the lack of correct synchronization means I don't know what will happen</strong> -- and deducing from that a completely unsupported conclusion -- <strong>the observations will be different on every execution</strong>.  The correct deduction from "I don't know what will happen" is that you don't know what will happen on <em>any</em> execution; in particular you do <em>not</em> know that the behaviour over a large set of runs will have <em>any</em> particular distribution.</p>

  <p>Why ?</p>

<p>Why what? You noted that 2 was a possible result, you are getting a possible result.  You do the same thing twice and the same result happens; that's not surprising. Just because the runtime is <em>permitted</em> to produce many different results does not imply that it <em>must</em> produce many different results. Doing the same thing twice generally results in pretty similar outcomes.</p>
