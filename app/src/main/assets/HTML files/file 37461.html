<p>You could use a raw string: <code>r"$ \xi$"</code> which will not treat the <code>\x</code> as an escape for a  unicode char.</p>

<p>Or, you could escape the slash: <code>"$ \\xi$"</code></p>

<p>It doesn't happen with other greek letters you've tried because they don't happen to start with a character used as a control code. But if you tried "\rho" I imagine you might be surprised, as "\r" is a carriage return code.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow">various such codes</a>, including <code>\b, \t, \n, \a, \r, \u, \v, \f, \x, \U</code></p>
