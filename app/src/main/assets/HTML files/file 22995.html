<p>This is a partial answer:  I believe that there was a change in the Quicktime video capture engine between iOS 5 and iOS 6. In iOS 5, it was possible to capture video at 60 FPS, and there were some apps that made use of this to record for playback in smooth slow motion (e.g. SloPro app). In iOS 6, it was no longer possible to achieve 60 FPS using the same method.  There is a lengthy discussion on this issue in the MacRumors Forum thread:  </p>

<p>Hopefully you can find some information there that might provide a solution to your problem.  I'd be very interested to hear if anyone can make this work again. I miss recording at 60 FPS...</p>
