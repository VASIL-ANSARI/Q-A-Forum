<p>I saw your edit. The reason is crashes is because <code>NSLog</code> expects to find a pointer to an <em>object</em> -- that is, a memory location -- when it finds the <code>%@</code> format specifier. Obviously a floating-point number cannot be a valid memory address, so the program crashes. Xcode doesn't  fix it because <code>NSLog</code> takes a string and a variable list of arguments. However, in C, you cannot specify types for varargs, so there's no way to tell what type of arguments <code>NSLog</code> <em>should</em> take, in the general case.</p>

<p>(gcc does provide some format-specifier checking when you call <code>printf</code>, but the same doesn't happen with <code>NSLog</code>.)</p>
