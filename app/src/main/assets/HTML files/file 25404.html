<p>The user should not modify that field (unless fiddling with firebug or the like) in the first place so the best bet is to assert that the value is correct and if not, throw an exception (e.g. IllegalStateException) and react to that by showing an error message, e.g.:</p>

<p>Controller:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(..)
public String submit(..) {
    if (hidden field is empty) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Missing XXX");
    }
    ....
   return "redirect:success"
}

@ExceptionHandler
public String handle(IllegalStateException e) {
    logger.warn("User attempted to fiddle with POST data");
    return "error";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where "error" is a sample view name.</p>
