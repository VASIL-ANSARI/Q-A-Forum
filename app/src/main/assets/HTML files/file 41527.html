<p>The best way to tackle this is to set the link to another element above it. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="#intro"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br id="intro"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you jump to just ABOVE the desired top of the page that it jumps to.</p>

<p>p.s. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is just an example. You could also make an empty div, an empty span, or just about anything you want. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is good though because it's a valid and functional element which means the page will have better SEO than having an empty div.</p>
