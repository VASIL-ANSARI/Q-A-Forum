<p>Actually, I'd use the first syntax, expressed as a <code>guard</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>guard passwordField1.text == passwordField2.text else { return }
</code></pre>

<p>This is exactly what <code>guard</code> is for: if conditions are not met, go no further. A succession of multiple <code>guard</code> statements (because multiple conditions must be met) is quite standard.</p>
