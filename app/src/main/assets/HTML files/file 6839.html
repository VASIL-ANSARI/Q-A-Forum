<p>I finally found the answer. It was a bug in Google Visualisations. One part of the pie chart was much bigger than the other parts combined (16.000 for one slice, versus just a handful on the other slices). This caused the pie chart vsiualisation to fail.</p>

<p>Google has promised to fix it in their next release. In the mean time, I worked around it by converting my data to percentages.</p>
