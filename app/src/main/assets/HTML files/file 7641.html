<p>Deleting array elements just sets them to <code>undefined</code> - that's why it is so fast. It does not remove the element. Decreasing the length of the array makes it even worse as the array length doesn't change at all!</p>

<p>In other words: the response to your question title is <em>no</em> and you should use <code>splice()</code> to achieve the intended effect. You can use the delete 'trick' to achieve greater performance only if your code handles the possibility of <code>undefined</code> elements. That can be useful, but it has nothing to do with 'removing an item from an array'.</p>
