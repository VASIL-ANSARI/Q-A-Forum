<p>In your first regular expression, you have indeed only two groups, which gets overwritten all the time. I would suggest a not so ugly solution, by checking the correctness of the url in a regular expression, but in only one whole group, and split and convert the single argument into a dict:</p>

<pre><code>url(r'((?:(?:[a-zA-Z]+)/(?:\d+)/)*)','kwargs.views.aview')

def aview(request,args):
    args = dict(zip(*[iter(args.split('/'))]*2))
    return HttpResponse(args)
</code></pre>

<p>edit: with correct reg-exp.</p>
