<p>If you have the images as a byte array you can use something similar to this in your graph:</p>

<pre><code> jpegs = tf.placeholder(tf.string, shape=(None))
 images = tf.map_fn(lambda jpeg : your_processing_fn(jpeg), jpegs,
                   dtype=tf.float32)
 logits = your_inference_model(images,labels)
</code></pre>

<p>where your_processing_fn is a function which receives a jpeg tensor of bytes, decodes, resizes and crops it and returns a image of H x W x 3</p>

<p>You need the latest version of tensorflow as map_fn is not in 0.8 and below.</p>
