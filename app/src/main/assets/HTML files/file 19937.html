<p>You could try and clear the webview through javascript:</p>

<pre><code>[webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@"document.body.innerHTML = '';"];
</code></pre>

<p>Reloading the web view will set it into a default state where it is not currently being edited and the keyboard is hidden. With the above snippet, you are going to directly change the content of the web view without affecting its state.</p>
