<p>Pinax is just django with a blend of other django plugins. You have to enable them and set them up individually. To use each individual app within pinax, you have to read that specific app's documentation and set it up appropriately (list of apps and repos which likely contain documentation here: <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/ecosystem/" rel="nofollow">http://pinaxproject.com/ecosystem/</a>)</p>

<p>Some people like pinax but I find that its more of a hassel than a solution. In the end pinax doesn't work out of the box. You have to customize everything, but at the same time you position yourself into using a bundle you dont need. I suggest instead starting a project and installing the packages you need individually, and even finding more here: <a href="http://djangopackages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://djangopackages.com/</a>. Especially, if its a big project because then if you bundle/setup everything on your own you will know the ins and outs of it all. </p>
