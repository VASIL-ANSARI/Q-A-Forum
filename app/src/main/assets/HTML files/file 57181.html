<p>You can not use method like this with UITapGestureRecognizer</p>

<p><code>-(void)tapActionWithBolck:(void(^)(NSInteger idx))completion;</code></p>

<p>it should be like that</p>

<p><code>-(void)tapAction:(UIGestureRecognizer *)sender;</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>-(void)tapAction;</code></p>

<p>If you want to use block on tap, you should keep it in variable (in init for example) and than call it in method. But keep in mind about <em>retain cycles.</em></p>
