<p>Actually, now I have duplicated your error -- if your data only has 2 sections before this update (which is what's implied by the error message), then you can't reload sections 1 and 2. Did you mean to update 0 and 1? I'm guessing that when the reload happens, it must first delete the old data and add the new, so that's where the delete error message is coming from.</p>
