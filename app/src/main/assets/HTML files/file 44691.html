<p>Looks to me like you are attempting to locate an object in a table view from the notification object... </p>

<p>You should be calling the index path method on your table view object, not your notification object. </p>

<p>Try matching your local variable:</p>

<pre><code>Object *obj = (Object *)notification.object;
</code></pre>

<p>with:</p>

<pre><code>[self.fetchedResultsController fetchedObjects];
</code></pre>

<p>(if it is the only one that should be relatively easy)...</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *arrayFetchedObjects = [self.fetchedResultsController fetchedObjects];
Object *tableObject = [arrayObjects lastObject];
</code></pre>

<p>(if there is more than one then you might need to filter the <code>arrayFetchedObjects</code> but that is another question)</p>

<p>then locating the position of that fetched object in the table view:</p>

<pre><code>NSIndexPath *indexPath = [self.fetchedResultsController indexPathForObject:tableObject];
</code></pre>
