<p>What you're asking for is the putback method (for more details see: <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/putback/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/istream/istream/putback/</a>). You would have to read everything, filter the part that you don't want to keep out, and put it back into the stream. So for instance:</p>

<pre><code>cin &gt;&gt; myString;

// Do stuff to fill putbackBuf[] with characters in reverse order to be put back

pPutbackBuf = &amp;putbackBuf[0];
do{
    cin.putback(*(pPutbackBuf++));
while(*pPutbackBuf);
</code></pre>

<p>Another solution (which is not exactly what you're asking for) would be to split the input into two strings and then feed the "non-inputted" string into a stringstream and pass that to whatever function needs to do something with the rest of the characters.</p>
