<p>The scala/java system requires that you:<br>
- Build scala first, giving the compiler both scala and java files.<br>
- Build the java sources with the compiled scala classes in the path for javac.  </p>

<p>The second is probably what you lack. Refer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/854264/how-to-add-directory-to-classpath-in-an-application-run-profile-in-intellij-idea">how to add directory to classpath in an application run profile in intellij idea?</a> to add a classpath to Intellij (I suppose you did it for the android runtime, so you probably already know it).</p>
