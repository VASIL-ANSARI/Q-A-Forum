<p>Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/React/Views/RCTSliderManager.m#L50" rel="nofollow">source code for RCTSliderManager</a>, we can see that it only exposes <code>value</code>, <code>maximumValue</code>, <code>minimumValue</code>, <code>minimumTrackTintColor</code> and <code>maximumTrackTintColor</code>. That means like it looks like you're out of luck. You could use the RCTSlider and RCTSliderManager files as a starting point for a custom component, or you could create a pull request to expose <code>setThumbImage</code> on UISlider.</p>
