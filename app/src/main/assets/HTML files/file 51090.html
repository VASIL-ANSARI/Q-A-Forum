<p>I think what the music app is actually doing is fading away the table view's section header, and then change the navigation bar's title to the appropriate words. To change the navigation bar's title you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>self.navigationItem.title = "Flame On"
</code></pre>

<p>And if you want to add a custom view to your navigation bar (maybe some buttons), you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>let myView = UIView()
// Customize myView
self.navigationItem.titleView = myView
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
