<p>Form validation in angular relies on two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your form (or ng-form) element must have a 'name' attribute.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name="myform"&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Your input (or select) fields must have a 'name' attribute and an ng-model.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" name="name" ng-model="name" /&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>The reason that your form and input fields need a name attribute is because that is how you will find the models on $scope and perform client side validation.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code> $scope.myform.name.$error.required
 $scope.myform.name.$valid
 $scope.myform.name.$invalid
</code></pre>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>I see that you've already followed these guidelines in your fiddle.  </p>

<p>The reason that it does not work is because the name attribute cannot be an interpolated value.</p>
