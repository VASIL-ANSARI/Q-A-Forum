<p>You can join entities through this: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/simonince/archive/2009/03/23/mapping-two-tables-to-one-entity-in-the-entity-framework.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/simonince/archive/2009/03/23/mapping-two-tables-to-one-entity-in-the-entity-framework.aspx</a></p>

<p>But I do believe they have to be related; otherwise, how would it know what information was correctly tied to each other?  The only thing it could do is query all rows of one entity and match them up with all rows of the other, which is probably not what's desired.</p>
