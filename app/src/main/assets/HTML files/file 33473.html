<p>With what you explained, I would tell the issue is not from the connection itself. QT doesn't accept parent/child to be located in different thread. This means your whole state machine has to run in one single thread.</p>

<p>In order to run it in a thread different than the main thread you need to create your QStatemachine without parent, add all state and then move it to a different thread using QObject::moveToThread.</p>

<p>You may also fully create your state machine from an other thread altrough I never did that. Creating element in the main is most of the time a more straight forward implementation. You may then move them as you want.</p>

<p>And yes, you may add transition without signals. In this case the state just has to be activate by other means, by reimplementing <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qabstracttransition.html#details" rel="nofollow">QAbstractTransition</a>.</p>
