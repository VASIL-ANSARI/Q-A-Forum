  <p>I want the token to refresh itself until it is not used any more for a limited amount of time - just like a session</p>

<p>This doesn't really make sense (in an OAuth2 context). The access token is issued by the authorization server, which decides how long it is valid for. It is "used" at a resource server, which may be completely separate from the authorization server, so there is no facility in OAuth2 to connect usage with the lifetime of the token. It would in theory be possible to hack something together which made this work, but it sounds like a bad idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I can steal the token, I can steal the refresh token as well. So I guess I don't really see the point in having a refresh token in the first place..</p>

<p>The access token is used repeatedly and sent by the client to servers other than the authorization server. The refresh token is retained by the client and only sent back to the authorization server. A client also has to authenticate to successfully use a refresh token, so the client id and secret would also have to be compromised.</p>

<p>It's not really clear from your question why you are using OAuth2. You should probably expand your question to clarify this. If there is only one client and a REST server, why not just use something like BASIC auth over HTTPS?</p>

<p>Also, is the client a browser-based app? If so, the username/password grant isn't really suitable for use in an untrusted client.</p>
