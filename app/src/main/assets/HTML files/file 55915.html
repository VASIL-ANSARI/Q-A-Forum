<p>I haven't read your code in detail but one obvious issue is that if you want to use a different overriden value for the two securities, you need to submit two separate requests.</p>

<p>If you submit one request for <code>XS0975256685</code> only with the <code>YAS_BOND_PX</code> override set to <code>116</code>, you should get the desired result (I got 101.8739 a minute ago which matches Excel's result at the same moment).</p>

<p>Also note that the returned value does change with the market so you may get different values at each run: refresh your Excel spreadsheet at the same time if you want to verify that the data match.</p>
