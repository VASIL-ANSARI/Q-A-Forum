<p>The current code have some typos (missing closing braclets on the <code>then</code> and <code>myFunction</code>) and a big flaw.</p>

<p><code>setTimeout</code> is not a blocking Function, so you are running in the <code>while</code> loop more times that you think.
you are creating a LOT of 'later function' that will execute after 5 sec'.</p>

<p>right now, the flow of your code do this..</p>

<ol>
<li>WHILE ...</li>
<li>CREATE A FUNCTION, BUT DONT RUN IT NOW ...</li>
<li>RETURN TO THE WHILE ...</li>
</ol>

<p>line 2 will run thousand of times even before the first 5 sec will pass..</p>

<p>Here is your code, without typos, but the main issue still remains.</p>

<pre><code>function myFunction()
{
    var status = null;
    while (status != "complete")
    {
        setTimeout(function()
        {
            callApi('myurl').then(response =&gt; { status = response.status }); //&lt;-- missing ')'
        }, 5000);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>as for the main problem, you should not write code that checks every X sec' if something happend, instead you shoud use the Promise API and add a function to the <code>done</code> event.
that way your desired code will run only when the previous code in the asyncronous function finnished.</p>
