<p>I don't know of any way of intersecting a whole rectangle. But you can intersect a point, so you could build a more complicated check out of that:</p>

<pre><code>var el= document.elementFromPoint(x, y);
</code></pre>

<p>will give you the highest-stacked element at a particular page-relative co-ordinate. You'll get the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element if no shapes inside the SVG are hit.</p>

<p>This is a non-standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/document.elementFromPoint">Mozilla extension</a>, but it works on WebKit as well. Unfortunately, though it exists in Opera, it won't look inside <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>, so on that browser the element will always be the SVGSVGElement.</p>
