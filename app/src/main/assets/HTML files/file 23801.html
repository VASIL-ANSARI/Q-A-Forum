<p>There is no one stop shop that includes a date picker and a time picker, both are seperate</p>

<p>so basically you need a date field that shows a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DatePickerDialog.html" rel="nofollow">DatePickerDialog</a> and a time field that show a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/TimePickerDialog.html" rel="nofollow">TimePickerDialog</a> when clicked</p>
