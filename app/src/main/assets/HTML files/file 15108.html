<p>I'm assuming this is in the emulator and not on a device.  If it is a device, ignore the rest.  :p</p>

<p>It sounds like you saved a snapshot of the emulator as the debugger was connecting.</p>

<p>To fix:</p>

<p>1) Go to the AVD control panel, click on the emulator that's affected and hit start<br>
2) when the window pops up, de-select "Launch from snapshot" and leave "Save to Snapshot" selected<br>
3) Start the emulator.<br>
4) Close the emulator<br>
5) On the AVD control panel again start the emulator
6) Check "Launch from snapshot" again</p>

<p>That should fix things up.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>.</p>

<p>Sorry for the wasted space, I read too fast and missed you talking about trying disabling USB Debugging.  I have run into the above situation I describe before so I'll leave this answer posted for those who come along who do have such an issue.</p>
