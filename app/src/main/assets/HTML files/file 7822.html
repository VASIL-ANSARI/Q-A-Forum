<p>The easiest way to simply post to a social networks wall is to use sharekit <a href="http://getsharekit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://getsharekit.com/</a></p>

<p>However if you need to post to another users wall you will need to get their facebook id
then to post to their Facebook you need to call the feed api with correctly encoded contents</p>

<p><code>[facebook requestWithGraphPath:@"[friend_ID]/feed" andParams:params andHttpMethod:@"POST" andDelegate:self];</code></p>
