<p>e.Handled is a bool property that says if the event should propagate further down or up the visual tree. When you don't want the event to propagate, you set this property to true to say that the event was handled.</p>

<p>You need to send your data, and not this bool.</p>

<p>To do this, you should get the DataContext and send that as parameter.</p>

<pre><code>private void txtEventName_Tapped(object sender, TappedRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Event ev = (sender as TextBlock).DataContext as Event;
    Frame.Navigate(typeof(EventPage), ev);
}
</code></pre>
