<p>I'd look into the XML output generated by doxygen which might have the information you need, although you may need to run doxygen again.  </p>

<p>You can add a preprocessor script prior to running doxygen that will generate the metrics for you and create a set of pages to display this information.  (Look into the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/config.html#cfg_input_filter" rel="nofollow">INPUT_FILTER</a> option in the Doxyfile)</p>

<p>I'd also post this question to doxygen-users@lists.sourceforge.net if you haven't already done so.</p>
