<p>Yes, this is very possible. Your reasons for migration aside, I would advise you to look at <a href="https://github.com/facebook/graphql" rel="nofollow">Facebook's GraphQL</a>. It's a query language and execution engine tied to any backend service. There is already a bundle for this here <a href="https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQLBundle" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQLBundle</a>. </p>

<p>Expose your doctrine queries and persistence via GraphQL and changing it from Doctrine to raw PHP, or from Symfony to Django or Java, or back to Symfony and whatever client consumes your API wont know a thing and thus will never break.</p>
