<p>There is a difference between keypress &amp; keyup. This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1367700/whats-the-difference-between-keydown-and-keypress-in-net">link</a> can be useful.</p>

<p>So I have replaced the keypress with keyup</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" data-bind="event: {'keyup': enterKey}, value: customer.telephone"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and it seems to be working.Hope this will be helpful to you.</p>
