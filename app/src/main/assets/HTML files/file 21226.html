<p>Adding a <code>UITableViewCellAccessoryDisclosureIndicator</code> will shrink the space allotted for your cell's contentView.</p>

<p>You either have to create your own disclosure indicator as an image subview or you need to fix the constraints on the label(s) with the numbers.</p>

<p>Or instead of using the cell's textLabel for the numbers and then right align it, you could setup up own <code>UILabel</code> which you add to the cell's contentView. For the UILabel subview you make sure it does not extend beyond the cell's width as if it had a disclosure indicator. You can set the background colour of your UILabel to red or something which will help you align the labels correctly.</p>
