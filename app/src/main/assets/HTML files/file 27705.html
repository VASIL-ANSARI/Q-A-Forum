<p>Might be because you are multiplying strings with numbers and maybe Safari on the iPad has a stricter JS engine?</p>

<p>Thats all I could think of, e.g. this line:</p>

<pre><code>$("#co2emission").html(toLocalFormat($("#leistung").html()*$('#slider-vertical').val()*0.00055/0.9, true));
</code></pre>

<p>Takes an html string and multiplies it by a number.
Thats all I can think of right now :)</p>
