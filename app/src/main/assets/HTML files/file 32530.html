<p>I got a answer to my question at one of the other forums.</p>

<p>Basically the reason MVC binder is returning a array is because it does not understand what type of data/control is used in the html and the model binder fails.</p>

<p>I got around my issue by modifying the model to have two different property a</p>

<pre><code>public String StringValue
public Bool BooleanValue
</code></pre>

<p>I use the StringValue field when the Type  is String , Date , Number etc.
I use the BooleanValue for  field with Type as Boolean.</p>

<p>Its not the cleanest approach but it will  have to do till the point I write my own custom model binder.</p>

<p>Thanks to bruce who answered my question here <a href="http://forums.asp.net/p/1961776/5605374.aspx?Re+MVC+4+Postback+returns+a+array+for+property+of+type+object+in+my+model" rel="nofollow">http://forums.asp.net/p/1961776/5605374.aspx?Re+MVC+4+Postback+returns+a+array+for+property+of+type+object+in+my+model</a>
I now understand why the model binder fails.</p>

<p>Pasting his answer here for the benefit of others </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you need to understand how browser postback is done. on form submit a collection of name/value pairs is sent. the name is the form element name, the value is the elements value. standard url encoding is done. so for:
    
  the postdata is
     foo=1&amp;bar=true
  note the post data is just a string with no type data. the brwser allows duplicate name, so
    
  the post data is:
     foo=1&amp;foo=true
  when asp.net load the post data into the form collection (which is just a dictionary), it can not add the key "foo" twice, but concats the values seperated by a "," ("1,true"). the binder just treats it as a string array named foo with 2 values.
  now we get to another browser behavior. form elements that support checked (radio and checkbox) are only include the post data if checked. this causes a problem for the mvc binder with checkbox, becuase it can not tell from the postback data if the element was not checked or not included. this is important if you are using tryupdate to apply only a subset of the model properties, becuase only a subset was rendered. to get around this, the checkbox helper renders two fields with the same name, a hidden with the value "false" and a checkbox with the value "true".
