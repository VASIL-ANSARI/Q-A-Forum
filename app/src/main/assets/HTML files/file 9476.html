<p>As Alex mentioned, you <em>can</em> run into problems - the documentation of the class states that it's not thread safe (at least not the methods used to read / write objects). By doing a quick look on reflector it seems like the serialization can actually work (assuming you're not serializing the same object at the same time in different threads, that's a whole new can of worms), but since it's an internal implementation detail, it's possible that in a new version of the framework the class has some change (i.e., optimization) and that won't be true anymore.</p>

<p>An option which you can consider is to have a <em>pool</em> of serializers which can be reused. Your code would take one serializer from the pool, use it to serialize / deserialize, and then return it to the pool. This way you get the benefit of reusing the instances, but without the risk of using a thread-unsafe class in multiple threads.</p>

<p>Finally, have you verified that the creation of the serializers is indeed a problem (i.e., by profiling)? It's possible that the time it takes is negligible in your scenario, and using some sort of reuse would just add unnecessary complication to your code.</p>
