<p>I got through the answer after wasting a day so taking some time to write the answer</p>

<p>This is as per the solution given by @Neoh in this link <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17029780/display-good-looking-math-formula-in-android">Display Good-looking Math Formula in Android</a></p>

<p>Note the mistake which I initially made : DO NOT COPY THE ASSESTS.ZIP file in your assets folder instead copy the MathJax folder in the asset folder.</p>

<p>After this you might face the issue which gives ResourceNotFoundException for no reason and you might think that its something in the code that's missing but its not like that.Its a bug in Android buildToolVersion 21.0.1 which I was able to trace it there was one very very useful solution which help me notice this and solve this problem
