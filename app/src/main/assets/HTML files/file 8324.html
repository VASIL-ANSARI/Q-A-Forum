<p>You could set up a variable the first time the page loaded as something like:</p>

<pre><code>var pagetitle = $('title').text();
</code></pre>

<p>And then in your code simply write</p>

<pre><code>$(this).text(pagetitle + html);
</code></pre>

<p>This would mean that you would be resetting the title every time and simply appending the newest data.</p>
