<p>1) You should find out if you need to scale Redis before worrying about how to scale Redis.</p>

<p>2) Redis is an in-memory dataset (http://redis.io/topics/introduction); so it doesn't have to persist to disk.</p>

<p>3) I'd recommend following the advice given in SignalR wiki (https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/wiki) for setting up SignalR (the fact you're using AWS EC2 doesn't really matter) - then come back with any specific issues.</p>
