<p>I personally went with option 2 for my app. Mainly because if you use python to render the graphs, it kind of adds some load on your server, when you can actually just pass the data to the client and then have the client machine render the graphs with js. I'm using <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/" rel="nofollow">Highcharts.js</a> to do the graph rendering.</p>

<p>From my app development experience, its always better to push the processing to the client if possible. Just prep the data so that it can be consumed by the js library.</p>
