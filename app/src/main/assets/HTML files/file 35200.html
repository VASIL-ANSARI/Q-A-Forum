<p>Your code does not test for the empty list -- that is where there are no elements in the list and the head is NULL.</p>

<p>Also, you are missing any constructors which is initializing the class, so it may very well be that <code>head</code> has an undefined value -- also there <code>add</code> method make not use of the loop, or make any recording of the added elements...</p>

<p>So in short, there are a lot of programming issues to fix.</p>
