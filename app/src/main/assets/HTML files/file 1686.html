<p>sqlite has a very limited number of datatypes. According to the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html" rel="nofollow">Documentation</a> it has the following 5 datatypes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NULL</strong>. The value is a NULL value.</li>
<li><strong>INTEGER</strong>. The value is a signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.</li>
<li><strong>REAL</strong>. The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.</li>
<li><strong>TEXT</strong>. The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).</li>
<li><strong>BLOB</strong>. The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.</li>
</ul>

<p>So to answer your question, no, sqlite and mysql do not have the same datatypes.</p>
