<p>Hardcode the first index to have a value of 1, then put each term of the sum in its own if statement to check for a negative index. If the index is negative, don't include it in the sum.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could just hardcode the first three values, then start at 4 and not worry about it.</p>
