<p>On your loanAmount field in Report Studio, set the Property 'Aggregate Function' to minimum, maximum, or average.  This will stop it from summarizing.</p>

<p>You are going to have problems with Rollup Aggregate if you are summarizing on ApplicationNo.  </p>

<p>Your ideal reporting facts are going to have Fact data at a single level.  In this case you have two fact columns which are on two seperate levels.  Loan amount at the applicationNo level, and collateralValue at the ApplicationNo,propertyType level.  If you create a report with Total/Subtotal lines, you are going to need to either Throw out the Product type or throw out the Loan Amount in order to get accurate totals.</p>
