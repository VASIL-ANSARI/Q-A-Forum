<p>I like combination of option #2 and option #1 - to use int's but have dictionary table in another database.<br>
Let me explain:  </p>

<ul>
<li>to store int and text in a table which is in another database; </li>
<li>in origin table to store int only;</li>
<li>do not join table from another database to get text but cache  dictionary on client and resolve text from that dictionary</li>
</ul>
