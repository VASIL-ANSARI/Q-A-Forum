<p>Square Odd Window Size just means that the filter window is square (N by N) and N is odd. N being odd ensures a well defined center to the window.  1D separable smoothing is a method used to implement 2D smoothing. It allows for you to smooth and image in O(MÂ²N) time rather than O(MÂ²NÂ²) where M is the height and width of the image being smoothed.</p>

<p>If you do smoothing in the frequency domain using an FFT you can do this in O(MÂ²logÂ²(M) + NÂ²logÂ²(N)) which is an order of magnitude speed up if the smoothing filter is large.</p>
