<p>Yes, it looks as though too many cooks contributing to my original code made it messier than it had to be.  Throwing out all the stuff between the if/end if and replacing with </p>

<pre><code>Dim strFileName as String = System.IO.Path.GetFileName(FileUpload1.PostedFile.FileName)
Dim attachment as New Attachment(FileUpload1.PostedFile.InputStream, strFileName)
email.Attachments.Add(attachment)
</code></pre>

<p>took care of everything--and was much simpler than all the sites made it look like it could be
  Thanks</p>
