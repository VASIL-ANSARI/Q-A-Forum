<p>The problem in this case was that there was an <strong>outlet set on the view controller</strong>.</p>

<p>If there are any outlets on the initial view controller (or, if the initial view controller is a navigation controller, the root view controller), the system will not render any launch image, and instead show a black screen.</p>

<p>In my case I have my target's <strong>Main Interface</strong> set to the same value as the <strong>Launch Screen File</strong> (both set to storyboards). Once it launches the real app, I want to manipulate the view a bit (hence why I had an IBOutlet). After deleting the IBOutlets, I was able to manipulate the view by using <code>-[UIView viewWithTag:]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the view controller is being used to render an image for the launch screen, none of the code in the class is called (e.g. <code>-[UIViewController viewDidLoad]</code> is never called). On the other hand, when the view controller is being used for the <strong>Main Interface</strong>, the code is executed normally, as you would expect.</p>
