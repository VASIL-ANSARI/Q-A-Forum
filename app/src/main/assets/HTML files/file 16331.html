<p>Can't you then do something like:</p>

<pre><code>private byte[] currFrame;
private byte[] prevFrame;    

private void copyFrame(byte[] a){
        if(a != null) prevFrame = a;
}

mCamera.setPreviewCallback(new PreviewCallback() {
            public void onPreviewFrame(byte[] data, Camera camera) {
                synchronized (SampleViewBase.this) {
                    copyFrame(currFrame);              
                    currFrame = data;
                    SampleViewBase.this.notify();
                }
            }
        });  
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure that's proper Java syntax but just copy the <code>currentFrame</code>, before assigning <code>data</code> to it. Anyway, I think you can also use the <code>VideoCapture</code> class to obtain the frames already in a <code>Mat</code> format. I'm not sure if this class is still available in the latest release, but from my experience with Opencv 2.3 it was much faster to use it to grab camera frames than to use the Android camera.</p>
