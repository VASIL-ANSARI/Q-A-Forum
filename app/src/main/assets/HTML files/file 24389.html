<p>Apologies if I'm misparsing something, but it looks like once the button is clicked, you're then starting a new thread  (in MainTimer_Elapsed) every 10 milliseconds?  Without knowing more about the context / versions, it's hard to give  specific advice on an alternative (async/await, TPL, etc), but off-hand it seems like anything creating new threads (especially non-background threads) like that is doing so unnessarily?</p>

<p>For processing non-UI work, perhaps use ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem instead of creating your own? For UI work, maybe use BackgroundWorker? If you're exhausting the thread pool, you could also consider setting things like max thread count, but using TPL and avoiding the use/creation/management of threads would be better/simpler IMHO if you're able to target .Net 4.x</p>
