<p>You get a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError, which means that the JVM can't initialise the class, not that it can't find the class which would be a ClassNotFoundException. A NoClassDefFoundError can be caused by a ClassNotFoundException but that need not be the case.</p>

<p>In order to find the cause, stop the server, delete the log and start again. Then reproduce the error and try to find the first Exception and its cause in your log file. If you are lucky this is the cause for the NoClassDefFoundError.</p>

<p>You also might indicate in your question which server you are using. It might make a difference how to solve the error.</p>
