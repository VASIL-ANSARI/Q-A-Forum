<p>Unfortunately, the documentation is a little obtuse here.
It's actually only documented on <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED" rel="nofollow">ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can not receive this through components declared in manifests,
  only by explicitly registering for it with Context.registerReceiver().
  See ACTION_BATTERY_LOW, ACTION_BATTERY_OKAY, ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED,
  and ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED for distinct battery-related broadcasts
  that are sent and <strong>can be received through manifest receivers</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, as I understand the documentation, ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED can only be received by a registered receiver, and ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED can only be received by a receiver named in the manifest.</p>
