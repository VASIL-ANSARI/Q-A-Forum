<p>Because it also implements <a class='doc-link' href="http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/c%23/1795/idisposable-interface/8699/using-keyword-and-idisposable#t=201608091326244960503"><code>IDisposable</code></a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of Using statement is that when control will reach end of using it will dispose that object of  using block and free up memory. its purpose is not only for auto connection close, basically it will dispose connection object and obviously connection also closed due to it.</p>

<p>Its purpose is to free up the resources that we used inside the Using statement.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/yh598w02.aspx" rel="nofollow"><strong>MSDN:</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a rule, when you use an <code>IDisposable</code> object, you should declare and instantiate it in a using statement. The using statement calls the <code>Dispose</code> method on the object in the correct way, and (when you use it as shown earlier) it also causes the object itself to go out of scope as soon as <code>Dispose</code> is called. Within the using block, the object is read-only and cannot be modified or reassigned.</p>
  
  <p>The using statement ensures that <code>Dispose</code> is called even if an exception occurs while you are calling methods on the object. You can achieve the same result by putting the object inside a try block and then calling <code>Dispose</code> in a <code>finally</code> block; in fact, this is how the using statement is translated by the compiler. The code example earlier expands to the following code at compile time (note the extra curly braces to create the limited scope for the object):</p>

<h2>NOTE:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can instantiate the resource object and then pass the variable to the using statement, but this is not a best practice. In this case, the object remains in scope after control leaves the using block even though it will probably no longer have access to its unmanaged resources. In other words, it will no longer be fully initialized. If you try to use the object outside the using block, you risk causing an exception to be thrown. For this reason, it is generally better to instantiate the object in the using statement and limit its scope to the using block.</p>
