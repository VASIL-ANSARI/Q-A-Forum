<p>There is a <code>FolderReferences</code> property in the NotesDocument class in the back-end classes.  I'm not 100% sure if that property is exposed in the COM classes and interop for C#, but if it is, you can use that along with the <code>PutInFolder()</code> method to solve part of your problem.</p>

<p>As far as read/unread marks are concerned, the critical question is whether you are concerned only about the read/unread status for yourself, or whether you are trying to preserve it for all users of the database.  If you only care about unread marks for yourself, then you might be able to use the <code>getAllUnreadDocuments()</code> method of the <code>NotesDatabase</code> class -- but this requires Notes/Domino 8 or above (on the machine where your code is running), and again I'm not sure if this method (or the <code>NotesNoteCollection</code> class that it returns) is exposed via the COM/interop interface for C#.  If it is available, then you can iterate through the collection and use the <code>MarkUnread()</code> method.  If you care about unread marks for all users, then I'm not sure if there is a way to do it at all -- but if there is, it's going to require using calls from the Notes C API.</p>
