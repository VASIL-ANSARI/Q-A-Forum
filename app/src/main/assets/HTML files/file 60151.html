<p>I would suggest a different architecture. Why do you think you need to "count down" anything?!</p>

<p>Meaning: all you care about is that you want to do "something" after a random period of time; so something like this (using pseudo-code) might be easier in the end:</p>

<pre><code>now = ... get current time
then = now + random value

schedule the Swing timer to sent some Event X "then"
</code></pre>

<p>And simply have some code that that reacts to incoming X events. </p>
