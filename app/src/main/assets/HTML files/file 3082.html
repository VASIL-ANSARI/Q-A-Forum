<p>I think rating: $(this).val() is referring to the wrong DOM element. Pull that reference outside the .post method, like so.</p>

<pre><code>var rating = $('#my_rating_elem').val();
$.post('game_rating_submit.cfm', { id: game_id, rating: rating}) ...
</code></pre>

<p>Or make sure that $(this) is referring to the object you expect by assigning it to another local variable</p>

<p>var klass = $(this);
$.post('game_rating_submit.cfm', { id: game_id, rating: klass.val()}) ...</p>

<p>This is necessary because in the context of the .post() method the $(this) is NOT referring to the object you were expecting (which is the $(this) outside the .post())</p>
