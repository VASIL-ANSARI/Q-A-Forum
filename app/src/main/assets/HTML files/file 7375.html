<p>Your best bet would really be to get into header.php (although I can't say where or how without seeing the code, as well as the plugins you're using) and rework the html so that the #socialicons div is where it is supposed to be.  That might be tricky because the menu is currently set up to be the total width of the page.</p>

<p>However:  The quick and dirty hack would be to relatively position the element where you want it.  In your style.css file, on around line 370, where you have this:</p>

<pre><code>#socialicons{margin-top:3px;}
</code></pre>

<p>replace it with this:</p>

<pre><code>#socialicons{
    margin-top:3px;
    position: relative;
    top: 150px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't done any testing outside of firefox with this, so you'll want to make sure it works well.</p>
