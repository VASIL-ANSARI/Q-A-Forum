<p>Please observe that you are assigning the texture of your model to a temporary Texture2D variable, and not setting the Texture present in the Effect currently tied to your mesh. 
If you do the following:</p>

<pre><code>Texture2D textureToSet = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;("MyTex");

//Keep in mind that this method requires a basic effect type and that only one 
//effect is present on each mesh to work properly.
foreach(Mesh mesh in model.Meshes)
{
    ((BasicEffect)(mesh.Effects[0])).Texture = textureToSet;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The quirky stuff going on inside the foreach is simply that you are grabbing the effect, then casting it to a BasicEffect and using its Texture property to give it a new texture to draw when used.
