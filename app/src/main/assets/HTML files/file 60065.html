<p>Contains is awaiting for UserModel instance to be passed, that's why you get error. Just use .Any() instead:</p>

<pre><code>var matches = from p in db.PERSONNEL_MSTR
            where userList.Any(u=&gt; u.ID == p.EMP_ID)
            select p;
</code></pre>

<p>What it does here is: If p.EMP_ID is found inside userList, than it is selected.</p>
