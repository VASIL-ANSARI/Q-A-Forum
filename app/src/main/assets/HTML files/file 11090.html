<p>You may want to consider a parallel http library like <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/typhoeus" rel="nofollow">Typhoeus</a>. It's a ruby API but it uses the C bindings to libcurl for fast parallel fetching.</p>

<p>Another excellent library is <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/em-http-request" rel="nofollow">em-http-request</a>, which runs on the eventmachine event framework for parallel requests.</p>
