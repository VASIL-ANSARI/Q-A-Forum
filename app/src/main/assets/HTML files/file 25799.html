<p>I am assuming your "terms" will be sorted in a descending order as shown in the example you have provided. I would simply establish a delta (say 0.5) which represents a difference small enough to be ignorable.</p>

<p>I would then traverse through the collection of terms adding them a resultant collection and as soon as I see a term within "delta" of my previously seen term, I'll end my iteration and potentially remove the last seen term from my resultant collection as well.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Something that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>delta = 0.5
result = []
for term in termMapSortedKeys:
     if (previousTermValue - delta &gt;= termMap[term]):
          break
     else:
          result.append(term)
          previousTermValue = termMap[term]
del result[-1]
return result
</code></pre>
