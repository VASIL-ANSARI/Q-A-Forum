<p>If I understand you correctly, your problem lies less with parsing the page, but with implementing a logic that successfully decides which image to select. </p>

<p>The first step I think is to decide, which images are news images and which are not (ads for example).</p>

<p>You can find that out by reading the image URL (src-attibute of the image-tag) and checking th host against the article host the middle part ("nytimes" in your example) should be the same.</p>

<p>The second step is to decide which of these is the most important one. For that you can use image size in article, position on page, etc. For step 2 you would have to try out what works best, for most sites. tweak your algorithm, until it produces the best results for most news sites.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>
