<li>Use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern" rel="nofollow">visitor pattern</a> to emulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch" rel="nofollow">double dispatch</a> (this may not be appropriate for your case; I'm not as fond of the visitor pattern as many others are)</li>
</ul>
