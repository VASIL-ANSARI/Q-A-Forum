<p>Rough and untested example.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT symbol, Sub1.aDay, MAX(high) AS high, MIN(low) as low, SUM(volume) as volume,
 (select open from A2A a2 where a1.symbol = a2.symbol and a1.date = a2.date order by time limit 1) as open,
 (select close from A2A a2 where a1.symbol = a2.symbol and a1.date = a2.date order by time desc limit 1) as close
FROM 
(
    SELECT DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL (Tens.a * 10 + Units.a) DAY) AS aDay
    FROM (SELECT 0 AS a UNION SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9) Units,
    (SELECT 0 AS a UNION SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9) Tens
) Sub1
LEFT JOIN A2A a1
ON Sub1.aDay = a1.date
GROUP BY symbol, Sub1.aDay
ORDER BY symbol, Sub1.aDay;
</code></pre>

<p>This is doing a sub query that generates the numbers 0 to 99 and subtracts that as a number of days from the current date. Gives you the 100 day range. Then joins your main table against that list based on the date.</p>
