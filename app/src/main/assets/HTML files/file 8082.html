<p>Okay, here some example code with <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match-all.php" rel="nofollow"><code>preg_match_all()</code></a> that shows how to remove the nesting as well:</p>

<pre><code>$pattern = '\b(?:amsterdam|paris|zurich|munich|frankfurt|bulle)\b';
$result = preg_match_all($pattern, $subject, $matches);

# Check for errors in the pattern
if (false === $result) {
    throw new Exception(sprintf('Regular Expression failed: %s.', $pattern));
}

# Get the result, for your pattern that's the first element of $matches
$foundCities = $result ? $matches[0] : array();

printf("Found %d city/cities: %s.\n", count($foundCitites), implode('; ', $foundCities));
</code></pre>

<p>As <code>$foundCities</code> is now a simple array, you can iterate over it directly as well:</p>

<pre><code>foreach($foundCities as $index =&gt; $city) {
    echo $index, '. : ', $city, "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>No need for a nested loop as the <code>$matches</code> return value has been normalized already. The concept is to make the code return / create the data as you need it for further processing.</p>
