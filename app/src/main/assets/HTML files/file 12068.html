<p>I assume that you have a model that contains a column with some text and that a <code>gtk.CellRendererText</code> widget has a <code>text</code> property set to the column index in that model.</p>

<p>If you add a new column to that model you can use it to set the font weight used in every cell renderer. To do that just set the <code>gtk.CellRendererText</code> widget <code>weight</code> property to the new column index in the model and <code>weight-set</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>After that, you just need to set the font weight in the model using any of the <code>pango.WEIGHT</code> constants such as <code>pango.WEIGHT_NORMAL</code> and <code>pango.WEIGHT_BOLD</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, let's say that these are your model columns (one for the text, one for the font weight):</p>

<p>and these are a couple of rows that you've added for testing:</p>

<p>(Note that <code>pango.WEIGHT_NORMAL=400</code> and <code>pango.WEIGHT_BOLD=700</code>)</p>

<p>With this model, you create a <code>gtk.TreeView</code> with a column and a text renderer:</p>

<p>In the renderer you set the <code>text</code> property to the <code>text</code> column in the model:</p>

<p>and the <code>weight</code> property to the <code>weight</code> column in the model:</p>

<p>The result that you obtain with the test data that you added to your model is:</p>

<p>Where you can see that the text is displayed with the font weight that is set in the model.</p>
