<p>I can't tell you why your screen is white. If you base it off of the Cocos2D Mac template, check the MainWindow.xib. The Cocos2D view spans the entire window, so just resize it and work with that.</p>

<p>What I <strong>can</strong> tell you is that your goal of <strong>running multiple cocos2d views is futile</strong>: cocos2d only supports a single view. </p>

<p>Support for multiple views has been on the roadmap for years, and it doesn't look like it'll come anytime soon. It's a non-trivial change as well, given how reliant cocos2d is on Singletons for many core classes (Director, ActionManager, Scheduler, Caches, ...).</p>
