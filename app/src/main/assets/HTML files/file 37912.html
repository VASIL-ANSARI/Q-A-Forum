<p>I found answers to both parts of the question right here on StackOverflow. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First is that I want to enable Grouping by 3</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25253121/android-split-by">Here are several solutions</a> to the grouping problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>another problem is that I want Results with up to 25 integer digits </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case what's really happening is that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13542944/how-many-significant-digits-have-floats-and-doubles-in-java">Java doubles can't represent 25 decimal digits</a>.</p>

<p>For this problem you might want to look at the BigDecimal class, which can represent the numbers in your example.</p>
