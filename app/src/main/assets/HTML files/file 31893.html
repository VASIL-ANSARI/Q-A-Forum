<p>First of all I'd highly recommend you use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=30425" rel="nofollow">Open XML SDK 2.5 Productivity tool</a>, that way you'll have a better idea of what you're working with.</p>

<p>Secondly a bookmark in Word does not have any value associated with it. It is usually marks a location in the word document. So what you're trying to do wont work.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;w:bookmarkStart w:name="bkStart" w:id="0" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>that is the XML element that is created in the docx file when you add a bookmark to the document.</p>
