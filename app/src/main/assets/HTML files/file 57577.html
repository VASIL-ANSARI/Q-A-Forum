<p>In addition to Zohar's suggestion, I would create a hierarchy for property attributes.   This way, the hierarchy does the heavy lifting and classification.  For example, in the hierarchy listed below, a property can be Beach Front and Resort town as well.</p>

<pre><code>Prop_Def
---------------------------------------
PropID,{..Prop Specific Details...}


Table Prop_Features  (1-many)
---------------------------------------
PropID,FeatureID
