<p>In comments you stated that you removed the read method. Unfortunatelly, this method is called on any socket action including query(). So put the method back.</p>

<p>Here is the method called on query:</p>

<pre><code>$response = $class::read($address, $port, $errno, $errstr, $timeout, $write, $latency);
</code></pre>

<p>It is defined on line 123.</p>
