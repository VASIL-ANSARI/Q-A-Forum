<p>This is what a I did to resolve my problem:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($invoice as $key =&gt; $value) {
        $date = Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s', $value-&gt;created_at);
        $result[$value-&gt;quote_number] = $date-&gt;day;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then i used <code>array_count_values($result)</code> to get what I wanted, maybe there is a builtin function to do what I needed thats why I wont choose this as the answer for now.</p>
