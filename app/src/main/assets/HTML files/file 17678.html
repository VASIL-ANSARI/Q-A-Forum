<p>You need to reinitialize your fd sets before every <code>select</code> call.  So, the loop in your program would look like:</p>

<pre><code>while(1)
{
    FD_ZERO(&amp;rfs);
    FD_ZERO(&amp;wfs);
    FD_SET(mouse_fd, &amp;rfs);
    FD_SET(kbd_fd, &amp;rfs);
    FD_SET(mouse_fd, &amp;wfs);
    FD_SET(kbd_fd, &amp;wfs);

    select((fd_max+1),&amp;rfs,NULL,NULL,NULL);

    // proceed normally
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, per <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12619683/select-isnt-responding-to-writing-on-dev-input-mice#comment17015708_12619683">User1's comment on your same question on Stack Overflow</a>, you need to open the devices for reading, because you are trying to read data from them:</p>

<pre><code>// Open device for reading (do you mean to use "/dev/input/mice" here?)
if ((mouse_fd = open("/dev/input/event3", O_RDONLY)) == -1)
</code></pre>

<p>Linux includes a <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/select_tut.2.html">select_tut(2)</a> tutorial manpage with explanations of how to use <code>select</code> and an example program which can be useful as a reference. "Select Law" #11 reminds you that you need to reinitialize your fd sets before each call to <code>select</code>.</p>
