<p>The first thing that hits me in the eye is the following:</p>

<pre><code>if(head == NULL)     &lt;--- lets assume that head was null
{
    head = newNode;  &lt;---- executed
}

else
{                    &lt;---- not executed, skipped
    curr = head;     &lt;---- this is skipped, curr is not assigned to head
    prev = NULL;

    //Traverse
    while(curr != NULL) { ... }
}  

if(curr == head)    &lt;----- Huh... What is curr right now? When was 
                           curr last set to a value 
{ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not saying that segmentation fault is caused by this, I'm just saying that this piece of code is fishy.</p>
