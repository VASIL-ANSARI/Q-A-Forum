<p>It's probably the same old IE P3P issue. With IE's default settings, if a cookie is set without a P3P header also present in the response, the cookie is marked as "first-party only". Which means that in a third-party context, such as an iframe or a CORS request, IE will refuse to send the cookie.</p>

<p>To fix it, you need to supply a P3P header when setting the cookies. See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537343%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537343%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a> for details.</p>
