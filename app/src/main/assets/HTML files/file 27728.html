<p>The problem is that you are removing an item using an iterator (good practice) but the other iterator is not aware of that. Hence, the call to <code>it.next()</code> fails.</p>

<p>You should try to use only one iterator or remove items after looping.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : After analyzing your question, it seems that your need is to create a Collection of unique items. This makes me think that you would like to use a Set with a well-formed Comparator. In this way, adding all your items to your Set will automatically remove duplicates.</p>
