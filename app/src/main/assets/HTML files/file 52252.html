<p>fixed it, turns out i was just having an issue where the sand texture wouldn't actually draw.</p>

<p>The full story was that i had a ctx.drawImage that looked like:</p>

<pre><code>ctx.drawImage(tileset, mapdata[x][y][z][dx], mapdata[x][y][z][dy], 64, 32, 0, 0, 64, 32);
</code></pre>

<p>Where dx and dy are that images posistion on that tile.</p>

<p>What was happening was that dx and dy was pointing to an empty area on the image, so no image was actually drawn under the blue tile.</p>

<p>I've fixed it now and the images now correctly overlay on each other.</p>
