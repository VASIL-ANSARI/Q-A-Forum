<p>The first reason would be the misuse of the <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>jQuery has an idiom for looping over selected elements..</p>

<pre><code>var top = 0;
$('.positionableDiv').each(function() {
   $(this).css('top',top+'px');
   top = top + 30;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Please take a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in">for...in</a> for a better understanding of the way a for...in loop works in javascript, it does not enumerate in the same way as say .NET or Java.</p>
