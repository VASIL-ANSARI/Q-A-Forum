<p>The example given in the README was not for ActiveRecord integrations -- just for plain Ruby classes.  In an ActiveRecord integration there's no need to do anything special in your initialize method in order for state_machine to work.  By overriding your initialize method, you're changing the method signature that ActiveRecord depends on.  If you're not doing anything else in that override, I suggest you remove it altogether.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
