<p>OK, so you've built a kinda bot that performs <strong>ADMINISTRATIVE</strong> tasks for you on your website, hosted by some hosting provider, right?</p>

<p>And you claim that you can achieve the same result, albeit slower, by performing the said task yourself.</p>

<p>If you're simply automating the task, then the memory "footprint" in the host is the same as if you were doing the task yourself. </p>

<p>However, there are ways to detect the use of a bot, that is, repetitive tasks that is being processed far faster than a human being could do. That's one way how they detect the usage of bots in, say, WoW.</p>
