<p>You are describing a form of <em>denormalization</em> - you are introducing a <em>redundant</em> copy<sup>1</sup> of data to speed-up the querying.</p>

<p>However, as others have already hinted, you then run the risk of leaving these two copies out of sync, and effectively corrupting the data. And in a concurrent environment, where an independent concurrent transaction may modify the other copy, it is very easy not to be careful and forgo proper concurrency control (such as locking), leading to hard-to-reproduce <em>race conditions</em>.</p>

<p>For this reason, the general goal of database design is normalization<sup>2</sup>, not denormalization. Denormalization should be used very carefully and only <em>after</em> you have performed <strong>measurements on realistic amounts of data</strong> and concluded it is absolutely necessary performance-wise.</p>

<p>In your case, denormalization is unlikely to be necessary. I suspect direct querying<sup>3</sup> will probably work just fine, assuming <a href="http://use-the-index-luke.com/" rel="nofollow">proper indexing / clustering</a>.</p>

<p><em><sup>1</sup> The term "copy" should not be taken too literally in this context. Essentially, whenever you can infer a piece of data from other piece of data you are making a "copy", even if it has a different "shape".</em></p>

<p><em><sup>2</sup> I.e. removal of redundancies and in doing so removal of opportunities to corrupt data. In other words: if something can be inferred, it should not be stored.</em></p>
