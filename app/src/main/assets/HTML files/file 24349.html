<p>Actually, what is more interesting, is that the documentation says that MySQL is smart enough to do this (see <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/optimizer-primary-optimizations.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>

<p>This would seem to come under the heading "8.2.1.2. Eliminating âDeadâ Code".</p>

<p>I suppose the reason is that the developers did not consider an expression such as " is not null" when the code was written.  The documentation gives many examples based on constant propagation (<code>x1 = 2 and x2 = x1</code> becomes <code>x1 = 2 and x2 = 2</code>).  <code>is null</code> probably does arise in this situation.</p>
