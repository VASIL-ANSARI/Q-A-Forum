<p>With new browsers: use the <code>:invalid</code> psuedo-selector and the <code>required</code> attribute. In older browsers you'll need JavaScript.  </p>

<p>If your framework is getting in the way of adding an HTML5 attribute I'd question the framework (or look at updating the version), but you could always use a shim if needed with something along the lines of (assuming jQuery):</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $(".required.").attr("required", "true");
});
</code></pre>

<p>Less than ideal, but simple enough that it shouldn't pollute the system.</p>
