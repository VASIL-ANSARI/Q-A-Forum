<p>What I did:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate a gravatar with a non-existing e-mailadress</li>
<li>Save the image</li>
<li>Make a MD5 checksum of the images contents and store it as a constant in your app code</li>
</ul>

<p>After that I did this for every gravatar request:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the gravatar image</li>
<li>MD5 checksum the contents and compare it against the constant</li>
<li>If it matches it's the default image, if it doesn't it is a custom image</li>
</ul>

<p>I also cached the gravatar image for 24 hours so you don't have to rely on gravatar all the time. Optionally you can put the first 3 points in a function and let it run once in a while to ensure that gravatar still uses the same default image allthough they haven't in at least the last couple of months (propably never).</p>
