<p>You should indent your main function with spaces or tabs. (4 spaces is recommanded)</p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>def main()
    num=input()
    # rest of your main code

main()
</code></pre>

<p>I saw you allready did this for if/else, you should also do it for functions. </p>

<p>I recommand you take a beginner python course like te one of codecademy. </p>
