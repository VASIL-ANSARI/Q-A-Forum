<p>The difference is that thickbox uses the css position:fixed to align the box, whereas colorbox uses a relative position. In the colorbox.css file try changing the line "#colorbox{}" to "#colorbox{position:fixed}" I tested it in Firebug and that seems to fix it. </p>

<p>The position fixed CSS won't work in IE6.</p>
