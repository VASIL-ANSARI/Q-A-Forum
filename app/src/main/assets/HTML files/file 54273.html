<p>Probably the problem is with your file path where you are writing the contents. You need to add the file name in the file path which makes it a fully qualified path.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<p><code>$img = 'C:\xampp\htdocs\myproject\assets\test.png';</code></p>

<p>Also make sure you have write permission for the folder.</p>
