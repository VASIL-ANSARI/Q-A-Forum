<p>Well, when you talk about peformance of TreeSet and HashSet you should clearly understand how these structures are organized what consequences of its organization.</p>

<p>Typically TreeSet is a structure where all elements are organized in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree" rel="nofollow">a binary tree</a>. Thus adding a member or accessing it is ~<code>O(log(N))</code>.</p>

<p>In other hand HashSet is a structure similar to an array. The difference is that in an array index is an unique number, while in a HashSet each key needs to be translated into index with the help of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" rel="nofollow">a hash function</a>. A hash function may produce the same results for different input data, the situation is called <code>hash collision</code>. A good hash function (yes, they could be bad and good) produces as many unique results on a given set of input data as possible.</p>

<p>So accessing data in a hash set costs calculations of a hash function (in Java usually this is <code>.hashCode()</code>) and possible conflict resolution. That is its estimated as O(1) i.e. a constant number of operations.</p>

<p>You should understand that O(1) is not always less than O(log(n)), it's less asymptotically and on big enough <code>n</code>. Also a proper choice of a hash function does matter.</p>
