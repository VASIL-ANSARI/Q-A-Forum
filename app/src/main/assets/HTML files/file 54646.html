<p>So, I figured out what I got wrong, and I think I should post the answer for someone who might has a similar question.</p>

<p>Turns out, I should have read the documentation of mpi4py better :D</p>

<p>The command <code>mpirun -np 5 python 5_test.py</code> is for running the program an a single, multi-core host on different processes.</p>

<p>However, I wanted to distribute the task across various host. Therefore I needed the command <code>mpirun --hostfile &lt;hostfile&gt; python 5_test.py</code>. And <code>&lt;hostfile&gt;</code> must be a file looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>-- hostfile --

host1   slots=4

host2   slots=4

host3   slots=4

'--------------


.
</code></pre>
