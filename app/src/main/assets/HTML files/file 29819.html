<p>Use this approach: Create a helper function which wraps <code>f()</code> and which doesn't return the result but puts it into a queue (maybe additionally returning it).</p>

<p>Now start the normal / usual process but don't wait for all threads to terminate. Instead, just wait for an item to show in the queue. If you get one, you can terminate the other threads and return.</p>
