<p>So far I cannot think of any other way than using a proxy that would record all requests made by browser. It is possible to set up such a proxy and control it from your code. You didn't specify the language you use for writing your tests. If it's Java then <a href="https://github.com/webmetrics/browsermob-proxy" rel="nofollow">Browsermob</a> may be helpful. If it's C# take a look at <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler/Core/" rel="nofollow">FiddlerCore</a>.</p>
