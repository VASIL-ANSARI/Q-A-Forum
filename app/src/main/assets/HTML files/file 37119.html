<p>If you're using std::string members to get the data you need, you're almost certainly not parsing the XML in the traditional sense of parsing XML.  (That is, you're very probably not making any use of XML's hierarchical structure.  Although you are extracting data from XML, "parsing XML" means something much more specific to most people.)</p>

<p>That said, the C equivalents of the <code>std::string</code> members you seem to be OK with, such as <code>memcmp</code> and the GNU extension <code>memmem</code>, just take pointers and lengths.  Read their documentation and use them in place of their <code>std:;string</code>-member equivalents.</p>
