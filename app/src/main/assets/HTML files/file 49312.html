<p>Only way you can put contracts on iterators is:</p>

<pre><code>public class Graph
{
    public IEnumerable&lt;Node&gt; Nodes(Graph g)
    {
        Contract.Requires(g != null);
        Contract.Ensures(Contract.ForAll(Contract.Result&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Nodei&gt;&gt;, node =&gt; node != null));
        foreach (var x in g.MethodForGettingNodes())
        yield return x;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The contracts above make sure that callers donât pass in a null parameter, and the method itself guarantees
that all elements in the resulting collection are non-null.</p>

<p><strong>Currently, the static checker does not reason about collections and thus will not be able to prove the
postcondition above.</strong></p>

<p>According to documentation they still do not fix it since 2009, I had problems with cc 2 years ago, and they still did not fix it and i think they wont. </p>
