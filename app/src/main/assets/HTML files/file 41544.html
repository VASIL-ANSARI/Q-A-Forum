<p>Your error will be fixed by addressing these statements:</p>

<pre><code>std::string UserChoice = CARDS;
std::string GeneratedCard = CARDS;
</code></pre>

<p>You need to index the array to obtain the proper value for these variables.</p>

<p>Your function parameters are intended to be the arrays containing the five guesses and generated cards, so your function then becomes:</p>

<pre><code>void DisplayCards(int* user, int* generatedCards)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Users Guess" &lt;&lt; "\t\t\t" &lt;&lt; "Generated Cards" &lt;&lt; endl;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i)
    {
        // Get the names of the choices from the deck
        std::string UserChoice = CARDS[user[i]];
        std::string GeneratedCard = CARDS[generatedCards[i]];
        // print the names side by side
        cout &lt;&lt; UserChoice &lt;&lt; "\t\t\t" &lt;&lt; GeneratedCard &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The function parameters are pointers to the first element of the array that is presumably being passed in via the call to this function I cannot see. You'll likely want to include some more error checking, but the gist of it is you can index your input arguments the same way you would a normal array, using your <code>i</code> counter as the index number. You'll get bogus data and perhaps a segmentation fault if your arrays are not the proper size when you run the code, but that's up to you to learn on your own.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
