<p><code>stdin</code> is defined to be a text stream (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf" rel="nofollow">C99</a> 7.19.3.7) which by definition is terminated by only a newline (C99 7.19.2.2). This is complementary to stdout, printf uses only '\n' (not '\r') for a newline.</p>

<p>Assuming your standard input is non-standard for some reason, most platforms will only interpret a newline (pressing enter) as the '\n' character by default. This is often handled by the kernel and you would have to tell it to give you the carriage returns if you really wanted them.</p>

<p>Also, even if your platform does provide the '\r' character, it is possible that the '\n' is presented to stdin before '\r'. Try:</p>

<pre><code>int x,y;
char z1, z2;

scanf("%d", &amp;x);
scanf("%d", &amp;y);
scanf("%c", &amp;z1);
scanf("%c", &amp;z2);

printf("%d %d %d %d\n", x, y, z1, z2);
</code></pre>
