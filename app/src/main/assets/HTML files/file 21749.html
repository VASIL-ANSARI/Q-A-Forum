<p>Normally you want to check whether your attempt at reading succeeded:</p>

<pre><code>while(inf&gt;&gt;theHand.handCards[i])
{
  theHand.totalCards++;
  cout&lt;&lt;theHand.handCards[i];
  i++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you should also normally use <code>std::vector</code> instead of an array, but I guess we can leave that for another question.</p>
