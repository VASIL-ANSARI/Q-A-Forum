<p>HTML is all about semantics. There is no reason <code>username</code> or <code>submit</code> should be inside a paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) because it's not a paragraph.</p>

<p>So I would go using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> instead. Ok, maybe <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has no meaning at all. But it's better than <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>
