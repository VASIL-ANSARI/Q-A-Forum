<p>A couple of solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>2 identical selects, first with the condition address from Paris, second with the condition address not from Paris and UNION and ORDER BY</p></li>
<li><p>in the Select statement, create an artificial column which is 0 when from Paris and 1 otherwise and ORDER BY this</p></li>
<li><p>in the table create a new column with ordinal ordering and ORDER BY this</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The solution choice depends on your needs. I would say, from the maintenance point of view, (3) is best.</p>
