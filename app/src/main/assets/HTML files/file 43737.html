<p>What you can do is to supply a delegate:</p>

<pre><code>public static void BankChoice(Func&lt;ArrayValueType, double&gt; searchBy)
{
    //...
    // use the delegate to evaluate the result for each time you need to get the value from an item in your array.
    tempMin = searchBy(Program.array_SH1[0]);
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>ArrayValueType</code> is the type of object in your array. Then you call it with</p>

<pre><code>BankChoice(x =&gt; x.OpenPrice);
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow you to specify a property to search on, and it will be done in a type safe manner. The only restriction at the moment is that the property is convertible to a <code>double</code>. It's possible to get around that for properties of a generic type, and there are various ways to do that depending on what your needs are.</p>
