<p>Your response is not correct <code>JSONAPI</code>. Also its not clear: Does a <code>channel-application</code> has one or multiple <code>channel</code>s?</p>

<p>Becuase <code>channel: belongsTo('channel'),</code> means it has one <code>channel</code> but then you don't should loop through them like <code>{{#each channelApplication.channels as |channel|}}</code>.</p>

<p>If you have one <code>channel</code> you can't return <code>"channel-id":1,</code> as an attribute, but <em>should</em> return a relationship:</p>

<pre><code>channel: {
  data: {
    type: 'channel',
    id: '1'
  }
}
</code></pre>
