<p>You misunderstanding <code>Exceptions</code>, you want to use <code>Exceptions</code> as rules for your data structure. Instead <code>Exceptions</code> is when an error occour in a method, as you are dividing with <code>0</code> in a math operation. This is a critical error, where the code does not know what to do.</p>

<p>For this concrete example, you should do <code>if</code> statements. Because you want to apply rules and enforce it and <code>Exceptions</code> does not fit these use cases well, if you where to implement it, you would need <code>if</code> statements to check if the string you want to apply the rules to, was well formed after your standards and after that throw an <code>Exception</code>. Moreso this makes sense if you are creating a library.</p>

<p>My solution to what the code should look like.</p>

<pre><code>String text = "A = [8 5 3 4; 2 6 5 3; 8 5 2 3]";

var startIndex = text.IndexOf('[') + 1;
var length = text.IndexOf(']') - startIndex;
text = text.Substring(startIndex, length);

if(!text.Contains(";"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("malformed seperator");

    return;
}

var test = text.Split(';').Select((k, i) =&gt; new {Key = i, Value = k.Replace(" ", "").Length});


if(!test.All(x =&gt; x.Value == test.First().Value))
{
    Console.WriteLine("unbalanced array");
    return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But i think you are making your self work harder then you should, your design implies that a lot of things goes right in the string creation and using already build matrix libraries would save a lot of work here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Updated the solution to work, but i still think the design of the string matrix forces the code in a lot of directions that is unecesary.</p>
