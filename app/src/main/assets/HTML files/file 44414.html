<p>We got into this situation two different ways. It started off by submitting a build, call it 0.9.1. Everyone was happy and could install.</p>

<p>We then submitted 0.9.2, somehow the provisioning profile became invalid after submitting. The result was that folks would get to 90% then be told that it could not be installed.</p>

<p>After we discovered that the profile had gone invalid, we turned off the switch for TestFlight testing. Users that continued to follow the email link would be presented with 0.9.2 even though the build wasn't available and would get the same 90% experience. For these users, we could instruct them to tap the "Close" at the top left where they would return to the list of apps in TestFlight and there they could tap on 0.9.1 and be good to go.</p>

<p>After this I invited some new testers. All of the new tester receive invites for 0.9.2 even though it is disabled, and there doesn't seem to be a way to help them. We are just going to have to submit a new build.</p>
