<p>The problem here is that VB.Net supports multiple ways of using ByRef parameters.  I did a detailed explanation of the types in a recent blog entry</p>

</ul>

<p>What's happening here is that <code>Me</code> is not an assignable value.  So instead of passing <code>Me</code> as a byRef parameter, the VB compiler will instead pass a temporary.  This is loosely known as "Copy Back ByRef".  It effectively generates the following code</p>

<pre><code>Dim temp = Me
Initialize(temp, SomeParam)
</code></pre>

<p>There is no way to work around this in the case of <code>Me</code> because it's not assignable.  In the case of the local variable <code>foo</code> though this works as expected because <code>foo</code> is a valid ByRef value.  </p>
