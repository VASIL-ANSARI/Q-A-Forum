<p>I see a lot of problems at first glance actually.  eg: You've called a hand object 'hand' (thus redefining it), if you're going to call your object names the same as their class/struct, at least differentiate them with capitalization.  eg: call your hand struct "Hand" instead of "hand"</p>

<pre><code>            cout &lt;&lt; "What do you want to bet? ";

            cin  &gt;&gt; player1.bet;  //                      &lt;====  problem              
            cout &lt;&lt; "check";
            if (player1.bet &lt; player1.money){

            }
            else if (player1.bet &gt; player1.money){
                cout &lt;&lt; "\nYou cannot go into debt!!\n";
            }
            else if (player1.bet == 0){
                cout &lt;&lt; "\nYou ended the game!";
                return 0;
            }  
</code></pre>

<p>That being said the issue you are having specifically relating to this section of code probably has something to do with a "\n" staying in the buffer and not getting cleared.  Try using cin.ignore(numeric_limits::max(),'\n');  to solve this problem (don't forget to #include limits as well).  </p>
