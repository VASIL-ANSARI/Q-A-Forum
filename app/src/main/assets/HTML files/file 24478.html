<p>In WPF you normally use the MVVM pattern. If you haven't heard of it, there is a good explanation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel" rel="nofollow">here</a>. So basically, you listbox is just a presentation of an underlying list of data items. You don't change the presentation listboxitems, but instead change the items in the underlying collection and let the WPF UI handle the resulting update of the presentation layer.</p>

<p>You button should activate a command that switches the data in the viewmodel (or even in the model, depending on your needs). For an introduction to commands, you might find <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> interesting.</p>
