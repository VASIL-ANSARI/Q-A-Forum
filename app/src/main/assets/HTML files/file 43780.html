<p>In an expression <code>(1,10,"AAA")</code> means to apply the comma operator.  To initialize an array, you have to provide expressions that can initialize each array member. So one way is:</p>

<pre><code>student a[] = {
    student(1, 10, "AAA"),    // creates a temporary student to use as initializer
    student(2, 20, "BBB"),
    student(3, 30, "CCC") };
</code></pre>

<p>Since C++11 you can write:</p>

<pre><code>student a[] = {  {1, 10, "AAA"}, {2, 20, "BBB"}, {3, 30, "CCC"} };
</code></pre>

<p>because C++11 added the feature that an object's constructor can be called via a brace-enclosed initializer list. This is the same reason you could also write afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>a[0] = { 4, 40, "DDD" };
</code></pre>

<p>Note: as mentioned in comments, <code>char n[]</code> should be <code>char const n[]</code>, and you could improve safety by using <code>std::string name;</code> instead of <code>char name[20];</code>.</p>
