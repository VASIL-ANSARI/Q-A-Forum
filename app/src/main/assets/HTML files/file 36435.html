<p>This is probably Maya/your model related. </p>

<p>Do you have the capability to break the mesh apart and inspect the mapping in a UV editor? 
If so, i'd try exporting piece by piece to pinpoint the problematic values. </p>

<p>If not, try to add some sort of mapping over the entire mesh (like planar) and check if you are still getting these odd values. </p>
