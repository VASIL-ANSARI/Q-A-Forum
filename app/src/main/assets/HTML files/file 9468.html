<p><code>The global object</code> isn't what it's actually going to say. It was implied that it will return the global <code>window</code> object, which is where global variables and such live. Unless you have a global variable named <code>myName</code> the value will be <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
First time through I missed the <code>var myName = 'the global object';</code>. That <code>var</code> makes it it part of the scope it's currently in, so as others have pointed out, unless you're in the global scope, it won't find the variable.</p>
