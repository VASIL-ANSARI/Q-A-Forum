<p>How about a preliminary random variable from 1â5. If a number in [1,4] is chosen then choose an index at random from the set {3,7,9}. Otherwise choose an object at random from the rest of the array.</p>

<p>(Also, since every object in the array has the suffix .png, you might as well remove that and just concatenate it later using <code>stringWithFormat</code>)</p>
