<p>You can set a lifestyle of singleton or transient though on objects in the container. Singleton objects I understand should last the life of the application, but I don't understand the usefulness of this behvaviour being the same for transient ones!</p>

<p>Custom lifestyles can be created by implementing <code>ILifestyleManager</code>. Maybe it's possible to implement this suitably to create a <code>ReallyTransient</code> lifestyle type!</p>
