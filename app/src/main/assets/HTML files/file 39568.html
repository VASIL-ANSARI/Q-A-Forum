<p>Both <code>lib</code> files and <code>exp</code> files are used with native code development (e.g. C++/VB6/Win32) and are not used at all in the .NET world.</p>

<p><code>lib</code> files contain a collection of reusable code or data or both that can be statically linked and reused with your existing code. They are similar to <code>DLL</code> files, except the big difference being DLL files are linked dynamically and <code>LIB</code> files are linked statically, when you compile your program.</p>

<p><code>exp</code> files are export files. There are kind of like metadata files that tell your compiler which functions in a DLL have been exported, and therefore can be reused in your statically linked program. .NET program do not require this because each .NET DLL has a special section called the CLR Metadata section. .NET programs can use reflection to pull this metadata information and see which methods are available.</p>
