<p>I don't think this can work with a union, even supposing the query was generated as you expect. You're querying three different object types. When the ORM gets the rows back from the database, I don't see a way for it to map rows to the right class.</p>

<p>A UNION in this case doesn't make much sense since the third column has a different meaning in all three tables.</p>

<p>You should do the three queries separately, unless your three notification types inherit from a common ORM-mapped class. In that case SQLAlchemy supports querying the four types all at once, although not with a UNION.</p>
