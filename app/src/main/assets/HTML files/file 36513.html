<p>The error means your device has an Android version that is less than your specified minSdkVersion. Set the minSdkVersion to the device's version. If that's not possible, there's really nothing you can do other than using a newer device.</p>

<p>Edit:
Now seeing userM1433372's answer ... That should be the actual issue. Thought you already tried a different SDK version, but you only changed compileSdkVersion to 15 without changing targetSdkVersion! I would suggest setting both targetSdkVersion and compileSdkVersion to 19 (which is the latest non-preview-version).</p>
