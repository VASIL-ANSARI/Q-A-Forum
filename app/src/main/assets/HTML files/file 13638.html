<p>I don't see here what you are doing with <code>dataLabels</code>. Also I only guess that the thing you do not like about your pie chart is that your legend doesn't show labels, right?</p>

<p>I think you should set your data in a different way. Take a look at one of my other examples related to use of pie chart, <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Boro/NYewy/" rel="nofollow">available here</a>. 
Effectively, your problem comes down to setting of a pair, first label then value, to each row of your data, like in the linked code:</p>

<pre><code>var row = [percentage, count];
data.push(row);
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, in your case you would have: </p>

<pre><code>var dataSlices = [];
$.each(data, function (entryindex, entry) {
    var row = [entry['Label'], entry['Value']];
    dataSlices.push(row);
});
</code></pre>
