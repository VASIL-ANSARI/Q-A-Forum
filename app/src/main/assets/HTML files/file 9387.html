<p>Take a look here <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/" rel="nofollow">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/</a></p>

<p>Basically, all a Facebook Canvas is an iframe. And a Facebook App is just a regular ole web app loaded in an iframe.</p>

<p>The biggest restriction to note is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Canvas Page is limited to a maximum of 760 pixel in width. A Canvas Page can be any height, although you will see scrollbars by default if the height exceeds the bounds of outer Facebook.com page. You can control this behavior by turning off scrollbars in the Developer App and using the setSize() function in our JavaScript SDK</p>
