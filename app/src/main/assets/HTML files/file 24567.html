<p>You need to use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getcpu.2.html" rel="nofollow"><code>getcpu()</code></a> system call. As man page says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>determine CPU and NUMA node on which the calling thread is running</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this should serve your purpose. Needs to include <code>&lt;linux/getcpu.h&gt;</code>, with kernel version greater than 2.6.19 and for x86_64, i386 arch.</p>
