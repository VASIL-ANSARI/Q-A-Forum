<p>So somthing like <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/8U9RS/6/" rel="nofollow">this jsfiddle here</a>? You can just add the class <code>opened</code> to the slide you want to show first and remove the class and add it to the next slide onclick. Also <code>position:absolute;</code> makes the elements not get pushed down. You don't need a <code>closed</code> class for what you are trying to do.</p>
