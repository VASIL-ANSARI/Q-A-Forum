<p>In short, yes.</p>

<p>What you have there isn't scalable in the slightest. What you want is to have a table for your assets, a table for the custom parameters and a "link" table. Then, enter multiple values into your link table rather than multiple columns.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<p>Assets Table</p>

<pre><code>AssetID     Description
---------------------------
1           Desktop HP79801
</code></pre>

<p>Attributes Column</p>

<pre><code>AssetAttr       Column1     
-----------------------------------
1               Color
2               Size
</code></pre>

<p>Link table</p>

<pre><code>AssetID     UnitID      AttrId        AttrValue 
-----------------------------------
1           1           1             Blue
1           1           2             Big
1           2           1             Orange
1           2           2             Giant
</code></pre>

<p>If your attributes are all model specific though, you may also want to add a <code>AssetId</code> column to your assets custom column, but I wouldn't personally do that unless none of your assets at all shared attributes.</p>

<p>You may also want to tag this further. You may want to annotate your attributes table with a data type, and maybe have another table related to the attributes table holding the possible data values, then, in your link table, insert the ID of the entry from the aforementioned table.</p>
