<p>With Android 6.0, you now need to request location permissions at runtime in order to be able to discover beacons.</p>

<p>From our initial tests: if your app targets SDK &lt; 23 (i.e., pre-Android 6.0), you will only need these permissions to detect beacons in the background. If your app targets SDK >= 23 (i.e., Android 6.0 or later), you will need these permissions to detect beacons both in the background and in the foreground. You also need to have Location enabled on your Android 6.0 device for both cases.</p>

<p>Google has a detailed guide on how to implement checking for and requesting runtime permissions:</p>

<p>Specifically, you need either <code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> or <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code>. They both actually display the same message ("Allow APP_NAME to access your location?") to the user.</p>
