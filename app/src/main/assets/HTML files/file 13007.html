<p>The only way I've been able to find to do this in the past is to create a simple wrapper object which is decorated with the XmlRoot attribute and use it in place of your List.</p>

<pre><code>[XmlRoot("Articles")]
public class Articles : List&lt;Article&gt; { }
</code></pre>

<p>There could be a more standard way to achieve it but I know this works every time.</p>
