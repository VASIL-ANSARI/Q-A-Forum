<p>I'm sure you already know that using <code>@synthesize</code> will create setter/getter methods for you, but it's good to know what's going on "under the hood" to understand the concepts.</p>

<p>As far as a setter method goes, you're probably better off with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setTableData:(NSArray *)array {
    if (tableData != array) {
        [tableData release];
        tableData = [array retain];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This basically checks to make sure the new array is actually different than the current.  If it is, it releases the old instance and sets the new one.</p>

<p>For a getter method, just use:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSArray *)tableData (
    return tableData;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can be accessed by calling <code>self.tableData</code>.  And of course setting the array is done just as you have done, with <code>self.tableData = array</code>;</p>

<p>I hope that helps.  If you need more information, just say so and I'll be happy to try and explain further</p>
