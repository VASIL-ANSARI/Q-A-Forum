<p>Well if I understand you, you'll need to use a subquery to get the parent meters with a building id, and then join that to your main table.

<pre><code>select
sm.id,
sm.parent_meter_id,
sm2.id as ID2,
sm.site_ref,
sm.building_id
from
statistics_meter sm
inner join (
  select
  id,
  parent_meter_id
  from
  statistics_meter
  where
  building_id is not null) sm2
  on sm.parent_meter_id = sm2.id
</code></pre>
