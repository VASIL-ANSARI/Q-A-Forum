<p>If pseudorandom is good enough (cf. Ben's comment), then you could create your own PRNG (eg. A Mersenne Twister rather than the weak modulo method used by most systems), and implement one independent generator per thread. if you do this, you MUST make sure that each generator has a different seed. </p>
