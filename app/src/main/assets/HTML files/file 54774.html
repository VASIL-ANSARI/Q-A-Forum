<p>You've correctly set up the permissions on the bucket, to allow access from the user.</p>

<p>But you also need to edit the policy of the user, to allow the user to access the S3 service.</p>

<p>Edit the IAM policy of the user whose credentials you're using to generate the self-signed URL. Something like this will definitely cover everything:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAllS3Access",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
