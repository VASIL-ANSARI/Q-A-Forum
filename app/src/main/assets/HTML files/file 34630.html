<p>There's no reason to use <code>vars</code>. The simple solution is to store all the widgets in a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>self.buttons = {}
for b in controls:
    self.buttons[b[0]] = Button(...)
</code></pre>

<p>There's also no good reason to use <code>place</code> -- <code>place</code> has it's advantages but they are few and far between. Your GUI will be much easier to write and maintain if you use <code>pack</code> or <code>grid</code>. In the case of a calculator, <code>grid</code> is a very natural choice. Also, trying to define the layout in a data structure is cumbersome. I'm not sure there's any real value to it since it's unlikely you're going to be creating a generic algorithm that can create calculators with different numbering systems.</p>

<p>I recommend separating the layout of the widgets from the creation of the widgets. In my experience that simply makes GUI development easier. </p>

<pre><code>self.buttons["zer"].grid(row=3, column=0, columnspan=2, sticky="nsew")
self.buttons["two"].grid(row=2, column=0, sticky="nsew")
self.buttons["thr"].grid(row=2, column=1, sticky="nsew")
...
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I'd suggest not using names like "zer" -- there's really no value in abbreviating a four letter word to three letters. </p>
