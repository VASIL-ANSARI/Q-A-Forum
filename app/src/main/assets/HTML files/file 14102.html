<p>Core Data is complex.  There could be dozens of things to check, any one thing which could be causing issues.</p>

<p>How many MOCs are you using?  How are you saving?  Many more questions...</p>

<p>I would suggest turning on the SQL debugging flag (-com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1) in the EditScheme for arguments when starting the application.</p>

<p>Run your code, and see what is actually going on.</p>

<p>Relationships resolve to a fault when fetched, unless you override it in the fetch request.</p>

<p>If you are using more than one MOC in a parent/child relationship, the save from the child to the parent just puts data into the parent, it does not really save it.  If using UIManagedDocument, it's a whole different set of issues...</p>

<p>I hope this does not sound harsh.  Be prepared to provide a whole lot of information for a Core Data question, other than "this is not saving and here is some debugging output."</p>

<p>Basically, how CoreData works depends on how the stack is created, whether using UIManagedDocument or not, multiple threads, how creating objects, how saving them, options on fetch requests, and a whole lot more things.</p>

<p>It's actually not that complex, but there are lots of customizations and special cases depending on how it is used.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Post the code that creates the objects/relationships.</p>

<p>Also, try the fetch with a manual fetch request instead of the template.  When you look at the data in the database, do you see the foreign keys for the relationships set appropriately?</p>

<p>Run it all again with debugging enabled to see exactly what the SQL is doing.  That is more valuable that your own debugging output.</p>
