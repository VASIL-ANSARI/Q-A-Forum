<p>There isn't anything like that for <code>LIKE</code> but you can use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/regexp.html#operator_regexp" rel="nofollow"><code>REGEXP</code></a> </p>

<p>You'll probably get the best performance from:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
  FROM my_table 
 WHERE name LIKE 'john %'
   AND 0 &lt; SUBSTR(name,6)
</code></pre>

<p>This'll convert the second part of the string into a number and see if it is greater than 0, anything that starts with a letter will be converted to 0.</p>

<p>The LIKE in this case can still use an index on <code>name</code>.</p>

<p>I would definitely question your data structure too, the number after the name should really be in a separate numerical column. Come to think of it, the surname 'Smith' should be in a separate column too!</p>
