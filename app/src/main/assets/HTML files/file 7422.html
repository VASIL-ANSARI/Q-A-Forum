<p>Use getent apache on the shell. This will return the shell of apache. Most likely, it is /bin/nologin or /bin/false. Change this to /bin/bash. You'll also need to specify the home directory and create it on the file system.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> getent apache will actually return the entry in the /etc/passwd file for the apache user. The last token in this string is the shell.</p>
