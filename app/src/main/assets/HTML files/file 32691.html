<p>you forgot to use the "$" signs on your sql or to escape the double quotes:</p>

<p>so the line 8 will be:</p>

<pre><code>$result = pg_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM olympics WHERE EXTRACT(month from $closing_ceremony_date)=theMonth AND EXTRACT(day from $closing_ceremony_date) = theYear");
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$result = pg_query($conn, "SELECT * FROM olympics WHERE EXTRACT(month from \"closing_ceremony_date\")=theMonth AND EXTRACT(day from \"closing_ceremony_date\") = theYear");
</code></pre>

<p>and you forgot to use the "{}" sign on the line 15:</p>

<pre><code>print "Athlete: {$row[0]} Year: {$row[3]}";
</code></pre>
