<p>You are not flushing (<em>saving</em>) the file, thus nothing is saved. To put it out there, it works like the following:</p>

<p>First the Formatter writes to a buffer, and when you flush the formatter it will write that buffer to the file and then clear this buffer. </p>

<p>So in short, call <code>f.flush();</code> before <code>f.close();</code></p>

<p>When you try to flush the formatter after it has been flushed, you will get a <code>FormatterClosedException</code>. Everything what is stated here is in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html#flush()" rel="nofollow">documentation of <code>Formatter</code></a></p>
