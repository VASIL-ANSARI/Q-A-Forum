<p>You can still use the equivalent of your ThreadContextManager class to handle the dispose.  The spawned threads dispose of this 'manager' object which in turn takes out all the other thread static objects it knows about.</p>

<p>I prefer to have relatively few thread static objects and use a context object instead.  This keeps the thread specific state in only a few places, and makes patterns like this easier.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> to handle the threadpool case you could create a base 'task' object that is the one that you pass to the thread pool.  It can perform any generic initialization your code needs, invoke the 'real' task and then performs any cleanup needed.</p>
