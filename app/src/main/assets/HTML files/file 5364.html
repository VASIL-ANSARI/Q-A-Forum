<p>Hi You can use the same certificate for multiple number of applications.</p>

<p>Once your certificate is in place, you will be required to create a provisioning profile of your application.</p>

<p>-Using this provisioning profile you can install your appilcation on iPhone.</p>

<p>-For development purpose you should create a developer Provisioning porfile.</p>

<p>-Once your application is tested and ready for sale on App Store you have to create a Distribution profile.</p>

<p>-Once done with this process you are required to install that provisioning profile on your device.</p>

<p>I recommend you should read the Apple documentation in your Agent account which you must have created as you have mentioned you already have a certificate.</p>

<p>They have explained in detail a full walk through for creating a certificate and Provisioning profile. </p>

<p>Hope this a cleared your initial doubts so that you can jump in for minute details.</p>
