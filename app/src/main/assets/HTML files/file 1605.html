<p>I don't quite understand the question. A single browsing session won't distinguish between the two cookies.  The last cookie that the server sets replaces the previous ones.  Obviously, two instances of Chrome running on two different computers don't share cookies and each send their own instance of the cookie to the server in every request.</p>
