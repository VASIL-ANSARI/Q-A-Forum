<p>That's because the <strong>other function has 2nd parameter as default argument</strong>. <a href="http://www.ideone.com/VUqWQ" rel="nofollow">See here</a> I have simulated the same effect. Unfortunately compiler doesn't show the default argument inside the error message:</p>

<pre><code>//intl.h
const wxChar *wxGetTranslation(const wxChar *c1, const wxChar *c2 = &lt;something&gt;);
</code></pre>

<p>More precisely,</p>

<pre><code>void foo (const char* c1);  // 1st
void foo (const char* c1, const char *c2 = 0);  // 2nd
</code></pre>

<p>would create ambiguity when you try to call the 1st version, because 2nd version is also an equally well candiate.</p>
