<p>Add this to your CSS :
It will help you to have the result you want. Of course there are still adaptations to do regarding your preferences.</p>

<pre><code>/* Without this line, the submenu elements are black on black background */
#nav_menu .sub-menu li a {
    color: #fff;
}
/* With this line you will remove the opacity:0; of the submenu when you hover the parent li */
#nav_menu li:hover .sub-menu {
    opacity: 1;
}
/* Don't set a width so you have a better output */
#nav_menu li .sub-menu  {
    width: auto;
}
/* This lines make the submenu li dislay verticaly and not inline */
#nav_menu li .sub-menu li  {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Instead of changing the <code>opacity</code> property to show/hide the submenu, you should use the <code>display</code> property.
Currently, the submenu is just transparent, but always opened. If your menu were bigger in height, you could open it by hovering the mouse on the slide at the location where it is when opened.
By using the <code>display</code> property, you're actually hiding it, and it will be opened only if you hover the menu element (as it should be).</p>

<p>To do this, you have to replace the <code>opacity: 0;</code> in your <code>.sub-menu</code> class by : <code>display: none;</code></p>

<p>Then change the code <code>opacity: 1;</code> in the <code>#nav_menu li:hover .sub-menu</code> by : <code>display: block;</code> (in the code I gave you before).</p>

<p>It will be cleaner than handling it with the <code>opacity</code>.</p>
