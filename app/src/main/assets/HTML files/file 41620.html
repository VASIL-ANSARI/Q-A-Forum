<p>You got one letter wrong, it is spelled <strong>localStorage</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>var foo = localStorage.getItem("bar");
// ...
localStorage.setItem("bar", foo);
</code></pre>

<p>I would mostly advise to wrap your storage in a class, so that you would create a bridge pattern. And separate place of storage from your code logic, it will be easyer to change it so other type of storage in the future.</p>
