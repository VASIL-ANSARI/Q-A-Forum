<p>That depends.</p>

<p>There are many cases where using GetHashCode() could cause incorrect behavior:</p>

<p>A hash code is intended for efficient insertion and lookup in collections that are based on a hash table. A hash code is not a permanent value. For this reason:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not serialize hash code values or store them in databases.</li>
<li>Do not use the hash code as the key to retrieve an object from a keyed collection.</li>
<li>Do not send hash codes across application domains or processes. In some cases, hash codes may be computed on a per-process or per-application domain basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the memory cache happens (or can in the future happen) in a different process or app domain than the code that calls it, you fail the 3rd condition.</p>

  <p>It feels odd using a single UTF32 character as the key for a potentially large cache.</p>

<p>If you are caching enough things, the collision rate on a 32-bit hash can be uncomfortably high due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem" rel="nofollow">Birthday Problem</a>.</p>

<p>When caching tens of millions of things, I have used a 64-bit hash called <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cityhash/" rel="nofollow">City Hash</a> (created by Google, open source) with good success.  You can also use a Guid, though the memory to maintain keys is twice as large for a GUID compared to a 64-bit hash.</p>
