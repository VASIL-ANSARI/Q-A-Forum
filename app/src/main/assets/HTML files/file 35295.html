<p>Some devices do not like MP3 audio in MP4 container. AAC audio is more common. A simple command:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i video -i audio -map 0:v -map 1:a -codec:v copy -codec:a aac \
-strict experimental -b:a 192k -shortest output.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I changed <code>-map 0 -map 1</code> to <code>-map 0:v -map 1:a</code> to be more specific, because you probably do not want ffmpeg to include any album art from the audio input (it would create an additional, separate video stream).</p>

<p>A more specific command for your case. You can do everything in one command instead of two:</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -framerate 1/5 -i %03d.jpg -i audio.mp3 -map 0:v -map 1:a -c:v libx264 \
-profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -r 30 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac \
-strict experimental -b:a 192k -shortest output.mp4
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>This example uses the native FFmpeg AAC encoder. It is considered experimental, so results may vary, but it is not a terrible encoder with enough bitrate.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have other AAC encoders supported by your <code>ffmpeg</code> then refer to the <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/AACEncodingGuide" rel="nofollow">FFmpeg and AAC Encoding Guide</a> for additional suggestions, examples, and information.</p></li>
<li><p>You may experience several issues, such as frames being skipped, when making a video from images. See the answer to <a href="http://superuser.com/a/714214/110524">FFmpeg slideshow from images - only one frame shown</a> for solutions.</p></li>
