<p>Xamarin has two ways to setup files you want present in the iOS bundle:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put them in any folder, and mark the "Build Action" as "Content". Whatever directory structure you have in your project will be present in the main bundle.</li>
<li>Put them in the "Resources" folder, with a "Build Action" as "BundleResource", this does the same as #1, but removes the "Resources" folder from the path present in the bundle. This is a nice place to put all images you want in the root of your bundle but would clutter up your project.</li>
</ol>
