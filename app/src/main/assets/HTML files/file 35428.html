<p>You can disable public access to a directory using the <code>.htaccess</code></p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(?:images)\b.* index.php/$0 [L]
</code></pre>

<p>This would forward requests to the images folder to your <code>index.php</code> file.</p>

<p>This will only work if you have <code>mod_rewrite</code> enabled.</p>

<p>Also you could add a <code>.htaccess</code> file to the folder you would like to disable public access to and add the following rule.</p>

<pre><code>deny from all
</code></pre>
