  <p>if I go to the parent of the BSTNode containing val, and assign nullptr to the left or right child field (which is the std::unique_ptr containing val), would the smart pointer self destruct? </p>

<p>The smart pointer will destroy <em>the thing it points to</em>.</p>

<p>It will not destroy itself (which is what self-destruct means; you may have confused terminology here).</p>
