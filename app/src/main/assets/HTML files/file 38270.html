<p>Don't have much context for your code, but slashes should work when used appropriately. I am not sure about the use of semicolons here.</p>

<p>This code is an example pulled straight from one of my Interop programs and works fine:
<code>thisExcel.xlWorksheet.Range["AD44", Type.Missing].Value = "=IF(BULK!L7=\"#N/A Field Not Applicable\",\"( \"&amp;'Title Look Up'!C3&amp;\" )\",\"( \"&amp;'Title Look Up'!C3&amp;\" )\")";</code></p>

<p>If all you want is: 'if a2 reads blanco then nothing else increment value of c1 by 1', then you just need:
<code>=IF(A2=\"BLANCO\",\"\",C1+1)</code></p>

<p>I would also try using .Value rather than .Formula.</p>

<p>Hope that help</p>
