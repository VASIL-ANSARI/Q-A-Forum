<p>You're trying to copy a mutex. That is not possible.</p>

<p>You're triggering that from</p>

<pre><code> from myprogram.h:2,
 from myprogram.cpp:1:
</code></pre>

<p>So, that's <em>your code</em>. Probably, if it is not explicit in your code, you have a <code>shared_mutex</code> as a member in a class, and this class is getting copied, somewhere as part of the rest of the code.</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>struct MyClass {
    boost::shared_mutex sm;
};

std::vector&lt;MyClass&gt; v;
// etc.
</code></pre>

<p><code>vector</code> will copy.move its elements during many operations and this would trigger the mutex copy along the way.</p>
