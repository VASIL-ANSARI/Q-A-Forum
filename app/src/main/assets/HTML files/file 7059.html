<p>If you are using apache, you need to use a rails mod to get it working. The best one is <a href="http://www.modrails.com/" rel="nofollow">Phusion Passenger</a>. It is very easy to set up, follow their directions, set up your virtual host and you'll be on your way. Again, apache cannot serve rails apps without extra additions.</p>

<p>It sounds like you are getting the mongrel/webrick servers that you run with <code>ruby script/server</code> or <code>rails server</code> confused with apache. In production don't even bother with webrick or mongrel if you've got apache running. Install Passenger. Then its easy, just go to your conf file and add your VirtualHost.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName www.domain.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/mysite/public
    &lt;Directory /webapps/mysite/public&gt;
        Allow from all
        Options -MultiViews
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>
