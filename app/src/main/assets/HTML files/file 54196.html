<p>Set your pos operator to -1 rather than 0. 0 represents your first index and since you output that the element has not been found for pos == 0 condition, your code is failing. You should set pos to -1 initially and check that itself for not found condition, if an element is found at pos = 0, that means the element exists at the first index.</p>
