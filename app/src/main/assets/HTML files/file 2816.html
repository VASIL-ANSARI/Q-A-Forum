<p>according to <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&amp;sektion=1" rel="nofollow">manpage</a> the -D does create a socks proxy. </p>

<pre><code>-D [bind_address:]port
             Specifies a local ``dynamic'' application-level port forwarding.
             This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local
             side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a
             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over
             the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to
             determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently
             the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act
             as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.  Dy-
             namic port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration
             file.
