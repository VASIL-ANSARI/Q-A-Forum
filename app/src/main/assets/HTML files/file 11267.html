<p>The solution you are considering is perfectly reasonable, but I would suggest adding a static method for creating an updated version of the object instead of adding the additional functionality to <code>__init__()</code>.  Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>class Point(object):
    def __init__(x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    @staticmethod
    def init_from_point(obj):
        return Point(obj.x, obj.y)
</code></pre>

<p>With this you could do <code>obj = Point.init_from_point(obj)</code> for your update, without complicating your <code>__init__()</code> at all.</p>
