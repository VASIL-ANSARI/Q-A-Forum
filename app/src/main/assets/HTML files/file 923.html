<p>The reflection overhead here is pretty much overkill especially since INotifyPropertyChanged gets called <strong>a lot</strong>. It's best just to hard code the value if you can.</p>

<p>If you aren't concerned about performance then I'd look at the various approached mentioned below and pick that that requires the least amount of coding. If you could do something to completely removes the need for the explicit call then that would be best (e.g. AOP).</p>
