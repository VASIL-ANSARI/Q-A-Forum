<p>I assume that the 'scan, parse, manipulate' slow down that you mentioned is in fact until your page loads the scripts and actually reaches the code that performs the actual binding.</p>

<pre><code>kendo.bind(container, viewModel)
</code></pre>

<p>So you can initially display some kind of loading animation icon and just before kendo.bind you should hide it.</p>
