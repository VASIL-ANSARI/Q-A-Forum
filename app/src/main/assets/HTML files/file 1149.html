<p>it is syntax error, you must have to use 'group by' when you are using having cause, </p>

<p>your query with group by is fetching records having ("distance" >) because, there is database rule that first of all it takes data with matching records then it will perform group by on it after it it is filtering records by having cause. so you never get data having ("distance" &lt;)</p>

<p>please correct if i am wrong</p>
