<p>You could try removing the htaccess file completely (or even better just rename it to htaccess.txt). It should allow acess to everyone. Then if you need to enable at a specific time or day you could just create a cronjob that simply copies the htaccess.txt file to .htaccess lets say saturday at 3pm or whatever.</p>
