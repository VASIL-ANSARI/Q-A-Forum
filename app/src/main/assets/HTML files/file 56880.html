<p>Since you are using the same command, you have to clear out the parameters afterwards:</p>

<pre><code>CmdSQL.ExecuteNonQuery();
CmdSQL.Parameters.Clear();
CmdSQL.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ID", 4);
....
</code></pre>

<p>On a side note, dates should be dates in a database, not strings.  Your database looks questionable if you have a bunch of tables with this same structure.  Why not just one table and a field that distinguishes what type of row it is.  It would make your queries easier.  It's also very common and beneficial to put those disposable database objects in using blocks.</p>
