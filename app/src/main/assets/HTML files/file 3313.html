<p>I think you are missing a comma between <code>:student_fail_attribute</code> and <code>params[:StudentFailState.true]</code>.</p>

<p>You might want to think if <code>params[:StudentFailState.true]</code> is supposed to be there at all, unless it returns the collection you will most likely not get the expected results. </p>
