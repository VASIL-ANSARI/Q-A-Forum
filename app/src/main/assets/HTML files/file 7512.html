<p>Your properties almost always have a backing variable. What</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize delegate=_delegate;
</code></pre>

<p>does is declare that the backing variable for your search bar will be called _searchBar. This allows you to decouple the name of the property from the name of your variable. In fact, if you don't use @synthesize you don't need to have a backing variable at all.</p>

<p>This can:</p>

<ol>
<li>avoid clashes with variable names
and</li>
<li>make it clear when I'm using a
local variable and when I'm using an
instance variable.</li>
</ol>
