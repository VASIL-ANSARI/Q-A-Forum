<p>I would double check all of your configuration settings on your machine as application's should automatically detect culture settings and adjust.  Additionally, you probably don't want to be writing code to explicitly change your users' OS culture settings.  But if you want to override the OS culture and always display a particular culture's format, you use something like:</p>

<pre><code>CultureInfo ci = new CultureInfo("en-GB"); //Great Britain
string formattedDateTime = DateTime.Now.ToString(ci);
Console.WriteLine(formattedDateTime);
</code></pre>
