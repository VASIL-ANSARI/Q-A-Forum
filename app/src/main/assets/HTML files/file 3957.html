<p>You should look at the source code, read it, understand it. Not just coopy-paste-run. Look at the <code>define_file()</code> function definition: <code>if ($token[0] != T_STRING) die("T_STRING");</code></p>

<p>You can debug it by displaying the file-path where that condition occurs. </p>

<pre><code>if ($token[0] != T_STRING) die("T_STRING: " . $path . " : " . $token[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you'll know what the real problem is.</p>
