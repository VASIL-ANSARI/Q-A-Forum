<p>Based on your question, you'd could use EXISTS to find rows where the related columns are in both tables.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.ConversationID, a.SendDateUtc
    FROM tableA a
    WHERE EXISTS(SELECT NULL
                     FROM FHU.HolidayCallers hc
                     WHERE a.ConversationID = hc.ConversationID
                         AND a.SendDateUtc = hc.SendDateUtc);
</code></pre>

<p>BUT, based on the sample code you provided, it seems like you are looking for a NOT EXISTS condition:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.ConversationID, a.SendDateUtc
    FROM tableA a
    WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT NULL
                         FROM FHU.HolidayCallers hc
                         WHERE a.ConversationID = hc.ConversationID
                             AND a.SendDateUtc = hc.SendDateUtc);
</code></pre>
