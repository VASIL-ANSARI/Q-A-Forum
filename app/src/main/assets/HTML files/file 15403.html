<p>I would first try to pass a function pointer to <code>std::sort</code>, and thus use it in the <code>qsort</code> way:</p>

<ul>
<li>the algorithm itself is precompiled</li>
<li>the comparison function is JITed and passed dynamically</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it would still be superior to <code>qsort</code> because the algorithm would manipulate the memory meaningfully and only the comparison would be called (really).</p>
