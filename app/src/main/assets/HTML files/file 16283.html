<p>To repeat what I understand you to be saying:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the image is 'small' then it is stretched to fill the ActionBar - this is the required behaviour, right?</li>
<li>If the image is 'larger than small' then it overlaps the ActionBar region - this is NOT the required behviour, right?</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the Drawable that you're setting as the background? Is it a 9-patch? Have you set the stretchable region correctly?</p>
