<p>The events you attached before $('body').html(data1) will not fire simply because the elements previously in the body will not exist anymore.</p>

<p>You have to re-attach the events or use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/on/" rel="nofollow">.on()</a> method and attach events directly to document.</p>
