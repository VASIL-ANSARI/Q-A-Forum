<p>Right, so Python is a compiled language when run on a web server. It's outputting a .pyc file that's the compiled version. Your goal is to tell the web server that the .pyc file is out of date and is no longer valid.</p>

<p>You have a few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the relevant .pyc file</li>
<li>For web.py, use the reloader middleware</li>
<li>Send it a HUP signal (I'm lazy and usually do killall -SIGHUP python). You can do this automatically with a file watching tool like watchdog (thanks barracel).</li>
<li>web.config.debug = True should be the default in your application</li>
</ol>

<p>None of those options are working for you?</p>
