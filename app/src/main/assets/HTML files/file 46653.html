<p>I found this <a href="https://github.com/erocarrera/pydot/issues/38" rel="nofollow">issue number 38</a> - Which says we cannot use special symbols (like colon) in node names or labels. The reason it has highlighted is -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As with issue 28: The problem with the colon in Node names is that Graphviz 
  will use them to specify a port where to attach edges, it's a Graphviz 
  artifact. The way pydot supports them is to allow them in names, if you wish to 
  simply have colon characters in the name simply add quotes to the string.</p>
  
  <p>For instance: (note the double quotes in the actual string):</p>

<pre><code>node = pydot.Node('"Testnode:###@"')

print node.get_name()
'"Testnode:###@"'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Though you may be better off not having colon in your name.</p>
