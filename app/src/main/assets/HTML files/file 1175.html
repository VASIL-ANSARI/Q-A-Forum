<p>If I could understand your question, your problem is when adding the activity indicator on the toolbar. Because to add the UIProgressView is not a problem.</p>

<p>To do that, you have to first add a UIView on your toolbar, and then insert the activity indicator inside this view.</p>

<p>Let me know if it works, for you!</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
