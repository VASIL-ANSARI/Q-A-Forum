<p>I suggest to verify the data being sent to the server.
In my case, I was trying to send a jQuery Object directly as the value of a property.</p>

<p>Something like: </p>

<pre>
$.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "data/runner/updateTeamFinder.php",
    data : { myKey : $("#chekboxes") }
});
</pre>

<p>Hope it helps somebody.</p>
