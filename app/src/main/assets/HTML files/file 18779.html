<p>It sounds like the app name, com.whatever.whatever, isn't an exact match with the app name in the provisioning profile.</p>

<p>If that's the problem, you'll need to make them match.  The provisioning profile refers to an app id which has a bundle name.  Your build settings probably has a variable called PRODUCT_NAME.  You can either create a new app id to match your project, or - probably easier - change your project's product name.</p>
