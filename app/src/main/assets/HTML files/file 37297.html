<p>Ok it was because you need to use the 'PF' function to get the layout widget, ie:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;pf:commandButton value="Toggle" onclick="PF('layoutWdgt').toggle('west')"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Although this isn't mentioned in the other posts I specified, I can only assume this became necessary in later PrimeFaces versions.</p>
