<p>you can use developers tools profiler, but you can be sure that calling stuff on every event gonna impact on site performance.</p>

<p>if you do hook to all this event i would suggest do it wise and use <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#throttle" rel="nofollow">"throttle"</a>.
and try to build some light weight logic that will prevent unexpected/necessary class.</p>

<p>and test your code it also can tell how much time it take to run each test which can indicate on your logic performance.  </p>
