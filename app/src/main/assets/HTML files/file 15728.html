<pre><code> $('yourInput').on('focus', function(){
      $('yourAnchor').trigger('click');
 });
</code></pre>

<p>should work just fine, however you are likely to loose focus on the input field as the new element has been 'clicked'. I would recommend using the jQuery <a href="http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/" rel="nofollow">scrollTo</a> plugin instead. That would enable you to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code> $('yourInput').on('focus', function(){
       $('messageArea').scrollTo('yourAnchor');
 });
</code></pre>

<p>This was scrolling occurs in a nice animated fashion and without triggering browser events.</p>

<p>Part of the reason the code you posted may be failing is that, 1. anchors do not always have a focus event, 2. clicking it right after focusing may be redundant and not causing the change you are looking for.</p>
