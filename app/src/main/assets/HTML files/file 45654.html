<p>There is no difference between passing in &amp;(g_pui8USBTxBuffer[0]) and just passing in g_pui8USBTxBuffer.  The addresses are the same.</p>

<p>The problem more than likely lies somewhere else in your code.  Please update your question with the all the other steps involved with creating the g_pui8USBTxBuffer.</p>

<p>Also, how are you sure that the issue is with the second parameter?  What debugging steps have you gone through?</p>
