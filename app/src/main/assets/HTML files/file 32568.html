<p>After search a lot over the Internet and forums, I found "models_to_sql" gem, from <a href="https://github.com/vivrass" rel="nofollow">Martin Provencher</a>. </p>

<p>But this gem only works for Rails 3.2 and older, and my application uses Rails 4.0. I <a href="https://github.com/vivrass/models-to-sql/issues/1" rel="nofollow">talked with author</a> and he doesn't want support this gem anymore. So I discovered by myself how to support Rails 4.0 and now I'm maintaining this gem.</p>

<h3>Download the <a href="https://github.com/paladini/models-to-sql-rails" rel="nofollow">"models-to-sql-rails" gem here</a>, supporting Rails 4.0 and older.</h3>

<p><hr>
With this gem, you can easily do the following. (the examples inside <em>values</em> are just a joke, you will get the correct values when using it in your object). </p>

<p>For objects:</p>

<pre><code>object.to_sql_insert
# INSERT INTO modelName (field1, field2) VALUES ('Wow, amaze gem', 'much doge')
</code></pre>

<p>For array of objets:</p>

<pre><code>array_of_objects.to_sql_insert
# INSERT INTO modelName (field1, field2) VALUES ('Awesome doge', "im fucking cop")
# INSERT INTO modelName (field1, field2) VALUES ('much profit', 'much doge')
# (...)
</code></pre>

<p>Just see the <a href="https://github.com/paladini/models-to-sql-rails" rel="nofollow">Github of this project</a> and you'll find how to install and use this wonderful gem.</p>
