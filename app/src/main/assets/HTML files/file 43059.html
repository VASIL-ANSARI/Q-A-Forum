<p>R works well as a special purpose math oriented language purely because the R interpreter/JIT and runtime is highly optimized.</p>

<p>Not unlike MATLAB or Mathematica or even using numpy with python</p>

<p>If you were to transpile R code to JS, it would be quite poor in comparision and would be unable to efficiently perform all the complicated computations you would typically do in an R program (if your R code is really doing non-trivial computations)</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any project that does R to JS compilation - seems like it is not really something people would really require.</p>

<p>I think the ecosystem of Javascript only Chrome extensions is a poor fit for running R code in.</p>

<p>If you were running FireFox or IE, you could call DLLs from within extensions - using COM on IE and the FF native bridge API. Chrome doesn't support such a thing directly.</p>

<p>The answer is to write an NPAPI plugin - this is a bit of native code implemented as a DLL that can be accessed from JS, via an OBJECT tag. I have used this to write an extension that replaces Flash video controls with a windowless VLC player on Chrome, FF and IE. 
This is the best way to do it. Write your R code, make it a DLL, expose the interface via an NPAPI plugin. In your extension, inject an OBJECT tag into the HTML, which will instantiate your native code instance - after which you can call methods on it directly as if it were a JS object.  </p>

<p>The next best thing I can think of is - Translate R to MATLAB, convert MATLAB to C++ (which is possible) and then run the C++ as native client code in the browser. </p>
