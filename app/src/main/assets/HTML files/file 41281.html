<p>A couple of things you might like to think about.</p>

<p>For one, you're assuming that each token appears on a new line. That might be true for what you're doing; but it would be more flexible to use <code>input.next()</code> rather than <code>input.nextLine()</code>. That will read the next token, without caring whether it's on a new line or not.</p>

<p>To read in the next token and determine whether it's an integer or not, the easiest thing is to look at <code>input.hasNextInt()</code>. That will tell you, without advancing past the token, whether the next token can be parsed as an integer or not. If it is, you can read it with <code>input.nextInt()</code>; if not, read a <code>String</code> with <code>input.next()</code>.</p>
