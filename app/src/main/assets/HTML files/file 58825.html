<p>It most certainly changes the variable, you're just not updating the HTML.  </p>

<p>Place the <code>innerHTML</code> line <strong>inside</strong> the event handler, so it updates when someone presses a button, and not just on pageload</p>

<pre><code>var x = 50;
var y = 50;
document.addEventListener("keydown", checkKey, false);
function checkKey(e) {
  if (e.keyCode == "37") {
   x = x--;
   document.getElementById("test").innerHTML = x;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>KeyboardEvent.keyCode</code> is not consistent, and according to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode" rel="nofollow">MDN</a> </p>
