<p>One solution is to use Liclipse, which comes with python integration, all you have to do is to configure the interpreter. Or check weather your interpreter is configured correctly. The configuration is found at Window->Preferences->Pydev->Intrepreters. Or another thing that might be wrong is that the pydev module might be for a certain type of eclipse. I personally use LiClipse which is great.</p>
