<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>As njzk2 points out in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27385370/encryption-algorithm-app-android#comment43219122_27385370">comments</a>, printing an array in Java doesn't print the contents of the array, but only some meta data to identify the object by during the execution. It is not the encrypted data that you're printing there.</p>

<p>Specifically it is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString%28%29" rel="nofollow"><code>Object.toString()</code></a></p>

<pre><code>getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
</code></pre>

<p>because Array objects don't have their own <code>toString</code> method.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>You need to encode the <code>byte[]</code> to a <code>String</code> before printing it. Altough you could use <code>Arrays.toString(textEncrypted)</code>, but there are better ways.</p>

<p>You could encode the <code>textEncrypted</code> as Base64 before showing it to the user, so that it can be "copied". See this question for example code: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7360403/base-64-encode-and-decode-example-code">Base 64 encode and decode example code</a></p>

<p>In the decryption method, you should then decode the <code>String</code> to <code>byte[]</code> before giving to <code>doFinal</code>.</p>
