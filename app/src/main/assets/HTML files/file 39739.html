<p>What you are looking is some kind of a REST Client code that would then be able to run your tests and you would be able to verify if the call is successful or not. Django Rest Framework has the APIRestFactory helper class that will aid you in writing such tests. The documentation can be found <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and specifically look at the Example section. This would be part of your Django tests</p>
