<p>The scaling algorithm used depends on the device; generally for power efficiency and speed, scaling is done in hardware blocks usually at the end of camera image signal processor (ISP) pipeline.</p>

<p>Therefore, you can't generally rely on it being any particular kind of scaling or filtering.  Unfortunately, if you want to understand the entire processing pipeline, you have to start with RAW and implement it yourself.</p>

<p>If you're on the same device, the old camera API and the new camera2 API talk to the same hardware abstraction layer, and the same hardware scalers, so the scaling output will generally match exactly for the same resolution. (with the exception of LEGACY-level devices, where camera2 may need additional GPU-based scaling, which will be bilinear downsampling - but you don't really know when this would apply).</p>
