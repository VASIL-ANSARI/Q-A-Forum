<p>Try this:</p>

<p><strong>Space added in key</strong></p>

<pre><code>NSArray * FrameShape = frameShaperesult; // array of you result which contains dictionary objects. 
FrameShape = [FrameShape valueForKey:@"FrameShape "]; // array that contains string objects which you mentioned in question
</code></pre>

<p>This final FrameShape array will contains only string as object and you can access each by for loop.</p>

<p>If you want all objects in one string try this:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *str = [FrameShape componentsJoinedByString:@","]; // all object will join by ,(comma) you can change it as per your need.
</code></pre>
