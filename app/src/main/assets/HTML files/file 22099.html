<p>Cookies have problem working in <code>localhost</code>. You better host your site to web check it out. And try <code>($.cookie('userAge') == undefined)</code> instead of <code>($.cookie('userAge') == null)</code></p>

<p>Edited: I gave as <code>($.cookie("userAge") == undefined)</code> before. Now changed it to single quoted. Sorry about the typo</p>
