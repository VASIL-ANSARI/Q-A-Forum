<p>The fastest way to square a number is to multiply it by itself.</p>

  <p>Why is <code>Math.pow</code> so slow?</p>

<p>It's really not, but it is performing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation" rel="nofollow">exponentiation</a> instead of simple multiplication.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and why does it cope badly with > 1 and even worse with &lt; -1 numbers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, because it does the math. From the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#pow-double-double-" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a> it also contains tests for many corner cases. Finally, I would not rely too much on your micro-benchmark.</p>
