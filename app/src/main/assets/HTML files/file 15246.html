<p>I'm trying the same thing.</p>

<pre><code>bSecure = WebServer.LoadSystemCertificate("My", "localhost","localmachine");
bSecure = WebServer.CertificateLoaded();
</code></pre>

<p>Both are true, so the certificate should be loaded.</p>

<p>Look here: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/24027/SSL-with-Self-hosted-WCF-Service" rel="nofollow">how to make a certificate</a></p>

<p>This works fine in IE9, port set to 5040.
<code>https://localhost:5040/</code>
It doesn't work in Firefox or Chrome, but this has something to do with loading the "Certification Authority" certificate.</p>
