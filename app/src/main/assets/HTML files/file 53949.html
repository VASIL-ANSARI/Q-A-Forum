<p>I linked the server person to this page and he confirmed that the issue was in fact the firewall. The port I was trying to use was not open. The port was then opened and I was able to connect through the browser.</p>

<p>I then tested it with my jquery application and had a CORS error. For anyone else running into the same issue as me you will probably have that issue next. I fixed it by adding these headers:</p>

<pre><code>response.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://acvsapps.med.uottawa.ca');
response.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE');    
response.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'X-Requested-With,content-type');
</code></pre>

<p>Cheers!</p>
