<p>I don't think that Ajax would be very good here. I would recommend WebSockets. You can check demos here: <a href="http://www.websocket.org/demos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.websocket.org/demos.html</a>. For example this seems very nice <a href="http://rumpetroll.com/" rel="nofollow">http://rumpetroll.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Try to keep it lightweight on server or you will run out of juice as kuroi neko mentioned. For example if every player would be polling requests to server and interfering with database, your service would go down very quickly.</p>
