<p>Best to run a network traffic analyser on your computer and make a list of attempted accesses.</p>

<p>Even better, do the same from home (or wherever you have access), and list the actual URLs.</p>

<p>Or (in the mean time) ask/urge IT if they can open HTTPS (and HTTP) access <code>*.apple.com/*</code> and <code>*.itunesconnect.com/*</code> and see how far you get.</p>

<p>Good luck, this is a very annoying situation I've in too a few times.</p>
