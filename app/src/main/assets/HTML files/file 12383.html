<p>I too had a mix of OpenID and OAuth logins with google app engine and you can mix. At the end in my case I settled on just Google and Facebook as providers and Google login is builtin and Facebook login is OAuth. It's true there should be a more convenient way to "add an OAuth provider" and add yourself as an OAuth provider same way we add Twitter and Facebook however at this stage is more or less programming it yourself and following the OAuth 2.0 login / logout flow independent of which implementation you do (Java, python, PHP..) since the OAuth 2.0 flow is the same regardless of which language you use for example OAuth with Facebook which I use with GAE:</p>

<p>You might want to read through the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/" rel="nofollow">OAuth</a> page for a large provider, Facebook, to see how you should do the authentication flow. </p>
