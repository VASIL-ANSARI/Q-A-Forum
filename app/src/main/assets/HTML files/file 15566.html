<p>Providing the WSDL should be enough as the WSDL would have the reference to the xsd's using the import attribute.</p>

<p>When defining your bindings for your WCF service make sure you use BasicHttpBinding (follows BasicProfile 1.1) which is interoperable. </p>

<p>Also you would consider flattening your WSDL for your service to be highly interoperable as at times php and other java clients might need flat wsdl. If you are using .NET 4.5 then you have this as an inbuild option now else you can check this link on <a href="http://weblogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/2007/05/improving-wcf-interoperability-flattening-your-wsdl.html" rel="nofollow">how to flatten your wsdl</a></p>
