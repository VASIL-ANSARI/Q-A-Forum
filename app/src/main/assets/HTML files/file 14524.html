<p>According to the Jcrop docs, it does not actually do the cropping.  It only creates a image cropping UI.  It then depends on the server doing the actual cropping; see <a href="http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop_Implementation_Theory.html" rel="nofollow">http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop_Implementation_Theory.html</a> .  So it looks like the plugin is doing exactly what it is designed to do.  It's now leaving the rest for you to do yourself on the server, as they show.</p>
