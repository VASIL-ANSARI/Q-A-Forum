<p>To be short, relevant error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caught exception during boot: java.lang.IllegalStateException:
  JBAS014647: Could not rename C:\Program
  Files\EAP-6.2.0\jboss-eap-6.2\standalone\configuration\standalone_xml_history\current
  to C:\Program
  Files\EAP-6.2.0\jboss-eap-6.2\standalone\configuration\standalone_xml_history\20151106-101212372</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would sound like a directory or a file in that directory is locked by some software instance.</p>

<p>So check if you don't have your configuration files open in any editor, cmd line instance or some other process. If else fails, reboot your computer.</p>
