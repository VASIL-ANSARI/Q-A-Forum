<p>You can use GetCell method for what you want to do. Also, you can subclass UITableViewCell and implement the layout as you want. Even layout designer can be used to achieve this.
You have GetHeightForRow (or something like that) where you can define height for row with index and section (which are passed as arguments of the function), so you can have different heights for different table cells. </p>

<p>I hope this can kick you off in right direction.</p>
