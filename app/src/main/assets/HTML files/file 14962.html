<p>In your document(ready), you can explicity make the first AJAX call that isn't tied to an event handler.  Or similarly, you can explicitly trigger the event handler.</p>

<p>Uninitialized index view:</p>

<p>index.html.haml (initial)</p>

<pre><code>.span12
  #book-table
</code></pre>

<p>Now here is the DRYed up partial that will be used to populate <code>div#book-table</code></p>

<p>_table.html.haml</p>

<pre><code>%table
  %tr
    %th Title
    %th Author
  - books.each do |book|
    %tr
      %td= link_to book.title, book_path(book)
      %td= book.author
</code></pre>

<p>Next you'll have JS that responds to it.  Note that what this is doing is rendering the partial during an AJAX call to the index action.</p>

<p>index.js.erb</p>

<pre><code>$('#book-table').html('&lt;%= escape_javascript(render(partial: "table", locals: { books: @books })) %&gt;');
</code></pre>

<p>We now need to adjust the index view to initialize to this view:</p>

<p>index.html.haml (final)</p>

<pre><code>:javascript
  $(document).ready (function() {
    $.get("/books.js");
  });

.span12
  #book-table
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the document.ready does an initial AJAX call, hitting your .js.erb and populating the div without explicitly populating the div in the .html.haml</p>
