<p>Given that you are unclear about the OS, it'll be hard to guess what command line parser you have.  (wc is available under Linux and with cygwin, under windows).    </p>

<p>I don't think it is a "command line" that does the trick, you need a tool that knows Javascript,    Given that your problem is one of retaining valid javascript lexemes, and throwing away just the comments, it would seem like a regexp would be possible.    Its probably pretty hard to write, since it has to be the disjunction of all the regexps for every lexeme in the language.  People use lexer generators to compute that disjunction; you probably can't do it by hand. (Yes, I've written production JavaScript lexers).</p>

<p>The easiest way to get this effect is get your hands on a full Javascript lexer/parser.  </p>

<p>Our Javascript Formatter contains such a lexer/parser; it job is to reformat your code.  One of its command line options is to strip comments.  You can configure it to process lots of files in one step using a project file.</p>

<p>That would probably work for you, based on Seibel's assertion that escript is ECMAScript 4 compliant.</p>
