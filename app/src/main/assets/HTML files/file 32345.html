<p>Try</p>

<pre><code>logs = PrizeVerificationCodeSMSLog.objects.filter(winner__lucky_draw_id=id).order_by('-created_on')
winners = logs.select_related("winner")[:10]
</code></pre>

<p>This generates following query</p>

<pre><code>SELECT "prizeverificationcodesmslog"."id", "prizeverificationcodesmslog"."winner_id", 
    "prizeverificationcodesmslog"."mobile_number", "prizeverificationcodesmslog"."created_on", 
    "winner"."id", "winner"."lucky_draw_id", "winner"."participation_id", 
    "winner"."prize_id", "winner"."mobile_number" 
FROM "prizeverificationcodesmslog" 
INNER JOIN "winner" ON ("prizeverificationcodesmslog"."winner_id" = "winner"."id") 
WHERE "winner"."lucky_draw_id" = 1  
ORDER BY "prizeverificationcodesmslog"."created_on" 
DESC LIMIT 10;
</code></pre>
