  <p>If the user clicks a button, I need to send a request to find all the rows in PRODUCTS</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `ID` FROM `PRODUCTS`
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note, this query only retrieves the <code>ID</code> values from all records, not all record data. Is this what you want?</p>

<p>To answer your questions:</p>

<p>1) The PHP script should be returning a specfic format, e.g. XML or JSON (the latter is preferred, IMHO). The number of collections returned will dictate how many DIV elements you create, if your intent is to stick each resulting record into a new DIV. Example, a JSON response has a collection (array) with 10 elements. You loop through each element in the array and create N DIV elements based on the array size.</p>

<p>2) Are you sure you want to create a new DIV for these values? Not TR element in a TABLE?</p>

<p>3) You'd format the returning data in such a way that it was initially "hidden", and use an onclick handler for the main DIV element relating that record data to "reveal" the other data. It's all on the page, it's just hidden, you don't need to create a new XHR call.</p>

<p>4) There are many Ajax related tutorials online. Find one and start tinkering. In other words, it's a bit too complex to scratch out in a couple of lines here.</p>

<p>Although I don't normally jump on the JS library bandwagon, you may want to look at jQuery, it will make these tasks a snap. You should understand the underlying JS code and how the request is made, however.</p>
