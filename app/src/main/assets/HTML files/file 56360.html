<p>Yes, you can create storyboard for each device and you have to put condition for different device in <code>AppDelegate</code> file <code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {}</code> method.
But it is not proper way to resolve this type of issue.
For that you have to add constraints.
By using constraints your view appear every device compatible.</p>
