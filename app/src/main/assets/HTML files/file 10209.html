<p>It looks like you're never setting "value" so it would still be null. I think that might be your problem.  Can you try setting that String value before calling putExtra?</p>

<p>Also, to get the selected text from the view clicked. do the following:</p>

<pre><code>String textOfSelectedItem  =((TextView) arg1).getText().toString();
</code></pre>
