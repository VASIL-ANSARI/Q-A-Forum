<p>If you select only the columns you want in the linq query, and then call .ToList() on the query, it will be immedietly executed, and will only bring back the columns you are interested in. For example if you do this:</p>

<pre><code>var q = from p in dataContext.products select p.ProductName;
var results = q.ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>You will get back a list of product names stored in results, and when the query executes on the server it will only bring back the ProductName column.</p>
