<p>First off, local variables are local to the function they are defined in so variables inside the event handler function for the one event are not available to another event handler function that is defined outside that function.</p>

<p>You can save yourself duplicating the code by combining your two event handlers into one event handling function where you use a common setup and then branch based on the event.  </p>

<p>Here's a code example of that:</p>

<pre><code>        // set up a single event handler for multiple events
        $("#homepage-media-slider li &gt; img").on('mouseenter mouseleave', function(e) {
            // common code setup here
            var ele = $(this);
            var eleSrc = $(this).attr('src');

            // branch based on the event that occurred here
            if (e.type === "mouseenter") {
                // mouseenter code here
                var overleafImage = $(this).attr('data-overleaf');
                ele.attr('src', overleafImage);
                ele.attr('data-overleaf', eleSrc);
            } else {
                // mouse leave code here
            }
        });
</code></pre>

<p>Note, this is a much better way than moving the variables up to a higher scope and trying to share them because here, they are properly initialized for each event occurrence and would even work proerly if your event handler was serving multiple objects or if events arrived in an unusual order.</p>
