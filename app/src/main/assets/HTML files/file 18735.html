<p>When dealing with <code>CHAR</code>, <code>VARCHAR</code>, and <code>TEXT</code> columns (as you are dealing with <code>TEXT</code>), the prefix-length you assign when creating the index will create a hash using the <em>first X characters</em> - exactly how you're thinking (<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-index.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>).</p>

<p>When dealing with a standard index, changing the size of the data that's indexed should also change the size of the index (i.e. - adding characters should increase the index; removing should decrease). When dealing with a HASH-index, and this is a guess because I cannot find specific documentation regarding it, I would assume that it <em>doesn't</em> increase (at least, not by much) due to the nature of hashing-algorithms.</p>

<p>HASH-indexes are only applied to the <code>=</code> and <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operators, so your sample usage of <code>teksti='random text'</code> is perfect for this type of index (<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-indexes.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>). If you need to use other operators, such as the <code>LIKE</code>, <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> operators, you may have to consider switching to a <code>B-TREE</code> index instead.</p>

<p>As a complete alternative option, you could check out <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-search.html" rel="nofollow"><code>FULLTEXT</code></a> index. This provides a large amount of matching capabilities, though it's fairly robust and may be <em>too much</em>. The documentation on the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-search.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Full-Text Search Functions</code></a> page states that <code>FULLTEXT</code> can only be used with MyISAM, <em>however</em>, <code>Section 14.2.4.12.3</code> on the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-table-and-index.html" rel="nofollow"><code>InnoDB Table and Index</code></a> documentation page covers <code>FULLTEXT</code> indexes with InnoDB - so, this may or may not be available =P.</p>
