<p>A <code>Collection</code> represent a logical grouping of data and a set of functions to operate on the data.<br>
You can find libraries that offer advanced data-structures and better performance than what is offered in the <code>JDK</code> but if I understand your question correctly, what you need is something to understand the logic you want to build <em>on top</em> of the collection.<br>
I mean, the separation between different types of exceptions and if they are logged or not etc. are part of <em>your</em> application logic.<br>
It is not something related to a collections framework which offers exactly that.  Collections and helper methods <em>on data</em></p>
