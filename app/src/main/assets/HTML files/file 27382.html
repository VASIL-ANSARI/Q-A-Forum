<p>You cannot use aliased columns in where clause, but you can use subquery and filter by new columns:</p>

<pre><code>select
    Deal_ID, start_date, end_date, New_Members
from (
    select
        `r`.`deal_id` as Deal_ID, 
        concat("2013\-05\-15") as start_date, 
        concat("2013\-05\-16") as end_date, 
        abs(0) AS New_Members 
    from (`ws_deal` r) 
) as a
where New_Members != 0 
order by `deal_id`" 
</code></pre>
