<p>It makes it easier to build alternative clients (mobile) to your server app if the server app is just a point to get data.  That way you can support mobile devices as well as traditional browsers.  Another advantage is you offload the work of rendering to the client, so the server doesn't speed as much time generating and sending markup to the client.  </p>

<p>If you have a lot of legacy code and have no plans for mobile devices it could be a hard sell to rearchitect an existing system.  Client MVC is definitely the future.</p>
