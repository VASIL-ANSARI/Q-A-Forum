<p>No, there is no such limitation. I regularly parse much larger chunks of memory. IIn each case I am ensuring the string is zero terminated; the documentation is unclear on the necessity for this. I would suggest your incoming XML is corrupted or perhaps your system has insufficient memory to allocate the XML document. </p>
