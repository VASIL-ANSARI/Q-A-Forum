<pre><code>SELECT   comment.on AS content_id, COUNT(comment_id) AS num_comments
FROM     comments
GROUP BY content_id
ORDER BY num_comments DESC
</code></pre>

<p>If you need all the fields of the content, you can do a join:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT   contents.*, COUNT(comment_id) AS num_comments
FROM     contents
  LEFT JOIN comments on contents.content_id = comments.on
GROUP BY content_id
ORDER BY num_comments DESC
</code></pre>
