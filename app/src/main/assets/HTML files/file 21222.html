<p>I think you are mostly there.  Your slider is probably stored in a propery...just check it like you would any other property when you need its value.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)sliderChanged:(UISlider *)sender
{
    //[self drawMapRect...]
}

-(void)drawMapRect:(MKMapRect)mapRect zoomScale:(MKZoomScale)zoomScale inContext:CGContextRef)context
{
     CrumbPath *crumbs = (CrumbPath *)(self.overlay);
     CGFloat lineWidth = self.mySliderControl.value;
     //Do something with lineWidth
}
</code></pre>
