<p>CPU% is meaningless regarding performance, because when your program is executing it uses 100% of the CPU, and when it is waiting it uses 0%.
The displayed CPU% is just an average.</p>

<p>The only thing it might tell you is if your program is more or less I/O-bound.</p>

<p>Sure, the program will run faster or slower on a faster or slower CPU, unless it is I/O-bound.
If you are concerned about the speed of the software, you could do what a lot of people do, and that is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/378024/23771"><em>eliminate all waste in the software itself</em></a>.</p>
