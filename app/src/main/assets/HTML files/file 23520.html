<p>Models contain states, controllers control behavior, and views display the data to the user. So, in this case, you should probably have an <code>Ant</code> model and maybe a <code>Stick</code> model. The Ant would be related to the Stick and its position should probably be within the bounds of the Stick's size. So, on the <code>index</code> action (or wherever you're setting this all up) you'd initialize a Stick and as the user interacts with the application, use AJAX to instantiate new Ant objects and display them on the screen. I'm not sure how you envision <code>createAndSet</code> being called. Would be helpful to understand more about the user's interaction with your application.</p>

<p>My thinking is honestly that Rails doesn't need to be involved here at all. If you're not persisting this to a database and the user doesn't need to be able to retrieve the state of things later on, then I would write the whole thing in Javascript. You could create an Ant and Stick object and expose functions attached to DOM nodes for the user to interact.</p>
