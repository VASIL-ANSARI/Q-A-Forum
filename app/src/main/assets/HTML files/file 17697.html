<p>Hard to guess, what's going wrong without further details about your http client and the server API. My first try debugging this would be to grab <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" rel="nofollow">wireshark</a> and check, if your generated requests are identical to the ones generated with the implementation of your other clients with the following questions to answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are some headers different?</li>
<li>Content-Length and Content-Type specified correctly?</li>
<li>Did the authentication succeed or is the response with the missing title used quite generically?</li>
</ul>
