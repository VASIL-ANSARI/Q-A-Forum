<p>Any index can give benefit by allowing a query to narrow down the set of rows to examine.</p>

<p>A multi-column index can help when your query includes conditions on those multiple columns.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Mytable WHERE user_id = 123 AND created_at &gt; '2013-02-01'
</code></pre>

<p>The multi-column index narrows down to the subset of rows that are associated with user_id 123, then within that subset, it further narrows down the selection to those with a recent created_at value.  </p>

<p>Without the second column in the index, the RDBMS would have to load <em>all</em> the rows for user_id 123 into memory before it could determine if they pass the criteria.</p>
