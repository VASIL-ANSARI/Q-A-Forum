<p>Because it appears that your table has no clustered index (neither a primary key which would cause the default clustered index), it will be created as a <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh213609.aspx" rel="nofollow">heap</a>.</p>

<p>Also, your table doesn't have any non-clustered indexes either - usually, as the number of rows in a table with indexes increases, the index depth will also gradually get <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8992351/finding-the-height-of-the-b-tree-of-a-table-in-sql-server">deeper</a>, meaning insert performance will be slightly degraded.</p>

<p>But since it seems you have no indexes, constraints, defaults, indexed views or persisted computed columns, inserts should be constant time as the table grows.</p>

<p>(IMO a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11787797/should-every-user-table-have-a-clustered-index">table with no indexing at all is fairly unusual</a> - filtered query performance will likely be abysmal - typically this will only be useful for e.g. log or staging data which is then completely re-read with a reader and processed into final tables.)</p>
