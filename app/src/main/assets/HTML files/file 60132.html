<p>Camera plugin store data in Android/Data/my.package.com/ directory.This directory is always accessible from your app even if you didn't grant read/write permission in manifest file of Android.It is always safe to do this while developing a API.
If you still you want to change and store file at custom location then create your own plugin to achieve this.</p>
