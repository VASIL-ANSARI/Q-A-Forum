<p>Have you tried:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;data android:host="com.google.android.youtube" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in your intent filter?</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, then your best course of action would be to register it as a normal "share" broadcast receiver and log various elements of the broadcast to the console, then compare shares from YouTube to all other apps.</p>
