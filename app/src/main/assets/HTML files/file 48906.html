<p>The problem is the underlying <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/forego" rel="nofollow">forego</a> tool, which <code>heroku local</code> uses to run your process.</p>

<p>I think the toolbelt still installs <code>foreman</code>, so you could try running <code>foreman start worker</code> instead.</p>

<p>In the end, you could always just run the Procfile command manually, but you'll need to set up your env vars manually too.</p>
