<p>You didn't create a list. You created a <em>set</em>, which can only hold unique elements. You must've had quite few duplicates for the result to be half the length.</p>

<p>A list comprehension would use square brackets:</p>

<pre><code>CEEBcomp = [re.sub("[^0-9]", "", str(x)) for x in df.CEEB]
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need to use <code>list()</code> on <code>df.CEEB</code>; it must be an iterable for <code>list()</code> to work and an iterable is all you need for a comprehension, set or list or otherwise.</p>
