<p>The types of all options in the <code>ORDER BY</code> CASE statement need to match, so you'll need to cast to something common e.g.</p>

<pre><code>CASE @OrderBy
        WHEN 1
            THEN CAST(exp.PartNo AS NVARCHAR(20))
        WHEN 2
            THEN CAST(exp.ExportDate AS NVARCHAR(20))
        END
</code></pre>

<p>(The optimal type to cast to will depend on the native types of <code>PartNo</code> and <code>ExportDate</code>)</p>
