<p>Your COLLATION for passsword inside mysql will be of type "ascii". Change it to "utf8_eneral_ci/latin1_swedish_ci". This will allow new password values to be stored as normal string. For existing values you have to write a schedular or batch that takes ascii collated string as input and convert it latin1_swedish_ci.</p>
