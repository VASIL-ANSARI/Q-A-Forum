<p>You're almost right. This behaviour actually comes from the function call specifically, not because of any sort of "only works once" rule.</p>

<p>Here's the wording for the whole lifetime extension "feature", with the pertinent rule emphasised in bold:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>[C++11: 12.2/5]:</code> <em>[..]</em> The temporary to which the reference is bound or the temporary that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference is bound persists for the lifetime of the reference <strong>except</strong>:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>[..]</em></li>
  <li><strong>A temporary bound to a reference parameter in a function call (5.2.2) persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the call.</strong></li>
  <li><em>[..]</em></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
