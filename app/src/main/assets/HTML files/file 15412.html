<li><p>Lion uses Python 2.7 by default; Python 2.5 and 2.6 are also available.</p></li>
<li><p><code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</code> does not exist on a stock install of Lion. My guess is that you've ended up with this by installing some application or another.</p></li>
<li><p>The default Python install is primarily installed in <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</code>, although some components are located elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes - you can <code>brew install python</code> to get a Python 2.7 separate from the system version, or <code>brew install python3</code> to get Python 3.2. Both will install to <code>/usr/local</code>, like any other Homebrew recipe.</p></li>
