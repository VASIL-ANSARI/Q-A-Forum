<p>BEGIN and END are Transact-SQL statements. They get parsed and executed by SQL Server engine</p>

<p><code>:r</code> is a sqlcmd extension. The sqlcmd tool uses it to change whatever it sends to SQL Server.</p>

<p>If you send <code>:r</code> to the engine (which you did) you will get a syntax error. <code>:r</code> can be used in sqlcmd, in SSMS when sqlcmd mode is enabled, or you can sue a custom library to do it in your app, like <a href="https://github.com/rusanu/DbUtilSqlCmd" rel="nofollow"><code>DbUtilSqlCmd</code></a>.</p>
