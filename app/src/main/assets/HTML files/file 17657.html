<p>First of all CodeIgniter 1 is really really old. You should upgrade to AT LEAST 2.1. I'd upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter" rel="nofollow">CodeIgniter 3</a>.</p>

<p>Eitherway, inside your index.php file, there is a line that looks like this probably</p>

<pre><code>error_reporting(E_ALL);
</code></pre>

<p>You need to change it to</p>

<pre><code>error_reporting(0);
</code></pre>

<p>When you go to production.</p>
