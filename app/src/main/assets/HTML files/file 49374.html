<p>50k words is pretty small, HashMap is likely fine. Only you can say whether it actually is an acceptable solution, since you know your requirements.</p>

<p>Whenever you ask "is this optimal", you need to specify what optimality means for you: minimal space, minimal run time, maximal readability of the code etc. With many of these, optimality isn't actually required: you just need something which is <em>sufficient</em> to meet your requirements, e.g. doesn't use more than X space, doesn't take longer than Y to run.</p>

<p>One minor point is that you can make removal more efficient by not checking <code>hashMap.containsKey</code> first:</p>

<pre><code>if (hashMap.remove(word) != null) {
    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "ok", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
            .show();
} else {
    Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "not found", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
            .show();
}
</code></pre>

<p>which simply avoids looking up the value in the map twice. Note that this only works because you are inserting non-null values into the map when you construct it.</p>
