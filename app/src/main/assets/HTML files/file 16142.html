<p>One approach is to populate the ModuleCatalog based on the UserRoles.
One would do this in the Bootstrapper by overriding:
protected virtual IModuleCatalog GetModuleCatalog();
Another extensibility point are:
protected override void ConfigureContainer();</p>

<p>Dig into the startup sequence of your application and the Bootstrapper,
for other ideas can be found there.</p>
