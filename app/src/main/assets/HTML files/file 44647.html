<p>Looks like your app was built using layouts defined in xml files. These layouts uses images like images for background or source images for <code>ImageButton</code> or <code>ImageView</code> etc. All your drawables are usually stored in <code>drawable-DENSITY</code> folders. So you need to lower resolution of all of your drawables to save some RAM. Like if you have some drawable for <code>ImageView</code> lets call it new_image.jpg and its in <code>drawable-hdpi</code> and its resolution is 800x600 px try to resize it to 400x300 px (you could use a Farstone Image Viewer for this). Do that with every drawable in project and see what happens.<br>
Also it could be that you are displaying images in <code>ListViews</code> using some ImageLoader like Glide (recommended) or UIL or Picasso or whatever use use. Such loaders are usually consuming a lot of RAM (which is configurable however) for caching needs and due to that at one point AOS fails to load, build and represent some your layout which uses images by itself.<br>
Also I recommend you <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/index.html" rel="nofollow">to lern how to display Bitmaps efficiently</a> you <strong>MUST</strong> know such things.</p>
