<p>Your WHERE clause does not constrain <code>tblVegetationClass</code> in any way, so it will allow all such records through.  If you were to add</p>

<pre><code>AND dbo.tblVegetationClass.ID = 1
</code></pre>

<p>(or something along those lines) you would be restricting which vegetation class was returned by the query.</p>
