<p>To solve this, we first need to find the two keys that are not same as the input key. We then just swap the values for those keys.</p>

<pre><code>def swap(d, key):
   keys_to_swap = []
   for k in d:
       if k != key:
           keys_to_swap.append(k)
   # keys_to_swap are the keys that need to be swapped
   # Swap now
   temp = d.get(keys_to_swap[0])
   d[keys_to_swap[0]] = d.get(keys_to_swap[1])
   d[keys_to_swap[1]] = temp
   return d
</code></pre>

<p>Your original answer is correct, but you are not returning d.
So to correct your solution:</p>

<pre><code>def swap2(d, key):
    a, b = [_ for _ in d if _ != key]
    d[a], d[b] = d[b], d[a]
    return d #Added this line
</code></pre>
