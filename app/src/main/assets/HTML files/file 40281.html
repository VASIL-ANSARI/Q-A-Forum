<p>Your ListView should have some sort of data adapter, probably an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html" rel="nofollow">ArrayAdapter</a>, associated with it (you need to create this, it isn't automatic).</p>

<p>If you're using an <code>ArrayAdapter</code>, in the listener for your Volley request, <code>add()</code>/<code>addAll()</code> your results into the adapter.  The adapter will automatically cause the ListView to refresh.</p>

<p>If you've created your own adapter type that doesn't derive from <code>ArrayAdapter</code>, you'll have to handle the notification of changes manually.  That's what <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter.html#notifyDataSetChanged()" rel="nofollow"><code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code></a> does -- just call it after making your changes in the adapter, and it will refresh the view.</p>
