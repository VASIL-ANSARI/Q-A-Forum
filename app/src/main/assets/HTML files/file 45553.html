<p>you need to run the initialize function
in the example it's being called on the body onload hook</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body onload="initialize()"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>you might have dropped it on the way</p>

<p>taking the code out of the function so it could run is probably all you need to make it work</p>
