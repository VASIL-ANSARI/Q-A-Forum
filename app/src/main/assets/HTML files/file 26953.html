<p>What is possible:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Inlining: Maybe, processStructure() and constructStructure() located in the include file, or in the file, where you call those functons. If so, compiler can inline code itself, for save on proc-call. So, this is just effect of macro-optimization of combination functions calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Cache effect: Maybe, you use less code, or less memory, and after optimization something can fit into cache L1/L2.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suggest you generate assembly file for both program variants (-S option for gcc), and compare assembler code.</p>
