<p>As unwieldy as it may be, I have opted to subclass <code>WebClient</code> in order to add the functionality in a way that mimics the way <code>WebClient</code> typically works (in which headers are consumed by / reset after each use):</p>

<pre><code>public class ApiWebClient : WebClient {
  public DateTime? IfModifiedSince { get; set; }

  protected override WebRequest GetWebRequest(Uri address) {
    var webRequest = base.GetWebRequest(address);
    var httpWebRequest = webRequest as HttpWebRequest;
    if (httpWebRequest != null) {
      if (IfModifiedSince != null) {
        httpWebRequest.IfModifiedSince = IfModifiedSince.Value;
        IfModifiedSince = null;
      }
      // Handle other headers or properties here
    }
    return webRequest;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This has the advantage of not having to write boilerplate for the standard operations that WebClient provides, while still offering some of the flexibility of using WebRequest.</p>
