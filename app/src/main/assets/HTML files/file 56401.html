<p>First, you should eschew using commas in your <code>FOR</code> statement because it makes the query hard to read, and this style of query has been deprecated.  Instead, use an explicit <code>JOIN</code>.  Regarding your question, if the other two tables also have a <code>street</code> column for the address, then you can simply add two more conditions to your <code>WHERE</code> clause.  Here is what your revamped query might look like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t.nev
FROM hospital.person sz INNER JOIN hospital.place t
    ON sz.residence_placeid = t.placeid
INNER JOIN hospital.member ti
    ON sz.residence_placeid = ti.placeid AND t.placeid=ti.placeid
WHERE t.street like 'Xy Street %' OR
      sz.street LIKE 'Xy Street %' OR
      ti.street LIKE 'Xy Street %' OR
ORDER BY t.street
</code></pre>
