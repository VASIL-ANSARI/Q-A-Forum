<p>No, it is overly complicated.</p>

<p>You do not need different controller for another action you want to make on something. Eg. if you have a controller for creating a movie, you do not need separate controller for editing it. You need <strong>separate action, not controller</strong>.</p>

<p>Basically you should employ <strong>DRY (Don't-Repeat-Yourself)</strong> rule for that. If view only differs by the values and <code>form</code>'s action, <strong>just use one view for both actions</strong> (create &amp; edit). View should generate similar code for both actions - one will have no form fields filled, with <code>form</code>'s action set to eg. "<code>movies/create</code>" and the second one will have prepopulated form fields with <code>form</code>'s action set to eg. "<code>movies/&lt;movie_ID_here&gt;/update</code>" (naming convention is up to you).</p>

<p><strong>Validation should be in model</strong>, but as additional help for the users you can validate it also on the client side, using JavaScript or HTML5 (depending what you want), so they do not need to submit the form to know they forgot about something.</p>
