<p>OK, I'm confused.... What is calling the ASMX?</p>

<p>It sounds like it's been called from the page via javascript -- which means the Page object is gone.</p>

<p>An ASPX page is a short program, which lives for a moment, spits out some HTML, and terminates.  The HTML goes to a browser, which then talks to the ASMX page.  Eventually, you postback and a new Page object is created.</p>
