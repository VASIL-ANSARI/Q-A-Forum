<p>So heres what I ended up doing to solve this:</p>

<p>Previously I was working between two files. I had the Dropbox authcode in Main.java, and the actual upload code in Dropboxfileuploadactivity.java. No matter what I tried, I could not get the upload to work this way. I received a NullPointerException every time. I initially blamed it on the variables and not being able to use then with the Dropbox methods. After days of trying to figure it out, in the end, moving the auth code and the upload code together in to Main.java is what solved my issue. No more NullPointerExceptions. Odd, but it worked. The variables work fine.</p>
