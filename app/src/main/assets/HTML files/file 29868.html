<p>The problem is that in your del_mysql function, you are referencing the connection object $con, which does not exist in the scope of the function. Either pass it into the function as a parameter like this:</p>

<pre><code>function del_mysql($table, $id, $con) {
</code></pre>

<p>or access it as a global variable like this:</p>

<pre><code>function del_mysql($table, $id) {
    global $con;
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>
