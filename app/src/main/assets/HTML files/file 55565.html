<p>What you are trying to do, doesn't make any sense in terms of MVC/WebAPI relation. In MVC a whole website is served by your server, using WebAPI you rely on client-API relation, in which you create an API, which can be consumed by whoever you allow to.</p>

<p>You can't mix those approaches in terms of redirection. What you can do is to inform your client, that a redirect is needed in this specific scenario(but this still is not an ideal solution) and perform a redirect on the client side.</p>

<p>Just think about it - if you create an API, which can be consumed by "everyone", does it seems a right thing to do to perform such redirects? Another option would be to call an action in your MVC controller and get the results, but I assume you would like to go to the another page when an user has an "Admin" role.</p>
