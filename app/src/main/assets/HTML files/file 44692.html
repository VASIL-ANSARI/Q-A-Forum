<p>If you're looking at console then how come you didn't see <code>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL</code> on tax-register:107? That's your problem. In your code above you've put <code>var pieces = event.target.value.split("\\");</code>, but on your website you have <code>var pieces = event.target.value.split("\");</code>, you're not escaping the special character. This is breaking your JavaScript, and so your function is never defined.</p>

<p>In addition, if you're looking at the console, why haven't you done anything about <code>Uncaught Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery</code>? Include jQuery.</p>
