<p>You might try using a <code>waitFor</code> method instead, which specifies both a time and a "condition" to wait for. The implementation detail would be hidden, but one possible implementation would be to try your action immediately and loop until the specified condition has been met, with an appropriate pause between attempts.</p>

<p>Here's a sample interface for a <code>Condition</code> I use myself (as you can see, it doesn't need to be complex):</p>

<pre><code>public interface Condition {
    public boolean met();
}
</code></pre>
