<p>I don't know if there are any way to do that.But if it exists, it deals with the internal structure/code of JQM.I can give you a easy solution:</p>

<p>Suppose,the height of the select pop-up is 150px.Then modify your page CSS like that:</p>

<pre><code>#pageId{
    height: auto;
    min-height: 160px; /* Some value greater than 150px, As I assume selectbox pop-up's height 150px*/   
}
</code></pre>
