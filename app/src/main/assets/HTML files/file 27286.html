<p>The State Pattern is probably a good solution to this problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>my GameTruco only consider the state of the game after the different Challenges that could be called, but DONT consider the playing of the cards themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if the state is only considering whose turn it is and what the current bets are etc, then the cards could be considered separate from the state.  You will need to have logic else where to track the cards and how to determine who won (which perhaps also updates the state)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>also, I don't quite get how I'm going to mix this up with my Button's onClickListeners when I finish designing this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your click listener code should be the place where the states are changed.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>//listener code implementation
//user has decided to raise...

int raiseAmount = ... // perhaps passed in thru listener or from UI objects
State currentState;  //current state before raise

currentState = currentState.player1Raises(raiseAmount);
//now state is for player 2 to decide what to do

//update UI to let player 2 decide what to do given current State
</code></pre>
