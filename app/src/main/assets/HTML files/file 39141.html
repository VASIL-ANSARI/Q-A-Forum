<p>What are you trying to achieve exactly? </p>

<p>If you're trying to extract a value from the url like you would normally do with Request.QueryString["someValue"], you should read up on how Routing works. Here's a good write-up

<p>If you are only interested in getting the url itself, you can use</p>

<pre><code>Page.Request.RawUrl
</code></pre>
