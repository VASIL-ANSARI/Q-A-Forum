<p>Javascript will not allow you to make requests between domains, howewer, this behavior can be changed if the server sends <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header with the name of whitelisted domain.  </p>

<h2>CORS</h2>

<p>As I've said, you can yse special response header to allow cross-domain request. This method is called <strong>CORS</strong> - <em>Cross Origin resource sharing</em>.<br>
It is used like that:</p>

<pre><code>header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: www.domain.tld");
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunatelly, this was only recently introduced and has poor browser support.</p>

<h2>JSONP</h2>

<p>Another method to fire cross domain request is JSONP. This can only be applyed to GET requests. Because you are sending POST, I will not introduce this further.</p>

<h2>Iframe</h2>

<p>You may have forgotten about possibility of using an Iframe. Of course, in that case you will not get any return values and it will be impossible to monitor upload process. But you can still inform user about sucess if you fire <code>alert()</code> function in the iframe. Also, you can reload page from the iframe:  </p>

<pre><code>window.top.location = "domain.com/script.php?upload=sucessfull";
</code></pre>
