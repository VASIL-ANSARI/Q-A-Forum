<p>Not sure if you are looking for a service to execute something in the background or something on a thread. Have you looked at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadpool%28v=vs.95%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">ThreadPool</a> class for threading? </p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kbf0f1ct%28v=vs.95%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem</a> to run on a different thread or use ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject to register a delegate to wait for a timeout and run later. </p>
