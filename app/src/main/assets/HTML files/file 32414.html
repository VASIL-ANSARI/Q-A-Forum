<p>What do you expect the JFrame to paint, when you're setting a transparent background color? Of course it doesnt "reset". From your description I still fail to see for what you would need <em>any transparency</em> at all.</p>

<p>If your goal is to make the entire JFrame transparent with respect to the desktop, your approach is <em>meaningless</em>. You need to explicitly make the frame transparent, which is easily found using google: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/trans_shaped_windows.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/trans_shaped_windows.html</a></p>
