<p>Though I agree with @Eevee about using the API, by scraping you are probably violating their terms and conditions.</p>

<p>If you want to crawl a webiste use scrapy (<a href="http://scrapy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://scrapy.org/</a>)</p>

<p>Just analyze the page to see which elements you need and how it is the most efficient to get to them and just write the crawler</p>
