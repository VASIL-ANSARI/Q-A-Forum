<p>A quick inspection of that <code>i</code> element shows the following CSS classes being applied:</p>

<pre><code>img
sp_ezjerk
sx_440431
</code></pre>

<p>The latter two appear to be dynamically generated and change with each page load.</p>

<p>The first of the latter two, on each page load, shows the following CSS rules:</p>

<pre><code>background-image: url("/rsrc.php/v2/yR/r/7TyBDSy09g8.png");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-size: 104px 488px;
display: inline-block;
height: 32px;
width: 24px;
</code></pre>

<p>The image file at <code>/rsrc.php/v2/yR/r/7TyBDSy09g8.png</code> contains the logo, and the CSS is positioning it to display only that portion of the image.</p>

<p>As for why they chose an <code>i</code> element, that is beyond me.  I wouldn't have chosen it, but I guess they did.</p>
