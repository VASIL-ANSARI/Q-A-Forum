<p><code>viewPager</code> is <code>null</code>. You initialize it like this:</p>

<pre><code>viewPager = (ViewPager) findViewById(R.id.pager);
</code></pre>

<p><code>findViewById</code> returns the view if found and <code>null</code> otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>public View findViewById (int id) Added in API level 1</p>
  
  <p>Finds a view that was identified by the id attribute from the XML that
  was processed in onCreate(Bundle). Returns</p>

<pre><code>The view if found or null otherwise.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Your problem is that the view is not found, maybe because it was not created (yet).</p>
