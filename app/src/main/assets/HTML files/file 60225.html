<p>Same thing on Nexus 6 updated to Nougat.
My application worked and now doesn't work anymore.</p>

<p>I tried using an alternative libary (OkHttp) but it ends up in the same result.
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Connection closed by peer</p>

<p>The app work against other servers but not this particular one (same cipher parameters as your).</p>

<p>Same app on older Android (6 and below) works great.
It doesn't matter if you build for an older version. It crashs on 7.</p>

<p>Something has changed on the SSL stack.</p>

<p>Regards</p>
