<p>You do it the other way around:</p>

<pre><code>$('.focus:not(:hidden):first').focus();
</code></pre>

<p>Right now you're getting the first element with the class <code>.focus</code>, which is of course hidden, then you filter on visible elements only, and that leaves you with nothing?<br>
You need to get the visible elements, and then get the first one.</p>
