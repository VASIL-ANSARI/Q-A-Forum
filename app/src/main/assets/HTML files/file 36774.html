<p>Not to answer your question, but you NEED to check on the security. I recommend setting the site down right now before fixing it. I just could upload and execute <code>apac.php</code>, which only contained this PHP:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo "This is a really bad security issue"; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I could be a malicious person and break your website. Check it out: <a href="http://neiol.1ufh.com/uploads/apac.php" rel="nofollow">http://neiol.1ufh.com/uploads/apac.php</a></p>

<p>NOTE: I put this in an answer since the comment is too small for the formatting and everything,</p>
