<li><p>Check for the existence of the file.</p></li>
<li><p>If the file doesn't exist:</p>

<li><p>create a ReentrantLock, and store it in a ConcurrentHashMap, with the path of the file as the key, using the <code>putIfAbsent()</code> method.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>putIfAbsent()</code> returns a lock, then use this lock in the following. Else, use the lock you created and stored in the map.</p></li>
<li><p>Acquire the lock on the ReentrantLock.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have the lock, check if the file exists. If it doesn't, create it. Else, you don't have anything to do because a concurrent thread created it before.</p></li>
<li><p>Release the lock and remove it from the map (in a finally block).</p></li>
