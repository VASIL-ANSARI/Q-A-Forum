<p>You want to get address to not exist variable. (function, for the matter, is kind of const variable)</p>

<p>What you have now it is just like a forward declaration. You state for a function but not implement it (it is similar to missing <code>extern</code> variable).</p>

<p>The address itself should be given during link, but when the linker search for it, it is missing.</p>

<p>In addition the function can be implemented after the main function or even in other file, but the compiler is processing one file at a time in a serial processing. therefor the compiler can't know the function was not implemented anywhere.</p>

<p>So there is no compile error since there is forward declaration, and the name is known, but there is link error because the function is used but not implemented.</p>
