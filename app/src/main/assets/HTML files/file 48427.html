<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After reading the question again and again, I think the problem is something else. I feel this is a application sandbox security issue, and I think that the browser app in your device cannot access the local files (all.pdf) residing in your app directory. I think you would need to write the file first in the <strong>'documentsDirectory'</strong> which should be publicly accessible to Android. </p>

<p>Look at this thread here and look at the accepted answer comments:</p>

<p><strong>My older anwser:</strong></p>

<p>Could be a relative URL issue. Check the path of your local PDF, and debug to see if its actually getting packaged or not. </p>

<p>Try "/pdfs/all.pdf" and see if that works.</p>
