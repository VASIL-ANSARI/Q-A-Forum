<p>JTS doesn't care what your point's units or coordinate system is.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://tsusiatsoftware.net/jts/jts-faq/jts-faq.html">it does assume that the coordinates are on a Cartesian plane</a>, so some geometry operations such as distance calculations may be inaccurate over long distances. (They don't yet support geodetic calculations.)</p>

<p>It should be fine for simple storage uses.</p>

<p>However, an important point to note is that the longitude is the X value and the latitude the Y value. So we say "lat/long", but JTS will expect it in the order "long/lat". So you should be using <code>geometryFactory.createPoint(new Coordinate(longitude, latitude))</code></p>
