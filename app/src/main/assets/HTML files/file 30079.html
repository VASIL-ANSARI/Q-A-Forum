<p>Any system you use will be unreliable for regulating font spacing in email, particularly because different machines may not even have the same font. You're limited by the fact that different systems will have different fonts, which are all, as I'm sure you know, differently sized.
Unless you use HTML emails you're pretty much out of options, I believe unless you calculate the "maximum size" for the largest font. But even then, window width can completely blow that away.</p>
