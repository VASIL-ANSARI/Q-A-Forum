<p>I don't think that it is likely to be a data type issue (unless they are floating point numbers then it may be) but if you want to check if they are the same type then use ===.  My guess would be that there is a rouge space in one of them that you can't detect when you print it out.  Can you give the example of what gets printed out?</p>
