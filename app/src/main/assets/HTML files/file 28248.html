<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/share/interactive" rel="nofollow">Interactive Post</a> feature allows prefilling up to 10 recipients by user ID or by email address.  It does not allow prefilling of Circles, or of the Extended Circles or Public share options.  It only allows IDs and email addresses, therefore only allowing up to 10 specific people to be shared with.</p>

<p>From the specification for <code>data-recipients</code>:</p>

<p>"A comma-separated list of user IDs and email addresses that you want to prefill the share settings with. You can get these IDs by calling the people.list method on behalf of an authenticated user. A maximum of ten recipients are allowed."</p>
