<p>Just for the record, this is because <code>skip_confirmation!</code> actually marks the account as confirmed (sets the <code>confirmed_at</code> column).  To just skip sending the confirmation email, use <code>skip_confirmation_notification!</code> instead.  It looks like you're using some customised code (user_controller.rb), as with the normal devise registration process the confirmation email wouldn't be sent until a user had been created, including a password.</p>
