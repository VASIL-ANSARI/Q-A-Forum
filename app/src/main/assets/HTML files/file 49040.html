<p>If port is the problem, you need an URL without port, where your server is available. The easiest way to do that is to use <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/configuring/#using-ngrok" rel="nofollow">ngrok</a>. Admin guru would recommend you something more secured and serious. For example, setup and configure Apache HTTP Server. But it's another topic. 
Actually, I would recommend to read detailed explanation of <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/" rel="nofollow">how to setup Github web hooks</a>. Bitbucket works in a very similar way(unfortunately, Bitbucket is not so well documented). </p>
