<p>Per the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/uiapplicationdelegate_protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the app is not running when a push notification arrives, the method
  launches the app and provides the appropriate information in the
  launch options dictionary. The app does not call this method to handle
  that push notification. Instead, your implementation of the
  <code>application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> or
  <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> method needs to get the
  push notification payload data and respond appropriately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In particular, the key you should be looking for in the launch options dictionary is <code>UIApplicationLaunchOptionsRemoteNotificationKey</code>.</p>
