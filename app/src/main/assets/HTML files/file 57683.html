<p>I'm not sure what is the configuration of your WP installation, but it might happen due to buffering that is done by the application (php) or by your server (apache?).</p>

<p>Some configuration can cause the output to be compressed (gzipped, mostly) before being sent back to the user, therfore your application must finish with all of the the output before it can be compressed.</p>

<p>You can check (using the Developer Tools) if the output was compressed in each of the requests (you should check for the <code>Content-Encoding</code> header).</p>
