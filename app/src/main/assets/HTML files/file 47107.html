<p>You need to test for fish collision with boundaries, and if so, then change the animation settings to change the direction of movement. This will entail using an if block or two in the code where you move the fish. In pseudocode, it would look like:</p>

<pre><code>if fish location is equal to or less than 0 
   change deltaX to a positive value
if fish location + fish width is equal to or greater than width of tank
   change deltaX to a negative value 

move fish by deltaX
</code></pre>

<p>I usually use the absolute values of the detlaX, i.e.,</p>

<pre><code>deltaX = Math.abs(deltaX);
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>deltaX = -Math.abs(deltaX);
</code></pre>

<p>rather than simply swapping signs. The reason is that if you simply swap signs, you risk getting the fish stuck at the corner.</p>
