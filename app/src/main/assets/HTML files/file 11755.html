<p>Probably this has to do with the image format. It depends on the way you load the image into the buffer. <code>QImage</code> expects to find an image stored line by line in the provided buffer. </p>

<p>Try the <code>Format_Indexed8</code> or <code>Format_RGB32</code> image formats. If it still does not work let us know how you have loaded the <code>jpeg</code> image into the buffer.</p>

<p>Notice that <code>QImage</code> provides a <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qimage.html#QImage-9" rel="nofollow">constructor</a> with the image filename as argument.</p>
