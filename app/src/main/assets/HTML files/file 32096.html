<p>in your situation where you have multiple columns referencing back to the same table you can JOIN the same table again and just alias it differently .. something like ....</p>

<pre><code>SELECT R1.SomeColumn, R2.SomeColumn
FROM Master_table M 
         INNER JOIN Refrenced_Table R1  --&lt;-- Alias R1
ON M.Column1 = R1.Pk                   -- JOIN Condition with Alias R1
       INNER JOIN Refrenced_Table R2      --&lt;-- Alias R2
ON M.Column2 = R2.Pk                  -- JOin condition with Alias R2
</code></pre>

<p>Join the Master table back to Referencing table as many as column you have which references back to that table each time with a different Alias. </p>

<p>In you Select Statement use Columns comming from Different aliases to get the required results.</p>
