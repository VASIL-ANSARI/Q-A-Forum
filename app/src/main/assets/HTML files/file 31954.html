<p>Don't use == to compare string, == is compare their address and equals is compare their value so that you need use equals<br>
this code can provide NPE</p>

<pre><code>if("abc123".equals(user)){
    Intent k=new Intent(MainActivity.this,MainActivity1.class);
    startActivity(k);
}
</code></pre>
