<p>there are 2 problems in your code:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>first of all, readline() will block untill when a new line is printed out and flushed.<br>
That means you should execute the code </p>

<p>while True:<br>
    ...    </p></li>
</ol>

<p>in a new Thread and call a callback function when the output is ready.  </p>

<ol start="2">
<li><p>Since the readline is waiting for a new line, you must use   </p>

<p>print 'Hello World'<br>
 sys.stdout.flush()</p></li>
</ol>

<p>everytime in your executable.</p>

<p>You can see some code and example on my git:<br>

<p>Instead, if your external tool is buffered, the only thing you can try is to use stderr as PIPE:
