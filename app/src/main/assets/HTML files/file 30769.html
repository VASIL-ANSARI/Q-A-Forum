<p>It's about what Java language level you want to use. KitKat supports full Java 7, Gingerbread and up support Java 6 and older versions are Java 5. At least when it comes to the core Java APIs. Roughly the same setting is mentioned <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Using-sourceCompatibility-1.7" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can often use language features that were added in one version in an older version if the compiler knows how to do it. For example the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4166966/what-is-the-point-of-the-diamond-operator-in-java-7">Diamond Operator</a> was added in Java 7 but you can still use that feature in Java 6 since</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>actually compiles into the same thing as</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>did.</p>

<p>The "try with resource" construct on the other hand can't be compiled into legal Java 6 compatible code and is therefore exclusive to Apps that require KitKat and up.</p>
