<p>Take a look at <a href="https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/source/f931ec39513854e56560fe85d55a5d144e22af88:src/qml/qml/qqmlcomponent.cpp#L1041" rel="nofollow">QQmlComponent.cpp</a>, it really contains a <code>createObject()</code> method, but it is a protected method so it could be undocumented.</p>

<pre><code>// QQmlComponent.cpp
void QQmlComponent::createObject(QQmlV8Function *args)
{
    Q_D(QQmlComponent);
    Q_ASSERT(d-&gt;engine);
    Q_ASSERT(args);
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Although it is protected it is also declared as <a href="https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qtdeclarative/source/f931ec39513854e56560fe85d55a5d144e22af88:src/qml/qml/qqmlcomponent.h#L123" rel="nofollow">Q_INVOKABLE</a>, hence you can call it from QML. I guess the reason it being a protected method is that it is meant to be called from QML's JavaScript and not from C++.</p>

<pre><code>// QQmlComponent.h
protected:
    QQmlComponent(QQmlComponentPrivate &amp;dd, QObject* parent);
    Q_INVOKABLE void createObject(QQmlV8Function *);
    Q_INVOKABLE void incubateObject(QQmlV8Function *);
</code></pre>
