<p>I'm assuming this is runs outside of the visitors web context? In order for .NET to fetch the appropriate strings from your resources, you will need to change the culture of the current thread:</p>

<pre><code>var culture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture( "pt" );
System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = culture;
</code></pre>

<p>I see that you pass on culture in your call:</p>

<pre><code> var resourceString = printJobResourceManager.GetString(resourceId, 
                                culture);
</code></pre>

<p>Are you saying that this invoke returns the worng result even when you send in the appropriate culture?</p>
