<p>Right now there is no way for your <code>Outlet</code> model to associate with the <code>articles</code> that it has. Once you say <code>belongs_to</code>, you need to have an <code>outlet_id</code> <code>column</code>. So you need to add an <code>outlet_id</code> (integer) column to your <code>Article</code> model and populate it with the id of the outlet they belong to. If an Article can belong to many outlets in that case you need to create a <code>many-to-many</code> relationship through a joint table.</p>
