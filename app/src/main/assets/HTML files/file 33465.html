<p>Expanding on my comment: the data isn't being encoded into JSON. jQuery will try to build normal URL encoded data from the objects (this explains why the first part is received).</p>

<p>Change to encode the JSON:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    data: JSON.stringify(data),
    contentType : 'application/json' // also set the content type
    ...
});
</code></pre>
