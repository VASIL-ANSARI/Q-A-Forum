<p>Sorry, but no.  All font properties <strong>cascade</strong> (the "C" from CSS) into all child elements and there is no way to prevent it.  You're going to have to reset the properties on the child elements if you don't want the same font.</p>

<p>One thing you can, potentially, do is not actually change the font on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, but on a container <strong><em>near</em></strong> it.  This will only work in newer browsers, if it works for you, great :) :</p>

<pre><code>ol {
  list-style-type : none;
}

ol &gt; li:before {
  content           : counter(list_counter) " ";
  counter-increment : list_counter;
  float             : left;
  font-family       : verdana;
}

ol:first-child {
  counter-reset: list_counter;
}
</code></pre>
