<p>Create an index for each type of WHERE clause you plan to have.  One joint index on <code>type</code> and <code>id_bar</code> will help the first query.  Another joint index on <code>type</code> and <code>id_foo</code> will help the second.</p>

<p>One index combining all 3 will not help because it's not specific enough to any single query.</p>
