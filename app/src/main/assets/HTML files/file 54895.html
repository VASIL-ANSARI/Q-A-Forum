<p>Here's what I pieced together for a similar situation from the openssl docs.  It isn't based on any deep understanding of keys, but it did work for me for the libraries I was using with Node. In the object from the JSON file, there is a member called 'private_key'.  Copy its value into a new file, say 'jsonkey.key', and replace all the occurrences '\n' with actual newlines.  Then run the command:</p>

<pre><code>openssl rsa -in jsonkey.key | openssl pkcs12 -password pass:notasecret -export -nocerts -out p12key.p12
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, change p12key.p12 to whatever you want your pkcs12 file to be called.</p>
