<p>In answer to your question: that's a no-no. You will leak memory if you autorelease an object (or use an autoreleased object) in a scope that has no autorelease pool.</p>

<h3>perhaps ignore the following:</h3>

<p>With regard to your example, it might be rather confusing the way you've written it, since <code>Class</code> is a typedef of <code>struct objc_class*</code>. So, you're really declaring a pointer-to-a-pointer to a class, and then assigning a pointer to a class to it. Which won't work. Moreover, since <code>Class</code> is not an Objective-C âclass-typeâ per se, you can't send messages to it.
But all this is neither here nor there, since <code>Â±class</code> does not return an autoreleased object.</p>
