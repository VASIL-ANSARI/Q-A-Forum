<p>What is so difficult to maintain about his solution?  Unless the config format changes, I don't foresee any maintenance (though surprises are always possible).  If maintenance is necessary, I think this solution will make it easier, as all the relevant parsing (including string->int, etc.) is in one place.</p>

<p>And his has far better compile-time checking.  If you remove a method, the compiler will tell you.  If you assign the return value to the wrong type, the compiler will tell you.</p>
