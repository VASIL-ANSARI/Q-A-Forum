<p>Please consider using jQuery and a statement like this which checks all checkboxes with the value "chk2":</p>

<pre><code>$("input:checkbox[value='chk2']").attr("checked", true);
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: A more elegant way would be the use of a ViewModel. Then you can bind the checkboxes to one single data entity and the checkboxes get checked/unchecked whenever the value of he underlying data changes. You can achieve that with knockout.js and it's easy to implement (<a href="http://knockoutjs.com" rel="nofollow">http://knockoutjs.com</a>)</p>
