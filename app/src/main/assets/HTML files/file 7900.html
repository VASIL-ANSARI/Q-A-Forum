<p>What do you mean by "save"? Do you mean just retain the X,Y co-ordinates in memory as long as the Activity is alive, or do you need to persistently store the data for future use? If you need to store those co-ordinates persistently, use SQLite. </p>

<p>Edit: Just noticed you've said 'to a file' in the title, so yes, SQLite is the best option. Or, do you have a specific need for the data to be written to a file, as opposed to SQLite?</p>

<p>Your question is far too vague. </p>
