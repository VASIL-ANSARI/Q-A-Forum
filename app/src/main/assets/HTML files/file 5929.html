<p>I've used SVNKit, it worked for me...they have some example's in their downloads... I was not so much comfortable learning it by those examples, but <a href="https://wiki.svnkit.com/Managing_A_Working_Copy">this</a> link worked for me...</p>

<p>I could implement following functionality easily: CheckIn(Local Copy(LC) to Repository(R)), CheckOut(R to LC), Commit(Update changes from LC to Rep) , importing Dir/File to R, deleting Dir/File from R...</p>

<p>P.S. - This <a href="http://old.nabble.com/SVNKit-f10898.html">forum</a> is also very helpful.</p>
