<p>The way I understand it... Instant is a UTC style time, agnostic of zone always UTC. LocaleTime is time at a given zone. So you'd expect the following would work given that Instant implements TemporalAccessor, </p>

<pre><code>Instant instant = Instant.now();
LocalTime local =  LocalTime.from(instant);
</code></pre>

<p>but you get "Unable to obtain LocalTime from TemporalAccessor" error. Instead you need to state where "local" is. There is no default - probably a good thing.</p>

<pre><code>Instant instant = Instant.now();
LocalTime local =  LocalTime.from(instant.atZone(ZoneId.of("GMT+3")));
System.out.println(String.format("%s =&gt; %s", instant, local));
</code></pre>

<p>Output</p>

<pre><code>2014-12-07T07:52:43.900Z =&gt; 10:52:43.900
</code></pre>

<p>instantStart.get(ChronoField.HOUR_OF_DAY) throws an error because it does not conceptually support it, you can only access HOUR_OF_DAY etc. via a LocalTime instance.</p>
