<p>Alright, here's the dirty way I managed to find. You need to inherit the <code>Button</code>, override the <code>WndProc</code> and expose a boolean which says whether currently processing <code>MouseDown</code>. </p>

<pre><code>class ButtonEx : Button
{
    public bool IsInMouseDown { get; set; }
    protected override void WndProc(ref Message m)
    {
        const int WM_LBUTTONDOWN = 0x0201;
        try
        {
            if (m.Msg == WM_LBUTTONDOWN)
                IsInMouseDown = true;
            base.WndProc(ref m);
        }
        finally //Make sure we set the flag to false whatever happens.
        {
            if (m.Msg == WM_LBUTTONDOWN)//Required to fight with reentracy
                IsInMouseDown = false;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your leave method</p>

<pre><code>private async void TxtLotTextLeave(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (yourButton.IsInMouseDown)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Ignoring Leave");
        return;
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works, however I won't guarantee it will continue to work always. You may need to address some corner cases or obvious thing which I've missed. That's a very hacky code, you are better off re-designing the logic.</p>
