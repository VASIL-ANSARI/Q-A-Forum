<p>I think the problem is that your alias and column name are the same, so when you refer to t1.number_column it is understanded as the actual number column, not the calculated timestamp value. In addition, you can not use alias of the column in the correlated subquery. So, this should work:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CAST(LAST_DAY(to_timestamp(lpad(cast(NUMBER_COLUMN as varchar2(6)), 6, '0'), 'MMYYYY')) AS TIMESTAMP) AS NUMBER_COLUMN_ALIAS FROM TAB1 T1
WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT TIMESTAMP_COLUMN FROM 
                 (SELECT TIMESTAMP_COLUMN FROM TAB2)
                 WHERE TIMESTAMP_COLUMN=CAST(LAST_DAY(to_timestamp(lpad(cast(NUMBER_COLUMN as   varchar2(6)), 6, '0'), 'MMYYYY')) AS TIMESTAMP));
</code></pre>
