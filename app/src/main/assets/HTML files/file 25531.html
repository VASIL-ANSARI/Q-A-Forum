<p>Maybe you should not only think about programming language but also about a component-library (like <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/" rel="nofollow">DevExpress</a>) Standard Winform-Controlls (and also WPF) are limited, so extra components can maybe give you a better base. In this case you can go on to use vb.net (or you may think about c#). </p>
