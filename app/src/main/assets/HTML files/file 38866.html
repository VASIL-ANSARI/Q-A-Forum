<p>You could implement this using activities for each question but I think the best way would be to use <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html" rel="nofollow">fragments</a> for each survey question. You could jump to a certain question fragment by storing them in an ordered array in the activity and switching to the one you want.</p>
