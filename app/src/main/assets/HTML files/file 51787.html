<p>I suggest you use Java to do the analysis.</p>

<ol>
<li>Java for analyzing the social network. (e.g. <a href="http://jung.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">JUNG</a>)</li>
<li>Export the result to PHP like reading the results from Java using PHP.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since I saw the comments that you already built the network, why not using Java/ Python to read your network. Based on the analysis from Python (i.e. write the result on disk/memory), you can still reuse the result on PHP, right?</p>

<p>Currently, I didn't see any library for social network analysis using PHP. You know, it would be much more computational intensive using PHP to do such mathematical things. Most of the guys do this in the back-end, like PHP "call/execute" some Java programs to run the results. </p>

<p>PHP will then read the results and shows to the user's browser. </p>
