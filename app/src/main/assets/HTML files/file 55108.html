<p>You shouldn't start activities when your app is in background. It is okay that your receiver is unregistered when user leaves the app.</p>

<p>Instead, store the information that the image is downloaded and then check it when the app is resumed. I don't know your use case, but, for example you can store this information to <code>SharedPreferences</code> and check it when the app is resumed. Then you can decide whether to start a new activity or not.</p>
