<p>It seems that you have a naming clash between a package and a class. There may have been some refactoring which left old class files around.</p>

<p>The error you have would occur if <code>Framework</code> was not a package, but a class, which contained <code>Item1</code> as its nested class. Another possibility is that you are just using the wrong directory as the source code root when compiling.</p>

<p>In any case, if the Java naming conventions were followed, the package would not be called <code>Framework</code> but <code>framework</code> and this situation would not arise.</p>
