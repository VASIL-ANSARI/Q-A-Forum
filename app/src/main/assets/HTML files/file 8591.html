<p>There is no keyword <code>undefined</code> in javascript, it does not work like <code>null</code> does.</p>

<p>When you use</p>

<pre><code>if(g===undefined)
</code></pre>

<p><code>undefined</code> will be parsed as an identifier. Therefore, the interpreter must check for existance of the <code>undefined</code> variable in the global (window) scope. This lookup takes some time. </p>

<p>IMHO, the more correct way to check for undefinedness is (though not necessarily faster)</p>

<pre><code>if(typeof(g) === 'undefined')
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, the expression <code>if(g)</code> is most likely implemented as an implicit cast to a boolean, which of course also takes some time.</p>

<p>So my guess is that these two different operations are not equally fast in the Firefox and Chrome engines.</p>
