<p>Each process "thinks" that it owns the full memory space available on the computer.  No process can "see" the memory space of another process.  As such, normally, nothing a process stores can be seen by another process.</p>

<p>Because it can be necessary to pass information between processess, certain mechanisms exists to provide this functionality.</p>

<p>One approach is message passing; one process issues a message to another, for example over a pipe, or a socket, or by a Windows message.</p>

<p>Another is shared memory, where a given block of memory is made available to two or more processes, such that whatever one process writes can be seen by the others.</p>
