<p>It's not just in admin forms, this happens for when you save any Django model  anywhere.</p>

<p>I'm not finding any good doc links to the "why", but I believe it has to do with the database structure. In Django it's stored in a single model, but on the database level it creates an intermediate table between <code>Contact</code> and <code>Tag</code> (which is the proper way to do it on the database level) - it's just hidden when inside Django.</p>

<p>Instead of using the <code>post_save</code> signal, you need to use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/1.9/ref/signals/#m2m-changed" rel="nofollow">m2m_changed</a> signal, which will fire when the ManyToMany field is changed.</p>
