<p>Your loop statement is the problem because of missing encolsing <code>{}</code>:  </p>

<pre><code>for(i=0;i&lt;cities;++i)      // loop
    scanf("%d",&amp;arr[i]);   // but there is no enclosing braces. so this is the only statement that loops
arr2[i]=0;              //&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; this is executed when loop is finished, i.e i==cities 
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, you assign <code>arr2[cities]</code>, which is out of bouds as it's indexed from <code>0</code> to <code>cities-1</code>.  This causes the segfault.  </p>

<p>Looking at the rest of the code, I guess you inteded to to:  </p>

<pre><code>...
for(i=0;i&lt;cities;++i) {    // loop, but for the block 
    scanf("%d",&amp;arr[i]);   
    arr2[i]=0; 
} 
...
</code></pre>
