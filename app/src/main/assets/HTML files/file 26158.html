<p>Not exactly a join, but, if both tables have the same number of rows and it is a one to one relationship then you can do the following:</p>

<p>Assuming you have the first table in Sheet1, the second one in Sheet2 and you want the results in Sheet3. </p>

<p>In Sheet3 Column A you can use:</p>

<pre><code>=QUERY(Sheet1!A1:C3,"Select A,B,C Order By A asc")
</code></pre>

<p>And in Column D:</p>

<pre><code>=QUERY(Sheet2!A1:C3,"Select B,C Order By A asc")
</code></pre>
