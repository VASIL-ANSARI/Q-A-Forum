<p>Using an AVL tree will never get you an <strong>O(n)</strong> complexity. If you do it right, which can be tricky, you will get <strong>O(n.log(n))</strong>, and if you miss, you may get a degenerate tree and a complexity of <strong>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</strong>.</p>

<p>For an <strong>O(n)</strong> complexity, they are expecting you to use a hash table.</p>
