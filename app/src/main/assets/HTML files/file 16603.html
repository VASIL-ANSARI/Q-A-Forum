<p>for PHP: phpicalendar (<a href="http://phpicalendar.net/" rel="nofollow">here</a>), the catch is that the algorithm is not easily isolated from the rest of the code
for JS there is a few attemps but I never checked if they really are compliant enough with rfc5545.</p>

<p>it all depends how much compliance you need: for instance adding timezone support will enable you to address the rare case of countries loosing one day (like Samoa island which skipped from Dec 29th to Dec 31st in 2011).</p>
