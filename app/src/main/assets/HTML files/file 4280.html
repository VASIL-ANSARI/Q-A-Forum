<p>As far as I can see, there is absolutely no way to do this from within the browser. Your mouse events will not fire in the area of the PDF plug-in, nor will you have any other kind of access there.</p>

<p>The only way this <em>might</em> be possible is using Javascript <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html" rel="nofollow">within the PDF</a>. But that would require you to prepare every PDF document that will be shown - if it's possible at all.</p>
