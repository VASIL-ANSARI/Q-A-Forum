<p>To make a sound play in a loop, you can use a Player:</p>

<pre><code># create a player and queue the song
player = pyglet.media.Player()
sound = pyglet.media.load('lines.mp3')
player.queue(sound) 

# keep playing for as long as the app is running (or you tell it to stop):
player.eos_action = pyglet.media.SourceGroup.loop

player.play()
</code></pre>

<p>To play more background sounds simultaneously, just start up another player for each of the sounds, with the same EOS_LOOP "eos_action" setting as above for each of them.</p>
