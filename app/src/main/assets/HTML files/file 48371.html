<p>Cron sets a minimal environment for the jobs (and I think it runs the job from the home directory).</p>

<p>Inside your python script, when you do something like -</p>

<pre><code>open('&lt;filename&gt;')
</code></pre>

<p>It checks for the <code>filename</code> in the current working directory , not the directory in which your scripts exist. </p>

<p>That is true even when running from commandline , if you change directory to some other directory (maybe your home directory) , and then use absolute path to your script to run it, you should be getting the same error.</p>

<p>Instead of depending on the current working directory to be correct and have the file you want to open, you can try either of the below options -</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use an absolute paths to the files you want to open , do not use relative path.</p></li>
<li><p>Or If the above is not an option for you, and the files you want to open are present relative to the script that is getting run (for example purpose lets say in the same directory) , then you can use <code>__file__</code> (this gives the script location) and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html" rel="nofollow"><code>os.path</code></a> , to create the absolute path to your file at runtime, Example -</p>

<pre><code>import os.path

fdir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)) #This would give the absolute path to the directory in which your script exists.
f = os.path.join(fdir,'&lt;yourfile')
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>At the end <code>f</code> would have the path to your file and you can use that to open your file.</p>
