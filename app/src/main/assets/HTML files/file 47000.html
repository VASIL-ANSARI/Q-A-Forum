<p>That's a really cool effect!</p>

<p>This is being achieved with some simple <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understanding-css3-transitions" rel="nofollow">CSS3 transitions</a>. You can see the classes being added to the wrappers around the input fields if you open your DOM explorer. The class is <code>.floating-label-form-group-with-value</code> and it has a corresponding rule that makes the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> field have an opacity, where normally it is invisible (opacity of 0).</p>

<p>If you are doing this to learn, I will not spoil all the fun by giving you the EXACT code, but here are the basics:</p>

<p>1) The form input fields have a label that is positioned <code>top:2em</code> and has <code>opacity:0</code> when the page loads</p>

<p>2) There is some kind of javascript that detects when the input changes and applies a class to the parent container, similar to this (I am using jQuery):</p>

<p><code>$('#contactForm input').change(function(){
   $(this).parent().addClass('has-value');
}</code></p>

<p>3)There is a style rule for the added class ( <code>div.has-value</code> in this example ) that changes both the <code>opacity</code> and the <code>top</code> position of the <code>label</code> element</p>

<p>4) A <code>transition</code> style rule with easing is added to the rule with the added class, that way the <code>label</code> will smoothly transition after the class gets added. So, the rules are something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#contactForm div label{
   display:block;
   position:relative;
   top:2em;
   opacity:0;
}
#contactForm div.has-value label{
   top:0;
   opacity:1;
   transition: top .3s ease, opacity .3s ease;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's the basics of it. Note, I did not include the vendor prefixes for CSS3 transitions in my example, but you will see if you inspect your original link's code that they covered all the bases with <code>-ms-transition</code> and <code>-moz-transition</code>.</p>

<p>Keep learning and good luck on your journey!</p>
