<p>Would be interesting to find what is causing this.</p>

<p>I've been trying to read the standard in search for an answer, please note I'm am novice in this. </p>

<p>However I believe I've found a relevant clause.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Â§14.6.2. A name used in a template
  declaration or definition and that is
  dependent on a template-parameter is
  assumed not to name a type <strong>unless the
  applicable name lookup finds a type
  name or the name is qualified by the
  keyword typename</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess this implies that the issue is in the difference of how name lookup works for base specifier lists and function arguments.</p>

<p>Base specifier name lookup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Â§10.2. During the lookup for a base
  class name, <strong>non-type names are ignored</strong>
  (3.3.10).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which explains why <strong>typename</strong> is not required for base specifiers.</p>

<p>Still looking for function argument name lookup.</p>

<p>Please correct me if this is an incorrect or irrelevant assumption. In the meantime I while keep digging. </p>

<p>The error given by VS2010 when not qualifying the template argument in the function declaration is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'T::type' : dependent name is not a
  type prefix with 'typename' to
  indicate a type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I'm still unclear about the rules for dependent function argument name lookup...</p>
