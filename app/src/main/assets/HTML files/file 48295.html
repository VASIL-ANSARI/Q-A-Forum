<p>You should have a <code>requirements.txt</code> with your webapp. Then do <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> when you deploy.</p>

<p>If you did not make such a file, you can create one later by running <code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code>. But beware that there might be some packages there that are not needed, if you installed other stuff on the side, so be prepared to manually screen the file.</p>

<p>If you work with multiple webapps you may also need to containerize your requirements (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell" rel="nofollow">here's why</a>). Two options: <a href="https://www.docker.com" rel="nofollow">Docker</a> or <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a>. If you don't know what Docker is and don't have some time on your hands I suggest you go with Virtualenv for now.</p>
