<p>If you construct new date, it will use time zone from the client. See here for more info how to construct date: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date</a></p>

<p>You can parse your date string manually and construct new Date object with year,month,day,hour,minute,second values. Or you can use Date.Parse(...) function if your date string is in correct format, see more here: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse" rel="nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse</a></p>

<p>If you want UTC date you need to construct it with new Date.UTC(...)</p>
