<p>We want to make the total complexity for all operations as minimum as possible. </p>

<p><strong>Total complexity = complexity(FIND) + complexity(UNION)</strong> </p>

<p>As you stated if we are given that a sequence of n - 1 unions take O(n^2) time in the worst case. And find takes O(1) on average.</p>

<p>So for n-1 union operations how many find can we afford without increasing total complexity greater than O(n^2). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The answer is O(n^2) find operations can be supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as long as the number of FIND is &lt;= <strong>O(n^2)</strong> and number of UNION is &lt;= <strong>O(n)</strong> . Complexity remains same. </p>

<p><strong>General rule:</strong> The heavier operation (more time consuming) should be used as less number of times as the weight of lighter operation and the lighter operation should be used as many number of times as the weight of heavier operation.   </p>

<p>I hope this is sufficient.</p>
