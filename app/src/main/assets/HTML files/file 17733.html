<p><code>:count</code> - the number of gc cycles, e.g. how many times did gc run</p>

<p><code>:heap_used</code> - the number of allocated heaps, ruby creates one heap by default and increase heap number if it's not enough to allocate all objects</p>

<p><code>:heap_length</code> - the size of the heap. That's the first heap size. Ideally you should have one heap after script start</p>

<p><code>:heap_increment</code> - the number that would be added to the last heap size if ruby creates new heap</p>

<p><code>:heap_live_num</code> - how many heap slots are allocated</p>

<p><code>:heap_free_num</code> - how many heap slots are free</p>

<p><code>:heap_final_num</code> - finalizers slots number</p>

<p>You are right that by increasing <code>RUBY_MIN_HEAP_SLOTS</code> the number of heaps should decrease down to one. But the higher <code>RUBY_FREE_MIN</code> the more heaps you'll get. It indicates the number of free slots that current heap should have, if that number is less than you provided - ruby creates new heap. 
<code>RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT</code> is more related to how often ruby would run GC process and does not affect heaps number directly. This counter indicates after how many mallocs ruby would run GC. But it can be runed even earlier. Please note that it's not ruby obj allocations, it's global ruby internal malloc counter that's incremented on any ruby interpreter internal obj allocation.</p>
