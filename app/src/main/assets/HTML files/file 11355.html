<p>The recommendation in Junit in Action 2e is actually not to create too many datasets (like one per test class), but just enough that is considered maintainable. Except for a few exceptional cases, I found it possible to use a master dataset for most unit tests, and individual datasets for integration tests. Limiting the usage of ExpectedDataSets is also an option.</p>

<p>Also, I used <a href="http://unitils.org/summary.html" rel="nofollow">Unitils</a> in combination with dbunit to simplify some of the setup and loading of test data, so you might want to consider it where appropriate.</p>
