<p>Make the dWordMap just <code>HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;</code>. For the line you're not sure of, do <code>dWordMap.put(createKey(word), word)</code>.</p>

<p>Then loop through the scrableList and the word is <code>dWordMap.get(createKey(scrambledWord))</code>.</p>

<p>You should probably also handle the case that the scrambled word is not in the original word list.</p>

<p>The key concept to understand about a HashMap is that it makes it O(1) to test if the map contains a given key, and O(1) to retrieve the value associated with a given key. This means these operations take constant time--whether the map has 5 elements or 5000, it will take the same time to determine if the map contains <code>"ehllo"</code>. If you want to check these two lists (dictionary and scrambled), you need a key that will be the same for both. As you have started to do in your solution, sorting the letters in the word is a good choice. So your HashMap will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "ehllo": "hello",
  "dlorw": "world"
}
</code></pre>

<p>One pass through the dictionary list builds that map, then another pass through it takes the scrambled word, sorts the letters in it, then checks the map to find the unscrambled word.</p>
