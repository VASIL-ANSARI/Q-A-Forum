<p>NHibernate is useful is you need to map data from a database table into a .NET class.  Even if you're only doing select queries, it still might be useful if you need to pass the data objects to a client tier (web page, desktop app, etc.) for display.  Working with plain objects can be easier than working with a DataSet or other ADO.NET data class in a presentation layer.</p>

<p>NHibernate does have the ability to parse/pre-compile queries if you put them in the mapping file.</p>
