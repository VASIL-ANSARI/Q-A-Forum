<p>I would recommend creating multiple instances of the <code>Stopwatch</code> and only reading from it on the same thread.</p>

<p>I don't know what your asynchronous code looks like but in psuedo code I would do either:</p>

<pre><code>Stopwatch watch = Stopwatch.Startnew();
DoAsyncWork((err, result) =&gt;
{
  Console.WriteLine("Time Elapsed:" + (watch.ElapsedMilliseconds / 1000.0));
  // process results...
});
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>public DoAsyncWork(callback) // called asynchronously
{
  Stopwatch watch = Stopwatch.Startnew();
  // do work
  var time = watch.ElapsedMilliseconds / 1000.0;
  callback(null, new { time: time });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first example assumes that <code>DoAsyncWork</code> work does the work in a different thread then calls the callback when completed, marshalling back to the callers thread.</p>

<p>The second example assumes the caller is handling the threading and this function does all of the timing itself, passing the result back to the caller.</p>
