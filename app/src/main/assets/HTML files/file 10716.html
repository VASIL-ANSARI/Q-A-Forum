<p>You're almost there, but as well as <code>%include &lt;std_vector.i&gt;</code> you'll also need something like:</p>

<pre><code>%template (MyVector) std::vector&lt;MyOtherClass&gt;;
</code></pre>



<p>This instructs SWIG to expose vectors of <code>MyOtherClass</code> to the target language as a type called <code>MyVector</code>. Without doing this SWIG doesn't know which types you want to instantiate <code>std::vector</code> for, so it's reduced to the default wrapping.</p>

<p>Side note:</p>

<p>Is there a reason you've got the <code>const</code> in <code>const std::vector&lt;MyOtherClass&gt; getList();</code> when it's not a reference? I'd either make it a reference and make the method <code>const</code> also (<code>const std::vector&lt;MyOtherClass&gt;&amp; getList() const;</code>) or drop the <code>const</code> entirely since it does nothing there.</p>
