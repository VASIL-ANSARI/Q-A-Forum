<p>Your graph can have up to 9 verticies:</p>

<pre><code>Graph *G = new Graph(9);
</code></pre>

<p>I assume that this means that any particular vertex can have a value from 0 to 8 since the code seems to use the vertex as an index into various vectors.</p>

<p>However, when you create the <code>previousVertex</code> vector in <code>Dijkstra::Dijkstra(Graph *G, int s)</code>, you give it one less element than the number of vertices for some reason:</p>

<pre><code>previousVertex = vector&lt;int&gt;(V - 1); // V is the number of vertices in G
                                     //   which is 9 in your example project
                                     //   so it will have 8 elements and
                                     //   can be indexed with 0-7
</code></pre>

<p>But you index it with various elements vertex value later:</p>

<pre><code>previousVertex[v] = u; // I believe that `v` can have the value 8 at times
</code></pre>

<p>I think you may be going past the end of the <code>previousVertex</code> vector.  I don't know why you're having trouble catching this in a debugger if it crashes 50% of the time.</p>
