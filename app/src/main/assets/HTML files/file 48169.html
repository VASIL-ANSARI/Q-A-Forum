<p>The reason why you can't access your label control is because it's inside of a repeater. Therefore in order to access them you can use <code>FindControl()</code></p>

<pre><code>var myLabel = (Label)FindControl("YouLabelId");
//Do Some Work
</code></pre>

<p>This will apply for the rest of your controls within the <code>&lt;asp:Repeater /&gt;</code></p>
