<p>The default implementation of the <code>ArrayAdapter</code> is to automatically call <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> when an item has been <code>add()</code>, <code>remove()</code>, <code>insert()</code>, <code>clear()</code>, etc. In your case you're adding an item to the list which is used by the adapter, so the adapter is notified automatically.</p>

<p>You can change this behaviour by calling <code>adapter.setNotifyOnChange(false)</code>. Just keep in mind that <code>notifyDataSetChanged()</code> overrides the <code>notifyOnChange</code> back to true, so if the former method is called you'll have to set <code>notifyOnChange</code> again.</p>
