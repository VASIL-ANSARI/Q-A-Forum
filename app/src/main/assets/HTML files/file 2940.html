<p>I can't help myself, I still wonder - isn't that innerfade tad overkill? (I noticed you use it only for the landing page, don't you?)</p>

<p>I did the very same with like 20 lines of jQuery code (and it's a bit configurable :) ) - if you're interested, I could post it :)</p>

<p>Also, the animation still feels a bit choppy in Google chrome.</p>
