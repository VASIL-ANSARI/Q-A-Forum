<p>That happens because the properties in an object doesn't have any specific order. The order that you get the propeties is depending on the implementation, i.e. how the properties are stored internally in the object.</p>

<p>The browsers that return the properties in a different order than you expect aren't doing anything wrong, the actual error is to expect any specific order.</p>

<p>If you want the properties in a specific order, you need to sort them. You can put them in an array, sort the array, and loop through the array.</p>
