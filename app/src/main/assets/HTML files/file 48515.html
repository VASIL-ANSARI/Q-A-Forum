<p>In order to save power, the Apple watch limits the update frequency for location services (a major power hog). When you open the iPhone application, you prioritize the task you're running, and the Apple watch will update its location more often.</p>

<p>You can try to force the application to update faster by sending a "wake up" ping: send an empty/dummy call to the application and reply with a dummy reply. This should wake up the connection for a while, and your second call might be processed faster, although I am unsure of whether this "wake up" ping will prioritize location services.</p>

<p>Last thing, IMHO 10 seconds isn't really an "absurd" amount of time.</p>
