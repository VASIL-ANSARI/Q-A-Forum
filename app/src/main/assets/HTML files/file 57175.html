<p><code>reshape</code> is not an 'append' function. It reshapes the array you give it to the dimensions you want. </p>

<p><code>np.array([]).reshape(0,4)</code> works because you reshape a zero element array to a 0x4(=0 elements) array.<br>
<code>np.reshape([]).reshape(2,3)</code> doesn't work because you're trying to reshape a zero element array to a 2x3(=6 elements) array.  </p>

<p>To create an empty array use <code>np.zeros((2,3))</code> instead.  </p>

<p>And in case you're wondering, numpy arrays can't be appended to. You'll have to work around by casting it as a <code>list</code>, appending what you want and the converting back to a numpy array. Preferably, you only create a numpy array when you don't mean to append data later.</p>
