<p>Your question is a bit confusing and hard to understand, because you're using strange terminology. These sentences are correct and mean something:</p>

<ul>
<li>a class extends another class</li>
<li>a class implements an interface</li>
<li>a class inherits methods from its parent class</li>
</ul>

<p>These sentences are inappropriate, unclear:</p>

<ul>
<li>a class inherits another class</li>
<li>violate generalization concept</li>
</ul>

<p>Especially without code, I can only guess what you're asking, but I try to answer anyway:</p>

<ul>
<li>a class that extends JFrame and at the same time implements an action listener interface, violates the single responsibility principle by being 2 things at once</li>
<li>a class that extends JFrame and at the same time contains some logic not related to displaying or configuring a JFrame, violates the single responsibility principle by doing 2 things at the same time. It also violates good separation of model-view-controller</li>
<li>a class that extends JFrame, but in terms of its behavior / implementation it's not mainly a JFrame but something else, then it violates the abstraction of a JFrame, and it shouldn't extend JFrame but possibly contain it instead</li>
</ul>
