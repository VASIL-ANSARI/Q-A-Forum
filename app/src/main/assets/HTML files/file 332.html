<p>From what I understand, prepared statements will reuse the generated SQL plan if it is the same statement, so the database will see the same prepared statement and not have to do the work to figure out how to query the database. I would say the extra work of saving the prepared statement in <code>Product::getPrice_A</code> is not typically very helpful, more because it can obscure the code rather than an issue of performance.  When dealing with performance, I feel it's always best to focus on code clarity and then performance when you have real statistics that indicate a problem.</p>

<p>I would say "yes, the extra work is unnecessary" (regardless of if it really boosts performance).  Also, I am not a very big DB expert, but the performance gain of prepared statements is something I heard from others, and it is at the database level, not the code level (so if the code is actually invoking a parameterized statement on the actual DB, then the DB can do these execution plan caching... though depending on the database, you may get the benefit even without the parameterized statement).</p>

<p>Anyways, if you are really worried about (and seeing) database performance issues, you should look into a caching solution... of which I would highly recommend <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/" rel="nofollow">memcached</a>.  With such a solution, you can cache your query results and not even hit the database for things you access frequently.</p>
