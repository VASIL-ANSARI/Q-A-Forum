<p>First of all you can summarize this in 1 query (it's not in 2 database, but in 2 tables it seems from your code)</p>

<pre><code>   SELECT b.*, s.type2 AS store_items_type2
     FROM backgrounds AS b
LEFT JOIN store_items AS s ON (s.type2 = b.id AND s.userid='$id2')
    WHERE b.type=2
</code></pre>

<p>How come <code>$id2 = $_SESSION['id'];</code>? A session ID is not the same as a user ID..</p>

<p>You should try to put a little more effort in constructing your question and the code, to make it more understandable for us.</p>
