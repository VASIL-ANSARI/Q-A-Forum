<p>Use <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/timeout/rdoc/Timeout.html" rel="nofollow">Timeout</a>.</p>

<pre><code>best_result = 0
begin
  timeout(5) do
    while true
      new_result = rand
      best_result = new_result if new_result &gt; best_result
    end
  end
rescue Timeout::Error
  puts "That's enough. Result is #{best_result}"
end
</code></pre>

<p>This effectively does the same thing you are doing (execute in another thread, thread gets dead after 5 seconds), but abstracts the timeout handling from your code. And it's in standard library.</p>
