<p>You are allowed to define a variable in the condition of an <code>if</code> statement but you can't define it in an expression. You need to write it like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (PredefinedAtom* pa = pst[i]-&gt;findAtomByLexCode(i)) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The value of <code>pa</code> is converted to <code>bool</code> to determine which branch is taken.</p>
