<p>This should work for XAML as well, at least if I understand your question correctly.</p>

<p>You can change the settings for how the code is aligned when you go to Tools -> Text Editor -> XAML and you'll see a couple of formatting and spacing options to finetune your code appearance.</p>

<p>Pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd> (or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>E</kbd>) and then <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>D</kbd> will automatically adjust your code. (If you want to look up the combination to format the document go to Tools -> Customize -> Keyboard and look for "Edit.FormatDocument".)</p>
