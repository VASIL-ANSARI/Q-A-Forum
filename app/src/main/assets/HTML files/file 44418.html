<p>You can do a redirect instead of a forward:</p>

<pre><code>response.sendRedirect("data.jsp");
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to use an absolute path, keep in mind that with this method a path starting with <code>/</code> is relative to the server root, not the webapp root, so you need to prepend the context path, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/data.jsp");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: If you want to keep the same URL before and after you submit the form without losing the submitted values, it would be easier to do it the other way around and always call your servlet first in the URL, and then forward to the JSP.</p>

<p>To determine whether you are in "submit" mode or just in "display" mode (blank form), you can check the presence of the submit button as a parameter, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>if (request.getParameter("mySaveButton") != null) {
    // Process the submitted form values
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually the basis of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" rel="nofollow">model-view-controller pattern</a>, where the servlet acts as the controller and the JSP acts as the view. The controller is always called first and forwards the request to the appropriate view or JSP.</p>
