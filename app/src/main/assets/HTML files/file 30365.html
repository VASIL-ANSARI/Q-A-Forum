<p>I assume now you are checking model state errors like...</p>

<pre><code>if (ModelState.Valid)
{... valid and do something...}
</code></pre>

<p>If so, you can include some additional checking before hand that will be considered in your conditional.  For instance, if it is a delete submit, you can check that before hand.</p>

<pre><code>bool isDelete = ***check some value***

if (isDelete || ModelState.Valid)
{... valid and do something...}
</code></pre>

<p>This way even if the model state is invalid, it will still move forward.</p>

<p>One thing to consider is you will need to set something in the model to tell you what action is happening.  This probably means using javascript to capture the submit, set a model field, and then perform the submit.</p>
