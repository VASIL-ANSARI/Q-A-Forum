<p>It's hard to see what's going wrong without seeing more of your code, but I'll wager exactly the same thing is happening as in the other question: you need to wrap your tree model in a <code>Gtk.TreeModelSort</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sorted_model = Gtk.TreeModelSort(model=liststore)
sorted_model.set_sort_column_id(1, Gtk.SortType.ASCENDING)
treeview = Gtk.TreeView(model=sorted_model)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>1</code> is the index into your model's columns in this case, not the visible treeview columns.</p>
