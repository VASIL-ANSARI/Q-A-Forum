<p>I've had this problem before. If my memory serves be correctly, the problem occurred on Firefox and maybe IE, but not other browsers. </p>

<p>It depends how your popups work. When you close a popup, does the HTML markup for the popup get removed from the DOM entirely? Check the Elements tab in your console.</p>

<p>Some modal popup systems just hide the popup, but it still exists in the document. Some browsers cannot tell that the video is no longer visible to the user, and so the video keeps playing.</p>

<p>So, to get around the problem, you must make sure that when a popup is "closed" that it is actually completely destroyed and removed from the document entirely, not just hidden.</p>
