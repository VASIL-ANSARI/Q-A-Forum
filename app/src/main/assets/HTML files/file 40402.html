<p>If you want create a <code>THREE.BoxHelper</code> for an object that has children, you can use this pattern:</p>

<pre><code>// bounding box helper
var bbHelper = new THREE.BoundingBoxHelper( myObject, 0xffffff );
bbHelper.visible = false;
scene.add( bbHelper );

// box helper - doesn't have diagonals  
var boxHelper = new THREE.BoxHelper( bbHelper );
scene.add( boxHelper );
</code></pre>

<p>In your render loop, you may have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>bbHelper.update();
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest you study the code to understand why this works. You may have to modify it slightly to accommodate your situation.</p>
