<p>You were actually trying to create two edges - one in <code>with self.canvas:</code> in your <code>GraphEdge</code> class (where you did not specified color) and second in your *.kv file (where you did not specified points). So you can remove whole <code>&lt;GraphEdge&gt;</code> in your *.kv file and then expand <code>with self.canvas:</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>with self.canvas:
    Color(self.r, 1, 1, 1)
    self.line = Line(points=[100, 200, 200, 200], width = 2.0, close = True)
</code></pre>
