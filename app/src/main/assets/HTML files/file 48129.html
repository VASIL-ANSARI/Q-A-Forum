<p>Most likely your reverse function is returning an integer, but you cannot have an integer that prints as <code>00863</code>, instead you can have a string that does that.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; num = 36800
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(num)[::-1]
'00863'
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(str(num)[::-1])
863
</code></pre>
