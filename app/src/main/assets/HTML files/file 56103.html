<p>Thank you, jonrsharpe. Py.test does no magic, I need to make my packages importable myself. There is one of possible solutions:</p>

<pre><code>   $ export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}: [Path to folder with my module]"   
</code></pre>

<p>( PYTHONPATH is one of path sources for sys.path )<br>
If I need to make this change permanently, I need to add this string to <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>
