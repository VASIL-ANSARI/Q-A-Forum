<p>A few options come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It may not be a bad thing to show a text entry box. This makes it clear to the user that having clicked on the bitmap they have entered a new "mode" and are now able to enter text. This is consistent with editing item names in a treeview, or editing a filename in a Windows file explorer, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>TextBox supports BorderStyle.None, but doesn't allow a transparent background (presumably because it would have to preserve the background during editing operations). It's easy to give this a try to see if it works well enough for your needs.</p></li>
<li><p>It would be very easy to write precisely the behaviour you want into your display - i.e. dispense with 3rd party controls entirely. You just have to render the text, and during editing add in the caret display (i.e. draw a simple line at the insertion position), and handle keypresses to add or remove text at the caret position. You just have to separate the rendering of the text and the background so that you can re-render it as the text is changed.</p></li>
</ul>
