<p>I assume what you're asking is if you can target the dropdown bit of a <code>select</code> using some selector and apply styling to it like the popover in the question you linked.</p>

<p>The answer is <strong>sorta</strong>.</p>

<p>The <code>select</code> HTML5 element is an example of a <a href="http://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/" rel="nofollow">Shadow DOM widget</a> in action.</p>

<p>In short, the drop down that you're seeing is neither the <code>select</code> nor the <code>option</code> elements. It's a hidden element that can only be targeted using the Shadow DOM API.</p>

<p>As of now, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-shadow-dom-20130514/" rel="nofollow">shadow DOM spec</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium#Working_Draft_.28WD.29" rel="nofollow">working draft</a> that <a href="http://caniuse.com/shadowdom" rel="nofollow">most browsers haven't implemented</a> at all. <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2013/01/content-security-policy-and-shadow-dom.html" rel="nofollow">Chrome is the only browser</a> (<em>as of May 2013</em>) that offers any substantial amount of Shadow DOM support.</p>

<p>Because of this, cross-browser pure CSS answers to your question involve 'hacks,' of sorts, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895476/how-to-style-a-select-dropdown-with-css-only-without-javascript">like the answers to this StackOverflow question</a>.</p>

<p>If you're against things like this &ndash; perhaps for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML" rel="nofollow">semantic reasons</a> &ndash; then you should consider Javascript solutions. This Javascript solution might involve making your own HTML widget that behaves like a select, but is comprised of regular DOM elements, which you <em>could</em> control the style of. There are a number of feature-rich Javascript selects already in existence that you might want to try. <a href="http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/" rel="nofollow">As an example, check out Chosen, one of my personal favorites.</a></p>

<p>If you want to prepare for the future, I suggest you check out the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/" rel="nofollow">Shadow DOM tutorials</a> over at HTML5 Rocks. They're a good read.</p>
