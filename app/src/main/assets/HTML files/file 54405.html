<p>The cause is this line:</p>

<pre><code>Queue&lt;Node&gt; Q = new LinkedList();
</code></pre>

<p>if you change it to </p>

<pre><code>Queue&lt;Node&gt; Q = new LinkedList&lt;Node&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>the warning disapers.</p>

<p>In the first case you have a list of <code>Object</code>,<br>
in the second a list of <code>Node</code>.</p>

<p>This is mostly relevant at compile time. Later during execution all Collections are of type Object. If you feed in objects of other types into the list, you would get at runtime an ClassCastException. (In cases the compiler cannot detect that you add objects of wrong type)</p>

<p>Since java 1.7 it's possible to just write</p>

<pre><code>Queue&lt;Node&gt; Q = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler is now clever enough to know that you mean <code>Node</code>.</p>
