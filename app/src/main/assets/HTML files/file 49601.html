<p>The error happened in one of your lines where you force unwrap last property on staffs object:</p>

<pre><code>self.staffs?.last!
</code></pre>

<p>By using ! you say I'm sure there is a data in my optional but unfortunately you are wrong and that's why the app is crushing.</p>

<p>You can change it to:</p>

<pre><code>self.staffs?.last?...
</code></pre>

<p>that's a safety way or do it like that:</p>

<pre><code>if let last = self.staffs?.last {
    last.DepartmentName = ...
}
</code></pre>
