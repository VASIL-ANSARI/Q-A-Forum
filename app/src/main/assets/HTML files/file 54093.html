<p>You can do some annotation clustering and display one annotation for both coordinates. If you really want to see them both and do not need to be exact shift them a bit like done in here </p>

<p>But if you do care about precision detect the distance between two annotations. You want the distance on the screen not on the map. If the distance is over some treshold, you can present with two rotated annotations one reaching to the left and one to the right side. More can be studied from stuff written on topic of annotation clustering. Search on stack there is a ton of it.</p>
