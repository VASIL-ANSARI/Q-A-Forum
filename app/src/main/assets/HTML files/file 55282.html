<p>Actually, I don't see too much sense for dependency management on a "class level". Typically you would bundle your classes in a jar file, which in turn can be considered as a unit with a particular functional range. Such a jar is suitable to be put in a dependency management.</p>

<p>If you are new to such tools, I'd recommend Maven. It is widely used in the Java world and well-integrated in common IDEs. If you stick to its conventions, it will take care of your whole build process from compiling, testing to packaging. There are a lot of plugins available that let you customize practically everything in a simple XML based configuration. You'll have your first project running in 30min and your current project migrated in another 30min. </p>

<p>To share your code with others, you still need a repository where you can upload your Maven-built artifacts to. Depending on your preference there are many possibilities. Shove it to Amazon S3, Maven Central or install your own <code>Sonatype Nexus</code> in your private network. </p>
