<p>If you want to submit your form using POST method, form data in the controller should be accessible via <em>$this->request->data</em> property. So if your field's id is spotId, you should be able to access it in the controller via:</p>

<pre><code>$spotId = $this-&gt;request-&gt;data['spotId']; 
</code></pre>

<p>You can also check what data is submitted in your form by typing:</p>

<pre><code>debug($this-&gt;request-&gt;data);
</code></pre>
