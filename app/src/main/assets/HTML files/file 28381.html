<p>Creating a new family instance will place a new instance of an element with its default parameters.</p>

<p>Using ElementTransformUtils.CopyElement will make a copy of an existing element, taking into account any parameters that have changed from their default settings.</p>

<p>When creating a new family instance, there is an overload of NewFamilyInstance that allows you to specify which face it should be mounted on (in your case, a ceiling).</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what the behaviour of ElementTransformUtils.CopyElement is, but it should be the same as copying and pasting it yourself, using the UI.</p>
