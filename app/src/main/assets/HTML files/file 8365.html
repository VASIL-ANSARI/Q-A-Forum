<p>The auto-generation of the R.java file is purely there as a mechanism to allow you to easily reference the contents of your <code>res</code> hierarchy from your code. As such, you cannot create sub-hierarchies.</p>

<p>The simple solution is to add context to your item names instead. For example, use <code>@+id/Activity1_button1</code>, and you can access this as <code>R.id.Activity1_button1</code>.</p>
