<p>It's not possible to change the name of the data table based on some information in the runtime (this feature exists in the Android SDK, so you can consider <a href="http://feedback.azure.com/forums/216254-mobile-services" rel="nofollow">creating a feature request</a> to have it added to the managed SDK as well).</p>

<p>What you can do, however, is to use a message handler which can "tweak" the request URI for table-related operations, so that you can achieve this programmatically. Basically, your portable library would expose, in addition to the data type you want shared across multiple applications, a class extending from <code>DelegatingHandler</code> which does that. Below is an example of such handler.</p>

<pre><code>public class AppSpecificTableNamesHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    public const string TablePrefix = "MyType";
    private const string TablesPathPrefix = "/tables/";

    private string tableSuffix;
    public AppSpecificTableNamesHandler(string tableSuffix)
    {
        this.tableSuffix = tableSuffix;
    }

    protected override Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        UriBuilder uriBuilder = new UriBuilder(request.RequestUri);
        string path = uriBuilder.Path;
        if (path.StartsWith(TablesPathPrefix + TablePrefix))
        {
            path = TablesPathPrefix + TablePrefix +
                this.tableSuffix + path.Substring(TablesPathPrefix.Length + TablePrefix.Length);
            uriBuilder.Path = path;
            request.RequestUri = uriBuilder.Uri;
        }

        return base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can find the full code for the solution I used to test that (at least the most important classes) at <a href="https://gist.github.com/carlosfigueira/9582c08851d116f5a426" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/carlosfigueira/9582c08851d116f5a426</a>.</p>
