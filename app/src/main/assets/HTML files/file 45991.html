<p>The Delphi code is freeing a <code>TIdAntiFreeze</code> component that has been placed on the Form at design-time.  If you don't want the component, don't put it on the Form in the first place.</p>

<p>That being said, the C++ equivalent of the Delphi code would be:</p>

<pre><code>if (AntiFreeze) FreeAndNil(AntiFreeze);

// or sometimes: AntiFreeze = new TIdAntiFreeze(NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>That being said, you really should strive to not use <code>TIdAntiFreeze</code> at all.  You should not be doing <em>anything</em> in the context of the main UI thread that blocks the main message loop for more than a few seconds at most.  Most Indy operations are better suited for use in worker threads instead of the main UI thread.  <code>TIdAntiFreeze</code> only works in the main UI thread, by pumping the main message loop while Indy operations are blocking the main thread.</p>
