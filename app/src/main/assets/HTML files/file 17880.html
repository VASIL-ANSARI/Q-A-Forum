<p>When you App is in background mode you can not establish a HTTP connection the usual way. You have to setup a background task that sends the location updates to your server.</p>

<p>I found a short <a href="http://www.mindsizzlers.com/2011/07/ios-background-location/">tutorial</a> that covers exactly what you're looking for (I've not tested the code).</p>

<p><strong>This is a summary of how it works</strong><br>
When your App is running in background and a location change occurs, iOS wakes up your App and calls the delegate method <code>locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation</code> of your CLLocationManager. When this happens, check if your App is running in the background and setup the background task if it is. The background task then should send the data to your server.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/ManagingYourApplicationsFlow/ManagingYourApplicationsFlow.html">documentation</a> is not clear about how much time such a background task may take to finish, but I slightly remember it was something around 10 minutes maximum.</p></li>
<li><p>As far as I know you can not update the UI while your App runs in the
background</p></li>
</ul>
