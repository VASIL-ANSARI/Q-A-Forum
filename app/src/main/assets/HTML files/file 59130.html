<p>I hope you have installed Mongodb driver for PHP and you are not receiving any exception while executing your code.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>After the db connection is established you need to save something in collection so that the db comes to existence.  This is missing in your code.</strong><br><br></p>

<p>Try below code<br><br></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
   // connect to mongodb
   $m = new MongoClient();

   echo "Connection to database successfully";
   // select a database
   $db = $m-&gt;admin;
   echo "Database admin selected";

   $collection = $db-&gt;createCollection("mycol");
   echo "Collection created succsessfully";
?&gt;
</code></pre>
