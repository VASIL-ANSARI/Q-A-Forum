<p>I'm not 100% sure why this worked, but I moved all of my script declarations to the bottom of my Index.cshtml file (they were previously declared at the top, but outside of the  tag.</p>

<p>Putting them at the bottom, outside my main container s, in the the same order they were in in the original post fixed the problem and now everything is binding alright. Thanks, all!</p>
