<p>I c++, if you want to use a (static in this example) library, you have to link against it. In normal english, you have to tell your compiler where it can find the implementations of the library's functions. I don't know how to do that in your editor, but usually there is something called linker settings, where you can link all the libraries you need for your project. For more info <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_%28computing%29" rel="nofollow">see this wiki page</a></p>
