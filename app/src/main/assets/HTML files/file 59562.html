<p>It doesn't matter how you input file name. </p>

<p>It can go like this: <strong>String fileName = new String("myFileName");</strong></p>

<p>or the way you have: </p>

<p><strong>Scanner sc = new scanner (system.in);</strong></p>

<p><strong>filename = sc.nextline();</strong></p>

<p>Then after you set the fileName, pass it to readFileExample:</p>

<p><strong>readFileExample(filename);// Whatever you get the name from, pass it.</strong></p>

<p>And processLine function, just like it's name, which is for parse each line. If you want to use this program to implement some sort of file analysis. Just use your structure above. but you have to modify the processLine function.</p>
