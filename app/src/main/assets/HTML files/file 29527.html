<p>Assuming <code>$to</code> would be the recipient email address:</p>

<pre><code>if(isset($_POST['submit'])) {
 switch($_POST['city']) {
  case 'gampaha': $to = 'to1@gmail.com'; break;
  case 'colombo': $to = 'to2@hotmail.com'; break;
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next time, please show the code you've already tried. Rather than relying on others to do the work for you, try something yourself. If it doesn't work, try again. If that doesn't work, post your code and ask where it's going wrong.</p>
