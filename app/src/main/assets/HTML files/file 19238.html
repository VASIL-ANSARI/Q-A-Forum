<p>It's both. The AMD64 directory contains a compiler that runs on and targets AMD64. The IA64 directory likewise (runs on/targets IA64). The x86_XXX directories contain compilers that run on x86 and target the other architecture (AMD64 or IA64 respectively). At least if memory serves, the 1033 directory should contain the 32-bit compiler (i.e., runs on and targets x86).</p>
