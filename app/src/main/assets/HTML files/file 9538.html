<p>ThinkStock's terms of service prohibit what you appear to be trying to do.  Even if you have rights to the images since you've paid to download them etc, they do not allow site access via automation.  I think you need to contact them for permission, and then ask if there is an alternative login page you can use. Given the nature of what you want to do, they may relent (since you're not trying to rip off the site, just make it easier to access the content you have licensed)</p>
