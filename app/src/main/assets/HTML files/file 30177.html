<p>What I would suggest is, you first create an order id for each transaction and store it in your database, and send the ID in the request form to monsterpay as a hidden baggage field.
Example - </p>

<pre><code>&lt;INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="Option1name" VALUE="myUniqueTransactionID"&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="Option1value" VALUE="12131"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These values will be passed back to your script upon the completion of the payment. You can cross check if the payment was successful by reading the response and mark the order ID as paid.</p>
