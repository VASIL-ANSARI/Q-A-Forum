<p>So I found this solution: Instead of mocking the accessor, I can pass a block into the stub on the method that has the side effect, to DO that side effect:</p>

<pre><code>controller.stub!(:set_up_foo) { controller.set_instance_variable(:@foo, @mock_foo_object) }
</code></pre>

<p>This has the effect of making sure the one side effect I care about actually happens. I tried this and it worked like a charm. </p>
