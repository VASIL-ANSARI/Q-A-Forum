<p>I haven't fully solved the problem yet, but a very useful message to intercept on form level is <code>CM_DIALOGKEY</code> (Borland Vcl only). It gets sent for every key that is normally used for navigating within the UI. That is, cursor keys, tab and shift-tab, Enter and possibly others.</p>

<p>I've added an event handler for <code>CM_DIALOGKEY</code> that returns the focus to the graphics area and also forwards the key press to that component. This way the user can still control the UI elements via keyboard (important for text entry), but cursor keys are handled by the graphics area.</p>
