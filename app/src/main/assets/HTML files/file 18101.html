<p>I have a partial answer, you need to modify your validation configuration object</p>

<pre><code>ko.validation.configure({
    decorateElement        : true,
    errorElementClass      : 'error',
    insertMessages         : true,  // had been set to false.
    parseInputAttributes   : true
});
</code></pre>

<p>That will cause the messages to occur.</p>

<p>I'm not very familiar with the the knockout validation plug in, but once it has an error, the count doesn't go below 1 for some reason.  Not sure why that is happening.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The count of error messages being off by 1 is a bug.  The first error message in the message list is "<em>null</em>".  It is discussed in issues log at <a href="https://github.com/ericmbarnard/Knockout-Validation/issues/99" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ericmbarnard/Knockout-Validation/issues/99</a></p>
