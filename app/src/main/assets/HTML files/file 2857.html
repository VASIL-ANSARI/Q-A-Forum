<p>If you only need to know the top three values, you don't need to sort the whole list - you can just perform one pass, storing the top three values at any one time. That will make it O(n) rather than O(n log n)... but you'll have to implement it yourself.</p>

<p>If you're happy with O(n log n) though, the simplest way would probably be to use LINQ:</p>

<pre><code>var ordered = pairs.OrderBy(pair =&gt; pair.Value).Take(3).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>It probably wouldn't be too hard to implement something like:</p>

<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; TakeTop&lt;TSource, TKey&gt;
    (this IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; source,
     Func&lt;TSource, TKey&gt; keySelector,
     int count)
</code></pre>

<p>which could have a complexity of O(n * count). If I had a bit more time I'd do it for fun...</p>
