<p>It looks like you should use 4 regular expressions</p>

<pre><code>/^47\d{3}/

/^5\d{4}/

/^6\d{4}/

/^55\d{3}/
</code></pre>

<p>notice how numbers that begin with <code>55</code> are a match for both of your cases, but the reverse doesn't work for numbers that begin with <code>5</code> you should use that fact to distinguish between them</p>

<hr>

<p>if you want to combine regular expressions, than that's fine</p>

<pre><code>/(^47\d{3})|(^5\d{4})/
</code></pre>

<p>note: you might also want to use the end of input anchor: <code>$</code> or a word boundary or negative look-ahead to match the end of output too.</p>
