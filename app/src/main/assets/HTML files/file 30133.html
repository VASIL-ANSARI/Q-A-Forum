<p>So lets break this down:</p>

<p>The artists you want to ignore are returned by the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT artist_id 
FROM   tags 
WHERE  main_tag IS NOT NULL 
</code></pre>

<p>So the ones you DO want are the ones where the artist_id is not in the above list:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT artist_id, 
       tag_id 
FROM   tags 
WHERE  artist_id NOT IN (SELECT artist_id 
                         FROM   tags 
                         WHERE  main_tag IS NOT NULL); 
</code></pre>

<p>If you want just the artist_id, and you want each artist to appear only once, then you can remove the reference to tag_id, and group them by artist:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT artist_id 
FROM   tags 
WHERE  artist_id NOT IN (SELECT artist_id 
                         FROM   tags 
                         WHERE  main_tag IS NOT NULL) 
GROUP  BY artist_id; 
</code></pre>

<p>Hint: if you want to post something database-ish, you can build your tables in sqlfiddle, then post the link, which gives people a starting point. I did this, the link is <a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/db53d/2" rel="nofollow">http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/db53d/2</a></p>
