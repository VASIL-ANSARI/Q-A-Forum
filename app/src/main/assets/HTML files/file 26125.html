<p>the message is pretty clear </p>

<pre><code>Warning: imagejpeg(): Unable to open ' /home/sites/public_html/images/2013-24-1-240x300.jpg'
 for writing: No such file or directory in 
/home/sites/public_html/includes/functions/html_output.php on line 352
</code></pre>

<p>if the directory exists chmod it so the apache user can write to it. </p>

<p>if the directory doesnt exist create it and then chmod it (644 should be enough)</p>

<p>if the file exists already - it can not over write it, So chmod the file (its likely you used SCP to transfer it and its under the user you SCP'ed as) <code>ls -l</code> to confirm the permissions</p>
