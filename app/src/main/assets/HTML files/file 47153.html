<p>The ResourceLoader class provides simplified access to app resources such as app UI strings.</p>

<p>When you dragging a file to the resource file, the data was stored as a file reference rather than the content, thatâs why you will get result âlevel1.xml;System.String...â.
As a recommend way, I suggest you putting the file name as the key and the file content as the value in the *resw file so that you can use the ResourceLoader to get the content easily.</p>
