<p>It's not the <em>type</em> which is idempotent - that doesn't even make much sense; you <em>may</em> mean immutable, but that's not clear. It's the <code>GetEnumerator</code> method itself which is typically idempotent.</p>

<p>While I'd say that's <em>typically</em> the case, I can envisage special cases where it makes sense to have a non-idempotent <code>GetEnumerator</code> method. For example, it could be that you've got data which can only be read once  (because it's streaming from a web server which won't service the same request again, or something like that). In that case, <code>GetEnumerator</code> would have to effectively invalidate the data source, so that future calls would throw an exception.</p>

<p>Such types and methods should be documented very carefully, of course, but I think they're reasonable.</p>
