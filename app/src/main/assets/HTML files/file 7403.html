<p>Last time that this happened to me, I had updated all my gems.  I did a <code>gem uninstall rake</code> and it listed version options. I picked the newer one, and then I did not have to use <code>bundle exec</code> anymore.</p>

<p>Basically, if you use <code>bundle exec</code> it uses whatever gem version is in installed by your bundle, so what is in the Gemfile.  Without <code>bundle exec</code> it uses whatever version is your system default.</p>
