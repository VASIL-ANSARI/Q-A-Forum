<p>Instead of a default, you can create a "BEFORE" trigger that sets the value to 0, and the "AFTER" trigger that you already have.</p>

<p>When inserting the first row, "before" trigger will set the value of Codice_Lezione to 0, and then "after" trigger will set it to 1.</p>

<p>With the second row, "before" trigger will set the value of Codice_Lezione to 0, and then "after" trigger will set it to 2. Etc.</p>

<p>Let me know if that doesn't work.</p>
