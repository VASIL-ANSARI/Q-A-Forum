<pre><code> select DATEPART(hour, date) as oHour, SUM(COALESCE(orders.total, 0)) as total
 from orders
 group by DATEPART(HOUR, date)
</code></pre>

<p>The SUM operator is returning null for orders.total where there are no orders. Using COALESCE it will choose the data type of the highest precedence (where all types are higher precedence than NULL).</p>
