<p>I am not a c# programmer but after looking at your code, method GetJSON is returning hard coded empty string that might be the cause you are not getting anything back from the server after invoking this method or second reason could be your asynchronous server configuration is not working properly thus its returning blank first and doing actual operation later.</p>
