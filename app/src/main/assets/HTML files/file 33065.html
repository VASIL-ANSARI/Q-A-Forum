<p>Your results look correct.  Lucene doesn't respect the order in which documents are added,it orders results by relevance score.  "This is line 1 with some custom data" matches 8 terms in your query, while "This is line 4" has 4 matched terms, thus the former has a higher score.  There is more complexity to scoring, including some factors that would equalize these somewhat, but in this case I believe that is the dominant behavior.</p>

<p>You can sort your results by passing in a <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_7_0/core/org/apache/lucene/search/Sort.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Sort</code></a> to your search call.  <code>Sort.INDEXORDER</code> is easy and sorts by Doc ID, which would serve your purpose somewhat.  </p>

<p>However, Doc IDs are not guaranteed to be in insert order.  The more correct way to do this would be to add a field to sort on, which indexes either the time or order in which documents are indexed, and create a <code>Sort</code> on that field.</p>
