<p>I have absolutely no idea if this would be helpful but have you considered converting your image to canvas?  Would this fulfill your requirements in any way?</p>

<p>There's some good info on this <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/convert-canvas-image" rel="nofollow">here</a> if your ok with using javascript to accomplish this.</p>

<p>That being said <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-canvas" rel="nofollow">not all browsers / devices support canvas drawing</a></p>

<p>I got stuck with only being able to use css3D transforms for a cross device / cross platform app with a 3D UI requirement and tried to fart around with SVG.  It was pretty painful.</p>
