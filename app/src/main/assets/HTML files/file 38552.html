<li><p>enum  is a string object internally mapped to integer. It will 1 or 2 bytes depending on the number of enumeration values. Here , you have only 'active' or 'inactive'. So, <strong>no space issue</strong> .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Getting list</strong> of distinct ENUM members would be pain.</p>

<p>Eg: you cant dynamically generate the drop down list of status by just select * from roles, if you would have maintained in a table</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Changing</strong> the member list of ENUM is <strong>expensive</strong></p>

<p><code>ALTER TABLE ENUM('active','inactive')</code> to <code>ENUM('active','disabled')</code>
MySQL needs to rebuild your table and look through every record to check for the now-invalid value 'inactive' and would be bad for millions of records</p></li>
<li><p>When you use enum, you have to note you can no longer add any attribute or related info to the roles</p></li>
</ol>
