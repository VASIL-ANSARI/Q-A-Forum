<p><code>gain_get_chapter()</code> returns a <code>double</code>, but <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html#return-types" rel="nofollow">the ctypes docs say</a> "By default functions are assumed to return the C int type." You should do something like </p>

<pre><code>replaygain.gain_get_chapter.restype = ctypes.c_double
</code></pre>

<p>You should also check the return values of <code>gain_init_analysis</code> and <code>gain_analyze_samples</code>; if those aren't both 1, something else is going wrong. (Those actually are ints, so you shouldn't have to do anything else there.)</p>
