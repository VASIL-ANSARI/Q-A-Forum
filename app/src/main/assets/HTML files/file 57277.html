<p>Because it's your class, and your object, it is up to you, the programmer, to define what qualifies two objects as equal.</p>

<p>It is important to understand the difference between == and the equals method.  == two references, and return true if the argument on the right and left of the operator are numerically identical, that is, are actually the same instance of the class in memory.  The equals method, on the other hand, is defined differently for different classes.  It is only useful if you define it to be useful, and it is only useful if it's implementation is helpful for the problem you're trying to solve.</p>
