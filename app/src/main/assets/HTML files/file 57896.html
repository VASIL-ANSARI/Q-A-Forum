<p>Q: For the Oid, do I only need to input ONE Oid(the first item of the Bulk)?</p>

<p>A: Yes, you only need to set the first OID.</p>

<p>Q: If I wish to get a bulk request starting from the stated Oid, and the following 4 items after the first, do I simply set the "Max-Repetition" to 5?</p>

<p>A: Yes. 5 is the minimum that you need to set for max-repetition, but you can set to a bigger value (e.g. 10). The way you would work with the response is to traverse over the response PDU and get out each OID at a time.</p>

<p>Hope this help.</p>
