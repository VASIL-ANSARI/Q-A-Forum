<p>You can use the function array_map() This applies a function to each of the elements in an array ($a in your case) and applies a callback function to those, you can give extra arguments to those functions by supplying another array ($b in your case). The result will be $sum of your example. </p>

<p>The callback function would need to check if the arguments are arrays, if so it would need to do the mapping function again (so its a recursive function) if the arguments aren't an array it needs to add the function.</p>

<p>So all in all you'd be off much better doing a nested foreach :)</p>
