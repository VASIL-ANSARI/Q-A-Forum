<p>You're using global variables to store instance data:</p>

<pre><code>std::string title;
</code></pre>

<p>That means there's only one <code>title</code> in your program and if you ever change it, it changes for every class, function, etc. that accesses it.</p>

<p>Make it a non-static member variable of <code>Node</code> and your problem will go away.</p>
