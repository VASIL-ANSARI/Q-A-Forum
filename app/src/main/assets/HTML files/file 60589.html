<p>Have you heard about <a href="http://asyncdisplaykit.org" rel="nofollow">AsyncDisplayKit</a>? It has its own unique approach to the question of <a href="http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/layout2-conversion-guide.html" rel="nofollow">layouts</a>, sizes and etc. It also has its own implementation of tables, collections, labels... It took me not much time to replace UICollectionView in existing project with ASCollectionNode.</p>

<p>Hope this helps (:</p>
