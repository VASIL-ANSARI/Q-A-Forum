<p>Recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li>One class should not try to directly manipulate variables of another class.</li>
<li>Instead have one class call public methods of the other class.</li>
<li>To allow your second class to do that, you need to pass a reference of the first class's object into that of the second class. I suggest you do this via a constructor parameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code>// class name should begin with an upper case letter
public class TimerRun {
  private MyTimer myTimer;


  public TimerRun(MyTimer myTimer) {
    this.myTimer = myTimer;
  }

  //.... 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the TimerRun class can call public methods on the MyTimer object held by myTimer by calling, <code>myTimer.someMethod()</code></p>
