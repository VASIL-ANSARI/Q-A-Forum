<p>I eventually found the problem which cannot be seen above. The problem (not documented anywhere) was that some of my classes use external packages that I had not imported into Matlab. I was not planning on using any of the functionalities linked with these packages. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Matlab error message that it cannot find the class is puzzling. An error message indicating that the class cannot be used because some packages are not referenced would be most useful.</p>

<p>IF YOUR PACKAGE USES EXTERNAL PACKAGES, MAKE SURE TO IMPORT ALL THE JAR FILE UNDER MATLAB OR SOME CLASSES WILL NOT BE US</p>

<p>Another tip that I found useful is that the Matlab function "import" will not return an error if you enter a package that does not exist with * "import java.doesnotexist.*" works fine. However, "import java.doesnotexist.aclass" will not work.</p>
