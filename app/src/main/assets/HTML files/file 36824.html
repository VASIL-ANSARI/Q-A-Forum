<p>first i do not think your program has any problem and i think this happens because the image has not completely downloaded from internet.In order to confirm this you can scroll the list and stop it suddenly to see if wrong images replace by correct one or not!! you can solve this problem by using placeholder image and error image in your request like this:</p>

<pre><code>imageLoader.get(URL_IMAGE, ImageLoader.getImageListener(
                imageView, R.drawable.ico_loading, R.drawable.ico_error));
</code></pre>

<p>and my suggestion is using ImageLoader and NetworkImageView together for image request. for more information look at: <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/volley/request.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/training/volley/request.html</a></p>

<p>and another issue that is not relevant to your question is your usage of ViewHolder. you are using this design pattern wrongly and it dose not give you any performance. the concept of using this is to eliminate unnecessary call for findViewByID but for every row you call this function for every view. search net for more information.</p>
