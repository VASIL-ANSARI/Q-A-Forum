<p>Ok, so the when you create a navigation controller, it is simply a means of controller a stack of views. In order to actually add a view to the window using <code>addSubview:(UIView *)</code>, you must retrieve the view of the navigation controller using <code>[navigationController view]</code>, which gets the view for the given navigation controller, allowing you to set it in the app's main window. I hope that makes sense. You should consider reading some introductions to objective-c.</p>
