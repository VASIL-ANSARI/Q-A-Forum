<p>You are on the wrong track here. You get the <code>NPE</code> because the <code>Fragments</code> views is not created yet. <code>Fragments</code> also have a lifecycle just like <code>Activities</code>.</p>

<p>What you should be doing is assigning the <code>OnClickListener</code> inside your <code>Fragments</code> <code>onViewCreated()</code> method. And from there... you should create a callback and notify your hosting <code>Activity</code> of the event. </p>
