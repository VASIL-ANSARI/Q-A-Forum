<p>It looks like your function is set up to return the new Blah(). Is it actually being returned in your code? I see in the piece you posted that it is not. If that is the case, then the new Blah() would have a scope outside of Foo and it may be the calling function that is actually holding the references in scope. Also, you're creating new Gadget() as well. Depending on how many Blahs to Gadgets you have, you could be exponentially filling your memory as the Gadgets will be scoped with the Blahs which are then held in scope beyond Foo.</p>

<p>Whether I'm right or wrong, this possibility was kinda funny to type.</p>
