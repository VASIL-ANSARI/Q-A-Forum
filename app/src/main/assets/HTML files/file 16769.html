<p>If you call play and pause sequentially, they will overlap on most platforms and cause pause to be ignored. To get it to work reliably, you should bind an event handler to play event and call pause in it, like this:</p>

<pre><code>    Froogaloop(playerID).addEvent('play', function(playerID) {
        Froogaloop(playerID).api('pause');
        Froogaloop(playerID).removeEvent('play');
    });
    Froogaloop(playerID).api('play');
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the event handler should unbind itself so that it is not executed when the user actually clicks play.</p>
