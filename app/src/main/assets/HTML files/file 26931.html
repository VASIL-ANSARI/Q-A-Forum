<p>There's a bunch of available data sets out there.</p>

<p>I would assume, that <a href="http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/" rel="nofollow">GeoNames</a> is most appropriate here. This project extracts all objects from Wikipedia, that has coordinates specified. And of  course, it is quite possible to query cities.</p>

<p>If you need more detailed info, then all depends on a particular country. Say, Netherlands state authorities can provide you extracts of the <a href="http://www.kadaster.nl/BAG" rel="nofollow">state estate database</a>, which includes all buildings, inhabited places, living boats and some more.</p>

<p>I assume that building a complete list of cities will be a costy project.</p>
