<p>The problem is not what you think it is - if i debug the following code:</p>

<pre><code>int main() {
    int list = 666;
    while( list ) {
        list--;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can break on the third line and say:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) print list
</code></pre>

<p>which gives me:</p>

<pre><code>$1 = 666
</code></pre>

<p>There must be something else wrong with the expression you are trying to print. Have you tried using a GUI debugger, like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/" rel="nofollow">DDD</a>, which will allow you to select the thing you want to print by clicking with the mouse?</p>
