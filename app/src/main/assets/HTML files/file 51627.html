  <p>Data link types for mon0 (use option -y to set): IEEE802_11_RADIO (802.11 plus radiotap header)</p>

<p>Then the raw packet data will begin with a <a href="http://www.radiotap.org" rel="nofollow">radiotap header</a>, which has fields that, if present, indicate:</p>

<ul>
<li>the channel (<a href="http://www.radiotap.org/defined-fields/Channel" rel="nofollow">Channel</a>, which contains the channel frequency, not the channel number, or <a href="http://www.radiotap.org/suggested-fields/XChannel" rel="nofollow">XChannel</a>, which contains both - the header might have both Channel <em>and</em> XChannel)</li>
<li>the signal strength, in dBm (<a href="http://www.radiotap.org/defined-fields/Antenna%20signal" rel="nofollow">Antenna signal</a>), or the signal strength, in dB from some arbitrary reference point (<a href="http://www.radiotap.org/defined-fields/dB%20antenna%20signal" rel="nofollow">dB antenna signal</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Be warned that radiotap headers are not simple to parse.</p>

<p>The radiotap header has a length field, which is a little-endian value, at the beginning; it indicates how long the entire header, including all the fields, is.</p>

<p>After the radiotap header, there will be an 802.11 header, which will contain the source and destination MAC addresses.  See <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/about/get/802/802.11.html" rel="nofollow">the IEEE 802.11 specification</a>.</p>
