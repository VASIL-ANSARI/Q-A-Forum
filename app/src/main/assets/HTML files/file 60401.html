<p>When you use DataTables with jQuery, the plugin manages the rows that appear on the page by adding and removing elements from the DOM when you switch pages. When the table loads, the only rows that exist in the DOM are those appearing on that first page.</p>

<p>This means that your handler is only ever added to the first page's elements and once you switch pages, those elements are removed so when you go back to page 1, those will be newly created elements with no handlers attached. </p>

<p>Change your code to this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#some-table-id').on('click','.clickable-row', function (event) {
    if (event.target.type !== 'checkbox') {
        $(':checkbox', this).trigger('click');
    }
}); 
</code></pre>
