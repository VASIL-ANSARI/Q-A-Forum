<p>Calling <code>gulp.series('task1', 'task2')</code> does <strong>not</strong> run <code>task1</code> and <code>task2</code>. All it does is return a new function. Only once you call <strong>that</strong> function are the tasks actually executed.</p>

<p>That means in your case you need to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>var runTasks = gulp.series('clean', 'patternlab:build',
                           'tag-version', deployWeb.bind(this, env));
runTasks();
</code></pre>

<p>The whole <code>function(done){ done(); }</code> part that you had in your code doesn't really make much sense and isn't needed for <code>gulp.series()</code>.</p>
