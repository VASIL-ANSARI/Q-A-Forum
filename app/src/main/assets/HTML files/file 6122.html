<p>Well, this is actually one of the annoying limitations of .Net GUI-Building Libraries</p>

<p>A common workaround would be managing your Menus dynamically, adding Items to them as they are opening. Ugly but quite seamless from the user experience point of view.
The trick is to use the following UI design pradigm : Menus are never displayed simultaneously, so you can hot-swap Items</p>

<pre><code>private void myContextMenuStrip_Opening(object sender, CancelEventArgs e)
{
    myContextMenuStrip.Items.Insert(3, myToolStripMenuItem);
}  
</code></pre>

<p>Then using flags and code logic you would be able to know, <em>As the Menu/ToolBar/ContextMenu is opened</em>, what Items it should display.</p>
