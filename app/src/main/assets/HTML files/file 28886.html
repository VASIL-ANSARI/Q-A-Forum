<p>You have to use the <code>liferay-portal-db-upgrade-6.1.1-ce-ga2-20120731132656558.zip</code> bundled application.</p>

<p>It's not easy to migrate from <code>5.2.3 to 6.1.1</code>, maybe it's better to have an intermediate step with <code>6.06</code> version.
Use always the <code>liferay-portal-db-upgrade-x.x.x.</code> It's the best way.</p>
