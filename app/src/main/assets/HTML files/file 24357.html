<p>After some debugging and comparing the emulator to the native app I discovered that the "can't open file for reading" is not related to the svg files not displaying. Instead it was related to hardware acceleration. I had to set the following in my manifest</p>

<pre><code>android:hardwareAccelerated="false" 
</code></pre>

<p>problem solved. Time wasted. Brain blown.</p>
