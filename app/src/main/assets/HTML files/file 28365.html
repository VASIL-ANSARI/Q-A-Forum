<p>First things first, if you are running (as you should) <code>dump</code> from <strong>AndroidViewClient >= 4.0.0</strong> you should not use <code>monkeyrunner</code> as the interpreter but <code>python</code>.</p>

<p>Just:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./dump -VF
</code></pre>

<p>on an operating system that supports shebang, or</p>

<pre><code>python dump -VF
</code></pre>

<p>on a no-so-lucky OS.</p>

<p><code>dump</code> dumps all the android Views and its properties, so unfortunately it's not possible now to dig inside the WebView, perhaps in the future this feature could be added, but it should rely on different techniques than the ones used to obtain the View hierarchy.</p>
