<p>I would say there is no benefit. Put <code>{ list-style: none; }</code> where you need it, most often in navigation as you already said.<br>
Defining it to display bullets again is imho the wrong use (unless you want to change the bullet type of course).</p>

<p>And I guess <code>ol</code> is added to just cover all types of lists.</p>
