<p><code>file_get_contents()</code> will return the raw content of a local file. For remote files it will return what the webserver delivers. If the webserver executes the script in the file it will get the result of that script. If the webserver doesn't execute the script in the file (due to a misconfiguration for example) you will still get the raw content of the remote script.</p>

<p>In your case I'd just remove the include path and just fetch all scripts over http. It reduces the complexity and the overhead of calling one of three scripts via http instead of loading it directly is negligible.</p>
