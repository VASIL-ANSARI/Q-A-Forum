<p>This is a good use for a <code>format</code> string, which can specify a width for a field to be filled with a character (including spaces). But, you'll have to <code>split()</code> your strings first if they're in the format at the top of the post. For example:</p>

<pre><code>"{: &lt;10}{}".format(*bob.split())
# output: 'Bob       1'
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>&lt;</code> means left align, and the space before it is the character that will be used to "fill" the "emtpy" part of that number of characters. Doesn't <em>have</em> to be spaces. <code>10</code> is the number of spaces and the <code>:</code> is just to prevent it from thinking that <code>&lt;10</code> is supposed to be the name of the argument to insert here.</p>

<p>Based on your example, it looks like you want the width to be based on the longest name. In which case you don't want to hardcode <code>10</code> like I just did. Instead you want to get the longest length. Here's a better example:</p>

<pre><code>names_and_nums = [x.split() for x in (bob, james, longname)]
longest_length = max(len(name) for (name, num) in names_and_nums)
format_str = "{: &lt;" + str(longest_length) + "}{}"
for name, num in names_and_nums:
    print(format_str.format(name,  num))
</code></pre>
