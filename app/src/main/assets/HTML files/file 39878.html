<p>I saw these codes in onInit(), which will be called after the TextToSpeech is instantiated and initialized successfully. See the speakOut() here? That's what causes your problem.</p>

<pre><code>if (result == TextToSpeech.LANG_MISSING_DATA
            || result == TextToSpeech.LANG_NOT_SUPPORTED) {
        Log.e("TTS", "Language is not supported");
} else {
    button1.setEnabled(true);
    speakOut();
}
</code></pre>
