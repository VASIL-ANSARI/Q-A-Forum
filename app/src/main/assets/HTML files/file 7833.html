<p>I don't know of any good tutorial but for the first question you ask : </p>

<p>"I need to understand how I can show another listview when clicking on an item in the first listview." </p>

<p>I assume you want to keep the same list view in the same activity. So just change the adapter of the list view. If it's cursor based, don't forget to manage your cursor. Once you switched to the new adapter, call the </p>

<pre><code>notifyDatasetChanged() 
</code></pre>

<p>method of you adapter to refresh the view.</p>

<p>Regarding the second question "Also how I can display a textview when clicking on an item in a listview.", it's too fuzzy for me. What do you wanna do ? Edit a list item directly in place, popup a dialog with an edit text ?</p>
