<p>You are specifically interested in <code>sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode:</code></p>

<p>Set <code>CGSize.width</code> of the constrainedToSize property to the width of your cell/label area. And then set the <code>CGSize.height</code> to a very large number, probably <code>CGFLOAT_MAX</code>. The idea is that you are saying "Hey, this label has to fit in an area that is a static width but it can go on vertically forever. So, tell me how high this label is actually going to be given the information I gave you."</p>

<pre><code>NSString *comment = @"Some really long comment that does not fit in the standard cell size. This comment will be wrapped by word. Some more words to make this longer...";

CGSize renderedSize = [comment sizeWithFont:myFont constrainedToSize:CGSizeMake(kCellWidth, CGFLOAT_MAX) lineBreakMode:NSLineBreakByWordWrapping];
</code></pre>

<p><code>renderedSize.height</code> is the value you would return for <code>(CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath</code></p>
