<p>You didn't call <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationClient.html#connect%28%29" rel="nofollow"><code>LocationClient.connect()</code></a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, why would you want to call this from a <code>IntentService</code>? It is designed to do work on background and is destroyed when no more work is scheduled. Use normal <code>Service</code>.</p>
