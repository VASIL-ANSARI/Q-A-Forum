<p>Your code should be fine. Do you change their positions outside this function?
I would consider rewriting <code>BGObstacle::setPosition(float x, float y)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>BGObstacle::setPosition(float x, float y){
    assert(Vec2(x, y).length()&gt;0.001f);
    Sprite::setPosition(x, y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The game will be interrupted and you can see the call stack when any BGObstacle is moved to (0, 0).</p>
