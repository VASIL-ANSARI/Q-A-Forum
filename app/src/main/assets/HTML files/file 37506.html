<p>Yes <code>HWND_TOPMOST</code> is a <em>very</em> bad user experience, so I will commend you for not taking the easy way out and trying to flip this switch.</p>

<p>The key to getting a dialog to appear on top of other windows is setting its <em>owner</em>. (Note that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/15/9978691.aspx" rel="nofollow">in Win32, an owner is distinct from a parent window</a>, although the terms are often confusing.) All dialogs have an owner, and dialogs always stay on top of their owner.</p>

<p>So when you create the modeless dialog (e.g. using the <code>CreateDialog</code> function), make sure to specify the handle to your application's main window as its owner. Confusingly, the parameter is named <code>hwndParent</code>, but it actually specifies the owner window.</p>
