<p>If you were to think of an event as a subscriber list, in your code all you are doing is registering a subscriber.  The number of instructions needed to achieve that is likely to be minimal at the CLR level.</p>

<p>If you want your code to be generic or dynamic, then you're need to check if something is subscribed prior to calling an event.  The event/delegate mechanism of C# and .NET provides this to you at very little cost (in terms of CPU).</p>

<p>If you're really concerned about every clock cycle, you'd never write generic/dynamic game logic. It's a trade off between maintainable/configurable code and outright speed.</p>

<p>Written well, I'd favour events/delegates until I could prove it is an issue.</p>

<p>The only way you'll truly know if it is an issue for you is by profiling your code -- which you should do anyway for any game development!</p>
