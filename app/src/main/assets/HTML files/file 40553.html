<p>Unfortunately IE's "F12 Developer Tools" is not available outside of IE itself.  When using the IWebBrowser2 OLE control (as MFC is doing under the hood) there are two other ways to debug scripts and view the DOM.  Note that both methods require you to modify the webpage beforehand.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use Visual Studio.</strong>  Assuming you have Visual Studio installed on your system, it has the ability to debug webpages.  To use this, add the <code>debugger;</code> keyword to your existing Javascript, or add <code>&lt;script&gt;debugger;&lt;/script&gt;</code> anywhere in the webpage.  Then launch IE, select <em>Internet options</em>, click the <em>Advanced</em> tab, and uncheck the box labeled <em>Disable script debugging (Other)</em>.  Now when you launch your application and it hits your breakpoint, a dialog will popup asking if you want to debug the page in Visual Studio.</li>
<li><strong>Use Firebug Lite.</strong>  The Firebug tools for Firefox also come in a package that works in other browsers, including IE.  The easiest way to use this is to add the following inside the head element of your webpage: <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>.
