<p>Unless <code>NewTask</code> is inner non static class in <code>OlderTask</code> it will not prevent GC from collecting <code>OlderTask</code> unless you store reference to it in some other way.</p>

<p>But even if GC will wait until <code>NewTask</code> is done it should not be a big deal unless you save lot of data in <code>OlderTask</code> or create lots of copies of <code>OlderTask</code>.   </p>

<p>So if your design requires doing that, it's ok. But it surely cleaner not to have chained tasks.</p>
