<p>Cannot change BorderStyle? No problem, let's hide it!!</p>

<p>I solved by handle a Panel.... Yes a panel instead of the form... with negative positions the job is done ;-) We can now leave our media player borderless (by fulfilling the panel) or we may draw a cool personalized border with photoshop :-)</p>

<pre><code>SetParent(ffplay.MainWindowHandle, this.panel1.Handle);
MoveWindow(ffplay.MainWindowHandle, -5, -30, 320, 280, true);
</code></pre>

<p>I know, it's only a trick but the result is totally compatible with the main question!</p>
