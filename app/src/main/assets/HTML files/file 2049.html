<p>I generally recommend not using the built in publish function to upload to FTP.  It occasionally has trouble with FTP sites and gives the publish failed error, however, its not a complete failure.  You only get the failed message because of the one failed file, but the rest of the site would still work.  This error has happened to me when publishing the original unmodified scripts as well as designer created files and images.</p>

<p>I find it much less frustrating to use the publish feature to publish a local copy or create a package (right click the web project in your solution).  Once all the published files are in my specified folder, I use some other FTP program to upload.</p>
