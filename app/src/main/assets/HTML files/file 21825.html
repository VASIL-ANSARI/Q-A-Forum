<p>I don't think it's possible. Based on this thread: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4545311/how-to-download-a-file-by-jquery-ajax">How to download a file by jquery.ajax</a>, JavaScript cannot save files directly to a user's computer. However do take a look at jQuery File Download Plugin (<a href="http://johnculviner.com/post/2012/03/22/Ajax-like-feature-rich-file-downloads-with-jQuery-File-Download.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://johnculviner.com/post/2012/03/22/Ajax-like-feature-rich-file-downloads-with-jQuery-File-Download.aspx</a>) and see if that works for you.</p>
