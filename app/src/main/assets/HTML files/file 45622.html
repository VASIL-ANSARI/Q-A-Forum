<p>The simplest thing is just to do it after the object initializer:</p>

<pre><code>for(i=43000; i&lt;=45999;i++){
    obj.zip.push({val: i, string: i});
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that I moved the <code>i++</code>, it has no business being in the body of the loop.) (Also note that unless you have <code>i</code> declared somewhere, that was falling prey to <a href="http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2008/03/horror-of-implicit-globals.html" rel="nofollow"><em>The Horror of Implicit Globals</em></a>.) (And <code>for</code> blocks don't have a <code>;</code> after them. :-) )</p>

<p>If it were <strong>really important</strong> that it be part of the initializer (which is unlikely), you could use a temporary function you call immediately:</p>

<pre><code>"zip" : function() {
    var a = [];
    for(var i=43000; i&lt;=45999;i++){
        a.push({val: i, string: i});
    }
    return a;
}()
</code></pre>

<p>...but I wouldn't without a good reason. Though I'm not sure why not...</p>
