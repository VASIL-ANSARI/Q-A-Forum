<p>Okay imagine you have a tree. You know it has one leaf with the data you want Suppose you want to find that leaf by traveling over the various branches of the tree until you find it. </p>

<p>With <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth First search</a></i>, if you came across a branch, you would take that branch, and then take another branch and another and another until you get to a leaf. </p>

<p>With a <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search"><b>Breadth</b> first search</a></i> (notice I didn't say 'best first' here) when you come across a new branch you add it to a queue to come back to later until you find all branches at the current level. Normally when people say "BFS" they mean <i><b>Breadth</b> First search</I>, not Best First.</p>

<p>So what about <i><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search">Best</b> first search</a></i>, like you asked about?  Well, suppose you're doing a depth first search and you come across two branches.  With a DFS, you just pick the first one each time, later on, you'll come back and pick the other one. </p>

<p>With <i><b>Best</b> first search</i> you pick a branch with the highest heuristic value, based on some heuristic you're using to help guess the best path. So a Best First search is a <i>type</i> of Depth first search. </p>

<p>Wikipedia is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">very helpful</a> for these kinds of questions, btw. </p>
