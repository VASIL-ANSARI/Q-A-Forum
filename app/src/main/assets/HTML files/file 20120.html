<p>The JavaDocs for the constructor of <a href="http://slick.cokeandcode.com/javadoc/org/newdawn/slick/Music.html#Music%28java.lang.String%29" rel="nofollow"><code>Music(String)</code></a> are not entirely clear on how it interprets the <code>String</code>.  J2SE methods that take a <code>String</code> typically presume it to represent the path to a <code>File</code>.  If that is the case, that is also the reason behind the failure.  </p>

<p>Typically those types of resources become an <a href="/questions/tagged/embedded-resource" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'embedded-resource'" rel="tag">embedded-resource</a> when the app. is built.  An embedded resource must be accessed by <code>URL</code>.  See the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/embedded-resource/info">embedded resource info. page</a> for tips on forming the <code>URL</code>.</p>
