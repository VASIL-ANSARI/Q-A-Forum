  <p>I have to override the categories each time the list is populated
  since it will be pull out form server. So i quess i need to have
  arrays and the second one will hold the selected objects?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, since it is a list you can/should use arrays. The information about the selected items/objects should be stored on your scope model (example below).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I am right, how do I preselected checkboxes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Save the ID's of the selected options/checkboxes on your model and let the <code>ng-model</code> do the rest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do I need ng-click in order call custom function to store the selected
  object in the other array?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you don't need it, <code>ng-model</code> is enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do i need ng-model in check box? And what for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you need it. The <code>ng-model</code> is responsible for storing the selected options on your model and for making the ('pre-')selection automatic.</p>
