<p>It is one of the many issues I've had with C# versus VB.NET, as much as I love C#, VB.NET makes events simpler. </p>

<pre><code>// Placed outside of the class
public delegate void CampaignDetailSelectedEventHandler(ListItem listItem);

// Test class to show to convert from vb.net to C# 
public class Test : ICampaignMaintenanceView
{
    public event CampaignDetailSelectedEventHandler CampaignDetailSelected; 


    protected virtual void OnCampaignDetailSelected(ListItem listItem)
    {
        if (CampaignDetailSelected != null)
        {
            CampaignDetailSelected(listItem);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
