<p>If you set the AutoGenerateColumns property to false and you do not have manually defined columns there will be no columns in RadGrid. Since there are no columns there will be no records because records are cells of given columns. Since there are no rows in the Grid the NoRecordsToDisplay message will be shown. Check this link to view add column manualy.</p>
