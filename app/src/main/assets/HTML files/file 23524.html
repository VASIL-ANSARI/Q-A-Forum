<p>I think you can use ActionBarSherlock.
You have to target api 11 but you can set the min lower than that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Targetting API level 11 or newer is required as it will cause Android to automatically add the native action bar when run on newer devices. Since you will be compiling against new APIs but your app will likely be run on devices with older versions of Android extra care must be taken to either avoid using or properly check and call any methods that were introduced after your minimum SDK version.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10260801/actionbarsherlock-gives-tons-of-call-requires-api-level-11-current-min-is-7">ActionBarSherlock gives tons of &quot;Call requires API level 11 (current min is 7)&quot; errors</a> might be helpful.</p>
