<p>A +1 to what Offler mentioned:</p>

<ol>
<li>Strip variations of \r\n</li>
<li>Regex group by "Packet #: ". Everything after this until the next Packet entry is what you want.</li>
<li>Regex.Split on the grouping</li>
<li>Clean data as necessary</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a rough scratch program to illustrate:</p>

<pre><code>        var reader = new StreamReader("Test.txt");
        var contents = reader.ReadToEnd();
        var strippedContents = contents.Replace("\r\n", "").Replace("\r", "").Replace("\n", "");
        var regex = new Regex(@"(?&lt;packet&gt;Packet \d+: )");
        var matches = regex.Split(strippedContents);
</code></pre>

<p>Test.txt just combines the data from your 1st and 3rd sections "Packe\r\n" and "P\r\n" but I kept the information sequential and without any spaces between the sections.</p>

<p>Number 4 above isn't in the scratch program but the data has the Packet section at every odd index of the array and index 0 is an empty string (""). It's not elegant but you're essentially telling Regex "match everything <strong>but</strong> this".</p>

<p>That likely isn't a final solution but it should at least get you started.</p>
