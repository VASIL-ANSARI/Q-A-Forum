<p>It's a classic environment problem.</p>

<p>There are two ways to do this: </p>

<ol>
<li>Add an environment string at the end of the appropriate .properties file; pass that value to the app when it starts and let Spring choose the correct one.</li>
<li>Put those dynamic properties in a database and query for them on startup.  The JNDI for the database will pick the right values.</li>
</ol>
