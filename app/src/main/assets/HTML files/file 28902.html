<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it is desirable to allow access to a property that returns a
  dynamically computed value, or you may want reflect the status of an
  internal variable without requiring the use of explicit method calls.
  In JavaScript, this can be accomplished with the use of a getter. It
  is not possible to simultaneously have a getter bound to a property
  and have that property actually hold a value, although it is possible
  to use a getter and a setter in conjunction to create a type of
  pseudo-property.</p>
