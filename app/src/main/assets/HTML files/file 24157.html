<p>You want an inequality on the cd condition in the join:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the beginDate is earlier than endDate in any <strong>other</strong> row with the
  same suffix value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also put all of the conditions into the ON clause of the join:</p>

<pre><code>select a1.cd, a2.cd, a1.suffix, a1.beginDate, a2.endDate
from data a1
join data a2 
on a2.cd &lt;&gt; a1.cd
and a1.suffix = a2.suffix
and a1.beginDate &lt; a2.endDate
</code></pre>
