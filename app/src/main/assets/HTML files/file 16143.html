  <p>We suspected s_var1 might overwrite the c_var2 but the memory locations of these 2 variables are far apart.</p>

<p>This sounds like a global buffer overflow somewhere.</p>

<p>Run <code>nm -n a.out</code>, and find out what variables are <em>near</em> <code>c_var2</code>. Then look for overflows caused by <em>these</em> variables.</p>

<p>Or use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/" rel="nofollow">Address Sanitizer</a>, which should be able to give you exact location of the bug quite easily.</p>

<p>Another way to debug this: run the program under GDB, and set a watchpoint on the address of <code>c_var2</code>. The watchpoint should fire every time <code>c_var2</code> is modified.</p>

  <p>For intance if i add delay somewhere</p>

<p>If your program is multithreaded, then note that static variables and threads don't work together well.</p>

<p>If it is not multithreaded, I don't see how a delay could have any effect (unless you are also processing signals).</p>
