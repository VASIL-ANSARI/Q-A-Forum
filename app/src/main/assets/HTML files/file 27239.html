<p>If you are wanting the code to work with source data from cities, rather than co-ords (sorry the question isn't very clear, maybe rephrase the question). This is possible with a reverse geocode lookup.
There's a jsfiddle here <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/sbnXE/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/sbnXE/</a>
The key changed code that can be added in below...</p>

<p>Note: multiple geocoding per page display is likely a bad idea and could cause problems as in the code below. I think the best method would probabably be to cache up previous geocoding server side, and then use that data to display placemarks. </p>

<pre><code>var cities = new Array(
        'DorÄol, Belgrade, Serbia',
        'DorÄol, Belgrade, Serbia',
        'DorÄol, Belgrade, Serbia',
        'Rome, Italy',
        'Rome, Italy');

var gmarkers = [];
mc = new MarkerClusterer(map, [], mcOptions);

for (i=0; i&lt;cities.length; i++) {
   var ptStr = cities[i];
   var newAddress;

    //Key Part Here!!! These should be cached somewhere rather than querying every page refresh like here though.
    geocoder.geocode( { 'address': cities[i] }, function(results, status) {
    if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
        newAddress = results[0].geometry.location;
        var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(parseFloat(newAddress.lat()),parseFloat(newAddress.lng()));
        gmarkers.push(createMarker(latlng,content[i]));
    }

} );
</code></pre>
