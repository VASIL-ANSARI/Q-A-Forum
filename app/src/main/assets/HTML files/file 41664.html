<p>When you run into a error in your <code>GetWebReqeust</code> your already returning a NULL value meaning you cannot get a working connection. In your <code>GetDirectoryListning</code> you should catch this NULL value and throw it up to your background DoWork event. Inside there you could check for the null and if needed call the .cancel method on the background worker. this will complete the dowork event and trigger the RunWorkerComplete event.</p>

<p>then use the RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler to set the label to a value you like to display when the connection failed. Microsoft wrote a example how to do this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.backgroundworker.runworkercompleted(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> </p>
