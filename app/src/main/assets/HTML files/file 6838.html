<p>From everything I had read I thought for sure the willTransitionToState was the way to go. It even works perfectly if you use didTransitionToState though the transition starts after the normal editing transition finishes.</p>

<p>As it turns out I think you want to use setEditing</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing animated:(BOOL)animate
{
    [super setEditing:editing animated:animate];

    if(editing) {
        [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil];
        [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.3];
        label.alpha = 0.0;
        [UIView commitAnimations];
    } else {
        [UIView beginAnimations:nil context:nil];
        [UIView setAnimationDuration:0.3];
        label.alpha = 1.0;
        [UIView commitAnimations];
    }
}
</code></pre>
