<p>I don't know much about Thymeleaft. But be aware that you might need to escape single quotes  (with two single quotes (<code>''</code>)) if you retrieve the message using <code>MessageFormat</code> and <code>ResourceBundle</code>.</p>

<p>If you are using Spring's <code>ResourceBundleMessageSource</code> (which uses <code>ResourceBundle</code> and <code>MessageFormat</code> internally) you have to do the same thing.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html" rel="nofollow">MessageFormat javadoc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Within a String, a pair of single quotes can be used to quote any
  arbitrary characters except single quotes. For example, pattern string
  "'{0}'" represents string "{0}", not a FormatElement. A single quote
  itself must be represented by doubled single quotes '' throughout a
  String. For example, pattern string "'{''}'" is interpreted as a
  sequence of '{ (start of quoting and a left curly brace), '' (a single
  quote), and }' (a right curly brace and end of quoting), not '{' and
  '}' (quoted left and right curly braces): representing string "{'}",
  not "{}".</p>

<p>Some time ago I wrote a blog post that provides some more details about exactly this topic: <a href="http://www.mscharhag.com/2013/10/single-quote-escaping-in-java-resource.html" rel="nofollow">Single quote escaping with Java resource bundles</a></p>
