<p><code>prop</code> actually is the <em>name</em> of the object's property (=key), not the property itself. It's a plain string (<code>"bill"</code>) and not the actual object <code>friends.bill</code> (/a reference to it).</p>

<p>This is also the reason, why you write</p>

<pre><code>friends[prop] // prop gets evaluated here, it's value is the identifier
</code></pre>

<p>instead of </p>

<pre><code>friends.prop  // prop is treated as the identifier here
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>var friends = {
    bill: { ...
    }
}
for (var prop in friends) {
    // prop == "bill";
    friends[prop] == friends.bill 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, this is similar to (the new) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys" rel="nofollow"><code>Object.keys(friends)</code></a> which returns you an array of all property names of the object you could then iterate on (which perhaps is a bit more intuitive for people coming from other languages).</p>

<p>EDIT: One important note!</p>

<p>Unlike <code>Object.keys()</code>, <code>for in</code> lists <em>all</em> properties of your object, even those it inherited from it's prototype. So if you want to make sure you only get your "native" properties, you always have to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty" rel="nofollow">check if it's a genuine property of the object</a>:</p>

<pre><code>for (var prop in friends) {
    if (friends.hasOwnProperty(prop) ){
         // it's a true property of your object
    }
}
</code></pre>
