<p><code>onAttach()</code> is not invoked until the fragment transaction is committed.  Until then, a fragment has no reference to the creating <code>Activity</code> unless you pass it such a reference.  Passing that reference is probably the cleanest way to implement what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>Generally in Android the title is dictated by the containing activity, not the fragment.  For example, a <code>PreferenceActivity</code>'s xml headers file lists titles and their associated fragments; those titles do not appear in the preference xml files used by the <code>PreferenceFragment</code>.</p>
