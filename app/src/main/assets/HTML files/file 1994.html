<p>My experience with print CSS is limited but try this:</p>

<pre><code>@page {
   margin-bottom: 4cm;
}

#print-footer {
   display: block;
   position: fixed;
   bottom: -10px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to get se the copyright in every page, but it was overlapping with the content and I couldn't get the @page property working. Here are some things you could try.</p>

<pre><code>@page copyspace { margin: 5cm; }

body { page: copyspace; }

#print-footer { ... }
</code></pre>
