<p>Creating an overview can be quite a cumbersome task. I found <a href="http://www.shawngrimes.me/2010/12/mapkit-overlays-session-1-overlay-map/" rel="nofollow">this</a> tutorial to be a good start.</p>

<p>Basically the tutorial says that these steps have to be done:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would recommend a 600 ppi tiff. My tiff had a resolution of about 4000*2000 pixel. </li>
<li>downlaod and install gdal: <a href="http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks" rel="nofollow">http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks</a>. The installation of gdal is no joy. I can't explain every step here. Basically: first install using the complete installer. Then install numPy. Then copy gdal in the path with the terminal.</li>
<li>load the tiff into Google Maps to get the coordinates of the 4 corners.</li>
<li>create the vrt file with gdal. The command will look similar to this string: gdal_translate -of VRT -a_srs EPSG:4326 -gcp 0 0 7.435822 46.953453 -gcp 2285 0 7.460397 46.953453 -gcp 2285 1479 7.460397 46.942342 -gcp 0 1479 7.435822 46.942342 MN_A.tiff MN_A.vrt</li>
<li>Create the tiles with <a href="http://www.maptiler.org" rel="nofollow">MapTiler</a>. The Mac version didn't work for me, but the Windows version did the job.</li>
<li>You need to add these tiles to the project and create a folder reference for them. The code of the WWDC video Session 127 shows how that works.</li>
<li>repeat step 3-5 until the overlay works fine.</li>
</ol>
