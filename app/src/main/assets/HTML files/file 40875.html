<ul>
<li>Case 1 : You are effectively using QMainWindow layout, which is a <em>specific</em> layout implementation to the same extent as QGridLayout or QStackedLayout.</li>
<li>Case 2 : You are using the default Qt widget layout, which have a more loose setup of the children widgets. The only condition I know of is that children rectangles are within the parent rectangle and their default position is 0,0. The layout will not resize the children.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>setCentralWidget(&amp;renderSurface);</code>will try to add renderSurface to the Qmainwindow layout. In case 2, rendersurface is already inside a layout, so this attempt will fail. </p>

<pre><code>Also, since my GUI seems to work better without parenting
</code></pre>

<p>You are incorrect about the parenting part. In both case <code>renderSurface</code> becomes a child of the window. </p>

<pre><code>QWidget* w = new Qwidget(0);
QLayout* l = new QHBoxLayout();

l-&gt;add(w);
setLayout(l);
</code></pre>

<p>During setLayout all widgets in the layout will have their affinity changed to the widget owning the layout. <code>w</code> is no more a parentless widget. </p>

<p>When a widget is going to be added to a layout, the best thing is to create it without a parent like you did. The correct parent is going to be set later.</p>
