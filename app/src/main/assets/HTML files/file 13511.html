<p><code>__clang_analyzer__</code> is a macro, defined when the program is compiled for the analyzer (see the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#analyzer_diagnositics" rel="nofollow">Clang User's Manual</a>). </p>

<p>When it's defined, the code between <code>#ifndef</code> and <code>#endif</code> isn't being compiled, which means that the analyzer doesn't see it and can't tell you about the owned <code>CGMutablePath</code> that you're returning from a function whose name doesn't indicate it returns an owning reference.</p>

<p>You should consider adding <code>create</code> to the beginning of the function name.</p>
