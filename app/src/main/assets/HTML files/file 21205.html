<p>It would be better if you did the authentication purely client-side.  Do an ajax call at the start on the angular end asking if we're logged in.  If not, prompt the user for information (maybe in a modal dialog) and then POST that to '/login' on the server.</p>

<p>For security, none of the authentication-sensitive information should be stored on the client side.  Instead, have it retrieved with ajax - and reply to the ajax with a 401 or some error if the user isn't logged in correctly.</p>
