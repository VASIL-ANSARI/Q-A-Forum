<p>It is not completely clear that your C# UI is launched from an Edit Substep. However, assuming that you are writing a C# UI to be launched from an Edit Substep in your Custom Step Type, you can pass the SequenceContext (ThisContext) to your C# UI as a reference that will provide the correct context to the Parameters PropertyObject in a given Sequence. Once the button on your UI is pressed, you would be able to use the TestStand PropertyObject API to SetVal(Type) (where 'Type' is the Data Type of the Parameter you are setting i.e. Number, String, etc.) of a given lookupstring variable in the Parameters of your Sequence.</p>

<p>If you provide more detail as to where the x and y values will be placed upon button click, I can give you a more detailed approach.</p>
