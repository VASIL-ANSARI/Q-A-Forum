<p>First question is it is disconnected graphs then you have to write according to scenario.</p>

<pre><code>   DbSet.Add() will try to add all

   DbSet.Attach() will make sure context is aware of objects but state of elements will be unchanged.

   Context.Entry(entity).State=EntityState is how you can say what has been modified, added or deleted.
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
