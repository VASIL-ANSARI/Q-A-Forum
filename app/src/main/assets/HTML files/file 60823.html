<p>When the user clicks on the button, send that event back to the activity (or where you have a reference of the viewpager). From there, you should check what fragment in the viewpager is visible (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11293300/determine-when-a-viewpager-changes-pages">Determine when a ViewPager changes pages</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10024739/how-to-determine-when-fragment-becomes-visible-in-viewpager">How to determine when Fragment becomes visible in ViewPager</a>) and then you will know what to do with that event.</p>
