<p>Your query is pretty much along the way there.  But you are missing conditions in the <code>case</code> statements.  Adding new conditions seems pointless, when some arithmetic on <code>N</code> solves the problem:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM (SELECT Country_
            , State_
            , (CASE WHEN N = 1 THEN 1
                    WHEN N = 2 THEN 2
                    WHEN N = 3 THEN 3
                    WHEN N = 4 THEN 4
                    WHEN N = 5 THEN 5
                    WHEN N = 6 THEN 6
                    WHEN N = 7 THEN 7
                    WHEN N = 8 THEN 8
                    WHEN N = 9 THEN 9 END) AS ParentNo
            , (CASE WHEN N = 1 THEN [Child1FamilyTag1]
                    WHEN N = 2 THEN [Child1FamilyTag2]

                    WHEN N = 4 THEN [Child2FamilyTag1]
                    WHEN N = 5 THEN [Child2FamilyTag2]
                    WHEN N = 6 THEN [Child2FamilyTag3]
                    WHEN N = 7 THEN [Child3FamilyTag1]
                    WHEN N = 8 THEN [Child3FamilyTag2]

            , (CASE WHEN (N + 2) / 3 = 1 THEN [Child1HouseHold]
                    WHEN (N + 2) / 3 = 2 THEN [Child2HouseHold]

<p>EDIT (in response to comment):</p>

<p>Your original query is</p>

<pre><code>        , (CASE WHEN N = 1 THEN [Child1FamilyRankA]
                WHEN N = 2 THEN [Child1FamilyRankB]
                WHEN N = 3 THEN [Child1FamilyRankC]
                WHEN N = 4 THEN [Child2FamilyRankA]
                WHEN N = 2 THEN [Child2FamilyRankB]
                WHEN N = 3 THEN [Child2FamilyRankC]
                WHEN N = 7 THEN [Child3FamilyRankA]
                WHEN N = 2 THEN [Child3FamilyRankB]
                WHEN N = 3 THEN [Child3FamilyRankC] END) AS Rank_
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know why the values are arranged as they are for this <code>rank_</code>, but you can keep using them.  I think I replaced them with something else.</p>
