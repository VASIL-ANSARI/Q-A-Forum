<p>This code is just dreadful.</p>

<p>Some suggestions:</p>

<h3>1) The following is illegal:</h3>

<pre><code>class base{ 
base(){};
~base(){}
};

class derived : public base{
};
</code></pre>

<p>In order to derive from base, the constructor and destructor need to be public or protected.</p>

<h3>2) The following is wrong:</h3>

<pre><code>*base b1(new (derived(b));
</code></pre>

<p>Pointers are declared as:</p>

<pre><code>TYPE* name;
</code></pre>

<h3>3) This won't work</h3>

<pre><code>base b1(new (derived(b));
</code></pre>

<p>since you need a constructor that takes a pointer to a <code>derived</code> object as parameter.</p>

<h2>4) Your factory method makes my eyes hurt.</h2>
