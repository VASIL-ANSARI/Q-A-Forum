<p><em>Assuming both functions take their argument by value</em>, Case 3 is at least as fast as Case 1 which is at least as fast as Case 2.</p>

<p>As ruakh mentioned in the comments, there's some complex dataflow analysis required before optimization occurs.</p>

<p>If the function parameters are references, then the final memory load of the value might never take place.  Then Case 1 would be fastest.</p>

<p>And if those are macros rather than functions, all bets are off.</p>
