<p>You're trying to use ServiceStack like a controller, instead of as the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15369736/85785">DTO-first message-based</a> services it was designed to support. If you want to use RPC method signatures to create services I recommend going back to using WCF, MVC or WebApi which supports this development model.</p>

<p>If you want to still use ServiceStack, I recommend spending some time to read the <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki" rel="nofollow">Getting Started documentation</a> instead of guessing how it works.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack#simple-rest-service-example" rel="nofollow">Simple REST Service</a> on the home page shows exactly how to create a simple service like the one you're trying to create. For further reading on how to design your services see:</p>
