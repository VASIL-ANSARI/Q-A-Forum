  <p>...how does the pointer returned actually point to any relevant data after clone() or create() exit their block?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_%28C++%29" rel="nofollow">Operator <code>new</code></a> allocates memory dynamically. That memory is valid until it is free'd using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delete_%28C++%29" rel="nofollow"><code>delete</code></a>. Neither <code>clone()</code> or <code>create()</code> âdeletesâ those pointers and so both of those functions return a valid pointer.</p>

  <p>Is there a better approach to this or is this where I need to program a function per case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since polymorphism is used here, the assumption is that users work with <code>Shape</code> class and are not aware of the actual implementation of those objects (i.e. they only work with âinterfaceâ). Without knowing what the actual implementation is, it becomes impossible to neither create nor copy the object.</p>

<p>The only place where the type is known is inside methods of the class that implement the interface (which in your case is <code>Circle</code>). So that is the only place where you basically know the type, its size, and all other necessary information needed to create and/or copy the object. So the answer is basically yes, you have to implement both <code>create()</code> and <code>clone()</code> for each top-level class that inherits <code>Shape</code>. Otherwise it would be either impossible to create/clone the object, or even worse - you may run into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing" rel="nofollow">object slicing</a> problem.</p>

  <p>Is creating a static object a viable workaround or does that negate all work to be OO?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't see how creating a static object helps here. Static objects usually exists one instance per scope. The whole purpose of having <code>create()</code> and <code>clone()</code> is to be able to create multiple instances of the object (either default or or a a copy of one of existing instances). So having a single static instance will not help to implement what the code is supposed to be doing. </p>
