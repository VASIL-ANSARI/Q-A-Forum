<p>Several issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The cause of your problem - C++ does not really support splitting templates into .h and .cpp files - you need to put everything in the header</p></li>
<li><p>The name <code>__QUEUE_H__</code> is reserved for the C++ implementation, as are all names that contain double-underscores or begin with an underscore and an uppercase letter. You are not allowed to create such names in your own code.</p></li>
<li><p>You probably will find it more convenient to implement the queue in terms of  a std::deque, rather than a  C-style array</p></li>
<li><p>I assume you are doing this as a learning exercise, but if not you should know that the C++ Standard Library already contains a std::queue template class.</p></li>
</ul>
