  <p>I would like to know why 'ac' object is NULL here, even if we the collection is empty, as per MSDN FirstOrDefault should return NULL for reference types if it does't find the match.</p>

<p>This shows that <code>GetMyClasses()</code> returns a collection which have a null element before any element matching your predicate. That's <em>not</em> the same as the collection being empty.</p>

<p>Check it with this:</p>

<pre><code>int nullElements = TestClass.GetMyClasses().Count(ac =&gt; ac == null);
</code></pre>

<p>I strongly suspect that you'll find <code>nullElements</code> is non-zero.</p>

<p>If that's <em>not</em> the problem, then you should work on providing a short but complete program which you <em>can</em> post. You don't need to post the real code - just code which shows the same problem. I'd be very surprised to see such code - it seems much more likely to me that you've somehow got a null element at the start, which would certainly explain the exception you're seeing.</p>

<p>As an aside, <code>ac</code> isn't an object - it's a variable (a lambda expression parameter). It's very important to distinguish between objects, variables, and references. An object can never be null - the value of a variable can be.</p>
