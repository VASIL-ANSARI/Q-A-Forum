<p>you can set debug="true" in a loback.xml file that you control like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration debug="true"&gt;

(...)

&lt;/configuration
</code></pre>

<p>and tho make sure that file is going to be used by logback add following VM argument when you start your program: </p>

<pre><code>-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/yourlogback.xml
</code></pre>

<p>This does not really answer to your question but gives you a work around solution.</p>
