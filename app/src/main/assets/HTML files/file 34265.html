<p>The magic Google field that means key is <code>__key__</code> (two underscores on each side). This is built in to GAE, so you want <code>order("-__key__")</code>.</p>

<p>Objectify could provide an <code>orderKey(boolean)</code> method on query to make this slightly more convenient. If you add it to the issue tracker, I'll implement it.</p>
