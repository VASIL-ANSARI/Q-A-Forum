<p>Firstly, better clear up some confusion:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Windows Forms is a technology built on top of the .NET Framework. When you describe <code>DateTime.Now</code>, you're discussing types from the base class library, not Windows Forms.</p></li>
<li><p>WebMatrix DB, is in fact, Sql Server Compact.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You might not of come across answers through search if you're making the mistake of confusing tools with the framework itself.</p>

<p>If you need a way to compare .NET data types with Sql data types, it's worth looking at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131092.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN Library Page</a> which discusses this very thing.</p>

<p>For your specific questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>DateTime</code> can be used with <code>datetime</code> in most scenarios, however Sql Server cannot deal with exceptional date ranges (e.g. &lt; 01/01/1753). I can't imagine many scenarios you would need to go less than that, but it's worth a note.</p></li>
<li><p>You're right, there is no <code>money</code> data type in the <strong>base class library</strong>, the compatible .NET data type is <code>Decimal</code>. Decimal is a fixed-precision data type which means that all values can be represented and stored with a range, whereas <code>Float</code> is an approximate-number data type, and <em>could</em> be prone precision issues. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are arguments for using both, for both accuracy and performance reasons, it depends what your application is design to do.</p>
