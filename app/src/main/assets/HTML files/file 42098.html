<p><strong>please understand controller does the business logic only.</strong></p>

<pre><code>MVC-model views and controllers.

model:only the data

view:View is display of model that is your data.  only the visible part(html)

controller: which handles and manipulates the data.
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Model is data</em></strong>, not the business logic and <strong><em>controller handles it</em></strong>. also read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13070048/3556874">this</a></p>
