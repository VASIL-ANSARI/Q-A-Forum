<p>Eclipse is an IDE VERY similar to Netbeans and also quite easy to install with <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">this bundle.</a></p>

<p>The reason why <code>Eclipse</code> is better is because it has official support from <code>Google</code>. <code>Netbeans</code> plugins are made by community, not the official android staff.</p>
