<p>Normally you would hold on to the window controller, and only release it when you are done with it. I'd say that your app delegate would be responsible for that. Just store them in an array if there can be multiple. Whilst your solution may work, it's not very elegant.</p>

<p>If you are working on a document based Cocoa app, you create the window controller in your document subclass method makeWindowControllers and let that class hold a pointer to your window controller.</p>
