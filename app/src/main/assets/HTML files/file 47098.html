<p>The reply by hindmost is correct, there are different messages depending on the browser. Given the following code:</p>

<pre><code>var a = null, b = 5;
a[b];
</code></pre>

<p>Chrome will give the error <code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '5' of null</code> while Safari will give the error <code>TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'a[b]')</code>.</p>
