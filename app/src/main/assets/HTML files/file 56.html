<p>Why won't any old proxy software work for this?  Why does it need to be an ASP.NET application?  There are TONS of tools out there (both Windows and *nix) that will get the job done quite easily.  Check <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/" rel="nofollow" title="excanvas">Squid</a> or <a href="http://www.grok.co.uk/netproxy/" rel="nofollow">NetProxy</a> for starters.</p>

<p>If you need to integrate with IIS, <a href="http://www.iisproxy.net/" rel="nofollow">IISProxy</a> looks like it would do the trick too.</p>
