<p>Three options</p>

<ol>
<li>Code something that connects to A &amp; B, consolidate the infomation, connect to C and save it there</li>
<li>Use a product that lets you connect to databases read from tables and insert into other tables, something like SQL Server Integration Services and design a flow that does the very same thing than step 1.</li>
<li>Depending on the engine, you may be able to make dumps of A&amp;B and load them in C, for example you could dump all data from A&amp;B as insert statements and execute them in C (assuming the tables already exist and that there are no PK conflicts)</li>
</ol>

<p>That should get you going.</p>
