<p>It sounds like you need a <code>Set</code>, not a <code>Map</code>. A <code>Map</code> is, as you say, a key-value structure. Since you only need to store the values (hash codes), a <code>Set</code> is all you need. To get fast lookups, a <code>HashSet</code> is probably your best bet.</p>

<p>Just calculate the hash code for each state, check if it exists in your <code>HashSet</code>, otherwise add it.</p>
