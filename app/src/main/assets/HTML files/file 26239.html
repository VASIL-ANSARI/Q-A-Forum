<p>You probably want a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/range" rel="nofollow">Range</a>, which you can get with <code>window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0)</code></p>

<p>As the link describes, that object has properties which describe the beginning and end of the selection in terms of the elements which the selection starts and ends in, and a numeric offset from the first textual "space" in those elements.</p>

<p>To pass that over the wire, you'll need a consistent identifier for the start and end elements.  If every element in the document has an ID which is the same no matter who's viewing it, then you could use that.  Otherwise, you'll need to determine some custom serialization to uniquely identify elements within your markup.</p>
