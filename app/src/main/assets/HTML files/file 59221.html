<p>Rails will automatically <code>require</code> all gems in the gemfile, which is not ideal when using Sinatra as a middleware. This is documented on the Sinatra website <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Sinatra::Base%20-%20Middleware,%20Libraries,%20and%20Modular%20Apps" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>A workaround to this is changing your Gemfile to say <code>gem "sinatra", :require =&gt; false</code> then adding <code>require "sinatra/base"</code> to your app where it is needed.</p>
