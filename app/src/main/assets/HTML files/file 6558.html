<p>(Answers to your question below, referencing the original question number)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Going to NHibernate is absolutely worth the learning curve - did it at my current job, and we've never looked back.  <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1932394923" rel="nofollow">NHibernate in action</a> is an excellent book to start with.</p></li>
<li><p>You can easily include a 'Where' clause as part of your map.  We use it for filtering some common-use tables and views in our NHibernate mappings.</p></li>
<li><p>For your purge function, just add a secondary map that reverses the where clause (or one without the flag filtered) and you're golden (we sometimes have several maps to the same entities for data shaping).</p></li>
<li><p>RE Blobs, etc. here's an article on them by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100711074950/http://blogs.hibernatingrhinos.com/nhibernate/archive/2008/11/17/lazy-loading-blobs-and-the-like-in-nhibernate.aspx?" rel="nofollow">Ayende</a>, and one on <a href="http://blog.calyptus.eu/seb/2009/03/large-object-storage-for-nhibernate-and-ddd-part-1-blobs-clobs-and-xlobs/" rel="nofollow">Calyptus</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Migration is probably a larger question - personally, we use a repository pattern with an interface for the repository (for unit testing and mocks), a concrete implementation of the repository, and our model (POCOs).  We keep no NHibernate specific code anywhere outside of our repositories to reduce dependencies, etc. and to aid in testing.<br>
Again, look at NHibernate in action for some great info on the product, as well as <a href="http://nhforge.org/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">NHForge.org</a>, <a href="http://tekpub.com/" rel="nofollow">TekPub</a> for their NHibernate series, etc. (I even have some tutorials on my blog, linked in my profile).</p></li>
<li><p>For lookup data, NHibernate works fine, and also supports cacheing.</p></li>
