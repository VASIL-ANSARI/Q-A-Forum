<p>I found the reason of this issue. I added my FragmentActivities to ActivityGroup and then used them in the TabHost. When I clicked the button which called ProgressDialog I got this exception. I should create it like this </p>

<pre><code>progressDialog = new ProgressDialog(getActivity().getParent());
</code></pre>

<p>, not</p>

<pre><code> progressDialog = new ProgressDialog(getActivity());
</code></pre>
