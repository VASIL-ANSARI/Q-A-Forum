<p>It is considered a major usability and acceptability bug in IE6 - for a long time it was recommended not to use <code>px</code> size, as most users will not be able to change it.<br>
Luckily, Microsoft fixed that issue in newer versions of IE.</p>

<p>The mentioned page does not have <code>%</code> or <code>em</code> (or <code>ex</code>, or whatnot), but IE6 supports resizing of <em>some</em> text. For example, the page is using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;font size="5"&gt;President Clinton: "Y2K may doom us all"&lt;/font&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which today is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_FONT.asp" rel="nofollow">deprecated</a>.</p>

<p>Another common text size supported by IE6 using CSS is</p>

<pre><code>font-size:medium; /*or small, xx-large, etc */
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, IE6 will also resize text with <em>no defined text size at all</em>. The default text is resizeable.</p>

<p>Here's a sample page for your resizing pleasure: <strong><a href="http://jsbin.com/ozila/2" rel="nofollow">http://jsbin.com/ozila/2</a></strong></p>
