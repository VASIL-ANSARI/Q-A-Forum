<p>You didn't even provide which number you wanted to print, but I guess you've stumbled over the difference between signed and unsigned printing.</p>

<p>Use "%lu" for <code>unsigned long</code> numbers, and "%ld" or "%li" for <code>signed long</code> numbers.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/56e442dc.aspx">MSDN</a> has good documentation on printf specifiers. For 64-bit values (like <code>long long</code>, for example), you should use the macros in "inttypes.h".</p>
