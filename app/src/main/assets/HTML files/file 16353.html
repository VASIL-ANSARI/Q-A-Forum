  <p>If it did a pull from the layout then would MVC cache the results of the action?</p>

<p>It wouldn't cache the results of the action no, it would go and get them on <strong>every</strong> request.</p>

  <p>If pulling results from an action was better then how exactly could I do it?</p>

<p>Instead of "pulling them from an action", just put them in the model that you are sending back from the controller, then you can use them in your view.</p>
