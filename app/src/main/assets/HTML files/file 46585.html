<p>I am assuming you add words to your <code>words</code> <code>ArrayList</code> as you go.</p>

<p>You correctly state that <code>words.indexOf</code> is <code>O(N)</code> and that is the cause of your issue. As <code>N</code> increases (you add words to the list) these operations take longer and longer.</p>

<p>To avoid this keep your list sorted and use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#binarySearch%28java.util.List,%20T%29" rel="nofollow">binarySearch</a>. </p>

<p>To keep it sorted use <code>binarySearch</code> on each word to work out where to insert it. This takes your complexity from <code>O(n)</code> to <code>O(log(N))</code>.</p>
