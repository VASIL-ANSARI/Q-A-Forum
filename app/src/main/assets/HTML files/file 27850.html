<p>I think it is not possible. You could write a factory yourself and change your code from using the interface to using the factory. Or you can bind your Interface to a Provder (but this will  lead to more code not to less).</p>

<pre><code>bind (new TypeLiteral&lt;Provider&lt;Call&gt;&gt;() {}).annotatedWith(
    Names.named("Verizon")).toProvider(new Provider&lt;Provider&lt;Call&gt;&gt;(){public Provider get(){return new Verizon();}});
</code></pre>

<p>(Or is YOUR Provider the Guice-Provider?)</p>
