<p>The difference of 0.67 is coming from the biggest number 21.8, which is a relative difference of about 3%.  If you look at the last row, all the numbers are off by about 3%.</p>

<p>Now take a look at the outputs from the first step, before you run the <code>echelon</code> function.  Notice that the first element of the last row was 0.0281 in Matlab and 0.0290 in C, which is a difference of 3%.  So the error already existed prior to running <code>echelon</code> on the matrix.</p>

<p>Therefore, my conclusion is that you should be looking at the LU decomposition for the source of your precision problems, not the <code>echelon</code> function.</p>
