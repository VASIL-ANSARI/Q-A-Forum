<p>I am using this in anti-ddos function in my web application, it is easy to do that.  </p>

<p>Firstly you need a database to record the invocation information, say <code>method name</code> and <code>time</code>.</p>

<p>then you can use <code>AOP</code> or <code>interceptor</code> in <code>springmvc</code> or some other technical framework.<br>
record what you are invoking and then check if you are eligible to do that.<br>
While checking eligibility, you need to calculate how many invocation have been done in last <code>N</code> minutes, if exceeded, just deny this invocation!</p>

<p>just have a try!</p>
