<p><a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/436#issuecomment-10712270" rel="nofollow">This</a> comment from the above linked "Related issue 2" suggests assigning to img, except(!?) in the yield, could break things, so my first guess is to try just <code>img.gaussian_blur 5</code> instead of <code>img = img.gaussian_blur 5</code>.</p>

<p>Otherwise: Stack trace?</p>
