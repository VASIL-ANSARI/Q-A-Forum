<p>1 - nope =[</p>

<p>2 - Whoa - holy crap. I hadn't seen this extension before, so thank you for that. I dug into it a bit, and it seems that they install a .plugin on osx and a dll for windows support. </p>

<p>The decompiled plugin is only a couple hundred lines - <a href="https://gist.github.com/3849247" rel="nofollow">https://gist.github.com/3849247</a>. </p>

<p>They are using <a href="https://github.com/nevyn/SPMediaKeyTap" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nevyn/SPMediaKeyTap</a> as a way to plug in directly to the media keys (on os x). They are relaying that through a local socket.io server running on port 12345 to the browser, and the plugin is listening for events fired on it.</p>

<p>supppper neat.</p>

<p>EDIT:
This is now <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+FrancoisBeaufort/posts/SDDSiLV5WVF" rel="nofollow">natively supported in chrome</a></p>
