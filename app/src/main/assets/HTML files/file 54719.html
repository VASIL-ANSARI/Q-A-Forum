<p>Luksprog's answer to Gabriele Mariotti's answer works.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.sg/2016/02/android-support-library-232.html">doc</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the release 2.3.0 there is an exciting new feature to the LayoutManager API: 
  <strong>auto-measurement</strong>!
  This allows a <strong>RecyclerView</strong> to size itself based on the size of its contents. >This means that previously unavailable scenarios, such as using <strong>WRAP_CONTENT</strong> >for a dimension of the RecyclerView, are now possible.
  Youâll find all built in LayoutManagers now support auto-measurement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to this change, <strong>make sure to double check the layout parameters</strong> of your item views: <strong>previously ignored layout parameters</strong> (such as <strong>MATCH_PARENT</strong> in the scroll direction) will now be <strong>fully respected</strong>.</p>

<p>In your item layout you have to change:</p>

<pre><code>android:layout_height="match_parent"
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>android:layout_height="wrap_content" 
</code></pre>
