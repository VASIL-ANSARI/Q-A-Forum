<p>Loop over the characters, for all positions check if the next character is the same as the current (e.g. 'f','f') or the character after and the character before are the same (e.g. 'f','g','f').
If that is the case, loop backward and forward and compare the characters until you find two that don't match.
Compare the length of the string with the longest you've found so far, if it is longer, save it.
Go to the next character. 
You can also exit the loop if you have found a palindrom where length/2 is larger than the number of characters left.</p>
