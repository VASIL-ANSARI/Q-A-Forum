<p>Right from the docs,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a call to the next method returns false, the cursor is positioned
  after the last row. Any invocation of a ResultSet method which
  requires a current row will result in a SQLException being thrown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that says it all, you have passed the row list hence your next statement to fetch record is throwing error,</p>

<p>next will return false if there are no rows, true if there are rows. So can you check if  in your database you have any row.</p>
