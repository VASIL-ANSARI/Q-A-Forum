<p>Will this do? Obviously add some square brackets and stuff. Not too into Access myself.</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO table2 (file_index, celeb_name)
SELECT file_index, 'Audrey Hepburn'
FROM table1
WHERE filename = 'aud'
  AND file_index NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT file_index 
                         FROM table2 
                         WHERE celeb_name = 'Audrey Hepburn')
</code></pre>
