<p>Its made for it. I think you are missing the <code>session_start()</code> part of your script.
Then you can register a var as following: <code>$_SESSION['var_name'] = 'value';</code> and you are done, if the session doesn't expires, that variable will be available everywhere on your domain. 
Remember that session, by default, expires after 24 minutes of inactivity.</p>

<p>Basically the code should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
$_SESSION['var'] = 'var';
</code></pre>

<p>and you should be able to get the variable in another page:</p>

<pre><code>$var = $_SESSION['var'];
</code></pre>

<p>Here it is. Just don't forget the <code>session_start()</code> at the top of each page where you need to use sessions.</p>
