<p>The file name to the font is not the issue since it is an absolute path (the same in both pages: <a href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Josefin+Slab" rel="nofollow">http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Josefin+Slab</a>). </p>

<p>I'm sure the problem resides in your path to your css.
This</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/main.css" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/main-menu.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>compared to this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/main.css" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/menu.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Those would include changing for your IE implementation as well. As Kai Qing said in his comment to you, I cannot help you get the right path because I don't know your file structure. If the second (non-working) page is in the same place as the first (working) page then the files should match. If the "css" folder is a subfolder of your root directory, then the path should be <code>/css/main.css</code> etc. That's about the best I can say for you to try without knowing more.</p>
