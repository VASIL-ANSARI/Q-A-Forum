<p>I think something like this should work, but I didn't tried out:</p>

<pre><code>$('link').each(function () {
    var target = $(this);
    var oldHref = target.attr('href');
    var newHreh = oldHref.replace('http://mysite.com', 'https://secure.bluehost.com/~username/mysite');
    target.attr('href', newHref);
});
</code></pre>

<p>To let the code before it's too late, thus before the css is loaded on the page, simply don't put the  tag in the header, but put it, for example, at the end of the page.
You can also omit the  tag declaration and approach the problem in a different way, adding to the body tag the link tag with the right address using jQuery.</p>
