<p>I had this exact same issue and ended up just using the map object directly.</p>

<p>I bound the control method on the map directive to $scope.control. Then I have to wait til google maps fires the tilesloaded event. Then I can get the map object with.</p>

<pre><code>gMap = $scope.control.getGMap();
</code></pre>

<p>After I have the map object I append polygons to it the non-Angular way.</p>

<p>This is really hacky and I would love to be able to use the polygon directive. </p>
