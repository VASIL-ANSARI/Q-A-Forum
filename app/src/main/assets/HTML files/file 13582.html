<p><strong>Rewrite</strong></p>

<p>I have an EditText that launches a dialog when the user either clicks it once or navigates to it with a trackball / directional pad.  I use this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an OnFocusChangeListener for gaining focus to open the dialog.</li>
<li>Override dismissDialog() to clear the focus from the EditText when the user closes the dialog, preventing the user from entering text without the dialog (as far as I can tell)
.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have also tried this (however I now remember this method did respond to trackball movement):</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an OnClickListener for touch events.</li>
<li>Set <code>setFocusable(false)</code> to prevent user input.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
