<p>So, Iâve since figured out this problem. What I did was searching for an equivalence between utf-8 and iso-8859-1, what I found was between utf-8 and cp1252 (Windows-1252) so there are two conversions, utf-8 to cp1252 and cp1252 to iso-8859-1 (these two having a lot of similarities)</p>

<p>Ugly code, comments left in French, and unelegant solution, but I feel bad seeing this question unansered while I actually found a solution that works.</p>
