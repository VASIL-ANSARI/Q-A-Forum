<p>How did you hide the fields?  If you used CSS <code>visibilty:hidden</code> then the fields still take up space on the rendered page and may or may not be selectable.  To hide fields with CSS use <code>display:none</code> which should prevent the browser from allocating rendered space on the page.</p>

<p>Remember that no matter how they're hidden, "view source" will reveal them, so don't put security-sensitive data in them.</p>
