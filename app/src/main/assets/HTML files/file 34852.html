<p>If you are using jqueryUI, bootstrap, or foundation, they have good docs on their modals so i won't go into that. </p>

<p>You can have a title or a rel attribute to your clickable element that will contain the ID# of the element in question you are retrieving information from.</p>

<p>Then you have 2 options: Use the modal with ajax directly and get the formatted html via ajax or get the age, etc, what you need with a jQuery.ajax call then inject in the modal HTML (pre formatted, you can use some  tags to show data and change it dynamically using an id, i.e. , then fire the modal up in the user's UI.</p>

<p>Hope the above makes sense, it's 3AM, too late to build demo code right now.</p>
