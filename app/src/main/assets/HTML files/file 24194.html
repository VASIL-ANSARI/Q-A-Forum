<p>When an executable is started, Windows searches the current directory, the <code>PATH</code> and then some other places. The exact description can be found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>You need to make sure either the PATH includes the library you need, or place it in the same directory (or in some other automatically searced directory, but that's typically not a good solution). </p>
