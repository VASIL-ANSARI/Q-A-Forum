<p>For anyone interested in the issue, it was with:</p>

<pre><code>ortho = glm::ortho(0, width, height, 0, 0, 1000);
</code></pre>

<p>Where the arguments are supplied as integers, not floats. Therefore the integer division applied within <code>glm::ortho</code> was creating an incorrect orthographic projection matrix.</p>
