<p>You need to use <code>dispatch_async()</code></p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
    //Do the computing-research

     dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
        //do UI update here
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>By using a global queue, the UI of your app won't get blocked. Once all info has been computed/received, it is MANDATORY that you go back to the main thread (by using <code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue())</code> for all UI updates or you'll end up with <em>hard-to-debug</em> crashes.</p>
