<p>As you can read in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/windows/desktop/ms724408%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>, the WinAPI function <code>GetTickCount()</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is limited to the resolution of the system timer, which is typically in the range of 10 milliseconds to 16 milliseconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get a more accurate time measurement, use the function  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh706895%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>GetSystemDatePreciseAsFileTime</code></a></p>

<p>Also, you can not rely on <code>Sleep(500)</code> to sleep <em>exactly</em> 500 milliseconds. It will suspend the thread for <em>at least</em> 500 milliseconds. The operating system will then continue the thread as soon as it has a timeslot available. When there are many other tasks running on the operating system, there might be a delay.</p>
