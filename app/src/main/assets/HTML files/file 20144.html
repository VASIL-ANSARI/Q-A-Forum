<p>As far as I know, this scenario is not supported by the CLR.</p>

<p>If it were, this would lead to all sorts of complications. For example, note that the compiler might <em>inline</em> your private method, so the actual code might look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>private void Method1()
{
    // Body of Method 1
    // Body of Method 2
}
</code></pre>

<p>In that case <code>SomeRunTimeThing.LastMethodExecuted.Name</code> never takes the value <code>Method2</code>. (That's also the reason why you should never use stack trace information for anything but logging and debugging.)</p>
