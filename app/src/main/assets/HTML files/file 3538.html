<p>Does it really matter if it stores is as 3.5, 3.50 or even 3.500?</p>

<p>What is really important is how it is displayed after it is retrieved from the db.</p>

<p>Or am I missing something here?</p>

<p>Also don't use a float, use a decimal.  Float has all sorts of rounding issue and isn't very big.</p>
