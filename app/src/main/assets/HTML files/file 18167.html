<p>I would not store this data in the HashMap as it does not really scale if you run on multiple instances and furthermore you use a lot of memory.</p>

<p>Why do you not use some different storages like MongoDB which is also available 'in the cloud'? (e.g. www.mongohq.com).</p>

<p>If you would like to scale you need to separate the data from the processors. E.g. have x servers running your servlet (or let Google AppEngine scale this on themselves) and have the data at a different place (e.g. in a MongoDB or PostgreSQL).</p>
