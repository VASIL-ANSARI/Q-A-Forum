<p>You can find the available licences and prices <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/plugins_filemanager.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>, you won't get it for free (at least not leagaly).</p>

<p>I never used TinyBrowser, but i am sure you could write your own Tinymce plugin and include your own button to trigger the TinyBrowser.</p>
