<p>If your application does not need to compile java code, you do not need a JDK.</p>

<p>The garbage collector options are specific to Java virtual machine (JVM). JRE is a distribution of the JVM. The <code>-XX:+UseG1GC</code> is valid as an option for recent versions of Java7 and all Java8. G1 GC is supported since Java 7u4. Do not use anything older.</p>

<p>You might be interested to install the JDK as it comes with tools like:</p>

<ul>
<li>jmc</li>
<li>jvisualvm</li>
<li>jconsole</li>
<li>jstat</li>
<li>jmap/jhat</li>
<li>jinfo</li>
<li>jcmd</li>
</ul>
