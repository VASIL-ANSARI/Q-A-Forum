<p>You can create and define tables as you wish, but if you will have to use the table via a CursorAdapter that won't work without a tweak.</p>

<p>CursorAdapter: The Cursor must include a column named "_id" or this class will not work.</p>

<p>You must always issue a select col1 as _id ... to work.</p>

<p>So it's recommended to use _id in the table schema.</p>
