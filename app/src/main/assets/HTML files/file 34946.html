<p>You are using the wrong method; <code>writer.writerows()</code> expects <strong>multiple rows</strong>, but you only have <em>one</em> row. Use <code>writer.writerow()</code> (singular, no <code>s</code>) instead.</p>

<p>What happens is that because <code>writerows()</code> expects a list of rows, it treats each column in your single row as a list; the list of a unicode string is its individual characters:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(u'1000F034E2')
[u'1', u'0', u'0', u'0', u'F', u'0', u'3', u'4', u'E', u'2']
</code></pre>

<p>That's the row of columns being written out in that case.</p>

<p>If you wanted each item in the list as separate rows, then <em>wrap them in list objects</em>:</p>

<pre><code>writer.writerows([column] for column in list_diff_1)
</code></pre>
