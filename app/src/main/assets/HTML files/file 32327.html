<p>Well, it's seems the problem was with the way that I check for queued messages. If programmatically I check it like this:</p>

<pre><code>_queue.FetchAttributes();
Assert.AreEqual(count, _queue.ApproximateMessageCount);
</code></pre>

<p>then I see that all messages have been successfully added, even for <code>count &gt; 32</code>.</p>

<p>However, at Server Explorer window when hitting "View Queue", I guess what happens behind the scenes is a <code>GetMessages</code> request which <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-queues-20/#advanced-get" rel="nofollow">has a limit of 32</a>.</p>
