<p>This is directly from the documentation.   My personal experience is 24 hours for a small site.   If you see data in the real-time reports its working.  If its a brand new site it can take 48-72 hours to show data.  Other wise the following is true</p>

  <p>Processing latency is 24-48 hours. Standard accounts that send more
  than 200,000 sessions per day to Google Analytics will result in the
  reports being refreshed only once a day. This can delay updates to
  reports and metrics for up to two days. To restore intra-day
  processing, reduce the number of sessions you send to &lt; 200,000 per
  day. For Premium accounts, this limit is extended to 2 billion hits
  per month.</p>
