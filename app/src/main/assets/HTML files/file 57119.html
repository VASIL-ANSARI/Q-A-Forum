<p>The callback function is invoked everytime the on() is invoked. </p>

<p>NodeJS runs asynchronously and is non-blocking I/O. Thus when the 3rd START is finished processing, the respective END is expected on the console. </p>

<p>But Node.JS jumps ahead the code, as the END is still processing, to invoke the callback and print the next START on the console and when the END which was waiting is finished processing, it is displayed on the console.  </p>

1 disconnect END - z0w0W4scKZ8o6c4nAAAm
2 disconnect START - LLnSgRBV9NZ35mjrAAAk
3 disconnect START - djl3hyNvIwAhSEDbAAAn
2 disconnect END - LLnSgRBV9NZ35mjrAAAk
3 disconnect END - djl3hyNvIwAhSEDbAAAn
