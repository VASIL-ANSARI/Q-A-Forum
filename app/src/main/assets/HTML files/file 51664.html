<p>Just put the receiver onto the inner side of the windshield, like all navigation systems do. This should give an acuracy of about 3-6m. (when SBAS correction is available in your location) or up to 10m if not. 
If the receiver is not state of the art (combined GPS + GLONASS or BEIDOU) then you will have problem in cities, especially in urban canyons with location jumps up to 30m.<br>
This is normal. To get correct result for a GPS application within a city you need advanced algorithms. Just summing up the distance between two consecutive locations is to primitive, this never works well. Distance calculation by GPS has be answered some times her at SO. Use the search engine, to get more info at that topic.</p>

<p>Of course, set the device to GPS provider only, with maximum precision.</p>
