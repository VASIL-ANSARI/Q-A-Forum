<p>First you have to calculate the height and width of device runtime and according to those figures you need to define your percentage height and width.
You can find the height and width at runtime as following</p>

<pre><code>    displaymetrics = new DisplayMetrics();
    getWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getMetrics(displaymetrics);
    screenHeight = displaymetrics.heightPixels;
    screenWidth = displaymetrics.widthPixels;  
</code></pre>
