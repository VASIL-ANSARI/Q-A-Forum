<p>Well firstly in Chrome you don't get scroll bars at all, no matter how high the window is (because the footer is set to fixed).</p>

<p>In ie 7 you get scroll bars that appear but scroll to nothing. In ie8 the footer doesn't stay fixed properly, but you don't get scrollable scroll bars (and for some reason the background gets corrupted on my computer if I adjust the height too much).</p>

<p>Can you clarify your question a bit more, what exactly are you trying to achieve?</p>

<p>Removing height:100% from the body in ie7 makes the scroll bars go away, if that helps?</p>
