<p><code>glGetUniformBlockIndex</code> doesn't work that way. It retrieves a number that identifies that particular uniform block. It is <em>not</em> a uniform buffer binding index to be passed to <code>glBindBufferRange/Base</code>.</p>

<p>UBO binding works a lot like texture binding. You tell the program what slot to look in. With textures, you get the uniform location to the texture, then set the value of that uniform to the texture unit index. With UBOs, you get the block index for the block, the set the binding value of that block index to the uniform buffer binding point where it will look.</p>

<p>So you should take the index from <code>glGetUniformBlockIndex</code> and use <a href="http://www.opengl.org/wiki/GLAPI/glUniformBlockBinding"><code>glUniformBlockBinding</code></a> to assign to it a buffer binding point. Then bind your buffer to the binding point you assigned to the uniform block.</p>
