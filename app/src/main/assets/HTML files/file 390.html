<p>Placing the call to the impl->Purr inside the cpp file means that in the future you could do something completely different without having to change the header file. Maybe next year they discover a helper method they could have called instead and so they can change the code to call that directly and not use impl->Purr at all. (Yes, they could achieve the same thing by updating the actual impl::Purr method as well but in that case you are stuck with an extra function call that achieves nothing but calling the next function in turn)</p>

<p>It also means the header only has definitions and does not have any implementation which makes for a cleaner separation, which is the whole point of the idiom.</p>
