<p>Your code is running when the page is not a post back.</p>

<p>Try taking the code segment outside the check, and see if that was the issue for you.
(ideally, you can check using breakpoints, if your code is being accessed).</p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
        //keep this block for future use
    }

    if (QueryString.Current.Get(Constants.HTTPGet.Action) == Constants.HTTPGet.LoadImages)
    {
        divAnything.Visible= true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Always remember that if you have an action in your page, and you need the ASP.NET engine to process it, you'll need to send the page back.
In javascript, you can force a postback caling the form's submit method, or with a control that has a postback event to it.</p>

<p>i.e in JavaScript.</p>

<pre><code>document.forms["myform"].submit(); 
</code></pre>

<p>i.e in jQuery.</p>

<pre><code>$('#myForm').submit(); 
</code></pre>
