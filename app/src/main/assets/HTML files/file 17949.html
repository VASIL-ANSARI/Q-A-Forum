<p>No hash function guarantees the uniqueness of value returned.</p>

<p>It depends how small the probability of collision it can be.</p>

<p>GetHashCode() returns a 32-bit integer, which may not be enough to assume uniqueness.
Consider other algorithm such as SHA-1, SHA-2, which the length of hash is longer,  probability of collision is much lower than a 32-bit integer.</p>
