<blockquote>
  <p>An EntityManager is an inexpensive, non-threadsafe object that should be used once, for a 
  single business process, a single unit of work, and then discarded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This answers perfectly your question. Don't share EMs over threads. Use one EM for several transactions as long as those transactions are part of a <em>unit of work</em>.</p>

<p>Furthermore you can't use an EntityManger after you've <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html#close%28%29" rel="nofollow">closed</a> it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After the close method has been invoked, all methods on the EntityManager instance and any Query, TypedQuery, and StoredProcedureQuery objects obtained from it will throw the IllegalStateException.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Controller {

    private EntityManagerFactory emf;

    public void doSomeUnitOfWork(int id) {
        EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
        em.getTransaction().begin();

        CrudDao dao = new CrudDao(em);

        Entity entity = dao.get(id);
        entity.setName("James");
        dao.save(entity);

        em.getTransaction.commit();
        em.close();
    }

}
</code></pre>
