<p>This is not a very good answer, but if you want a fairly simple way of doing parallax check out skrollr. All you have to do is link the source and initialize it, and after that it is as simple as adding parameters to your elements. Also there is a very good tutorial if you just search skrollr on Google it will be one of the top hits.</p>
