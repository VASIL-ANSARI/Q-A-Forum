<p>The storage class specifier controls the <em>storage</em> and the <em>linkage</em> of your variables. These are two concepts that are different.
C specifies the following specifiers for variables: auto, extern, register, static.</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong><br />
The storage duration determines how long your variable will live in ram.<br />
There are three types of storage duration: static, automatic and dynamic.</p>

<p><em>static</em><br />
If your variable is declared at file scope, or with an extern or static specifier, it will have static storage. The variable will exist for as long as the program is executing. No execution time is spent to create these variables.</p>

<p><em>automatic</em><br />
If the variable is declared in a function, but <strong>without</strong> the extern or static specifier, it has automatic storage. The variable will exist only while you are executing the function.  Once you return, the variable no longer exist.  Automatic storage is typically done on the stack.  It is a very fast operation to create these variables (simply increment the stack pointer by the size).</p>

<p><em>dynamic</em><br />
If you use malloc (or new in C++) you are using dynamic storage.  This storage will exist until you call free (or delete). This is the most expensive way to create storage, as the system must manage allocation and deallocation dynamically.</p>

<p><strong>Linkage</strong><br />
Linkage specifies who can see and reference the variable. There are three types of linkage: internal linkage, external linkage and no linkage.</p>

<p><em>no linkage</em><br />
This variable is only visible where it was declared. Typically applies to variables declared in a function.</p>

<p><em>internal linkage</em><br />
This variable will be visible to all the functions within the file (called a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28160/multiple-classes-in-a-header-file-vs-a-single-header-file-per-class">translation unit</a>), but other files will not know it exists.</p>

<p><em>external linkage</em><br />
The variable will be visible to other translation units.  These are often thought of as "global variables".</p>

<p>Here is a table describing the storage and linkage characteristics based on the specifiers</p>
