<p><code>height: 30px;</code> is likely your issue.</p>

<p>A quick look at the default <code>.form-control</code> in my Chrome inspector shows the elements as being 34px high. You've made the <code>.form-control</code> elements too small to display the entirety of their contents.</p>

<p>In general, you should avoid explicitly setting the height of these.</p>
