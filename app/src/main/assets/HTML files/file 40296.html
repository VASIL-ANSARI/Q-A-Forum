<p>This seems to be unrelated to jwrapper. The clojure uberjar tool, lein, sometimes builds a jar that is incompatible with pack200. It only happens with certain upstream jars, and certain jdk versions (1.7).</p>

<p>A work-around is to unzip/re-zip the clojure uberjar, which fixes the directory structure. This should be done before invoking jwrapper.</p>
