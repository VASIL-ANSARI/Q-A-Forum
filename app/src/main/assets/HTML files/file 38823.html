<pre><code>is not called because it is only in Activity
</code></pre>

<p>You are actually using the support version of the <code>Activity</code> which is the <code>FragmentActivity</code> which you can call <code>onBackpressed</code> programatically.</p>

<p><strong>sample:</strong></p>

<p>You can create a method for onBackPress functionality and call it whenever you want. But Also I really think that it should be called upon pressing the back button because it is a support version of activity means it extends from <code>Activity</code> under the hood of it. </p>

<pre><code>BaseGameActivity.this.onBackPressed();
</code></pre>
