<p>So the only thing wrong here was my understanding on how table joins and JPA type ORM works (I previously worked with MyBatis so still learning JPA). It turns out even though intuitively you would think that I could add data to my team class, including an arraylist of my players and then persist it, that you can't. You have to first persist the team, then add the team to each of the players in turn and then persist them one at a time. So in essence, there is nothing wrong with this code. The problem lay between the chair and the computer. :/ It has since been corrected.</p>
