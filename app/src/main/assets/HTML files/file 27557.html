<p>PAYMENTREQUESTID is a user set value. The purpose of this field is to allow you co-relate response data for each of your parallel payments with your request data - Therefore it is good enough that this field is unique amongst multiple payment data for a given API call but random numbers should work too. See the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/express-checkout/integration-guide/ECParallelPaymens/" rel="nofollow">docs</a> for more.</p>
