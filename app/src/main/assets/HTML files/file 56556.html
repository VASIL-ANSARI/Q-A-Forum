<p>I make a temp variable to store them.. not sure if this is the correct way but it's been working for me perfectly. </p>

<pre><code> //in beginning of your function make the variable
    let _members;

    //promise chain
    .then(members=&gt; {
          //store it in the variable and you can use it later
         _members = members
    }
</code></pre>
