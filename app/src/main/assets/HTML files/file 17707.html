<p>The tutorial you linked to does not make use of the class being Serializable.</p>

<p>They might have thrown it in there to follow a general Java bean pattern, but it is not needed for writing it to a database via JDBC. You are rightly confused about this, because there is no explanation.</p>

<p>Serializable is used for ObjectOutputStream, for example to write to files or transfer the bean over the network using RMI. So for a data transport object, this is not a bad feature to support.</p>
