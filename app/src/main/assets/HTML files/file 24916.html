<p>You can add an ActionListener to a button by typing </p>

<pre><code>przyciska.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
            @Override
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ev) {
                new frameKontrastGame();                    
            }
});
</code></pre>

<p>(assuming that the code you've written in the frameKontraestGame class starts a jframe within its constructor)</p>

<p>In case you want to handle actions from more than 1 buttons then you can write another class eg. ActionHandler (or whatever name you want to give the class) which will implement the Interface ActionListener. 
Then within the actionPerformed function you can detect the button that was preesed by using the ev.getSource() (ev is your ActionEvent variable) method.</p>
