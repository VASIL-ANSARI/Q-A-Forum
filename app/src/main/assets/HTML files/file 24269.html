<p>Are you sure that the problem comes from the service and not <em>from the client</em> ?</p>

<p>Can you show us how do you call this service ?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the request of message must be protected, such as required by a contract operation ('IMyService','<a href="http://tempuri.org/" rel="nofollow">http://tempuri.org/</a>'). The
  protection must be implemented by
  ('BasicHttpBinding','<a href="http://tempuri.org/" rel="nofollow">http://tempuri.org/</a>') binding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As said <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.servicecontractattribute.protectionlevel.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the binding does not support security (such as BasicHttpBinding),
  the effective System.Net.Security.ProtectionLevel is
  ProtectionLevel.None for the whole contract. The result is that
  depending upon the endpoint binding, clients can require different
  message or transport level security protection even when the contract
  specifies ProtectionLevel.None.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This error message suggests you are calling the service with a basicHttpBinding with no ProtectionLevel.</p>

<p>Also, the contract in your Web.config <code>IMyServiceName</code> is not the same that in your code 'IMyService' or in the error message. </p>
