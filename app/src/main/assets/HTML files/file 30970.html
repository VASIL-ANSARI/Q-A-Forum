<p>The current set of Environment properties that you can access in your App Engine application is given over <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/#Java_The_environment" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I don't think there is a property that refers to what you are trying to get.</p>

<p>However, I would suggest that you print out the request headers in the incoming request object, there could be something that could give you the hint there:</p>

<pre><code>Enumeration headers = req.getHeaderNames();
while (headers.hasMoreElements()) {
    String name = (String)headers.nextElement();
    String value = req.getHeader(name);
    resp.getWriter().println(String.format("%s: %s", name, value));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, I would suggest to look at the Backend API. This should give values of particular interest to you too: <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/backends/BackendService" rel="nofollow">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/backends/BackendService</a></p>
