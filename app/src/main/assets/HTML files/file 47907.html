<p>Yes, there is a chance that some applications won't work. I upgraded from 5.3 to 5.4 on a system and found that a bug appeared in production code. It wasn't anything that couldn't be fixed. Of course, there have been other times where an upgrade worked flawlessly.</p>

<p>If you install 5.5 on the system without disturbing the 5.3 installation then it should be possible to rollback to 5.3 if needed. Just save the server configuration for 5.3 before pointing it to 5.5.</p>
