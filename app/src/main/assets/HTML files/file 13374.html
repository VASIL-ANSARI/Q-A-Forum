<p>There's a discussion about it in the forums.  <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/features-and-requests/android-for-pi?value=android&amp;type=1&amp;include=3&amp;search=1&amp;ret=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/features-and-requests/android-for-pi?value=android&amp;type=1&amp;include=3&amp;search=1&amp;ret=all</a></p>

<p>The end result is that some versions might be able to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The consensus in the forum is that Ice Cream Sandwich requires too much CPU and RAM to be able to run on the Raspi. <em>Some of the older versions might work at an acceptable speed</em>. </p>

<p>However, no such effort has been invested:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I have said before, if <em>someone want[s] to put Android on the Pi they are more than welcome. It won't be easy, and the benefits are pretty small for the effort involved</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And is viewed as some as simply being outside the scope of the Pi, meaning there will be little foundation support:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Android simply does not further the goals of the foundation â it"s totally orthogonal to them.</em> It is an OS designed for passive consumption of media and targetted advertising delivery.</p>
