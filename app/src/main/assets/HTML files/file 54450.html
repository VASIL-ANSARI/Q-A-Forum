<p>The stack trace clearly states that there is a class in the tree that is not serializable: <code>com.cogentautomation.view.ViewMain$23</code>. You have to read this path like this: <code>com.cogentautomation.view.ViewMain</code> is the outer class, and the <code>$23</code> denotes the 23rd anonymous inner class. Since there are a lot anonymous classes in <code>ViewMain</code>, you may have a difficult time figuring out which class it is.</p>

<p>Easiest thing to do, would be to install the JDK (get the sources of "java") and set an exception breakpoint <code>at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.writeObject0(Unknown Source)</code>.</p>

<p>On a side note, this kind of GUI will make your life difficult in the future. As you can see, debugging is more difficult of the massive amount of anonymous classes in one file and the file length must be excruciating long. I suggest that you apply a few techniques to slim down <code>ViewMain</code> like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern" rel="nofollow">Command-Pattern</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern" rel="nofollow">Chain of Command</a>. There are more, maybe you spend some time on Wikipedia to get to know them.</p>
