<p>From the looks of it you should be able to get away with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$data = "Your JSON input";
$decoded = json_decode( $data );
// Take a look at your data:
var_dump( $decoded );
// Keep in mind that source is an array and will be
// returned as one but it contains objects.
$server_name = $decoded-&gt;data-&gt;source[ 0 ]-&gt;server_name;
// Note that json_decode will return an object by default
// you may pass in a boolean true as second argument to
// make it return an assoc array.
$decoded = json_decode( $data, true );
$server_name = $decoded[ 'data' ][ 'source' ][ 0 ][ 'server_name' ];
</code></pre>

<p>Or is this one of the approaches you tried earlier?</p>

<p>Pass in your input into <a href="https://de.functions-online.com/json_decode.html" rel="nofollow">an online version of json_decode</a> and have a look at what it returns, then work your way through.
That plus var_dump and print_r are your best friends when you deal with data structures you cant wrap your head around.</p>
