<p>You can place all the text in a <code>div</code> (or any block level element you'd like to use), set it to a fixed size and then put <code>overflow: hidden;</code> on it. You could also use <code>text-overflow: ellipsis;</code> and the browser will display <code>...</code> where it truncates the text - if it supports it.</p>

<pre><code>#synopsis {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;   
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could possibly end up with a lot of superfluous text which would only serve to increase the size of your HTML which needs to be downloaded.</p>
