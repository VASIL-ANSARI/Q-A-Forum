<p>Every time <code>drawbox</code> is called in your program, you're creating a new set of rectangles and then drawing them on top of the old rectangles.  As time goes on, you're drawing more and more rectangles (even though it doesn't look like it since the new rectangles are being drawn above the old ones).  Also note that with the way your program is written, you're bleeding memory.</p>

<p>The way to fix this is to create the rectangles on the first go-around and then update them on the subsequent passes using <code>canvas.itemconfig(rectangle_id,fill=color)</code>.  I've posted an (ugly) modification to your <code>drawbox</code> below which accomplishes this.</p>

<pre><code>def drawbox(m,_rectangles={}):
    if(_rectangles):
        myrectangles=_rectangles
    else:
        myrectangles={}

    for y in range(nRows):
        for x in range(nCols):
            if m[y][x]:
                color = '#00FF00'
            else:
                color = '#000000'
            if(not _rectangles):
                cid=canvas.create_rectangle(CELL_SIZE*x,
                                            CELL_SIZE*y,
                                            CELL_SIZE*x+CELL_SIZE,
                                            CELL_SIZE*y+CELL_SIZE,
                                            fill=color,
                                            outline="#000000", width=1)
                myrectangles[(y,x)]=cid
            else:
                canvas.itemconfig(_rectangles[(y,x)],fill=color)

    if(not _rectangles):
      _rectangles.update(myrectangles)
</code></pre>
