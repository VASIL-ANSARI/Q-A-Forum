<p>This happens because although you have <code>IPlugIn</code> decorated with <code>InheritedExportAttribute</code> you also decorate the plugin with the <code>ExportAttribute</code>. The catalog will match both of these and hence export twice. You need just one of the two approaches. Either keep the <code>InheritedExportAttribute</code> and do not decorate any implementation with the <code>ExportAttribute</code> or decorate all implementations with <code>ExportAttribute</code> and remove the <code>InheritedExportAttribute</code> from the interface.</p>

<p>I haven't figured out why <code>DirectoryCatalog</code> cannot load the plugin assembly on Mono. On CLR is works correctly as you mentioned.</p>
