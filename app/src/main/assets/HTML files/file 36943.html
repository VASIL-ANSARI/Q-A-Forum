<p>This is easy to change :</p>

<pre><code>.logo-sponsor{
    z-index: 1000;
    position: absolute;
    top: -200px;
    left: 20px;
</code></pre>

<p>But seriously, it's a bad idea to try to compose a logo like this : it's so much easier, and more powerful, to use an image. You could also use a character for this shape : â¬</p>
