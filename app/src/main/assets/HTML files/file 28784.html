<p>Yes!</p>

<p>Having been in the same position (more than once sadly) I can say that it is well worth it - if you come back to one of your projects in 6 months time - you'll look at that old code and wonder what the heck you were trying to do. Also, you may want to send examples of your work to prospective employers at some point, and if they look at code which is sloppy - it doesnt look good. Worse yet, if they look at the code and see two wildly different styles (sloppy vs neat) they will think you plagiarised the code.</p>

<p>You will also (most likely) find that rewriting those 4k lines of code, results in far fewer lines of code. Or, that it results in code that is far more reusable. Try to think about DRY when you recode (dont repeat yourself) if you use something more than once, make it a function or a class. </p>

<p>Also, you will save LOTS of time in the future when you come to extend/change your work.</p>
