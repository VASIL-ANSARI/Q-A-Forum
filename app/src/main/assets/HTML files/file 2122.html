<p>What an absolutely amazing problem! It even works in Quirks mode but not IE7 Standards.</p>

<p>I first focused on the #content margin but changing it would give different results, then I moved to the footer with no much success, tried the #content_top_left and nothing.  Then I returned to the #content and eliminated any left/right margin.</p>

<p>Although you can fix this, it won't be as clean as you probably expected. Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#content 
{
    <b>margin: 80px 0 50px 0;</b>
    position: relative;
    <b>padding: 0 10px 0 10px;</b>
}<br />#content_top_left 
{
    position: absolute;
    width: 7px;
    height: 7px;
    top: 0;
    <b>left: 10px;</b>
    background-color: rgb(40, 40, 40);
}</code></pre>

<p>I dot not know details of your implementation for backgrounds and things like that in the #content container, so an extra padding can be a problem, the 10px left on the corner is aligned with the left padding on the container. </p>
