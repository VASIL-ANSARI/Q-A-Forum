<p>You could try wrapping each one of the original divs in a container, skewing the containers with the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/" rel="nofollow">transform</a> CSS3 property (check skewX and skewY) and skew the content div in the opposite direction (this way you keep the content non-skewed). </p>

<p>After that, perhaps <code>overflow:hidden</code> and some toying around with margins/paddings could finally do the trick.</p>
