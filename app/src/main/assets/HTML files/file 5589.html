<p>Is that really the Python interpreter installed by macports? 2.6.1 smells like the Apple provided one to me (2.6.1 is quite old).</p>

<p>try, </p>

<pre><code>which python
</code></pre>

<p>As an aside, I wouldn't install Django using macports.</p>

<p>EDIT: Macports installed 2.6.6, the problem is the apple provided python is earlier on your path.</p>

<pre><code>python26 @2.6.6_0+no_tkinter (active)
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I use python from homebrew, which by default goes in /usr/local/bin/python.</p>

<p>To use this, I have a line in my .bashrc, but it could go at the end of your /etc/profile</p>

<pre><code>export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
</code></pre>

<p>What that does is prepends my system path with location of my homebrew installs (/usr/local)</p>

<p>In your case, it should be where your macports python (the 2.6.6 one) can be found. </p>

<p>HTH</p>
