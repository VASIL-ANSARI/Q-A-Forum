<p>Are you referring to @autoreleasepool?</p>

<p>You can use @autoreleasepool in an app with a build target of iOS 4.3.x if you are using Xcode 4.2 and the iOS 5 SDK. Despite the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/ipad/#releasenotes/ObjectiveC/RN-TransitioningToARC/_index.html" rel="nofollow">transitioning to ARC guidelines</a> stating that "ARC introduces a statement construct to the Objective-C grammar" in @autoreleasepool, which might suggest ARC is required, it goes on to say that, "This syntax is available in all Objective-C modes."</p>

<p>While I don't think that's particularly clear documentation, what this means is that you can use the @autoreleasepool syntax both with and without ARCâif you're using the iOS 5 SDK.</p>
