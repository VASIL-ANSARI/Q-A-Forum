<p>So I solved this:</p>

<p>The problem was in my SubdomainHelpers file </p>

<pre><code>module SubdomainHelpers
  def within_account_subdomain
    ### This Line Is the original line
    let(:subdomain_url) { 'http://#{account.subdomain}.example.com' }

    ### Changed it to this
    let(:subdomain_url) { "http://#{account.subdomain}.example.com" }

    before { Capybara.default_host = subdomain_url }
    after { Capybara.default_host = 'http://www.example.com' }
    yield
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason using single quotes was keeping <code>account.subdomain</code> as a string; as soon as I changed to double quotes the test passed! </p>

<p>Thanks. </p>
