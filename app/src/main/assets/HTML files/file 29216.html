<p>If I understood you correctly, you want the user (<em>any</em> user who has the app) to see some data in your app, but not to be able to download it directly. This means that at the same time, you want the user to have access to the data and not have access to the data, which is obviously not possible. The content industry has tried and failed with countless DRM schemes. What you can do (and what DRM does) is make getting the data more annoying.</p>

<p>Users can get the URL by sniffing (intercepting) traffic. To prevent this, you should use SSL, and include an additional check to restrict the SSL certificates that will be allowed. This will prevent the user from installing his own CA on the phone and then using MitM tools to get the URL.</p>

<p>Then you need to hide the URL/key/whatever you use to distinguish your app from an evil user with a browser as deep in your app as possible. Certainly hide it in the code, and make sure to use ProGuard to make it harder to read.</p>

<p>Also, use a custom User Agent, custom HTTP headers and other fun stuff, check it server-side returning a generic error message so the attacker doesn't know how you found out he isn't using your app, and hide the code that adds these all over your app. (Some of these things can be set using static calls, so you can hide it nearly anywhere.)</p>
