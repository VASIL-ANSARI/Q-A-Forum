<p>First see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9913626/hadoop-easy-way-to-have-object-as-output-value-without-writable-interface?rq=1">Hadoop: Easy way to have object as output value without Writable interface</a> you can use Java serialization OR</p>

<p>See <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module5.html</a> you need to make your own write and read function, its quite simple as inside can call the API to read and write int, flaot, string etc</p>

<p>Your example with Writable (need to import it)</p>

<pre><code>public class ScoreDoc implements java.io.Serializable, Writable  {      
    /** The score of this document for the query. */
    public float score;//... as in above

  public void write(DataOutput out) throws IOException {
      out.writeInt(score);
      out.writeInt(doc);
      out.writeInt(shardIndex);
  }

  public void readFields(DataInput in) throws IOException {
      score = in.readInt();
      doc = in.readInt();
      shardIndex = in.readInt();    
  }

  //rest toStirng etc
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note : order of write and read should be the same or value of one will go to other, and if you have different types will get serialization errors on read</p>
