<p>You should not use a <code>foreach</code> statement with a COM object, as a reference is made behind the scenes to which you have no control over releasing. I would switch to a <code>for</code> loop and make sure you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/158706/how-to-properly-clean-up-excel-interop-objects-in-c">never use two dots with COM objects.</a></p>

<p>The way this would look would be:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    manager = new ComObjectClass();
    ComObject comObject = null;
    ComObject[] collectionOfComItems = manager.GetCollectionOfItems();
    try
    {
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; collectionOfComItems.Count; i++)
        {
            comObject = collectionOfComItems[i];
            ReleaseComObject(comObject);
        }
    }            
    finally
    {
        ReleaseComObject(comObject);
    }
}
finally 
{
    ReleaseComObject(manager);
}
</code></pre>
