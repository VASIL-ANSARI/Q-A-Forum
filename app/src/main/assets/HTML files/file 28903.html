<p>Trick here is selecting result of joining into intermediate data type (row) which will be grouped later:</p>

<pre><code>from bc in db.BookCopies
join b in db.Books on bc.bookId equals b.id
join a in db.Authors on b.authorId equals a.id
join p in db.Publishers on bc.publisherId equals p.id
where bc.sold == 0
select new { bc.id, b.title, author = a.name, publisher = p.name } into row
group row by new { row.title, row.author, row.publisher } into g
select new {
   id = g.Min(x =&gt; x.id),
   g.Key.title,
   g.Key.author,
   g.Key.publisher
}
</code></pre>

<p>This produces exactly same query you are looking for.</p>
