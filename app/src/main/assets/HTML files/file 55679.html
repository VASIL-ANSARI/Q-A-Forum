<p>Notice that pyplot has the concept of the current figure and the current axes. All plotting commands apply to the current axes. So, make sure you plot in the right axes. Here is a WME.</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.loglog(range(100), 'b-',marker='o')

plt.savefig('test.png')     # apply to the axes `ax`
</code></pre>
