<p>YES!</p>

<p>It was a $PATH problem, as i ran <code>echo $PATH</code> on php i got a smaller list then i got on my ssh session.</p>

<p>So to solve it in my case i used full path towards cec-client
which was:
<code>/opt/xbmc-bcm/xbmc-bin/bin/cec-client</code></p>

<p>as that was the only cec-client i could find...</p>

<p>Hope this helps others!</p>

<p>Would someone please help me by telling me how to make my php session <code>$path</code> include the path towards my <code>cec-client</code>
as i dont want to use the full dir all the time.</p>
