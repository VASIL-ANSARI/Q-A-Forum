<p>Its the same like any other datatype. By default, local variables contain garbage values. So, you initialize it if you will be reading its value. But if you know that you will be writing to the variable, than you can skip the initialization part.</p>

<p>For eg:</p>

<pre><code>char a[20]; //local variable
</code></pre>

<p>contains garbage, so you need to write some meaningful data to it before reading it. But if you are just writing to it, then you can skip the initialization.</p>
