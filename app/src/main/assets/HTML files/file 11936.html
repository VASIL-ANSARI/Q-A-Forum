<p>Are you sure that you <strong>really</strong> need to invoke click of parent control? In general it would be, in my opinion, a code smell if you will do something like that - especially when it requires some strange constructions.</p>

<p>If you need to react in a same way when clicking on panel and on any child control inside the panel, it should be enough just to call the same method from two event handlers (that is from event handler of parent panel and event handler of child control. If you need, for example, mouse pointer location inside parent panel, you can easily calculate the position of mouse pointer using, for example, PointToScreen() and PointToClient() methods.</p>
