<p>When you declare your variable <code>image</code>, give it an initial value.</p>

<pre><code>string image = "";
</code></pre>

<p>The error you are getting indicates that the variable has not been initialized in all cases (it only gets initialized if <code>cond</code> is true).</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with being contained in a .aspx page.  You will get the same error in a code behind.</p>
