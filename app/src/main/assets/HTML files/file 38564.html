<p>Can you correctly connect to the database? You said you are using MYSQL database but I see you are using MS Access ODBC driver for the connection. If that is the case I recommend you use the MYSQL JDBC driver which you can download from</p>

<p>If you can connect to the database correctly, then you may have not set your database schema (database name) properly.

<p>For an example of how you should configure db using pure JDBC have a look at this link:

<p>Basically you provide a connection url in the format <code>jdbc:mysql://[MySQLServer_DOMAIN_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS]:[PORT]/[DB_NAME]</code>.</p>
