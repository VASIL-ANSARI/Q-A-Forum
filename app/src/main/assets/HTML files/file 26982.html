<p>If I understood you correctly (which I'm not sure), you seem to want to have a 3d array representing points at certain coordinates contained in your list. If it is what you want to do:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; lst.Count; i++)
    array_t[lst[i].a, lst[i].b, lst[i].c] = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>the rest of your array would be filled with zeros.</p>
