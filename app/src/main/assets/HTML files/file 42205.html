<p>I fixed the issue. It was a silly mistake of mine.
Eventhough I compiled the library with the new function,  I didnt add it to the testing environment.
The testing environment had the older version of the library without the new function API</p>

<p>But quite surprised that the fucntion call didnt crash the program, or show any signs of problems</p>
