<p>If you vant to differenciate the two quaternion just use the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/html/classOgre_1_1Quaternion.html#a9c516d6b499410b2fc72524026d3a124" rel="nofollow">ToAngleAxis</a> of the delta quaternion. It returns the angle (you need this) and the axix of the rotation between the two quaternions.</p>

<p>You can use quaternions and the calculated speed to calculate <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/html/classOgre_1_1Quaternion.html#ab0c47f1a7308ac4c17db9f9ddb6e4a72" rel="nofollow">spherical interpolation</a> (slerp for short), which allows you to calculate intermediate states for your camera orientation.</p>
