<p>So I took a gander at the codepen and your element is still there, its just at the top. Since your actual parent container isn't moving nor is it postion relative the sidebar will be position in relation to the page.</p>

<p>You can see this when you inspect it and scroll down, as soon as it 'disappears' its actually at the top of the page, you cannot see it because you are too far down.</p>

<p>What do you need it to do though? Hope this helps! :)</p>
