<p><code>EndReceive</code> just means that the message was successfully delivered - it doesn't imply anything about whether you were able to do anything worthwhile with it.</p>

<p>It sounds like you're contemplating an asynchronous transactional read from MSMQ, in which you would only finalize the receipt (remove the message from the queue once and for all) upon fully handling your message, whatever that might mean in your context. But asynchronous transactional reads aren't possible - see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/43h44x53.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not use the asynchronous call
  BeginReceive with transactions. If you
  want to perform a transactional
  asynchronous operation, call
  BeginPeek, and put the transaction and
  the (synchronous) Receive method
  within the event handler you create
  for the peek operation.</p>
