<p>Here is your issue:</p>

<pre><code>Intent openMenu = new Intent("com.mysterygame.au.Menu");
          startActivity(openMenu); } } };
</code></pre>

<p>It should be:</p>

<pre><code>Intent openMenu = new Intent(Pentagram.this, Menu.class);
startActivity(openMenu); } } };
</code></pre>

<p>When you are using <code>Intent</code>, you need to insert the class name as I did above, not the way you did. You basically include the current Activity you are in, and the one you want to start, which is why you use <code>Pentagram.this</code> (the Activity you are in) and <code>Menu.class</code> the Activity you want to start. </p>

<p>Good luck. </p>
