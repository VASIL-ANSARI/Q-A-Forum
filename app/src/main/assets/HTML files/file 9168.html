<p>You definitely don't need the second <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code>. You can replace it by <code>EXIST</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select distinct CL.ClientID, NL.Name from CL CL 
inner join PR PR on CL.ClientID = PR.ClientID 
WHERE EXISTS 
(SELECT 1 from TabFields where WBT1=PR.WBS1 AND custInclude = 'Y' and WBT2 = '') 
and PR.WBT2 = '' order by NL.Name
</code></pre>

<p>And I don't see <code>NL</code> in <code>FROM /JOIN</code>. Did you miss it or it's supposed to be <code>CL</code>?</p>
