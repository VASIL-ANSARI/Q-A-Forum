<p>I suggest you to throw away whole <code>while</code> styling if it's not necessary - <em>especially</em> that one in <code>main_loop</code>, which is just checking values. It's not good in kivy if you really don't need that functionality e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>while &lt;some list&gt;:
    value = &lt;some list&gt;.pop()
    # do something
</code></pre>

<p>and even here are ways how to do it differently. As inclement suggested, using <code>Clock</code> is the right way. Also a little <em>wrong</em> detail in that particular loop is this:</p>

<pre><code>while True:
    Clock.schedule_interval(self.incrementi, 5.0)
</code></pre>

<p>This will schedule interval infinitely many times, which will basically either freeze your app when you run this function or (if run in Thread) cause an endless loop/freeze + create a big memory eater = it will forbid you to <code>Thread.set()</code> i.e. stopping the thread and exiting the app correctly and in the end will crash.</p>

<p>I hope it's typo, because you only need to put it above <code>while</code> loop. Another thing: <code>decrementcounter</code>... It's in a <code>while</code> loop, it'll again create multiple Clocks and cause troubles. The same thing - again, put it either above the loop to make it work.</p>

<p>Basically <code>while</code> with <code>time.sleep(t)</code> is <code>Clock.schedule_interval(some_function, t)</code>. It's nice that you want to check for something, but with each <code>Clock.schedule_*</code> you create another clock and I don't see anything that stops it. So basically you'll create infinitely many clocks.</p>

<p>Something more similar to <code>while</code> only(without sleep) is <code>Clock.schedule_interval(some_function)</code> i.e. you leave out time parameter and it'll call the function on each frame which if <code>60fps</code>, then 60times per second. Quite precise for a simple value checking.</p>
