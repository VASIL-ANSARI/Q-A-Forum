<p>In your case, I would just extend a preferable ViewGroup, inflate an XML - for styling and positioning Views - into it, grab an access to those View, add all relevant set/get methods, and that's it.
If relevant, you can also define attributes for your component to adjust its custom functionalities while using it in XMLs.</p>
