<p><strong>Update</strong> You are invoking the <code>readSpecification</code> method when the object is constructed, that is before you have chosen a file. Move the line</p>

<pre><code>String modelSpec = readSpecification();
</code></pre>

<p>into the <code>openModelActionPerformed</code> method.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Old answer based on incomplete information</strong> <br>The message of <code>FileNotFoundException</code> should include the name of the file that was not found. Since it's not there, the program must be using the empty string <code>""</code> as the file name, which also happens to be the default value you gave for the <code>filename</code> variable. This suggests that you may be using a local variable for this assignment:</p>

<pre><code>filename = f.getAbsolutePath();
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure that you use the right variable.</p>

<p>To verify, check which file you're trying to open before opening:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("Trying to open ["+filename+"]");
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename));
</code></pre>
