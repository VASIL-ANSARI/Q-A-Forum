<p>There's all kinds of reasons that dominators are interesting in program analysis, whether you are doing reverse engineering as a special case or not.</p>

<p>The key notion is that if X dominates Y,  when Y gets executed, X has been already executed.  So if you want to understand what Y is doing, and Y depends on the context in which it is executed, you're probably going to need to understand X.</p>

<p>There are other things you need to understand, too, such as dataflows into Y, program inputs, etc.   Just this is a useful place to start.</p>

<p>There are lots of analysis algorithms that use dominators, each answer specific kinds of questions.  Its hard to argue any of these are "the (key) role" dominators play.</p>
