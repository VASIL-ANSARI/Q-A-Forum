<p>That's actually a feature of MigLayout, if I recall correctly.  If you don't want this I am sure you could so configure MigLayout.  Otherwise, you could use a different layout manager (but I still highly recommend a table-based one) which uses constant spacing for all platforms (such as my <a href="http://www.softwaremonkey.org/Code/MatrixLayout" rel="nofollow">MatrixLayout</a>).  </p>
