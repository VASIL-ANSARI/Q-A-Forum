<p>(1) What you are most probably looking for it the matplotlib text command. Have a look at <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html</a> section working with text. It might be convenient to create two separate axes, so you can truly put the text below the whole figure. Maybe it is enough to place the text at xlabel position? </p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.xlabel('yourtext')
</code></pre>

<p>(2) There are already good answers out there that might help you: e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16896341/how-to-change-the-pylab-window-background-color">How to change the pylab window background color?</a>
As for the color of the axis <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4761623/changing-the-color-of-the-axis-ticks-and-labels-for-a-plot-in-matplotlib">Changing the color of the axis, ticks and labels for a plot in matplotlib</a></p>
