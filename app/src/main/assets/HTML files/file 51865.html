<p>Yeah. Check locking - 2 makes NO SENSE because multiple queries CAN execute at the same time, unless someone was challenged in not using exclusive or serializing locking for reporting (which should have READCOMITTED hints on the queries).</p>

<p>Generally find the issue. From your question it is not even clear whether it is SQL Server that is bottlenecking - can it be your excel use on the server (which, btw., is totally NOT SUPPORTED - running office on a server) is inherently single threaded? Why do you even blame SQL Server given the information you give, which indicates no real debug hints (as can be seen on the attempt to blame GB or reindexing both which will not result in any paralellism on the SQL side to start with). WIth the same reasonin you give I can advice you to eat vegan from now on and check whether it increases reporting performance. That is as sensible as just changing debug attribute or maxdop for something that incidentally should not happen like that to start with.</p>

<p>Start with analysis. Find out whether your SQL Server is even to blame. MAXDOP should always be configured to sensible value. Timeout? Seems your queries are POORLY OPTIMIZED. Unless you do what I do - which is stastistical analysis over a 3 billion row table - you should not have a serious issue IF your queries are sensible. This indicates serious query issues.</p>
