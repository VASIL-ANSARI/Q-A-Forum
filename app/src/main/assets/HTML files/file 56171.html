<p>Update: You can just use this script I threw together to fix your IPA so it's properly formatted, download the <a href="https://github.com/jamesbar2/auto-ipa-packager" rel="nofollow">Auto IPA Packager</a> on Github. It's a simplification of the IPA Packager I reference below, and handles all of the steps below too.  </p>

<p>So, I've finally made it submit properly to the App Store, just had to hop through a few more steps than I expected.  A lot of my confusion was because I didn't want to leave out other artifacts.  I've decided to list the process here so it's very clear for anybody deploying an iOS app in the future that needs to use this tool.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/bq/ipa-packager" rel="nofollow">IPA Packager</a> from GitHub.</li>
<li>Then go to Xamarin Studio, and Build > Archive for Publishing.</li>
<li>I've been using XCode to export my archives.  Open XCode, Window > Organizer.  Find your app archive, and click "Export" and follow the appropriate steps, then save it.</li>
<li>Locate the .ipa file and change it to .zip, and extract it.</li>
<li>Next, in the extracted files, locate the "AppNameFolder > Payload > AppName.app".</li>
<li><p>Load terminal and execute the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sh package_ipa.sh /AppNameFolder/Payload/AppName.app /AppNameFolder/AppName.ipa</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>AppName.ipa should now be created.  This file should be ready to upload to the App Store.  However, if your AppNameFolder has a "Symbols" directory you should follow the additional steps below...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optional:</strong> If you have symbol files, you should change the AppName.ipa to AppName.zip and extract the files.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the "AppNameFolder > Symbols" directory into the extracted AppName folder, then zip the contents of the folder and change the extension back to .ipa.</p></li>
</ol>
