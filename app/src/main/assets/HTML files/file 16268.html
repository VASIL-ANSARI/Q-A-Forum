<p>It seems that there has been a lot of jquery parallax related answers.</p>

<p>I played around with it on jsfiddle:

<p>The trick to parallax is that the further back it is, it takes the same time to move a shorter distance. While I don't have any specific equation for setting them up, it can be done with a little work.</p>

<p>The irregular background won't be bothered by the animation of the child elements.</p>

<p>Looking at the sidebar here, it seems there are a lot of answers for parallax jquery, though some of it seems based around the nikebetterworld example, which is not what I think you're looking for.</p>
