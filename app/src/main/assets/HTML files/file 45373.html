<p>Bootstrap isn't designed to have a fixed width column.  It is designed around percentage column widths.</p>

<p>However, you can use create media queries that follow Bootstrap's use of them.  For "tablet" sized devices, Bootstrap sets the overall container to fixed width of 768px, like below.</p>

<pre><code>@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        width:750px
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can make use of this knowledge to create two classes that divide the layout into two columns.  One for with of content and one for the ads.</p>

<pre><code>@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .col-left-width{
    width: 625px;
  }
  .col-right-width{
    width: 120px;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to have a fixed right column width of 120px.  But as the size of the screen changes, you can redefine the "left" column width to </p>

<pre><code>Container Width - 120 - Padding.
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the left column would be set to 625px.</p>
