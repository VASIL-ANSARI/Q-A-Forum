<p>I think the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Miscellaneous/Foundation_Functions/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000055-BCIJBHDC" rel="nofollow">assertion handler</a> prints that message <strong>before</strong> raising the exception.  If that's not it, <code>STAssertThrows()</code> probably ignores assertion failures.</p>

<p>In any case, why are you testing that NSAssert works?  Do you not trust the Cocoa framework?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Just noticed the second part to your question.  The answer is no, you should not be using STAssertThrows and NSAssert together in this way.  <code>NSAssert()</code> is there to pick up cases of programming error where an assumption of the programmer is false.  By definition, a piece of code that asserts has failed its test case.</p>
