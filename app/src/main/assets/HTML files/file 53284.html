<p>If you use include jQuery, all you need to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>$("td:nth-of-type(3), td:nth-of-type(4)").hide();
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a fork of your Fiddle: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/ccbsa9z3/2/" rel="nofollow">https://jsfiddle.net/ccbsa9z3/2/</a></p>

<p>You can also do the same thing with CSS, although I'm assuming you need to do this programmatically. With CSS, it's the following:</p>

<pre><code>td:nth-of-type(3), td:nth-of-type(4) {
    display: none;
}
</code></pre>
