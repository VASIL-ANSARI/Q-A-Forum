<p>Well, if you just want to take static pages, you could use a downloader like <a href="http://www.httrack.com/" rel="nofollow">HTTrack</a>, which allows you to create a static web site for offline use.  It would still show editor features, but because there is no code on the end, it wouldn't work.  Do you want this as a one time thing, or do you want your php scripts to update this "zip" realtime/nightly?</p>
