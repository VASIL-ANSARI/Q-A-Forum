<p>Watch out this line <code>document.getElementById('xWinCount');</code> is not assigned to a variable seems you want to <code>xWinCount = document.getElementById('xWinCount');</code> same for <code>oWinCount</code></p>

<p>You will have the element which <code>innerHTML</code> must be holding your current score, and yeah later you can modify or increment its value.</p>
