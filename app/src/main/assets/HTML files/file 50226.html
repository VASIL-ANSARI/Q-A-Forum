<p>You are trying to use variables which are not defined inside the scope of your area() function.</p>

<p>Within the area() function, we have size and price that are not defined. You pass in the size variable from your main(), but it is then renamed to diameter, and this diameter variable isn't used.</p>

<p>You should also pass the price variable, since you need it for your calculations.</p>

<pre><code>def area(diameter, price):
    radius = diameter / 2
    area = (radius**2) * math.pi
    finalprice = cost(price, area) / area
    return finalprice
</code></pre>

<p>Also, be careful with integer division when calculating finalprice (and in your cost function)... This can lead to mistakes in your calculations.</p>
