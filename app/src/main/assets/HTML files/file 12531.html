<p>You have to create your own certificate to release your app in the Market. If you're using eclipse follow this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Right-click on your project > Android Tools > Export Signed Application Package...</li>
<li>If your project is chosen, press next.</li>
<li>Select: Create new keystore, set the path and password, press next</li>
<li>Fill the form, (Validity = 1000), next</li>
<li>Save the APK somewhere and press finish</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important</strong>
Save the keystore where you always find it and make a backup somewhere. You need this keystore to update your app. If you lose it you won't be able to update your app anymore. Not even Google can help you, if you lose it. So make a backup on your hard drive, online, external hard drive, ... This is a very important file.</p>
