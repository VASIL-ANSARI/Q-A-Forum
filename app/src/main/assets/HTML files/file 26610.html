<p>Chances are you that you do not catch the event at all if the preventDefault doesn't work. If you want to be sure, place an alert in your event handler.</p>

<pre><code>$("a.ajax-link").on("click", function(e) {
    alert('Event handler was fired');
    e.preventDefault();
    $("#main_content").load(this.href);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Also, use $.ajax() if you need to pass information to the server along with your request and $.load() if the server doesn't require any information to display the desired output.</p>
