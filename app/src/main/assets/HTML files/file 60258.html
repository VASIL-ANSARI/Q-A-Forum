<p>The JOIN portion is unnecessary given your example above, but in the event that you actually only want records that are included in the first table, you could do an <code>INNER JOIN</code> like so.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT tb.UniqueID, MIN(DATE) as [Date] FROM [Table B] tb
INNER JOIN [Table_A] ta ON ta.[Unique ID] = tb.UniqueID
GROUP BY tb.UniqueID
</code></pre>

<p>I've used your table and column names, despite the lack of naming consistency, and the fact that your tables and columns have spaces in them. (Personally, I'd advise against this in any SQL implementation, but that's a separate issue.)</p>

<p>Without the join you'd just need to do...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT UniqueID, MIN(DATE) as [Date] FROM [Table B]
GROUP BY UniqueID
</code></pre>
