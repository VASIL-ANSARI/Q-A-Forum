<p>I work at <a href="https://stormpath.com" rel="nofollow">Stormpath</a>.  The API Key authentication feature, where accounts are issued API keys, is meant to be used for server-to-server clients, not web browser clients.  As such, API Keys are meant to be used with HTTP Basic Authentication or to be exchanged for OAuth2 access tokens.  Both of those strategies are described in this documentation:</p>

<p>Web browser clients are meant to use the <code>/login</code> endpoint, and they receive an Oauth2 access and refresh token in response (we store these in secure cookies).  This is a special nuance of express-stormpath.  You can do a proper OAuth2 password exchange by using the oauth/token endpoint, that is also described here:</p>

<p>I hope this answer helps!</p>
