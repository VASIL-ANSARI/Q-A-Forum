<p>There are two different questions here - how to grab frames from an OpenGL application, and how to turn them into a movie file.</p>

<p>The first question is easy enough; you just grab each frame with glReadPixels() (via a PBO if you need the performance).</p>

<p>The second question is a little harder since the cross-platform solutions (ffmpeg) tend to be GPL'd or LGPL'd. Is LGPL acceptable for your project? The Windows way of doing this (DirectShow) is a bit of a headache to use.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since LGPL is ok and you can use ffmpeg, see <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/texmex/people/dufouil/ffmpegdoxy/apiexample_8c-source.html#l00190" rel="nofollow">here</a> for an example of how to encode video.</p>
