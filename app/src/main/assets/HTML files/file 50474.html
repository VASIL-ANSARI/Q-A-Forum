<p>AFAIK, Lucene never writes by random positioning. This would be costly to do so. Even if you update an existing document, it deletes the document and creates new one with updates applied. And deleted document sits there but marked as deleted in bitset data structure. Whenever merge happens or flush happens it will get deleted from index. This way lucene avoids writing to random position in file. So always appends to the existing file if it needs to write. </p>

<p>For reading it needs to do seek to read correct block of data while searching for looking up posting lists and so on. </p>
