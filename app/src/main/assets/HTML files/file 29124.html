<p>The answer I found to this one after much digging was I had an endpoint with a capital letter in its name. Apparently you can do this. In any event the way to really debug this is to try to generate the endpoints on the command line. It will actually throw an error on the class that has an issue and at least then you know which one to focus.</p>

<p>To do this run this command:</p>

<pre><code>endpoints.sh get-client-lib com.class1.name com.class2.name
</code></pre>

<p>on Windows I believe it's </p>

<pre><code>endpoints.bat
</code></pre>
