<p>I've solved the problem.</p>

<p>It's somehow related to the graphics card producing signal noise which the sound card picks up, or at least that's how I understood it.</p>

<p>The cause of the problem was that I had disabled Vertical Sync in my program and the refresh rate was causing the problems that way.</p>

<p>I've re-enabled Vsync in my program and the issue has gone.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help anyway!</p>
