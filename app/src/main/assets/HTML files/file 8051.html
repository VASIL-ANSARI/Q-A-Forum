<p>Here is a version that works; it uses jQuery just for convenience, but you can use <em>standard javascript</em> (pass me the term) without problems.</p>

<p>The main issue was that the HTML was wrong, especially the <code>select</code> tag wasn't closed, as well as the <code>option</code> tag.</p>

<p>What I did is simply bind the <code>onChange</code> event of the <strong>select</strong> (not the option!) to a function that updates the content.</p>

<p>This function searches the <code>option</code> which is currently selected, reads its <code>value</code> attribute (which is the id of the div to load content from) and updates the content accordingly.</p>

<pre><code>$('select').change(function() {
    var domElement = $('select option:selected').attr('value');
    $('#videoPlayback').html($('#' +  domElement.toString()).html()); 
});
</code></pre>
