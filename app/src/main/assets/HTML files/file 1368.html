<p>lock() only works on other lock() blocks.  So lock(f) will block other code that is working with f as long as that code also has lock(f), so lock(f) has to be on all usages of (f).</p>

<p>You don't need to worry about locking the target Foo since it's still being constructed--nothing else can have a reference to it yet.</p>
