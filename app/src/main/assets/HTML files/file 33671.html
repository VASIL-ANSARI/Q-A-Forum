<p>Not quite sure on what you are trying to achieve...</p>

<p>In general, if you have to validate a form you should it in your java code before inserting stuffs into the DB.</p>

<p>You can check ad a DB level using a trigger (BEFORE INSERT) or a constraint (you can use the constraint anyway to ensure the data integrity) but I believe that a check in Java is easier to maintain.</p>
