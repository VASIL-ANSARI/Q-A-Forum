<p>You can't read a stream or reader twice. Once it's read to the end it's at the end (Done in <code>IOUtils.copy(in, out)</code>). Then you try to read it again (<code>IOUtils.toString(in)</code>). </p>

<p>To write both file and string in one step you could use a TeeWriter (like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/io-tools/source/browse/trunk/easystream/src/main/java/com/gc/iotools/stream/writer/TeeWriter.java?r=434" rel="nofollow">this one</a>) and a StringWriter</p>

<p>Or copy the input to a String and write the string to out:</p>

<pre><code> priv = IOUtils.toString(in);
 out.wite(priv);
</code></pre>
