<p>I'm afraid there is not much you can do here with Jsoup, because the text you need to extract is inside a script node, so it is not HTML which Jsoup deals with, it is JavaScript.</p>

<p>What can be done is </p>

<ul>
<li>you could try manually extracting the text needed</li>
<li>or rendering the page in Selenium, then getting the page source and parsing it with Jsoup</li>
<li>or opening a page in you web browser, saving it to disk and then parsing</li>
</ul>

<p>Concerning you Jsoup example, there is no need to create a TextNode from html. You get you tree in doc.body() and then navigate with Jsoup API: CSS selectors or tree API methods (children, first etc).</p>
