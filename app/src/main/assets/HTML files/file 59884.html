<p>That's right. However, you are doing it before incrementing the index, and since indexing starts at zero, you should stop one index before the end:</p>

<pre><code>var index = 1 // Set the index to 1 initially to skip the title
...
if index+1 &lt; workoutArray.count {
    index += 1
    tableView.reloadData()
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above check verifies that <code>index</code> would stay in range <em>after</em> being incremented.</p>
