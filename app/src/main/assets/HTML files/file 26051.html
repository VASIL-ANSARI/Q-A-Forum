<p>Recently (as of Rails 3.2.13), Rails will save both ends of the the relation if they are not yet persisted before the validation is run.
So they won't be null and they will look persisted. 
Rails does this in a transaction, so if the validation fails, you won't end up with persisted objects.</p>

<p>In previous versions of Rails, the values being related could appear as nil in the relation's validation methods.</p>

<p>This makes coding validations much more straightforward as of 3.2.13. 
This seems like a major change for a 'TINY' version bump. Make sure related code is well tested.</p>
