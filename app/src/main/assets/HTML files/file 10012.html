<p>You need to look for touch events (TouchesBegan, TouchesMoved, TouchesEnded, TouchesCancelled) in your view. When you get a touch, you can ask it for its location in your view. You can use this location to test whether that point is inside any of your paths, if it is, do your cool stuff.</p>

<p>Using your example code, here might be a rough TouchesBegan...</p>

<pre><code>- (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
    for (UITouch *touch in touches) {
        CGPoint pointTouched = [touch locationInView:self];
        for (UIBezierPath *path in paths) {
            if ([path containsPoint:point]) {
                // do something cool with your path
                // or more likely, set a flag to do the cool thing when drawing
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget that you should handle all the touch events and do something sensible with each. Also, the above code is multitouch capable, but you may want to only allow a single touch, in which case there are ways to eliminiate the "touches" loop.</p>
