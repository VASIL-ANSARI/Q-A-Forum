<p>After lots of trial and error, I found that deselecting the checkbox <code>Deploy database properties</code> stopped the publish script from including the junk about turning off encryption. Then it was a matter of finding which db property was causing this.</p>

<p>I saw my <code>dbproj</code> target platform was set to <code>Microsoft Azure SQL Database</code> not <code>Microsoft Azure SQL Database V12</code>. V12 is what has TDE, the old db does not. </p>

<p>Once you go to the properties on your dbproj (right click proj > properties), go to project setttings, change to V12, then click on <code>Database Settings</code>. Go to <code>Miscellaneous</code> tab and check <code>Encryption enabled</code>. Voila, you're done. Make sure you have <code>Deploy database properties</code> re-enabled in your publish settings.</p>
