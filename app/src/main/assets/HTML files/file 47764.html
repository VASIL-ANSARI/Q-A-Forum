<p>Ref parameter wont work with WCF. </p>

<p>When you do the call to the service everything is pass as an input message serialized. Then the service deserialize it and do the work and finally it return a serialized  response to the client that is deserialized on the client side.</p>

<p>The ref parameter might compile but in no way you retain the reference to a memory pointer in the client computer. You must use the response to return back the object.</p>
