<p>If I understood the question correctly it's all about cascading through simple <code>1:N</code> relations. In that case Hibernate can do the job rather well:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, 
        mappedBy = "post", orphanRemoval = true)
    private List&lt;Comment&gt; comments = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
}

@Entity
public class Comment {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    @ManyToOne
    private Post post;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>Post post = newPost();
doInTransaction(session -&gt; {
    session.delete(post);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Generates:</p>

<pre><code>delete from Comment where id = 1
delete from Comment where id = 2
delete from Post where id = 1
</code></pre>

<p>But if you have some other (synthetic) collections, Hibernate has no chance to know which ones, so you have to handle them yourself.</p>

<p>As for Hibernate and custom queries, Hibernate provides HQL which is more compact then traditional SQL, but still is less transparent then annotations.</p>
