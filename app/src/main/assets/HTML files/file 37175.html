<h1>Look under <code>.idea</code> folder of your project</h1>

<p>In the <code>Project Pane</code> on the left, browse to <code>.idea/libraries</code></p>

<p>All the library dependencies that your project has have been mentioned, with each one getting its own xml file. You can see the version number included in the xml file title. The xml itself has the library file path.</p>
