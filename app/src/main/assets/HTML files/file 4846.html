<li>I dont like the idea that you try and convert the images.</li>
<li>User will quickly get impatient and say you app is buggy and takes ages to load.</li>
<li>I think you solve the situation without any re-processing of full sized images.</li>
<li>On older hardware you would not have a retina display (so no need to upsize the images). If they have a retina display then they have a fast iPhone iPod.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would suggest you graphically solve the problem by how you display the thumbnail images. so instead of fullscreen put a border around this image and show it at its true resolution (dont upscale it).  Or show 4 images where you normally show 1 (since iPhone screen is 4x the resolution).</p>

<p>Instead of resampling the original massive image, you could do a bicubic upsample of the thumbnail making it 4x the size. This will make it slightly blurry but it should look better than the iPhone scaling which will look really bad. The upsample would be ultra fast as its working with a small image. </p>

<p>I cannot help you out on upsampling but there will be some code somewhere.</p>

<p>Cheers, John.</p>
