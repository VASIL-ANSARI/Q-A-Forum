<p>Apparently, the Hebrew text is supposed to be written by some software, possibly JavaScript code, where e.g. <code>\u05d0</code> within a string literal denotes the Unicode character U+05D0 HEBREW LETTER ALEF â×â. It sounds like such a construct has been mistakenly âescapedâ e.g. so that the <code>\</code> character is preceded by another <code>\</code> character, which nullifies the meaning and turns the <code>\</code> to a mere character.</p>

<p>This was a rather abstract answer, though somewhat more concrete than the question. For a more detailed answer, please post some code.</p>
