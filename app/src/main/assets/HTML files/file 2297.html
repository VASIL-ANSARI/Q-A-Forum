<p>I generally have my PHP pages in one folder, (maybe 10 files if it's a medium size site) then a subfolder in there called media, in which I put a css folder, a js folder an img folder, a swf folder etc.</p>

<p>I have 2 css files, one's a reset, the other has the style for the whole site written in chunks. I use a class on the body tag to target different page layouts.</p>

<p>The js folder has jquery, a file that's run on every page, then specific files for individual pages.</p>

<p>This keeps things pretty straight forward really.</p>
