<p>As Peter Wood suggests in the comments, this is <strong>exactly</strong> what the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#reduce" rel="nofollow"><code>reduce</code></a> does:</p>

<pre><code>result = reduce(update_theta, stuff, some_initial_theta)
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 3, <code>reduce</code> has been moved to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce" rel="nofollow"><code>functools.reduce</code></a>, so you'd need to import that:</p>

<pre><code>from functools import reduce
</code></pre>

<p>If you want an iterator of all the intermediate values, Python 3 provides <code>itertools.accumulate</code>. There's no argument to specify an initial value, so you'd need to put the initial value in the iterator:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import accumulate, chain
result_iterator = accumulate(chain([some_initial_theta], stuff), update_theta)
</code></pre>

<p>Python 2 doesn't have <code>itertools.accumulate</code>, but you could copy the equivalent code from the Python 3 documentation. There's no easy way to formulate it in terms of the Python 2 standard tools, which is why people wanted it added to Python 3 in the first place.</p>
