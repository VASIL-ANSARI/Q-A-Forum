<p>There aren't guidelines fixed in stone. It basically boils down to your own preference. The only thing you need to be sure is that you stay consistent within your own codebase.</p>

<p>Anyway, to answer your question, i'll give you my own personal style, from which you can take inspiration or derive your one.</p>

<p>In the first part, i define the attributes. First the class' constants, then static attributes, then public, protected and private attributes in this order.</p>

<p>In the second part I have the class' methods, which follow the same pattern as the attributes before: first the static ones, then public, protected, and private ones.</p>

<p>I usually put getters and setters (when available) on top of the other public methods.</p>

<p>Also, I usually give precedence to inherited / implemented methods from interfaces and parent class(es)</p>

<p>But again, this is just my own guideline.</p>
