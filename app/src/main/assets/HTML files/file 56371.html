<p>The <code>HTTP protocol</code> never sends cookie expiration time to the server. So you can not extend cookie expiration time. </p>

<p>Browser will send only cookie name and value to the server. All the other properties like <code>expires</code>, <code>domain</code>, <code>path</code>, <code>httponly</code> can not be accessed once the cookie has been set.</p>

<p>When you assign a Cookie in the response a <code>SetCookie</code> header gets added to the output and that will contain not only the value but also the path and the expires value.</p>

<p>But when the client browser sends the cookie back to the server, it simply includes the cookie name and value only and It does not send path or expires info.</p>
