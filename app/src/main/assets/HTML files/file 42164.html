<p>This reminds me of issues that came up for me back in the early days of Java (Java 1.0, 1.1) where to get anything to work cross-platform / cross-browser, you really had to rely strictly on the common denominator (ie Java 1.0) eshew virtually all of the AWT toolkit and build everything yourself.</p>

<p>So... What I'm saying is that if it is necessary that this work on Firefox, I'd recommend you not use typed arrays, but rather use the least common denominator :-) </p>
