<p>Not in this case, no. They are equivalent. However, if you do this:</p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var divid = document.getElementById("log1id");
  this.log1 = function(txt) {
    divid.innerHTML += "&lt;br /&gt;" + txt;
    };
  })();

var divid = document.getElementById("log2id");
function log2(txt) { // this is obviously the straightforward model
  divid.innerHTML += "&lt;br /&gt;" + txt;
};
</code></pre>

<p>then they do differ: the second version will pollute the global environment with <code>divid</code>, while the first one will not.</p>

<p>Given that they are evaluated in the global environment (where <code>this</code> is the global object), both functions are global. <code>log2 = ...</code> is equivalent to <code>this.log2 = ...</code> in absence of <code>var log2</code>, and nothing changes <code>this</code> in the case of <code>log1</code>, so they both assign a function to a property of the global <code>this</code>.</p>
