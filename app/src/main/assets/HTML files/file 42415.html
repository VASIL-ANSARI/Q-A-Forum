<p>Typically you'd mount routes for your engines like this:</p>

<pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do
    mount Mercury::Engine =&gt; '/mercury'

    # If you wanted routes mounted on root
    # mount Mercury::Engine =&gt; '/'    
end
</code></pre>

<p>So if you want to add constraints, you could say:</p>

<pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do
    mount Mercury::Engine =&gt; '/mercury', constraints: {}
end
</code></pre>
