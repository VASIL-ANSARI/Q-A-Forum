<p>Your fetch request has no predicate. That will cause it to fetch all of the <code>VitaminData</code> entities in your datastore. </p>

<p>Give it a predicate, and (probably) also some sort descriptors. Then iterate over the results. Note you should also check that <code>objects</code> is not <code>nil</code> after your <code>-executeFetchRequest:</code>. If <code>objects</code> is <code>nil</code>, there's an error in your fetch request, and you should look at the contents of <code>error</code>.</p>
