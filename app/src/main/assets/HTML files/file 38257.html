<p>The first thing is: do you really need <code>mixed="true"</code>? This means that between all the child elements of a FooType you may also have content. This means that you need something to store a mixture of String (for the content before, between and after child elements), one Bar, one Baz and whatever comes for <code>xs:any</code>. Truly a wild mixture.</p>

<p>Without mixed, xjc generates:</p>

<pre><code>public class FooType {
    @XmlElement(name = "Bar")
    protected BigInteger bar;
    @XmlElement(name = "Baz")
    protected byte[] baz;
    @XmlAnyElement(lax = true)
    protected List&lt;Object&gt; any;
    @XmlAttribute(name = "Moo", required = true)
    @XmlSchemaType(name = "anyURI")
    protected String moo;
</code></pre>

<p>(Do you really need BigInteger??)</p>

<p>If <code>mixed="true"</code> is required, you'll have to test the QName values. You might have had a small chance to avoid this if the classes of the List elements would be distinct, but String will occur vor the text children, the Baz element and later on ("any") everything is possible.</p>

<p>Not sure what has motivated exactly this XML Schema design, but better alternatives aren't inconceivable.</p>
