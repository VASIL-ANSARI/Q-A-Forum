<p>IE has issues (bugs) with keeping namespaces distinct. Do you have <em>anything</em> else on the page that uses "aid" as an <code>id</code>, a <code>name</code>, a variable at global scope, ...? If so, that's your problem. An easy way to check is to do an experiment: Change the hidden field's ID to <code>flibberdegibbet</code> and change the string in your <code>getElementById</code> call. If it starts working, that means you have a name conflict somewhere.</p>
