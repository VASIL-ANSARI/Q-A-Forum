<p>Yes, I'm seeing this error too.. Currently trying to figure out if there's some sort of conflict with 'MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification'. </p>

<p>UPDATE: I had my MPMovieplayer instance set to NULL in my MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification notification method. Moving that to my movieplayer instantiation method fixed the crash:</p>

<p>videoTrack = NULL</p>

<p>videoTrack = [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc]initWithContentURL:url];</p>
