<p>Don't even try to run babel in ie. It will be awfully slow. Use a compiler toolchain (babel) to create an offline build process, and serve the compiled files. It's true that all modern browsers understand the class keyword, but until you have to support at least one browser that doesn't, you will have to compile. The babel compiler is a complex javascript program, I am sure you don't want to include additional hundreds of kilobytes of js code in your web application. Offline compilation is the way to go.</p>

<p>You may wonder why is even babel capable of doing it in the browser: well it was created to support some developer workflows, but nowadays it is mostly unnecessary as browsers implement most of the es6 spec and some esnext specs like async/await too.</p>
