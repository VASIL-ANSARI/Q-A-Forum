<p><code>randint</code> is a method. You should call it:</p>

<pre><code>total = randint(1, 20)
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand your code you should replace all <code>randint</code> (without parentheses) to <code>num1</code>. You've already called <code>randint</code> and assigned its return value to <code>num1</code>.</p>
