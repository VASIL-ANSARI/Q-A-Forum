<p>Keeping your database in assets folder would be a permanent thing. If your database is such that it is necessary to update it,i suggest you use an online database,i mean keep your database in an online server. Now when you want to perform any CRUD operations,you can do it by connecting to an mySQL database using php. Hope this helps!</p>
