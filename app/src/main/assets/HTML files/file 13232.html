<p>You can <a href="http://api.jquery.com/stop/" rel="nofollow">stop current animation</a> in jQuery. </p>

<p>Or you can restore original values yourself.</p>

<p>To do both you'll have to be able to select element that is currently animated. To facilitate this, I suggest adding a special class (like <code>currentlyAnimated</code>) in your click handler. When you click another element, check if there are elements with this class. If there are, stop/revert animation on them. After that, you remove this class from those elements and add it to the current one. </p>
