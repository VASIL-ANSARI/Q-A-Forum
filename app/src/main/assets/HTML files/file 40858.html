<p>Are you sure your teacher wanted the function to take the indexes and not values?</p>

<p>If it's indexes, your solution is right. </p>

<p>If it's values, a quick and dirty way would be to this:</p>

<pre><code>def slice(alist, start, end):
    s = alist.index(start)
    e = alist.index(end)
    return alist[s:e+1]
</code></pre>

<p>You can add the check for inputs, and also modify the function if you don't want the greedy approach, as the index function returns the index of the first element it can find in the list starting from left (which mightn't be what you want for the end value).</p>
