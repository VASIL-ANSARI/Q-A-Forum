<p>Like Babiker already said, <code>short_open_tag</code> has to be set to <code>1</code> in your <code>php.ini</code>. But to be on the safe side, you should only use long tags and <code>echo</code> in your code, as you cannot be sure if the PHP server you might your application deploy to has short tags enabled.</p>
