<p>C++ will give this error, so you're probably using a C++ compiler.</p>

<p>Change the settings to C, or add an explicit cast, as C++ requires (or switch to using new/delete).</p>

<p>In C, adding an explicit cast to the return value of malloc is considered bad form. This is the primary reason that almost all C code is incompatible with a C++ compiler. Best thing is to consider C and C++ different languages and learn them separately.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/605845/do-i-cast-the-result-of-malloc">See here</a> as to why it's considered bad form.</p>
