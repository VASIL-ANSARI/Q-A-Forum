<p>When I run:</p>

<pre><code>gem install susy --version 0.9 -V
</code></pre>

<p>I see that <code>gem</code> is going to rubygems.org for the gem in question.</p>

<p><em>However</em> when I look for the <code>susy</code> gem on that server, all I find is version <a href="http://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=susy" rel="nofollow">1.0.1</a>.</p>

<p>In your Gemfile, you could try to specify the source of the gem from a git repo as they do in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2577346/how-to-install-gem-from-github-source">this question</a>.</p>

<p>Normally, you'd put all of your gems you want to use in a Gemfile and then run <code>bundle install</code> from the directory that contains the Gemfile.</p>
