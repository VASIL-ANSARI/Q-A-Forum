<p>As I mentioned in my comment, I can't quite figure out what you're asking, but what I can figure out is that you're doing a few things wrong here.  </p>

<p>First, you should not be using "-1" for default..  You are using a nullable field RelationShipId, and you should make RelaitonShipId null when you want it unselected, then you use the "option label" default string parameter of DropDownListFor to place the text for this.</p>

<pre><code>@Html.DropDownListFor(m =&gt; item.RelationShipId, 
     new SelectList(ViewBag.RelationShip,"Id", "Title"), 
     "--Select--", 
     new { @id = "ddl_" + @item.UserID, @class = "form-control", 
       onchange = "update(this,'" + @item.UserID + "','" + @item.SentByUserId + "');" })
</code></pre>

<p>This allows model binding and validation to work, so if you have a required validation, if RelationShipId is null ("--Select--" is selected) then it will fail to validate.</p>
