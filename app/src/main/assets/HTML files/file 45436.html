<p>HEUREKA!</p>

<p>I had the same problem, but with windows 8.1. It took me 2 days to find a solution. It's the foolish SwapChainPanel, which can't be in focus because the class doesn't inherit from Control class, so it won't handle keyboard events.</p>

<p>The solution is <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/54e4820d-d782-45d9-a2b1-4e3a13340788/set-focus-on-swapchainpanel-control?forum=winappswithcsharp" rel="nofollow">HERE</a> that is to say, you have to put an XAML element that's inherited from the Control class, like Button to handle the event. My XAML file is like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SwapChainPanel  x:Name="_swapChainPanel"
                 Loaded="_swapChainPanel_Loaded"
                 KeyDown="_swapChainPanel_KeyDown"&gt;
    &lt;Button x:Name="_swapChainButton"
            Content="Button"
            HorizontalAlignment="Left"
            Height="0"
            VerticalAlignment="Top"
            Width="0" 
            KeyDown="_swapChainButton_KeyDown"&gt;
    &lt;/Button&gt;
&lt;/SwapChainPanel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the XAML.cs I handled the events this way:</p>

<pre><code>private void _swapChainButton_KeyDown(object sender, Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.KeyRoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        e.Handled = false; //This will pass the event to its parent, which is the _swapChainPanel
    }

private void _swapChainPanel_KeyDown(object sender, Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.KeyRoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        game.KeyboardEvent();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In the KeyboardEvent() method I put the if things... and you have to make the button in focus manually, with code. "_swapChainButton.Focus(FocusState.Programmatic);"</p>

<p>But last, it's not so good for me, it's so slow. It has delay. :/</p>
