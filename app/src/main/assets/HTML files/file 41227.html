<p>After calling the procedure, you have to close the cursor and open it again before using it to execute another statement:</p>

<pre><code>cur.close()

cur = con.cursor() 
</code></pre>

<p>The cursor can be closed immediately after <code>fetchall()</code>. The result set still remains and can be looped through. You have to clean/close the cursor after calling stored procecude in order to execute further sql code. This is not an issue with Python but with MySQL.</p>
