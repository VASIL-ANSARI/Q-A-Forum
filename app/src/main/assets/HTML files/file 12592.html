<p>You are most likely trying to search the DOM before it's been loaded. Try putting your code inside an onload handler:</p>

<pre><code>document.onload = function () {
    alert(document.getElementById('&lt;%=ControlID.ClientID%&gt;'));
}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sure that the code isn't executed before you actually have all of the DOM loaded.</p>
