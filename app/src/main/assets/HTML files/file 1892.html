<p>I would do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 'select * from table_a where col_a = ?' INTO @query, 1 into @param1 FROM dual;
PREPARE stmt FROM @query;
EXECUTE stmt USING @param1 ;
</code></pre>

<p>So converting that into your tables, I guess would look like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.result_query INTO @query, b.result_query_id INTO @param1 FROM result_query_table a, original_query_table b where a.result_query_id = b.result_query_id;
PREPARE stmt FROM @query;
EXECUTE stmt USING @param1 ;
</code></pre>

<p>Will you know how many parameters the where clause will need? If that's dynamic, then things could get a bit tricky.</p>
