<p>The following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is caused when there has already been output to the page before a header is sent. By convention, all <code>header()</code>s (including cookies) must be sent out before any output is displayed.</p>

<p>To fix this, you can simply move your entire PHP script (<code>&lt;?php ...  header('Location: index.php'); ?&gt;</code> to the top of the page.</p>
