<p>First of all, on Linux qmake generates Makefiles which are used to control your build process. When you add the line </p>

<pre><code>LIBS+=-L"$$_PRO_FILE_PWD_/libs" -lvl
</code></pre>

<p>to your <code>.pro</code> file, qmake will see to it that appropriate Makefile target is generated which tells the linker to search for additional libraries in <code>$$_PRO_FILE_PWD_/libs</code> and link to a library <code>libvl.so</code> when <em>linking</em> the executable.</p>

<p>However what you're experiencing is a <em>run-time</em> problem. More specifically, <code>ld-linux.so.2</code> will try to find and dynamically load shared libraries like <code>libvl.so</code> at <em>runtime</em>. This happens using built-in, such as <code>/usr/lib</code> and user-defined (and/or distribution-defined) paths when the executable is loaded. I refer you to the corresponding <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/ld-linux" rel="nofollow">man page</a> for <code>ld-linux.so.2</code> and the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/ldconfig" rel="nofollow">man page</a> for <code>ldconfig</code>, which is used to configure user-defined library search paths in a standard way.</p>

<p>When <code>ld-linux.so.2</code> tries to find libraries, it searches a well defined set of directories (all colon-separated) in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li>if present, the so called <code>DT_RPATH</code>, which can be written into an executable library (<strong>deprecated</strong>).</li>
<li>the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (at least for most executables, see the man page for exceptions)</li>
<li>the <code>DT_RUNPATH</code> which supersedes the <code>DT_RPATH</code> (if any) but delays lookup until after <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> has been processed. The <code>RPATH</code> and <code>RUNPATH</code> can be used to simulate behavior like on Windows, where the path of the executable is also searched. <code>LD_LIBRARy_PATH</code>, however, is much better suited for this purpose.</li>
<li>library names present in the cache file <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code> which is generated by <code>ldconfig</code> using directories specified in <code>/etc/ld.so.conf/</code> and possibly additional files either directly referred to via inclusion in <code>ld.so.conf</code> or otherwise specified</li>
<li>the <em>trusted directories</em>, <code>/lib</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If none of the paths mentioned above contain the appropriate shared object, you will get an error that it could not be loaded by <code>ld-linux.so.2</code>.</p>

<p>The solution in your case is simple and come in some variety:</p>

<ul>
<li>before executing the program, set the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable using <code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={yourSearchPaths}</code>.</li>
<li>add the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to the invocation of the executable on the command-line, e.g. <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH={yourSearchPaths} ./{executable}</code></li>
<li>provide an executable start-up shell script, e.g. <code>start.sh</code>, which does the above for you and then simply execute the shell-script <code>./start.sh</code></li>
</ul>
