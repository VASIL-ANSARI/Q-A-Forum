<p>You have to make block "locked" after you have inserted. There are several issues to handle:</p>

<h2>1. On insertion of locked element</h2>

<p>I assume, it will be via insertHTML command.</p>

<pre><code>editor.composer.commands.exec('insertHTML', lockedhtml);
$(editor.composer.iframe).contents().find('.lockedForEditing').attr('contenteditable', 'false');
</code></pre>

<h2>2. On initialization of wysihtml</h2>

<p>i.e. locked element is in the contents of text area. First you need to add your "lockedForEditing" class to whitelist in wysihtml rules. then after composer initialized you need to lock elements.</p>

<pre><code>editor.on('load', function(){
   $(editor.composer.iframe).contents().find('.lockedForEditing').attr('contenteditable', 'false');
});
</code></pre>

<h2>3. Prevent contenteditable commands affect contents of locked element</h2>

<p>If user selects all text inside composer and styles it, your locked element's content will also be affected even contenteditable attribute is false. So you need to use CSS to make text inside locked element not-selectable</p>

<pre><code>-webkit-touch-callout: none;
-webkit-user-select: none;
-khtml-user-select: none;
-moz-user-select: none;
-ms-user-select: none;
user-select: none;
</code></pre>

<p>An humble advise, instead of using div tag for your locked element, you may prefer section tag, which you reserve for lock.</p>
