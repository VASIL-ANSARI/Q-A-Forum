<p>Query cache can be used stand-alone since it caches the ids of the query results, eliminating the need for performing the query again. </p>

<p>No one will be able to tell you if the benefit in your case is higher than the memory impact of storing all those queries, results and query parameters. Depending on the latency to your db and how huge your queries are results will vary but I personally would not use the query cache without a very good reason and only for a selected few query where query parameters don't fluctuate.</p>
