<p>First I think you do not want to call it this way. I prefer not to call the UIApplication from  a view and try to prevent it from a controller. Use a notification instead.</p>

<p>But the way you could do this is:</p>

<pre><code>[(ApplicationDelegate *)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate switchToTabbarController]
</code></pre>
