<p>Are you manually adding the location header, or expecting it to automagically be returned by the server script? As it may not actually be set.<br>
Unless you are redirecting I would expect that it would not be set, and Chrome might actually just be adding it itself to be "helpful".   </p>

<p>Maybe just try explicitly setting the location header in your script, then it should definitely be there, but that might have undesired side-effects.</p>
