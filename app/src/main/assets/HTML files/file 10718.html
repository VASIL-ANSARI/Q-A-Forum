<p>AFAIK, the architecture you should adopt is to put in place a remote machine. 
On this machine, you must have a server installed : Flash Media Server, Red5, etc. It will host the application that will get the coming stream and will outputs it.</p>

<p>Then, you can stream from a device (that you called "server") to the remote hosted application (ex: www.remoteserver.com:1234/myApp). To stream, just put that url in the input of a media container (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/VideoView.html). Hopefully, Android natively supports the RTSP protocol via that VideoView container.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
