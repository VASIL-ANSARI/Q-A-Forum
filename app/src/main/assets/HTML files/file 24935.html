<p>To answer your question: <code>Thread.join()</code> makes the current thread wait for the referenced thread to finish - so use that in the main method.</p>

<p>Also, if you're planning on using <code>Thread.interrupt()</code> for interrupting you will also need a status-check (<code>!isInterrupted()</code>) in (at least) the outer loops - only catching <code>InterruptedException</code> is not enough as that will only be thrown if it's currently waiting at the <code>sleep()</code> - it might get interrupted at another point as well.</p>
