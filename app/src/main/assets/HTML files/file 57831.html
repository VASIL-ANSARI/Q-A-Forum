<p>Based on our conversation in the comments, I am placing this as an answer.</p>

<p>What you are asking for is not part of the visual studio debugging process. unless you manually return from the request after the break point the process is going to continue running. When debugging you are just an observer of the process. Either the code kills the process via exception or returns from execution, or you kill the process externally.</p>

<p>It does not looks like what you are asking for is possible, and that is by design. </p>
