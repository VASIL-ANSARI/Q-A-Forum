<p>The problem is with matching the server format with your parsing format.</p>

<p>You specify .SSS to handle milliseconds, but in the default configuration the number of "S" does not matter, SimpleDateFormat will consume until the next delimiter. This means that it will parse the first fields, and in the end add 162430057 milliseconds (about 45 hours) which gets you to the (correct, but unwanted and unexpected) Wed Apr 01 09:01:56 IST 2015.</p>

<p>If you are using Java 8 I recommend instead looking at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html" rel="nofollow">DateTimeFormatter</a> which can handle nanoseconds or if pre Java 8 use <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/" rel="nofollow">Joda Time</a>.</p>

<p>If you are running on JDK 1.3 (which was End-Of-Life 2006/2007 depending on vendor) and you are certain of the time format, then you could use:</p>

<pre><code>fmt(text.substring(0, 23) + 'Z')
</code></pre>

<p>or possibly remove the <code>+ 'Z'</code>and remove the <code>'Z'</code> from the format.</p>

<p>Using Date you will lose the nano second precision in any case as Date only holds milliseconds.</p>
