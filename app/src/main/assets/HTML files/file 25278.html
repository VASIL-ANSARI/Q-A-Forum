<p>You sound like you are building a reverse proxy.  Code Project has a good post on how to accomplish this <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18490/Reverse-Proxy-in-C-NET-v2-0" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18490/Reverse-Proxy-in-C-NET-v2-0</a> which included copying cookies from one request to the other.</p>

<p>Be aware you will only receive cookies for the domain you app is hosted on.  If you are proxying requests to a different domain the browser sending the request will not send you cookies for the domain you are targeting.  </p>

<p>For example if your app is at <a href="http://dev.local/" rel="nofollow">http://dev.local/</a> and you are forwarding the request to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a> you will not have any cookies for the domain stackoverflow.com in your request.</p>
