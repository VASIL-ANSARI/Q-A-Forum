<p>If the tablet's Google Play Services is up-to-date, you may not have the latest SDK versions. </p>

<ul>
<li>Go to the SDK Manager and open the stand alone SDK Manager</li>
<li>Update the Android SDK Tools, The Android SDK Platform-tools and Android SDK Build-tools. </li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully the referenced libraries will be checked and you'll not encounter the issue after this.</p>
