<p>Not sure what version of Xcode you're using but if you're on 3.x did you use "Empty caches" (Xcode menu) to make sure any intermediate files were removed prior to building? Sometimes cleaning the target doesn't do the trick.</p>

<p>Also, you could try removing the offending files from the project and re-adding them from the correct path.</p>
