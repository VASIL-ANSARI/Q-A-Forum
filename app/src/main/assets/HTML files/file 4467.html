<p>I don't know about the memory leak but there is a better way to convert image to greyscale. Visit this <a href="http://www.switchonthecode.com/tutorials/csharp-tutorial-convert-a-color-image-to-grayscale" rel="nofollow">page</a>, you'll find three ways to do it, with third way called "Short and Sweet" being the fastest. And sweetest.</p>

<p>External site is unavailable even in Google and Internet Archive's wayback machine, but the code for short and sweet method is given in another <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2265990/395718">SO answer</a>.</p>
