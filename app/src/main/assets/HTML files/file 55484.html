<p>The Bluetooth LE Gatt APIs are built upon Android's Binder mechanism, which means it will only work during the app process is alive. You must make sure your app process isn't killed by the system. The easiest way to do that is to have a foreground service running (not an intent service). The only important thing is that the foreground service is alive and running, your service class itself doesn't have to do anything. But I guess the easiest way is to put all your BLE code inside that service.
