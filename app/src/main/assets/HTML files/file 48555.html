<p>Just for your information: i'm reading 13 Mbyte, 29000 lines of csv in about 4 seconds. (not using parallel processing)
Archlinux, AMD Phenom II X2, Python 3.4, python-pandas 0.16.2.</p>

<p>How big is your file and how long does it take to read it ?
That would help to understand the problem better.
Is your excel sheet very complex ? Maybe read_excel has difficulty processing that complexity ?  </p>

<p>Suggestion: install genumeric and use the helper function ssconvert to translate the file to csv. In your program change to read_csv. Check the time used by ssconvert and the time taken by read_csv. 
By the way, python-pandas had major improvements while it went from version 13 .... 16, hence usefull to check you have a recent version.</p>
