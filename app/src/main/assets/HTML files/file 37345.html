<p>No. <code>a</code> has type <code>double*</code>. Therefore <code>&amp;a</code> has type <code>double**</code>. You're casting <code>double**</code> to <code>double*</code>. That's not allowed in any version of C.</p>

<p>For example in C89, see <a href="http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c89-draft.html#3.3" rel="nofollow">section 3.3</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue that
  has one of the following types: [28]</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>the declared type of the object,</p></li>
  <li><p>a qualified version of the declared type of the object,</p></li>
  <li><p>a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the declared type of the object,</p></li>
  <li><p>a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a qualified version of the declared type of the object,</p></li>
  <li><p>an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among its members (including, recursively, a member of a
  subaggregate or contained union), or</p></li>
  <li><p>a character type.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>[Footnote 28]  The intent of this list is to specify those circumstances in which an object may or may not be aliased. </p>
