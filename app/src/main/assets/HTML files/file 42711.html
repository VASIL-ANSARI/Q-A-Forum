<p>Your controller should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpPost]
[ActionName("MyAction")]
public ActionResult MyAction(MyModel model) {
    // ... model has been loaded with data from the form, now work with it.
    // ex: MyDataLayer.Save(model);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Set your view's form to POST to "MyAction" and your model will be created and pre-loaded via <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh781022.aspx" rel="nofollow">model binding</a>.</p>
