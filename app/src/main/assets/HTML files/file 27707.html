<p>One option might be like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID, CASE WHEN Type = 1
                THEN Address
                ELSE '' END AS Add1,
           CASE WHEN Type = 2
                THEN Address
                ELSE '' END AS Add2
FROM tbl
</code></pre>

<p>Another option might be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID, Address AS Add1, '' AS Add2
FROM tbl
WHERE Type = 1
UNION
SELECT ID, '' AS Add1, Address AS Add2
FROM tbl
WHERE Type = 2
</code></pre>
