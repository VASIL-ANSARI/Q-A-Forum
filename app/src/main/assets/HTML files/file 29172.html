<p>When PHP is running as a service, it's running as a different user and with different registry keys than it has when running interactively.  In particular, SAPI makes extensive use of the registry to determine the voice to load.  I suspect that you're using the desktop TTS engine, which isn't designed to run as a service.  You will have much better results with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27226" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Speech Platform SDK 11</a>, which is designed to run from service applications, and which uses the same SAPI programming interface.  (It has different voices, and is configured slightly differently.  The SDK has samples that outline the differences.)</p>
