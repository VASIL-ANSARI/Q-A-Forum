<p>There is no way to detect a browser autofill, unfortunately.  Instead, use <code>setInterval</code>, for example, to run a function at a fairly high frequency that checks whether the original value (or empty) matches the input value and trigger the response that way.  If you don't want to do that, you're probably SOL since the browser will not even trigger <code>.change</code>, and any event is most likely not cross-browser compliant.</p>

<p>You could also have the validation events run on form submission as well, which should be just as effective.</p>
