<p><code>foldername/shoppingbag.php</code> is the file you're running and <code>foldername/uploads/image.jpg</code> is the file it's interested in. The relative path should just be <code>uploads/image.jpg</code>.</p>

<p>What does this give?</p>

<pre><code>var_dump('uploads/image.jpg');
</code></pre>
