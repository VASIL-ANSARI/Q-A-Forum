<p>Ahhh-hah, without seeing your code I'm thinking you might find use in the .not selector.
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/</a></p>

<pre><code>$("#foo .bar").not(this).hide();
</code></pre>

<p>This will basically grab anything BUT the thing you pass it, then do whatever to it (in this case hide). The nice thing about this is that doing it like so makes your UI expandable, if you plan to add more panels/windows later on.</p>

<p>Hopefully this gets you where you need to go. :)</p>
