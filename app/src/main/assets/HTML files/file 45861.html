<p>This is what I do with Retrofit. Just use <a href="http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/" rel="nofollow">jsonschema2pojo</a> to generate your POJO's (model classes). This will have all your getters and setters and serialized data for you to use and manipulate as you wish.</p>

<p>Let's say you're retrieving a <code>Data</code> objects. When you retrieve data with Retrofit, just throw them into a <code>List&lt;Data&gt;</code>. Something like the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public interface DataService{
  @GET("/{user}/data")
  List&lt;Data&gt; listData(@Path("user") String user);
}

RestAdapter restAdapter = new RestAdapter.Builder()
.setEndpoint("https://your.url.com")
.build();

DataService service = restAdapter.create(DataService.class);    

List&lt;Data&gt; datas = service.listData("your_parameter");
</code></pre>

<p>From a design standpoint, I find this to be the most elegant way because your POJOs should change as frequently as the API changes (that is, very infrequently). As such, it's OK to auto-generate your code and just have this black-box to reference. The best code is the code you don't have to write. Be careful to not over-architect.</p>
