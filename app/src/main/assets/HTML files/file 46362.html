<p>I worked up the courage to submit for testflight beta review and my app is still in 'Pending Developer Release' (phew!) but annoyingly the testflight status is "waiting for review".</p>

<p>I kinda hoped that since Apple have approved the app to be released into the market then testflight might be ready instantly. Now waiting for the test flight review to test >_&lt; </p>
