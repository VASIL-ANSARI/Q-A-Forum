<p>assuming you have a </p>

<pre><code>IBOutlet UISwitch * myNiceSwitch;
</code></pre>

<p>you can drop a push button (UIButton) into your view and connect it to an IBAction which then activates (or in my case below, toggles) your UISwitch:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction) pushButtonAction: (id) sender
{
    BOOL switchEnabled = myNiceSwitch.enabled;

    myNiceSwitch.enabled = !switchEnabled;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Should be as simple as that, yes?</p>
