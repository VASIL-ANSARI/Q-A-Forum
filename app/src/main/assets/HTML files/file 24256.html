<p>Have you checked the jdk version? From cmd type java -version. Also verify you got the right sdks installed in the sdk manager for the emulator image. For instance if your pointing to api 4.1 you need that and associated tools installed to run it in the emulator. If it gets funky go to your .android (not sure on ubuntu) folder and clear out the avd emulator cache and relaunch and recreate the avd. I could be off track because your not using windows and also using the cmd line. </p>
