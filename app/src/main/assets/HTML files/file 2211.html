<p>Have you told the user agent your HTTP response is UTF-8?</p>

<pre><code>header ('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8');
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to ensure your HTML markup declares the encoding also, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For your database, are your tables and mysql client settings set up for UTF-8? If you check your database using a mysql command line client, is your terminal environment set up to expect UTF-8? </p>

<p>In a nutshell, you must check every step: from the raw source data, the code which touches it, the storage systems which retain it, and the tools you use to display and debug it.</p>
