<p>Best you'd be able to do from Bash is CSV output, which means you can't have multiple worksheets. Alternatively, use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmcnamara/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-2.40/lib/Spreadsheet/WriteExcel.pm" rel="nofollow">Perl</a>, <a href="http://www.python-excel.org/" rel="nofollow">Python</a> or <a href="https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">PHP</a>, which do have supporting libraries for XLS output.</p>
