<p>You can't get a drawable's resource id after setting this drawable as a background. But you can store some kind of flag or even a resource id somewhere outside your <code>TextView</code> or maybe in its tag field. In this case you'll be able to get it and compare with another id.</p>

<pre><code>Object tag = textView.getTag();
int backgroundId = R.drawable.bg_image_2;
if( tag != null &amp;&amp; ((Integer)tag).intValue() == backgroundId) {
    backgroundId = R.drawable.bg_image_1;
}
textView.setTag(backgroundId);
textView.setBackgroundResource(backgroundId);
</code></pre>
