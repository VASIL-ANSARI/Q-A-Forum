<p>Oh, well, Shot in the dark time. If you are running Magento 1.4.x.x, previous to 1.4.2.0, you have a memory leak that displays exactly this symptom as it eats up more and more memory, leading eventually to memory exhaustion. Profile exports that took 3-8 minutes under 1.3.x.x will now take 2-5 hours if it doesn't throw an error before completion. Another symptom is exports that fail without finishing and without giving any indication of why the window freezes or gives some sort of funky completion message with no output.</p>

<p>The Array Of Death(tm) has been noted and here's the official repair in the new version. Maybe Data Will Flow again!</p>

<p>Excerpt from 1.4.2.0rc1 /lib/Varien/Db/Select.php that has been patched for memory leak</p>

<pre><code>public function __construct(Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract $adapter)
{
   parent::__construct($adapter);
   if (!in_array(self::STRAIGHT_JOIN_ON, self::$_joinTypes)) {
      self::$_joinTypes[] = self::STRAIGHT_JOIN_ON;
      self::$_partsInit = array(self::STRAIGHT_JOIN =&amp;gt; false) + self::$_partsInit;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Excerpt from 1.4.1.1 /lib/Varien/Db/Select.php with memory leak</p>

<pre><code>public function __construct(Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract $adapter)
{
   parent::__construct($adapter);
   self::$_joinTypes[] = self::STRAIGHT_JOIN_ON;
   self::$_partsInit = array(self::STRAIGHT_JOIN =&amp;gt; false) + self::$_partsInit;
}
</code></pre>
