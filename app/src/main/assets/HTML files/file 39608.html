<p>I think, having a closer look at this here:
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.get_rect" rel="nofollow">http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.get_rect</a>
will answer your question!</p>

<p>If not, here's the solution:</p>

<p>The rect you get with get_rect always has (0, 0) for the x and y value. When you blit the surfaces, however, you shift them but not the rect. Therefore the button rect is there (try to click somewhere in the top-left corner and see what happens) but not in the same position as the button image.</p>

<p>To solve this issue you have to shift the rect too:</p>

<pre><code>play_game_rect = play_game.get_rect()
play_game_rect.x = MENUX
play_game_rect.y = MENUY
</code></pre>

<p>Do this for each of the buttons and it should work. If you didn't understand what the problem is, please ask again, this is an important issue you will encounter very often.</p>
