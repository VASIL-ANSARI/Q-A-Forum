<p>Although you can use anonymous types or collections of objects of anonymous type locally with static typing, there is no way to return them from a function without losing the information about their static type.</p>

<p>If you cannot or for some reason prefer not to create a named class to hold the return data, you need to either return <code>List&lt;dynamic&gt;</code>, or <code>List&lt;object&gt;</code>. Both these approaches have their drawbacks: <code>dynamic</code> will be slower than a comparable statically-typed object, while <code>System.Object</code> would not let you do much with the data that you get back.</p>

<p>The best solution would be creating a named return type:</p>

<pre><code>public class PositionData {
     public int ImoNo {get;set;}
     public string PositionCordinates {get;set;}
     public int VesselId {get;set;}
     public string Equipment  {get;set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now your query will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>select new PositionData {
    ImoNo = positions.imo_no
,   PositionCordinates = positions.position_cordinates
,   VesselId = vessels.vessel_id
,   Equipment = vessels.equipment
};
</code></pre>

<p>The return type of your method would change to <code>List&lt;PositionData&gt;</code>.</p>
