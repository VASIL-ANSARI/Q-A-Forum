<p>It's unclear if you want to include the time part of the DateTime as well, or simply the Day and Month. Uncomment/tweak for your use:</p>

<pre><code>bool AreEqual(DateTime left, DateTime right)
{   
    return left.Day == right.Day &amp;&amp; left.Month == right.Month
        // &amp;&amp; left.TimeOfDay.Equals(right.TimeOfDay)
    ;
}
</code></pre>
