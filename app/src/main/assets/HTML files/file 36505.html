<h1>Scope matters.</h1>

<p>The <code>List</code> you are accessing is local to the <code>main()</code> method. You can access that only within the <code>main()</code> method.</p>

<p>Move that to top level, which should be an instance member( and provide a getter to return that as well) to access.</p>
