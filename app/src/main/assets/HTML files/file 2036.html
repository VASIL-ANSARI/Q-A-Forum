<p>I've used DotNetNuke (http://www.dotnetnuke.com) in the past with great succcess.  It has a great community and track record.  There are also enormous amounts of third-party solutions to extend core functionality (http://www.snowcovered.com).</p>

<p>In addition, you may consider looking at Windows SharePoint Services, however development within that can be both a licensing and development nightmare.</p>

<p>Rolling your own just doesn't make sense given the overhead of redoing all of the security and content management pieces.</p>
