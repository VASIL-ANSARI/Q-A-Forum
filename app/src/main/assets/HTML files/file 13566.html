<p>Calling the property</p>

<pre><code>window.rootViewController
</code></pre>

<p>returns an instance of <code>UIViewController</code>, and that class does not have a publicly visible property called <code>delegate</code>. <code>UINavigationController</code>, however, does.</p>

<p>When using property syntax (i.e., dot notation) the compiler needs to know which properties the receiver's class has declared.</p>

<p>If you instead do the standard message notation and don't cast, <code>[rootViewController setDelegate:self]</code>, then it will probably <code>work</code>, but I believe you'll get a compiler warning still, but it will "work".</p>

<p>But it's generally good to be explicit. The compiler doesn't know how to properly/safely send the message <code>-setDelegate:</code> to <code>UIViewController</code>, that's why it complains. You need to be more explicit with it.</p>
