<p>So the easiest and best way to do something like this in Redis is to keep a dedicated counter for the stat breakdowns you want to track.  So, for example, if you wanted to track today's views and all time views you might have two increments:</p>

<pre><code>d = Date.today
$redis.incr "Stats:#{d.year}:#{d.month}:#{d.day}:post:#{@post.id}:views"
$redis.incr "Stats:alltime:post:#{@post.id}:views"
</code></pre>

<p>Then you simply query the 2nd key to get the alltime aggregate.</p>
