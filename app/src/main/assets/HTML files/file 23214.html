<p>You don't want the controllers to communicate with each other directly. If you are segueing to another view you can use <code>prepareForSegue</code>. If you don't want to use that I suggest you either update a file or a database that both controllers have access to as to avoid direct interaction and keep the mvc architecture.</p>
