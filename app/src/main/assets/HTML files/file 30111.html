<p>I assume you mean that you want <code>obj2</code> to point to the same value that <code>obj1</code> originally pointed to.  If so then just grab the value out of the list with the indexer </p>

<pre><code>Class1 obj2 = (Class1)newList[0];
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I had to insert a cast there.  The type of elements in the list is <code>IClass1</code> but you specified <code>obj2</code> as <code>Class1</code>.  </p>
