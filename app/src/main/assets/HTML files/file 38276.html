<p>I found the problem in the line <code>$out = 'open 192.168.0.22' . PHP_EOL;</code> more specifically <code>PHP_EOL</code> . Since the server target is running Windows, it expects <code>\r\n</code> as a character return. My computer (localhost) is running Windows, which makes <code>PHP_EOL = \r\n</code>, but once I deployed the application on a Linux server, the <code>PHP_EOL</code> there is set to <code>\n</code>. My problem was solved with the following line:</p>

<pre><code>$out = 'open 192.168.0.22' . "\r\n";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> the character <code>\r\n</code> must be wrapped in double quotes mark (<code>""</code>) for it to work.</p>
