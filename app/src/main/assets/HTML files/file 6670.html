To have it open, do its thing, and close without taking over the screen in any way, you could probably set the property list to hide the status bar icon <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/customizing_docktile/docktasks_cocoa/docktasks_cocoa.html" rel="nofollow">cite</a> and to close.
