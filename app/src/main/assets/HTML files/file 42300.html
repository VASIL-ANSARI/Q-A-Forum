<p>This is potentially due to adjustments that you might be making to your UI elements (or constraints) from the view controller in code. For example, if you are programmatically setting a different UIImage into your UIImageView, and this code is happening too late in the view lifecycle (for example, in <code>viewDidAppear</code>) after a layout pass has already calculated view positions and sizes, then you will see a visible snap as views take on new positions based on the new intrinsic content size of the image view.</p>

<p>This could be caused by other adjustments such as injecting a localized string into a UILabel in code, which causes the label to have a smaller or larger intrinsic content size, which in turn affects the layout based on your constraints.</p>

<p>If you are making adjustments to your UI in code, make sure they are happening in <code>viewDidLoad</code> or <code>viewWillAppear:</code> so that they occur before the view's initial layout pass (and the view's animation onscreen).</p>

<p>If you're still seeing issues, you can try explicitly forcing an immediate layout pass to occur on the view controller's view at the end of <code>viewWillAppear:</code> by doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewWillAppear:animated];

    [self.view setNeedsLayout];
    [self.view layoutIfNeeded]; // forces an immediate layout pass
}
</code></pre>
