<p>The Optimus whitepaper at <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/LO_optimus_whitepapers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/LO_optimus_whitepapers.html</a> is unclear on exactly what it takes before a switch to GPU is made. The whitepaper says that DX, DXVA, and CUDA calls are detected and will cause the GPU to be turned on. But in addition the decision is based on profiles maintained by NVIDIA and, of course, one does not yet exist for your game.</p>

<p>One thing to try would be make a CUDA call, for instance to <code>cuInit(0);</code>. As opposed to DX and DXVA, there is not way for the Intel integrated graphics to handle that, so it should force a switch to the GPU.</p>
