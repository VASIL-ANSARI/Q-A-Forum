<p>Since both constructors have the same parameter types, the compiler doesn't know which constructor to use. Different constructors for the same object must have a different set of parameters. Also, if you're passing in a piece of data to construct the object, generally you want to actually do something with that data...</p>

<p>EDIT: For a quick fix, simply delete the second constructor.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Since I seem to have misread your post originally...My advice is to make sure you are passing the appropriate types to the constructor.</p>
