<p>1) Sets the type of the symbol to function. It's not needed, except in special cases, for example shared libraries.</p>

<p>2) No, that has been done by the compiler for the functions defined in C.</p>

<p>3) Both of those are wrong. You should access arguments relative to <code>esp</code> or, after setting up a standard stack frame, relative to <code>ebp</code>.</p>

<p>4) You should read the appropriate ABI documentation for information about the calling convention. Typically, you can use <code>eax</code>, <code>ecx</code> and <code>edx</code> the rest must be preserved.</p>
