<p>What about something like</p>

<pre><code>for(User user : userList)
{
    System.out.println(user.getName());                 // XXX
    for(Book book : user.getBooksCollection())
    {
        System.out.println("    " + book.getTitle());   // XXX
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where the lines marked as <code>XXX</code> have made up method names you'd need to substitute in for whatever you're calling them.</p>

<p>It'd print a list like:</p>

<pre>
John Smith
    Book Title A
    Book Title B
Bob Smith
    Book Title A
    Book Title C
</pre>

<p>But using the <code>Collection</code> interface seems pretty odd.  Are you sure you can't go deeper down the stack?  Say, with <code>List</code>?</p>
