<p>A really good start is to work through the tutorials step by step on the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">knockoutjs.com</a> site, the tutorials are brilliantly put together and there are live examples which help to demonstrate "real world" scenarios.</p>

<p>Once you are comfortable with the knockout constructs this <a href="http://www.dotnetcurry.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=847">article</a> gives a basic but good illustration of integrating pure knockout with MVC controllers, models and views.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to use <a href="http://knockoutmvc.com">knockoutMVC</a> although it is important to point out that this is an <em>extension</em> of knockout.js and is definitely not required to get knockout working really well in an MVC project (I don't use this but thought I would include for completeness).</p>

<p>Finally if you want to get more advanced, this <a href="http://cgeers.com/2012/10/06/single-page-application-with-knockout-js-part-">SPA guide</a> is a very useful 4-part tutorial on creating a Single Page Application with Knockout and MVC.</p>
