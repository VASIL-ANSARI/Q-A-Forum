<p>Facebook authentication doesn't use the JavaScript api. It handles it server side. Follow the steps from the page you linked and those outlined here <a href="http://docs.nopcommerce.com/display/nc/External+Authentication++Methods" rel="nofollow">http://docs.nopcommerce.com/display/nc/External+Authentication++Methods</a> to enable it.
If you still can't see the login with Facebook button, maybe your template its not rendering it. Check the login views from the default theme for more information.</p>
