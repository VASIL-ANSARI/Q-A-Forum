<p>The problem you are having is with the single quote or apostrophe in the name.  This needs to be escaped.  In PHP, the easiest way to escape a string is mysql_real_escape_string().  I just noticed that this will be deprecated.  In order to escape a string, a \ needs to be placed before the character.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE zen_meta_tags_products_description SET metatags_title = 'What experiences are being evoked in Brancusi\'s Bird' Where products_id=412
</code></pre>

<p>You can change your sql command to:</p>

<p>$db->Execute("  UPDATE zen_meta_tags_products_description SET metatags_title = '".mysql_real_escape_string($p_name)."' Where products_id=$p_id ");</p>

<p>and that should work until mysql_real_escape_string is deprecated.</p>
