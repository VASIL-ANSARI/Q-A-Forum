<p>You cannot do this in a portable manner.  Terminals (and emulators of those such as <a href="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html" rel="nofollow">xterm</a>) give you only the key that was pressed, not the release events.  Graphical user interfaces often provide the ability to receive separate press- and release-events.</p>

<p>Terminal emulators running in a graphical environment compose those events into individual characters.  As read in the graphical environment, those are <em>key symbols</em>, which may contain <em>characters</em>. In addition to the press- and release-events for the key events themselves, you can have <em>modifiers</em> such as shift-, control- and meta-modifiers which are separate events.  If you run <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/current/xev.1.html" rel="nofollow"><code>xev</code></a>, you can see these separate events.</p>

<p>After composing these events into a character, the terminal emulator may send it to your application as a series of data bytes, e.g., in UTF-8 encoding.  When you use <a href="http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/man/curs_getch.3x.html" rel="nofollow"><code>getch()</code></a>, the ncurses library reads those bytes, and puts it together again into a character.  In between those two (the terminal emulator and application) are the pseudo-terminal and <em>its</em> translation, which both terminal emulator and application must manipulate.</p>

<p>If you are <strong>not</strong> running in a graphical environment, there are (not always) other ways than graphical applications such as <code>xev</code> which can read directly the key press/release events.  The Linux console supports that.  See for example the links cited in <em><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1598436/4518274">Receiving key press and key release events in Linux terminal applications?</a></em></p>
