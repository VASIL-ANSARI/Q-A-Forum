<p>The API for getting that information is just:</p>

<pre><code>if (Tcl_Eval(interp, "info script") == TCL_OK) {
    const char *scriptFile = Tcl_GetString(Tcl_GetObjResult(interp));
    // Will be OK until you evaluate another script; copy if necessary
    // ...
} else {
    // Something bad happened; unlikely for just âinfo scriptâ in a normal interp
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's no formal C API for getting the executing script name, as it isn't required all that often. The string produced will be whatever was passed to the <code>source</code> command (or to <code>Tcl_EvalFile()</code> or its relations).</p>

<p>In general, yes, it's safe to call <code>Tcl_Eval</code> from Tcl commands implemented in C. How do you think a command like <code>if</code> or <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> is implemented?</p>
