<p><code>params = ...</code> assigns to a local variable called <code>params</code>. At no point do you actually modify <code>@params</code>, you just create a local variable called <code>params</code> and return it.</p>

<p>You need <code>self.params = ...</code> in every case where you're performing assignment if you intend to use the <code>params=</code> accessor on <code>self</code>.</p>
