<p>Assuming you mean that it is returning you a string instead of an integer you could always try using <code>settype</code> or <code>intval</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$var = '2';
settype($var, "integer");
$var = intval($var);
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you mean that the quotes are for some reason hard-coded in, you could do a string replace, if you are sure that the value will not contain quotes:</p>

<pre><code>ech str_replace("'", "", "'2'"); // prints 2
</code></pre>
