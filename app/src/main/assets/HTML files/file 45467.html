<p>The default <a href="http://statecharts.org">Yakindu SCT</a> C code generator generates plain C code that is agnostic of the concrete execution environment. This means you get a piece of standard C code that you can integrate into you own application manually. This manual integration means mapping events, operations, and variables between your application and the state machine. Additionally you have to trigger the state machine execution properly. </p>

<p>You can find some information on that in the <a href="http://statecharts.org/documentation.html#SpecC">user guide</a>. You could also customize the code generators in order to match your needs but that makes only sense if the integration into the application always look the same and you want to integrate more than one or two state machines.</p>

<p>So if you provide some more information about the application side API that i could provide some hints how to integrate with the state machine. </p>
