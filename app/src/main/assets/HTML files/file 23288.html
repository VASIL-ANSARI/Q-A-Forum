<p>According to the <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php" rel="nofollow">PHP manual for include()</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a file is included, parsing drops out of PHP mode and into HTML
  mode at the beginning of the target file, and resumes again at the
  end. For this reason, any code inside the target file which should be
  executed as PHP code must be enclosed within valid PHP start and end
  tags.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since <code>include()</code> is expecting a PHP file you should check out <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php" rel="nofollow">file_get_contents()</a>.
<em>Note: the behavior changed after PHP 5.</em></p>

<pre><code>$target_file = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/pages/$_page.html";
$html_file = file_get_contents($target_file, true);
echo $html_file;
</code></pre>

<p>If you're trying to get PHP to parse an HTML document like a PHP file, then you'll need to add the directive to your server config or your server <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>AddType application/x-httpd-php .html .htm
</code></pre>

<p>Then you could use <code>include()</code>, <code>include_once()</code>, <code>require()</code>, and <code>require_once()</code>.</p>
