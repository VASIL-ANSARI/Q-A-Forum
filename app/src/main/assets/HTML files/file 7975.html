<p>Just rewrite your program to read your huge text file one line at a time. This is easily done by just changing <code>get_all_words(path)</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>def get_all_words(path):
    return sum((words(line) for line in open(path))
</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of a generator in the parenthesis, which is lazy and will evaluate on demand by the sum function.</p>
