<p>Your code is irrelevant. <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> happens when a class which was available at compilation time is unavailable at runtime. If you provided a full stacktrace, together with the actual name of the class which has not been found, more precise advice could be given.</p>

<p>Typically this happens when you are running your code with a different version of a JAR from the one used to build the code. A rogue JAR may come in from an application container or similar, and be placed earlier on the classpath than your proper JAR.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Given the stacktrace you have added, you are lacking a transitive dependency of Apache POI: XMLBeans. You may be missing this JAR at runtime. This all depends on how exactly you are running your project.</p>
