<p>I ended up figuring it out for myself, but I'm not happy with the way the Validator control replaces \n with \\n.</p>

<p>When building my string that previously had embedded \n in it, instead, I used vbLf, which the Validator replaces with \n.  I then just had to make sure that when I set the value of the control being validated, I replaced any occurrence of vbLf with \n, so that the 2 strings matched for validation.</p>
