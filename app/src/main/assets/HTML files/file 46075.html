<p>Every user (each http-request) will load and execute your JavaScript independently ... i.e. your script-content will be 'fresh' for each user.</p>

<p>When you want communication (with your server or other users), you need to send data to backend, and perhaps distribute that, back to all users from your server. Most people use ajax for that, and I see you already have some ajax-calls in the code ... so maybe you do that already. It is hard to tell.</p>

<p>If you donât want communication between users, you can just store all user-data in local-storage, or keep it in memory.</p>

<p>A more precise answer, needs a more precise question :)</p>
