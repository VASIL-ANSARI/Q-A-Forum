<p>Did you really measure that there is enough memory ?! If you load the 500Mb unzipped into memory, then that's a lot. </p>

<p>I have seen this behavior when running out of memory. I would suggest to try with a smaller test file. If that works, try to implement a streaming solution where the size of the file won't matter since it is never loaded into memory.</p>
