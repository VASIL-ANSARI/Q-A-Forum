<p>Yes it it, you don't have to add any properties for product. As i remember most important things for product are: name, available_on, price,  shipping_category. And you have to have stock or do not track_inventory. 
But remember when you are creating Product you also create master variant. 
It is also nice to have all meta_data.</p>

<p>If you want to you can override admin product views and create them as you want. <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/master/backend/app/views/spree/admin/products" rel="nofollow">Product Views</a></p>
