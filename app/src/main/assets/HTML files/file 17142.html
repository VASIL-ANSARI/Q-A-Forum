<p>Forget about Bayeux Protocol and implementation details.</p>

<p>For stuff like that, such as connecting people that use the same app on similar device, and share their actions and so on, I think that considering <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/GameKit/Reference/GameKit_Collection/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008303" rel="nofollow">GameKit</a> (even if you application is not a game, as you still connect people that will use the application on different devices at the same time, and actions of one user will be refered on other user's devices) might be a good option.</p>

<p>See for example the <code>GKPeerPickerViewController</code> to connect users to each others, the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/GKTank/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40008918" rel="nofollow">GKTank</a> example and so on.</p>
