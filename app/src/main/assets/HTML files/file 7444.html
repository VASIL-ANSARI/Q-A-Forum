<p>It is not compiling because the actions listeners (like <code>SellActionListener</code>, for example) that you are providing (all bar the quit action) are not implementing <code>ActionListener</code>. The method <code>addActionListener</code> expects an object that implements <code>ActionListener</code>.</p>

<p>This:</p>

<pre><code>class SellActionListener{

    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Needs to become this:</p>

<pre><code>class SellActionListener implements ActionListener{

    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(along with the other action listeners)</p>

<h2>For posterity</h2>

<p>These sort of errors can usually be figured out from the compiler feedback. When eclipse said that there were compile errors, you should be able to see the error details. I guess it would say something like <em>"class SellActionListener does not implement the interface ActionListener"</em> (or something along those lines). If you google that error message you might be able to find the answer faster that waiting for someone to answer your specific question.</p>
