<p>First in last out.</p>

<p>The first function call will pause when the sub call is triggered, it will wait for the return value to continue.</p>

<p>So I'll comment your example with the return order</p>

<pre><code>mergesort(int a[], int low, int high) //fourth
{
  int mid;
  if(low&lt;high)
  {
   mid=(low+high)/2;
   mergesort(a,low,mid); // This should be executed and returned first. it will create a chain of functions, it need to be resolved in reverse order before the program continues.
   mergesort(a,mid+1,high); // second
   merge(a,low,high,mid); //third
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However each of the sub functions will spawn their own mergsort functions which will have its own iterations.</p>

<p>That is said, the main mergesort will spawn alot of sub mergsort functions like a chain, once the chain spawning is completed, the last ring of the chain should be able to resolve, that is is should not satisfy (low

<p>If you have experience in BASIC, I would recommend you try it there, they usually allow line by line execution and you can "see" how the code is executed.</p>
