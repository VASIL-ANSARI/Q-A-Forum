<p>Your last Dlookup statement seems absolutely fine so I'm a little confused as to why it isn't working, you may be able to get round the problem like this though:</p>

<pre><code>Combox2_AfterUpdate (Or whatever the event is called)

Dim rs As Recordset

    Set rs = Currentdb.OpenRecordset("SELECT C.Company, R.Customer_ID " &amp; _
                                    "FROM Customer As C, RFI As R " &amp; _
                                    "WHERE C.Customer_ID = R.Customer_ID " &amp; _
                                    "AND R.RFI_ID =" &amp; [Forms]![Request for Info Form]![Combo90] &amp; " " &amp; _
                                    "ORDER BY C.Company")

    CompanyTB = rs!Company

    rs.Close
    Set rs = Nothing

End Sub
</code></pre>
