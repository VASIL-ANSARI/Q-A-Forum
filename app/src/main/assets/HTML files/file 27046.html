<p>The columns must be in the same order when you <code>UNION</code> them together, explicitly list them if * isn't working:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  condition,                                                        
  area,
  [type]
 FROM d_rooms
 UNION
 SELECT 
  condition = '',                                                        
  area,
  [type] 
FROM k_rooms
</code></pre>

<p>Updated making assumptions, if condition isn't in both tables then you need to hard-code it in, '' or <code>NULL</code>.  The conversion problem definitely looks like it's the result of columns that aren't lined up.</p>
