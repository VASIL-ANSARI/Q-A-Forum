<p>When you have a function-constructor like <code>status()</code>, you'll need to call <code>new</code> for it. I've revised part of your code here.</p>

<pre><code>var returnValue = {
  current: new status(),
  cur:function(port){
    current.functionA();
  }}
return returnValue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just to differentiate; <code>create()</code> doesn't need a <code>new</code> statement because you're actually creating and returning an object to refer to, inside of the function.</p>
