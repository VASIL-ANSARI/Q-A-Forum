<p>The problem was in this line: </p>

<pre><code>HSSFRow dynamicRow = spreadSheet.createRow(i + 2);
</code></pre>

<p>I had to assign another variable outside of the for method to keep a int:</p>

<pre><code>int rowNumber = 2;
</code></pre>

<p>and then just increase its value with each row. </p>

<pre><code>HSSFRow dynamicRow = spreadSheet.createRow(rowNumber += 1);
</code></pre>
