<p>I don't know much about Rhino to be honest, but I do know some stuff about Node.js (which is based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/" rel="nofollow">V8</a>), and one of the most important is that <a href="http://nodeguide.com/convincing_the_boss.html#cpu-heavy-apps" rel="nofollow">it's not recommended for heavy cpu usage apps</a>.</p>

<p>The best thing would be to write C++ addons for stuff that you know will take an important amount of CPU.</p>

<p>Another useful link that you should read is about <a href="http://fabric-engine.com/products/what-is-fabric-engine/" rel="nofollow">Fabric</a> and (for ex.) what it does to improve a basic fibonacci server to perform better: <a href="http://fabric-engine.com/2011/11/benchmark-node-js-fibonacci-server/" rel="nofollow">http://fabric-engine.com/2011/11/benchmark-node-js-fibonacci-server/</a></p>
