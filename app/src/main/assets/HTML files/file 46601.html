<p>I found my answers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems" rel="nofollow">here</a> by going to each filesystem's articles and looking up its <strong>Date Resolution</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>FAT8</strong></p>

<p>Does not record dates and is not supported in Windows.</p>

<p><strong>FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B and FAT32</strong></p>

<p>Some of these are not supported in Windows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Last Modified Time: 2 s</li>
<li>Creation Time: 10 ms</li>
<li>Access Time: 1 day</li>
<li>Deletion Time: 2 s</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>exFAT</strong></p>

<p>10 ms for all records.</p>

<p><strong>NTFS</strong></p>

<p>100 ns for all records.</p>

<p><strong>Live File System (UDF)</strong></p>

<p>1 Î¼s for all records.</p>

<p><strong>ReFS</strong></p>

<p>Could not find resolution details, but its pretty modern so I'm assuming most of the worst cases are above and that not many people will be using it at the moment. Perhaps someone can spruce this post up when they find out.</p>

<p>So, to answer the questions:</p>

<p><strong>1. Which one has the worst resolution in Windows for a file's last write time?</strong></p>

<p>2 seconds, the FAT filesystem.</p>

<p><strong>2. Which one has the worst resolution in Windows for a file's creation time?</strong></p>

<p>10 ms, also the FAT filesystem.</p>
