<p>Why do you put such complex HTML inside a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>? Normally, a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> just needs a <code>for=</code> attribute to point to the <code>id</code> of an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. This should be enough to make the input get focus when the user clicks the label. You can bind to the focus event and continue from there.</p>
