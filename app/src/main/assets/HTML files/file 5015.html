  <p>What is this kind of optimization called?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure if there is a "proper" term for it, but I've heard it called query batching or just plain batching.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Is it worth doing?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether it is worth the effort optimizing the query at all,</li>
<li>the number of elements in the set; i.e. <code>... IN ( ... )</code>,</li>
<li>the overheads of making a JDBC request versus the costs of query compilation, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>But in the right circumstances this is <em>definitely</em> a worthwhile optimization.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can it be implemented cleanly from a Java application?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on your definition of "clean" :-)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do existing Java ORM technologies help?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the specific ORM technology you are talking, but (for example) the Hibernate HQL language supports the constructs that would allow you to do this kind of thing.</p>
