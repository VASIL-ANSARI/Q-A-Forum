<p>You want to use <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-60" rel="nofollow">backticks</a> rather than the <code>system</code> method. Just enclose your shell command in backticks, and the return value will be a string containing whatever it output to standard out.</p>

<pre><code>@word = `artii Hello World`
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Be careful not to pass user input to the shell without sanitizing it first, to prevent malicious users from executing arbitrary shell commands. As long as you're the one supplying the string in backticks, and not the user, you're fine. </p>
