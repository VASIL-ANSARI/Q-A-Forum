<p>I can't recommend this method as it's likely a <strong>bad thing</strong> on many levels, but it did solve my problem. I ended up copying the <code>shared/bundle</code> folder from the staging server to the production server. Bundler sees that the gems are already installed and doesn't try to reinstall them. </p>
