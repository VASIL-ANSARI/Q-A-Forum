<p>It looks to me that <code>DateMadeActive</code> in <code>[RecordStateField]</code> is a VARCHAR(255) field.  Could you post the table definitions?</p>

<p>I ask this because MIN() has neve rchanged the type for me before.  And so if the result is a VARCHAR(255) it seems the input must also be a VARCHAR(255)</p>
