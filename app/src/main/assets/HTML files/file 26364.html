<p>You need to use</p>

<pre><code>String dayOfWeek = getDayOfWeek(c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK));
</code></pre>

<p>What you were doing before</p>

<pre><code>String dayOfWeek = getDayOfWeek(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK);
</code></pre>

<p>is calling your method with a random constant (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18882420/want-to-get-day-of-a-week-as-a-string-but-giving-wrong-day/18882471?noredirect=1#comment27868970_18882471">that happens to be 7</a>) the <code>Calendar</code> class is using to represent the <code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code> field in a date.</p>

<p>What you are actually looking for is getting the value of the day of the week in your <code>Calendar</code> instance, which is what <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html#get%28int%29"><code>Calendar#get(int)</code></a></p>

<pre><code>c.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK)
</code></pre>

<p>returns.</p>
