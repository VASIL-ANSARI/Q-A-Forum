<p>since you said that you need to structure it like this, i won't mention any of the reasons to not use this approach, and try to reply directly to your question.</p>

<p>this line: </p>

<pre><code>if(document.images[0].onmouseover)
</code></pre>

<p>is just testing "if the first image in the document has a mouseover of any sort defined" and has nothing to do with the currently executing function</p>

<p>if you want to tell if the executing element is being called, since you're using directly attached handlers (as opposed to event delegation), you can just check "this":</p>

<pre><code>if(this == document.images[0])
</code></pre>

<p>or, you can test against the event target, but that'd require a little crossbrowser chicanery...  something like this would work</p>

<pre><code>function changePic_onmouseover(e) {
if(!e) e = window.event;
var target = e.target || e.srcElement;
if(target == document.images[0]) // do stuff
</code></pre>
