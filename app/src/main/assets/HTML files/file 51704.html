<p>The first thing you need to check is if GoDaddy supports 4.5.1 on their server. Once this is confirmed? We can start working!</p>

<p>Helios (the shim between IIS and ASP.NET 5) requires at least 4.5.1 to run so this is why it's essential. </p>

<p>Only thing missing is running a <code>dnu publish</code> and making sure that you have a web.config with this section in it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.webServer&gt;
  &lt;modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" /&gt;
&lt;/system.webServer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If it doesn't work, I would get in touch with GoDaddy for some support. If they do not support the latest version of the framework, you might have to revert to MVC 5 or switch to <a href="/questions/tagged/azure-web-sites" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;azure-web-sites&#39;" rel="tag">azure-web-sites</a> if you really want to enable <a href="/questions/tagged/asp.net-mvc-6" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;asp.net-mvc-6&#39;" rel="tag">asp.net-mvc-6</a>.</p>
