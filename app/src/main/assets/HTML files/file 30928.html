<p>OK, I've ran experiments and the answer seems to be that in rest easy 2.01GA running in JBoss jboss-as-7.1.1.Final I get different instances for the preProcess and the postProcess.</p>

<p>So the answer to "would this be legal?" is NO.</p>

<p>So as a workaround I'm including the context of the HttpServletRequest and storing the state as a request attribute:</p>

<pre><code>@ServerInterceptor
@Provider
public class MyInterceptor implements PreProcessInterceptor, PostProcessInterceptor {

    private static final String ATTRIBUTE_NAME = MyInterceptor.class.getName();

    @Context
    HttpServletRequest servletRequest;

    @Override
    public ServerResponse preProcess(HttpRequest request, ResourceMethod resourceMethod) throws Failure, WebApplicationException {
        String url = request.getUri().getRequestUri().toString();
        servletRequest.setAttribute(ATTRIBUTE_NAME, url);
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void postProcess(ServerResponse response) {
        String url = servletRequest.getAttribute(ATTRIBUTE_NAME);
        System.out.println(url);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I found for my use this wasn't adequate as the postProcess isn't called when there's an error (401, 500 etc.), I ended up using a <code>javax.servlet.Filter</code></p>
