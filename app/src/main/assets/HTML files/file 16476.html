<p>I fix the problem by using an IDE plugin called <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">Resharper</a>.  (Among <strong><em>many, many</em></strong> useful features) it highlights when a namespace is wrong (based on the folder hierarchy and root namespace of the assembly) and can fix it for you.</p>

<p>Note that unlike in Java, there are sometimes very valid reasons for a class to be in a namespace <em>other</em> than the one inferred by the directory structure.  A good example might be extension method classes, which need to be in scope in the class that is invoking them.  Therefore it is common to have:</p>

<pre><code>/myProject
  /extensions
     /MyExtensionMethodClass.cs
</code></pre>

<p>with a namespace like <code>myProject</code> (so that the extension methods can be used anywhere in myProject without a using directive)</p>
