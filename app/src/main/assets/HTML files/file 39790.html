<p>So found my problem. Since I had my server and app on two different localhost adresses the request was cross domain (CORS). So I fixed it by allowing CORS calls in my server route. </p>

<p>I added to the header part: </p>

<pre><code>res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
  });
</code></pre>
