<p>That's a lot of code to digest looking for errors, but off the top of my head nothing will happen until <code>timeSpanSubject.onNext()</code> is called. I don't see this called anywhere but maybe there is some missing code you are not showing.</p>

<p>If there is no missing code that calls <code>timeSpanSubject.onNext()</code>, then you could use either a <code>BehaviorSubject</code> which will emit an item when first subscribed to or another Observable such as <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/timer.html" rel="nofollow"><code>timer</code></a> or <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/interval.html" rel="nofollow"><code>interval</code></a> depending on what you are trying to do. <code>timer</code> would subscribe to your <code>trendingSearch</code> Observable a single time whereas using an <code>interval</code> would subscribe multiple times.</p>
