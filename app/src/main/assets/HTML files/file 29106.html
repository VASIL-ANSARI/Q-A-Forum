<p>You can add different types of hyperlinks. By default, Excel assumes that you want to link a file in your hard drive (in the folder where the spreadsheet it). To tell Excel that you want a website, you have to write the full address (with the starting <code>http://</code> bit).</p>

<pre><code>string hyperlinkTargetAddress = "http://www.bing.com"; 
</code></pre>
