<p>I think it's probably a mistake to assume that textBounds.bottom = 0. For those descending characters, the bottom parts of those characters are probably below 0 (which means textBounds.bottom > 0). You probably want something like:</p>

<p><code>canvas.drawText(text, 0, textBounds.top, paint); //instead of textBounds.height()</code></p>

<p>If your textBounds is from +5 to -5, and you draw text at y=height (10), then you'll only see the top half of the text.</p>
