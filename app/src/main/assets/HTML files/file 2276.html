<p>You destroy things that need destroying. If your class created objects using new, you probably need a destructor that deletes them using a destructor. Note that containers like LinkedList should contain only elements that have been dynamically allocated or ones that are not. If you mix the two, or mix originals and copies, as I suspect you are doing, you probably need to use smart pointers or reference counting.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you really need to reverse a singly-linked list (something in 30 years of programming I've never needed to do), you are simply using the wrong data structure - you should be using a doubly linked list, in which case there is no need to do anything.</p>

<p>And thirdly, can I say that your C++ style is non-idiomatic and to me nearly unreadable - making C++ look like Java is NOT a good idea. Change to:</p>

<pre><code>class LinkedList
{
    private:
       ListElement *start;
    public:
       LinkedList();
       void AddElement(int val);
       void PrintList();
       void InvertList();
};
</code></pre>
