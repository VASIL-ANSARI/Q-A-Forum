<p>You haven't provided enough details for me to help you with search, but here's an easy way to export to a CSV file (which Excel can open):</p>

<pre><code>$f = fopen('export.csv', 'w');
foreach ($data as $row) fputcsv($f, $row);
fclose($f);
</code></pre>

<p>This is assuming that $data is an array of arrays.</p>
