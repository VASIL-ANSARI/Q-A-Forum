<blockquote>
  <p>How can I paint what is currently loaded in a gif to a canvas element before it finishes loading the entire gif</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can't.</p>

<p>It's not a bug per se. The spec dictates that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the image argument is an HTMLImageElement object that is not fully decodable ... then the implementation must return without drawing anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason it works when you do <code>stop()</code> the image is technically declared fully available. Or more accurately in plain English, "as available as its going to get."</p>

<p>Your best bet assuming you want this functionality is to make many small images out of the gif's frames and use them as they load. Any other solution (such as breaking up the gif on the fly) would necessitate loading the entire gif first, which you seem to have deemed unacceptable.</p>
