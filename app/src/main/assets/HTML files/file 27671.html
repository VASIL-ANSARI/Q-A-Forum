<p>That's not how it works.
You should add the delegation to the parent element. The one who is going to suffer from modification. </p>

<p>You can do it with the whole document:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).on('click', '.btn-comment, .btn-youtube', function(){ ... });
</code></pre>

<p>But it would be better to do it with the modified element.</p>
