<p>The reason that <code>IFNULL</code> doesn't work is that it only has an effect on values. A result set with no rows has no values, so it does nothing.</p>

<p>First, it's probably better to do this on the client than on the server. But if you have to do it on the server, there's a couple of approaches I can think of.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT IFNULL(SUM(score), 0) AS score
FROM score
WHERE processID=? and operationID=? and type=?
ORDER BY processid
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>SUM</code> ensures that exactly one row will be returned.</p>

<p>If you need to return multiple rows when the table contains multiple matching rows then you can use this (omitting the ORDER BY for simplicity):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT score
FROM score
WHERE processID = ? and operationID = ? and type = ?

UNION ALL

SELECT 0
FROM (SELECT 0) T1
WHERE NOT EXISTS
(
    SELECT *
    FROM score
    WHERE processID = ? and operationID = ? and type = ?
)
</code></pre>
