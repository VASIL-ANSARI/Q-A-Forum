<p>According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FASP-NET-AJAX-Action-Alessandro-Gallo%2Fdp%2F1933988142&amp;tag=diaryofamadma-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET AJAX in Action</a>, p. 257</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just before the old markup is replaced with the updated HTML, all the DOM elements in the panel are examined for Microsoft Ajax behaviours or controls attached to them. To avoid memory leaks, the components associated with DOM elements are disposed, and then destroyed when the HTMl is replaced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as far as I know, any asp.net ajax components within the update panel are disposed to prevent memory leaks, but anything else in there will just be replaced with the html received.</p>

<p>So if you don't have any asp.net ajax components in the target container for the response, it would be basically the same as an inner html replacement with any other js framework / ajax request, so i would say that it's just the how the browser handles this, rather than asp.net ajax causing this.</p>

<p>Also, while it may be "leaking", it may be by design, meaning that the browser might not have reclaimed the dom elements yet and released them. Also, drip might be causing those to leak, as it is attaching to those dom elements.</p>
