<p>Finally Found a Solution
The jqGrid library doesnt allow to edit the row on error is because they unbind the enter key event in save function . 
<strong>The Fix</strong>
Remove this line of code from the library itself and it worked :</p>

<pre><code>$(ind).removeClass("jqgrid-new-row").unbind("keydown");
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps to someone !!!</p>
