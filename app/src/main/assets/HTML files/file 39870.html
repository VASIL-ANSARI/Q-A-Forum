<p>Good, your comment clears things up. To get your csv into unicode, you should run: <code>import codecs</code> then:</p>

<p><code>f = codecs.open("/Users/shannonmcgregor/Desktop/ShanTweets.csv","r","utf-8")</code></p>

<p>Then if you recheck the type of your csv, you should see unicode. This is of course assuming your Tweets are utf-8 compliant, which appeared to be the case (I took a quick peek!). If you plan on working with strings in Python, I recommend reading up on encodings--they will become important for your work.</p>
