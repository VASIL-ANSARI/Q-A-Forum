<p>Not too sure about this, but hypothetically, you could give each checkbox a class, eg chkbox, and then have some jquery code to handle a click event:</p>

<p>$('chkbox').click(function() {
                alert("here is where you put your popup code");
            });</p>

<p>You could use window.open here</p>
