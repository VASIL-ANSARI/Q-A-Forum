<p>You've configured your apache setup incorrectly (AND you have a typo in your html file). Put the HTML file in your document root (see your docroot setting) and the CGI in the <code>/cgi-bin/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Then in chrome, go to <code>http://localhost/test.html</code></p>

<p>fyi -- the typo in your HTML file does not correctly reference your cgi-bin. Line 3 is missing a forward slash. It should be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name="search" action="/cgi-bin/test.py" method="get"&gt;
</code></pre>
