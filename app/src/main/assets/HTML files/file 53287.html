<p>That is because a <code>set</code> is an unordered sequence.  When you define the <code>set</code>, it is not ordered.  When you try to print it, it needs to come up with some way to order it, but it is unrelated to what order the elements of the <code>set</code> were given.  Also, when you try to create a <code>list</code> from the <code>set</code>, it needs to come up with some order.  What order it comes up with will always be the same, but it is completely unrelated to what order the elements are given.</p>
