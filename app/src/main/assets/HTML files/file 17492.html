<p>If your callbackFunc is called from this asynchronous thread it may cause race conditions that might cause such a behaviour (cocos caches all the rendered font labels and the CCTextureManager is not thread safe). </p>

<p>Also (I think you can find the following info in Apple's OpenGL programming guide) - it is not safe to call all the OpenGL methods from different threads. And if you create this string "test" in a different thread, cocos actually ends up creating a new OpenGL texture (which might be not proper since created in a different thread). I think you can check this theory by creating a different label with the same "test" text somewhere else (on main thread) - if the one created in your code snippet no longer disappears - it means the theory is correct :)</p>

<p>How to fix it? </p>

<p>I believe you have to create the label (or set text on it) in your main UI thread - for example remember the result of your async callback in a queue and check it periodically in your update method somewhere. And remember about proper locking.</p>
