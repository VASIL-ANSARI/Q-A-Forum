  <p>If there must be multiple autoload functions, spl_autoload_register() allows for this. It effectively creates a queue of autoload functions, and runs through each of them in the order they are defined. </p>

<p>It's queue. Second autoload function would run if first autoload function did not define a class.</p>

<p>So, you do not need to throw an exception in your autoload method because it would prevent launching second autoload method in your autoload queue.</p>
