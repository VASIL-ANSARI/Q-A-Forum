  <p>I tried the following, and it does not work: <code>string s1=(char) 97;</code></p>

<p>That's because the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/basic_string" rel="nofollow"><code>std::string</code> constructor</a> doesn't have any overload that takes a single <code>char</code>. And also, copy is elided so the constructor is called directly, <code>operator =()</code> is never called (document yourself on <strong>copy elision</strong>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the conversion works only if I break the assignment apart like this: <code>string s1; s1=(char) 97;</code></p>

<p>Now the copy is not elided any more, you are really calling <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/operator=" rel="nofollow"><code>std::string::operator =()</code></a> which <em>does</em> have an overload accepting a single <code>char</code>.</p>
