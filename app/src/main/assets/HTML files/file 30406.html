<p>It looks like your middleTabView is obscuring your leftTabView (which is the superview of your scrollview). Either bring the leftTabView to the top of the view hierarchy:</p>

<pre><code>[self.leftTabView.superview bringSubViewToFront:self.leftTabView];
</code></pre>

<p>or disable user interactions or visibility of your middleTabView (or add the leftTabView last).</p>
