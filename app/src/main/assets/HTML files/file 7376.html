<p>There are no virtual constructors in C++ though it is possible to <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/virtual-functions.html#faq-20.8">simulate the behavior</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Why no virtual constructors in C++?</em></strong><br>
<strong><em>My attempt to give a Reasoning:</em></strong><br>
The standard states that the object creation is not complete until the closing brace of the constructor. Thus a object exists only after the constructor ends. </p>

<p>Virtual keyword is used to implement a polymorphic behavior, where in actual function to be called is evaluated at run time, depending on the actual type of object, <code>this</code> is pointing to. In order for the constructor to be dispatched using the virtual table mechanism, there has to be an completely existing object with a pointer to the virtual table, but inside a constructor the object construction itself is not complete so how can a pointer to the virtual table exist if the object isn't completely formed?</p>
