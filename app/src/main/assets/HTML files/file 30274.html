<p>I have been working on something very similar in the past days. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10979323/new-foursquare-venue-detail-map">This</a> answer is actually quite good, but you will suffer a bit in terms of performance. After more tweaking, I used parts of <a href="https://github.com/mstrchrstphr/LocationPickerView" rel="nofollow">this</a> library. You don't need to use everything, but keep in mind the following when choosing a library:</p>

<ol>
<li>Libs that base the movement of the map on the <code>map.centerCoordinate</code> are less performant than libs that base the movement on the map's <code>frame</code>. </li>
</ol>

<p>You can also read a bit from this <a href="https://twitter.com/XSody/status/418418906001186816" rel="nofollow">tweets exchange</a> I had.</p>

<p>My thoughts about what FourSquare actually did, is that in the beginning they are using a screenshot of the map, so they are not really using a <code>MKMapView</code>, but an <code>UIImageView</code>. Once you touch it and you animate it, they switch between one and another and they start using a map. I will be using Reveal App plus <a href="http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2013/how-to-inspect-the-view-hierarchy-of-3rd-party-apps/" rel="nofollow">this</a> to know exactly what they are doing.</p>
