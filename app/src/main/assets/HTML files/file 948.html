<p>Just make a new record in your webserver setting tomsite.com directly to your mywebapp.com/user/tom/ path ?</p>

<p>See it like an alias :)</p>

<p>Ofcourse, since you're asp.net/windows based, i think you'll have to digg deep into IIS to automate this kind of stuff. If you were on apache it would be adding 3 simple lines to httpd.conf.</p>
