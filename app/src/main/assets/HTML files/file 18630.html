<p>You should compile with all warnings and debugging info enabled (if using <em>GCC</em> e.g. on Linux, that means compiling with <code>gcc -Wall -g</code>).</p>

<p>Then you should learn how to use the debugger (i.e. <code>gdb</code> on Linux) and possibly a leak detector like <a href="http://valgrind.org/" rel="nofollow">valgrind</a></p>

<p>a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault" rel="nofollow">segmentation fault</a> may happen if you dereference some "bad" pointer, e.g. a NULL one or an uninitialized one. It also may happen if you write into a read-only segment (you are probably overwriting a string literal which is put into a read-only -so called <code>.text</code> or <code>.rodata</code>- segment)</p>

<p>Taking account of every warning of the compiler (and enabling them) and using a debugger are essential skills of any C programmer.</p>
