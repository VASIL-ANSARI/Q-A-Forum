<p>The iPhone uses <a href="http://www.skyhookwireless.com/" rel="nofollow">Skyhook Wireless</a> for determining WiFi location. You can submit your information using their <a href="http://skyhookwireless.com/howitworks/submit_ap.php" rel="nofollow">submission page</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Apparently this is no longer true. Apple seems to aggregate this data from iOS devices directly now. See the comments.</p>
