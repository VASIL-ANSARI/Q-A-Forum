<p>Mysql only excepts dates in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format. That is why you are getting errors such as <code>1292 Truncated incorrect date value: '05/18/2011'</code></p>

<p>You can change this in Excel before doing your import.</p>

<p>In order to change the date format in excel: right click on the top cell. Choose <code>format cells</code> from the drop down list. change the <code>local</code> to something like <code>'Afrikans'</code>. Choose the format that looks like <code>2001-03-14</code>. Use the top cell to <code>fill down</code>. Then save the document. </p>

<p>Just a quick note: Excel sometimes tries to do too much and will revert this column back to a the <code>English(U.S)</code> default time zone. So, if you plan on doing more editing make sure that the column has not reverted back.</p>
