<p>you have to call it in the callback function of the ajax call, not after it:</p>

<pre><code>$.post("some_url", {var: var1 .... etc}, function(data){ //the same with $.ajax, $.get
     //HERE !
});
</code></pre>

<p>the callback function is executed after your ajax call is done, if you modified or added any DOM elements with the ajax call you need to apply the jquery functions after that modification.</p>
