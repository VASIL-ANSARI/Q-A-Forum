<p>Devise will handle registration and login/logout. It will not do anything else. Index is a typical controller action within rails. When you generated a user scaffold did you add any extra parameters? <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html" rel="nofollow">Rails getting started</a> has the basic documentation. Scroll down to the 6th section about scaffolds. When you generate a scaffold you create a Model, a View, and a Controller. Section 7 of that tutorial generates a model from scratch. In your case a user model may have a string for a name and a string for an email. A model can have many attributes like boolean values or integers. (You will want to add devise attributes for authentication like password, but that can be added later.)  So try generating a scaffold again but with <code>rails generate scaffold user name:string email:string</code>. This will add name and email columns to your user model. From there the scaffold should set you up with the default actions in the controller and basic views. Then you should have your index action.</p>
