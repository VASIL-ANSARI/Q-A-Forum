<p>Updates are kind of like if-thens themselves, and there is also if-then support of some sort in most SQL implementations. A simple solution might be:</p>

<pre><code>update &lt;tablename&gt;
  set widget_id = widget_id + "somenumber/"
  where row_id = X
    and widget_id not like "%/somenumber/%"
    and widget_id not like "somenumber/%";
</code></pre>
