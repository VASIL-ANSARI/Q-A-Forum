<p>The documentation at <a href="http://api.cakephp.org/class/router#method-Routerconnect" rel="nofollow">http://api.cakephp.org/class/router#method-Routerconnect</a> does a great job at explaining this.</p>

<p>What you've done is created a custom parameter. Cake uses an array to keep track of the parameters and that how it know which controller, action and other parameters have been passed. The Router will convert any URLs with 3 slashes (/) to <code>$param['site']</code>, <code>$param['controller']</code> and <code>$param['action']</code>.</p>

<p>From your controller, you can retrieve the value of :site by using <code>$this-&gt;params['site']</code>.</p>
