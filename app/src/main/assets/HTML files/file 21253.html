<p>I found the problem.<br>
The lines <br></p>

<pre><code>mos_hp_properties AS p,
mos_hp_companies AS c 
</code></pre>

<p><br>
should be in reverse order.<br>
Open components/com_hotproperty/hotproperty.php and change lines 711/712 with this code: </p>

<pre><code>$sql2 .= "\n FROM #__hp_companies AS c, #__hp_properties AS p "
. "\n LEFT JOIN #__hp_prop_types AS t ON p.type = t.id"
</code></pre>
