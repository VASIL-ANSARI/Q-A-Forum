<p>Due to Javascript's scoping, the scoped variable <code>first</code> is overriding the global variable first. In other words, you're adding <code>second</code> to the scoped version of <code>first</code> inside your function (which is scoped because you're declaring it inside the function), and the global version of <code>first</code> is unaffected.</p>

<p>If you remove the <code>first</code>'s declaration from the function, Javascript goes for the next version of <code>first</code> it can find--in this case, the global one. </p>
