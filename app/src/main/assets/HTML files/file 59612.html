<p>"cv void" is not a real type. "cv" here is a shorthand for "possibly cv-qualified", which means "may have a <code>const</code> or a <code>volatile</code> on it".</p>

<p>The passage means that a pointer-to-member may not point to an object of the following types: <code>void</code>, <code>const void</code>, <code>volatile void</code> and <code>const volatile void</code>. It's fairly obvious, since such objects cannot exist in the first place, but I guess it's nice to be clear.</p>
