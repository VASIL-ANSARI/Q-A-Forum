<p>If I'm not mistaken, HipHop has not been released yet -- even the <a href="http://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wikis" rel="nofollow">wiki page</a> linked from the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=358" rel="nofollow">Facebook annoucement yesterday</a> is not up yet.</p>

<p>So, it's going to be a bit hard to answer, right now.</p>

<p><br>
I suppose it'll all depend on :</p>

<ul>
<li>The features used by the Frameworks -- like already said here and there, stuff like <code>eval</code> is not supported by HipHop</li>
<li>The PHP extensions used by the Frameworks : only a couple of those have been ported by Facebook to HipHop.</li>
<li>Depending on the Frameworks and your specific needs, maybe/probably some subsets of the Frameworks you are using will be supported, even if not every available components... I suppose time will tell which ;-)</li>
</ul>
