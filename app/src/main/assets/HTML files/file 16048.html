<p>Instead of just selecting data after creating a temp table you have to insert it into the temp table:</p>

<pre><code>Create Table #First_Pay(SAID int,
                        First_Payment date)

insert into #First_Pay select b.CUSTNMBR, min(b.docdate) as first_payment
                       from RM20101 b
                       where b.CUSTNMBR = '1973204005'
                       and b.CHEKNMBR &gt; '1'
                       Group by b.CUSTNMBR

Create Table #First_Bil(SAID int,
                        First_Bill date)

insert into #First_Bil Select a.CUSTNMBR, MIN(a.Tax_Date) as First_Bill
                       from SOP30200 as a
                       where a.CUSTNMBR = '1973204005'
                       Group by a.CUSTNMBR
</code></pre>
