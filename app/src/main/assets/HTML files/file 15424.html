<p>If <code>l</code> is the list in question</p>

<pre><code>[(x, y) for x in l for y in l if x &lt; y]
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could create a generator:</p>

<pre><code>def pairs(l):
  for x in l:
    for y in l:
      if x &lt; y:
        yield x, y
</code></pre>

<p>This has the advantage of being able to generate pairs "on the fly", without having to keep them all in memory at the same time.</p>

<p>Something similar can be achieved using <code>itertools.product(l, l)</code>, but this would generate both <code>(x, y) and (y, x)</code>, and will also produce pairs like <code>(x, x)</code>. To filter those out, you'd have to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>itertools.ifilter(lambda (x,y): x &lt; y, itertools.product(l,l))
</code></pre>
