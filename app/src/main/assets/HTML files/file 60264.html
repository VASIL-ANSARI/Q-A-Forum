<p>I believe this is a bug in PutSQL that is hiding an issue either in the JDBC configuration, SQL statement, or something else. Using the standalone JDBC driver with valid SQL INSERT statements, I was able to PutSQL working with Crate.</p>

<p>Can you double-check your connection information and SQL statement(s)? Also if you can reproduce and want to share the SQL and/or connection info (JDBC URL, e.g.), please feel free, it could help get to the bottom of the PutSQL bug that is hiding another issue.</p>
