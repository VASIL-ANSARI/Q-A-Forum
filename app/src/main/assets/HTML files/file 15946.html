<p>I see two options...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have client side validation that would not allow the form to be submitted if the there are formatting issues.</p></li>
<li><p>On the server side you will have to have a mechanism of handling the exception that would catch it and report the problem back to client.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Well not having client side validations may not be a good user experience. Users do not want to be reminded about validation errors after they have made a server round trip. However, if this is still a constraint have a look at following url and it gives elegant way of handling such issues and reporting informative error messages.</p>
