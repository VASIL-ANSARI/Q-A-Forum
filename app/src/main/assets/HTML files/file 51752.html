<p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1679" rel="nofollow">A recent issue on Webpack Github</a></p>

<p>Basically, you can spawn a new worker for each entry, or collection of up to your number of cpus, like so:</p>

<pre><code>var _ = require('lodash');
var os = require('os');

var entries = [...]; // your entries go here

module.exports = _.chunk(entries, os.cpus().length).map(function(entry) {
  return {
    entry: entry,
    ... rest of your config ...
  };
});
</code></pre>

<p>I found this hard to get to work, honestly, but I have a funky setup. Who doesn't?</p>
