<li><p>You've overriden the method <code>test</code> in your subclass <code>S</code> and you're constructing an object of type <code>S</code>. So in the superclass constructor, when <code>test()</code> is invoked, it invokes the overriden version of <code>test()</code> from the subclass <code>S</code>. That's the point of overriding.</p></li>
<li><p>Same as 1. The method <code>print</code> is <em>not</em> abstract in class <code>Derived</code>, and you're constructing in instance of <code>Derived</code>, not of <code>Base</code>. (It is illegal to say <code>new Base()</code> for the reason that you mentioned: you can't invoke an abstract method)</p></li>
