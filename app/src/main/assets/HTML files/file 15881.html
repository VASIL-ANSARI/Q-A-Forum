<p>Check out virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper. Like maven, these are third-party projects and not part of the language distribution itself. I have no idea what maven does exactly, so I can't say for sure whether virtualenv is directly equivalent. It's mainly intended for development and testing environments.</p>
