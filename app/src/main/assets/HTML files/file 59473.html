<p>You could set up a switch case:</p>

<pre><code>switch (caseDecider)
        {
            //ON/OFF
            case 1:
                //set UI elements to apropriate states here
                break;
            //ON/CLOSE//OFF
            case 2:
                //set UI elements to apropriate states here
                break;
            //OFF
            case 3:
                //set UI elements to apropriate states here
                break;
            //ON/CLOSE/OFF/NEW
            case 4:
                //set UI elements to apropriate states here
                break;
            //ON
            default:
                //set UI elements to apropriate states here
                break;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>you'll just need to figure out where you are setting the "caseDecider" variable, and where you are placing the switch.  Switches are often a better option than if/else because of readability, flexibility, and requiring less typing.</p>

<p>EDIT:  if you want to simplify setting each of your 5 states, write a function that sets each state. Something like: </p>

<pre><code>private void setState1()
        {
                onBtn.startX = 242;
                onBtn.width = 116;
                onBtn.gap = 0;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>for each state.  Then you just call that function whenever you want to set that state.</p>
