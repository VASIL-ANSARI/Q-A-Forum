<p>The problem was a C# issue for dummies... had to create parameter each time instead of using the previous one, i.e. put at the begining of each block:</p>

<pre><code>AseParameter extraParam = command.CreateParameter();
</code></pre>

<p>Also, another issue was that I needed to set the direction to:</p>

<pre><code>extraParam.Direction = ParameterDirection.Output;
</code></pre>
