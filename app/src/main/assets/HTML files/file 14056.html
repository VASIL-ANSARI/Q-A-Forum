<p>Instead of adding the table reload to your main queue, try </p>

<p><code>[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(doSomething:) withObject:object waitUntilDone:YES]</code></p>

<p>That will reload the table on the main thread, but pause your custom queue until it is complete, thereby preventing the error you are experiencing.</p>
