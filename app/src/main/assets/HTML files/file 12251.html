<p>The wrapping with double quotes was already the correct idea, but you have to make sure you do it correctly. You can put a column within double quotes, then everything inside is considered as a single value. Quotes itself have to be escaped by writing two of them (<code>""</code>).</p>

<p>See for example this:</p>

<pre><code>Column A;Column B;Column C
Column A;"Column B; with semicolon";Column C
Column A;"Column B"";"" with semicolon and quotes";Column C
Column A;"=HYPERLINK(""http://example.com""; ""Example"")";Column C
</code></pre>
