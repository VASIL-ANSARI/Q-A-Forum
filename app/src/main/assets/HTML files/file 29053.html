<p>For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" rel="nofollow">Basic Auth</a> where the credentials are sent on each request it's expected. </p>

<p>In order for the ServiceClient to retain the Session cookies that have been authenticated you should set the <code>RememberMe</code> flag when you authenticate, e.g using <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.WebHost.Endpoints.Tests/AuthTests.cs#L395" rel="nofollow">CredentialsAuthProvider</a>:</p>

<pre><code>var client = new JsonServiceClient(BaseUrl);
var authResponse = client.Send(new Authenticate {
    provider = "credentials", 
    UserName = "user",
    Password = "p@55word",
    RememberMe = true,
});
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Sessions" rel="nofollow">Behind the scenes</a> this attaches the user session to the <code>ss-pid</code> cookie (permanent session cookie), which the client retains and resends on subsequent requests from that ServiceClient instance.</p>
