<p>Based on your sample data and guessing that you have groups of the same <code>TargetDateTime</code>, the following should do it.</p>

<pre><code>;WITH MyCTE AS
(
    SELECT  TargetDateTime,
            Location,
            TransferDateTime
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY TargetDateTime ORDER BY TransferDateTime) AS rn
    FROM    TableName
    WHERE   TransferDateTime &gt;= TargetDateTime 
)
SELECT * 
FROM   MyCTE 
WHERE  rn = 1
</code></pre>
