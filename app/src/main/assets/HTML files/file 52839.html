<p>I'd say that this is a reasonable approach given the context of an intro to C++ class. I'd even say that it's fairly likely that this is the approach your instructor expects to see.</p>

<p>There are, of course, a few optimization tweaks that can be done. Like instantiating a 256-element <code>bool</code> array, using <code>good_chars</code> to set the corresponding values to <code>true</code>, and all others defaulting to <code>false</code>, then replacing the <code>find()</code> call with a quick array lookup.</p>

<p>But, I'd predirect that if you were to hand in such a thing, you'll be suspected of copying stuff you found on the intertubes, so leave that alone.</p>

<p>One thing you might consider doing is using <code>tolower</code> when you <code>push_back</code> each character, instead, and removing the extra <code>std::transform</code> pass over the word.</p>
