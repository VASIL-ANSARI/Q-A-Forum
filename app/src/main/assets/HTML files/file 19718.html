<p>Tokenizing the command line into arguments for your program is the responsibility of your shell, not yours. So there's nothing for you to do.</p>

<p>Just put quotation marks around strings that contain spaces, or escape spaces with backslashes on your command line, and your <code>--foo</code> value can contain as many spaces as you like.</p>
