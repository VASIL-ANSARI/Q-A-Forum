<p>From the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developerâs Manual:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2.3.11 AVX Instruction Length</strong></p>
  
  <p>The maximum length of an Intel 64 and IA-32 instruction remains 15
  bytes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can construct instructions that would encode to more than 15 bytes, but such instructions would be illegal and would probably not execute.</p>
