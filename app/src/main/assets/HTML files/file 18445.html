<p>You mean something like this?</p>

<p>For this kind of work, I use Poedit ( <a href="http://www.poedit.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poedit.net/</a> )</p>

<p>Poedit is cross-platform gettext catalogs (.po files) editor. It is built with wxWidgets toolkit and can run on any platform supported by it (although it was only tested on Unix with GTK+ and Windows). It aims to provide more convenient approach to editing catalogs than launching vi and editing the file by hand.</p>
