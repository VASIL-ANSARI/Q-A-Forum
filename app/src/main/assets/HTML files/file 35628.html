<p>If you're looking to create "next" and "previous" functionality, you can use <code>location.search</code> to get the query string, and parse through it to get your value.</p>

<pre><code>if( location.search.indexOf( "vijestID=" ) !== -1 )
    currentId = parseInt(location.search.match(/vijestID=(\d+)/)[1]);
</code></pre>

<p>This will have the ID simply in an integer form, and you can add or subtract 1 from it to setup the link you need for your setup.</p>
