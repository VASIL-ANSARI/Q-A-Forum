<p>While I cannot answer the first question regarding pyglet, textures and images (I found a method called "get_image_data" in Texture in the online API; maybe that can be used?),
I can answer the second question.</p>

<p>Apart from the method you provided in the link, I know at least two other methods: The first is using OpenGL, draw the images to a buffer, and check whether they overlap. I have no idea how fast this is, but I could imagine it is slow. It does support rotation and scaling, however.</p>

<p>The second is somewhat similar to the one you have given; but instead of finding the intersection of two axis-aligned bounding boxes and only check inside the intersection, the intersection of two convex hulls are found and checked. One advantage of this is that convex hulls generally provides a better fit, and another is that the convex hulls can be rotated, while axis-aligned bounding boxes cannot. The main disadvantage is that convex hull intersection is much more complex than axis-aligned bounding box intersection, so it can be difficult to implement.</p>

<p>I have written a library that utilizes the second method; you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/Poxelcoll/Poxelcoll" rel="nofollow">PoxelColl</a>. It should be faster than other pixel-perfect collision detection libraries, especially for rotation and scaling. I don't know if you can use it from Python; There is a Scala-version if you use Jython, and a C++ version that you might be able to make a binding to in Python, but that might be a fair amount of extra work. So if you don't need scaling or rotation, it might be a better idea to simply implement the version you have already found and test if it is fast enough.</p>
