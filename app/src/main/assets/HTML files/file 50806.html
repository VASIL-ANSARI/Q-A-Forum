<p>You will need to create your <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3348247/uidatepicker-select-month-and-year">custom picker</a> for this.</p>

<p>In the PickerInlineRow shown above the row.title is the title that appears on the left of the row while the <code>displayValueFor</code> block is used to define the value that appears on the right of the row.</p>

<p>The <code>row.options</code> are the options shown in the picker, in your case you will have one option for each month you are adding. </p>

<p>Finally the <code>row.value</code> is the value of the row which you can use to get what the user selected. You also have to update it accordingly.</p>
