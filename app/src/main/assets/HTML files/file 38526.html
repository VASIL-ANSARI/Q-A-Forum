<p>I would suggest using a single script to change the look of the table based on media screen properties. Below is an example script that would load different views of a table based on screen width.</p>

<pre><code>$(window).on('resize load', function () {
    var width = $(window).width();
    if (width &lt; 720) {
        //for screens with less than 720px
        var table = $('#example').DataTable({
            "scrollY": "300px",
                "scrollX": "100%",
                "scrollCollapse": true,
                "paging": false
        });
        new $.fn.dataTable.FixedColumns(table);
    } else {
        $('#example').DataTable({
            responsive: true
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Responsive and Fixed Column code is taken from datatables website links you have provided. This piece of code should fire on window resize and when loading as explained <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13882559/different-javascript-jquery-function-by-screen-orientation-on-mobile-and-browser#answer-13882873">here</a>. </p>
