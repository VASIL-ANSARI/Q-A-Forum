<p>I'm not sure I completely understand the question. But in general, you don't want to use SQL to do what you're describing. Use SQL to return the data (like your query does now), and use a report writer to hide repeating values, summarize data in headers and footers, etc. </p>

<p>It's a simple division of labor. SQL returns the data; report writers (or their equivalent) handle the presentation and layout.</p>
