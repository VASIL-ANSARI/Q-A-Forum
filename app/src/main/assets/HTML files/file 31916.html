<p>If the keys are identical between the two arrays in both dimensions :</p>

<pre><code>foreach (array_keys($array1) as $key1) {
    foreach (array_keys($array1[$key1]) as $key2) {
        echo $array1[$key1][$key2].' '.$array2[$key1][$key2];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Worst case scenario, some keys in one dimension or the other are missing in one or both arrays and you have to merge them prior to reading (and ensure the existence of the key's value in each loop &amp; array).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: used the same solution twice for two-dimensional array structure.</p>
