<p>If you look at the input to the <code>KnockKnockProtocol</code> constructor, you will notice it directly affects the <code>currentJoke</code> counter via <code>this.ourstep</code> which is then used to reference the <code>clues</code> array.</p>

<p>Therefore to start at different locations you can pass in a different number in the constructor at the beginning of the program.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
