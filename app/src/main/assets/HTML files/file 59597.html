<p>You are reading the file line by line with <code>ReadLine</code>, and trying to split a single line with a line ending. This will result in an array with just one element (E.G. "BMW")</p>

<p>You can either read the whole file and then split by lines or just assume that each line will contain some data.</p>

<p>The <code>OutOfRangeException</code> refers to your invocation of <code>array[1]</code> when the array contains only <code>array[0] = "BMW"</code>.</p>
