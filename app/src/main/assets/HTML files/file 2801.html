<p>Whether you're using the active record class or not, you can access database errors using <code>$this-&gt;db-&gt;_error_message()</code> and <code>$this-&gt;db-&gt;_error_number()</code>.</p>

<p>If you're using a mysql database, these functions are equivalent to <code>mysql_error()</code> and <code>mysql_errno()</code> respectively. You can check out these functions by looking at the source code for the database driver for the database you're using. They're located in system/database/drivers.</p>

<p>So, after you run a query, you can check for errors using something like:</p>

<pre><code>if ($this-&gt;db-&gt;_error_message()) \\handle error
</code></pre>
