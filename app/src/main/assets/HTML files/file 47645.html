<p>If you want to extend a python function in Odoo, you can do it by writing:</p>

<pre><code>def _generate_xml(self,xml):
   get_xml = super(account_invoice, self)._generate_xml(xml)
   # And from now on you can add whatever you want...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>

<p>I've just realized that you are trying to extend the method in a class which does not inherit from <code>account.invoice</code>. To be honest, I've never tried to extend a function from a class which does not inherit from the class where the original method was declared. I'm not sure if that's possible.</p>
