<p>You need to convert all of your input values to floats:</p>

<pre><code>print "This program will compute the comission earned for the month based on your sales for the month."
comission_rate = float(raw_input("what is your comission rate percent? "))
sales = float(raw_input("How many sales did you have this month? "))
total_com = sales * (comission_rate / 100)
print " your total comission for the month is "
print total_com
</code></pre>

<p>(exception handling for bad input left as an exercise for the reader)</p>
