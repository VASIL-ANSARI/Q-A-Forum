<p>After looking at the console log, I am pretty sure the crash occurs because of a missing outlet connection.</p>

<p>Press Cmd+Shift+F and type 'play' in the search field.
Look for a entry in your storyboard file, of the form <code>...: Outlet = "play"</code>.</p>

<p>Click on that entry and remove it by clicking on the 'x' button next to <code>play</code>.</p>

<p>This should fix the crash.</p>

<p>Whenever you see an error of the form:
<code>... this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key ...</code>
you should check if there is a missing outlet in your storyboard or xib.</p>
