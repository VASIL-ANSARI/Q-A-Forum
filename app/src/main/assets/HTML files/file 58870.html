<p>Hi Below are the root cause</p>

<p>1) check the order of the Js file. it should be in correct order.</p>

<p>2) If you are using multiple Js file. Use bundling because some browser have limitation of calling concurrent HTTP Call. if the limit exceeds it will stop rendering the script</p>

<p>3) It should be the caching issue also open in Incognito window.</p>

<p>4) last Debug using Inspect Element.</p>
