<p>Declare a boolean called "usedHelp", and initialize it as 'false'. Test for it on each question, ie:</p>

<pre><code>if (a[0] == "?" &amp;&amp; (!usedHelp) ) // This means the user pressed the 'help' key (in this case, a question mark  '?') and they haven't already used it.
{
    usedHelp = true; // Now set the 'ÃºsedHelp' variable to 'true'. The next time a user presses '?', it will skip a similar if statement
    getline(answers, print);
    position = print.find("02.");
}
</code></pre>
