<p><code>info</code> is a parameter of your function, that is passed by value.  In this case, <code>&amp;info</code> is the address of the parameter, and not of the original data.  </p>

<p>This is undefined behaviour and can only give weird results.  </p>

<p>One possible solution would be: </p>

<pre><code>void queue::add(myObj&amp; info)  // pass by reference
{
    ... // unchanged code
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>&amp;info</code> would refer to the address of the original object. </p>
