<p>If your storyboard pushes a view controller then you can always programatically pop it. this is not a problem. The problem here is that the UIAlertView is shown using an animation and therefore you can't perform another animation in one go.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>So you have two options. Popping the view controller without animation should work but then the user might not realize where he is getting to.</p></li>
<li><p>You can put the call that pops the viewcontroller into a helper method and call this methd like this: <code>[self performSelector:@selector(myPopHelperMethod:) withObject:nil  afterDelay:0.8f]</code>. This should pop your view controller after 0.8 seconds which is enough to let the UIAlertView finish its animation.</p></li>
