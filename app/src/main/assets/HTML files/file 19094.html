<p>Rails handles the serialization by itself. Remove the <code>to_yaml</code> method call from the default option in your migration. If you run this method on a hash you get a string. </p>

<pre><code>{ :key =&gt; "value" } 
# =&gt; "---\n:key: value\n" 
</code></pre>

<p>That is the reason why you get the exception.</p>
