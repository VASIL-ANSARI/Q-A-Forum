<p>this might be the shop table in simplest form:
id,shopname</p>

<p>this might be the product table structure in simplest form:
id,product_name,shop_id</p>

<p>you have for example 5 shops, in your shops table.
Every time a user want to insert a product into the products table you should have an option where the user can select the shop or you should do it automatically by getting the shop-id according to the page where the user is.
At the end you have for example 5 shops in shops table and 200 products in your products table. Each product has a shop id which indicates to what shop it belongs.</p>

<p>Now you cant query in your products table simply by selecting all products with a specific shop id eg. "SELECT * FROM products WHERE shop_id=$anyvariable";</p>

<p>I hope you got the idea.</p>
