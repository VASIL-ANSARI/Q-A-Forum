<p>You can probaby use something like</p>

<pre><code>(?&lt;!://[^ ]*)\bfoo\b
</code></pre>

<p>But this probably isn't perfect, it just looks that the word doesn't appear in a single non-whitespace string of characters that don't have <code>://</code> somewhere before the word.</p>

<pre><code>PS Home:\&gt; "foo foobar http://foo_bar/baz?gak=foobar baz foo" -replace '(?&lt;!://[^ ]*)\bfoo\b', 'FOO'
FOO foobar http://foo_bar/baz?gak=foobar baz FOO
</code></pre>
