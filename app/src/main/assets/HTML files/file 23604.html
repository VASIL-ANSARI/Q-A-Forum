<p>The default <strong>PHP session handler mechanism uses</strong> both your <strong>Cookie and your User-Agent</strong> to match a session to a user. As Flash identifies itself to the server with the user-agent of <em>"ShockWave Flash"</em>, which is different than your browser's UA, php assigns a new session to the request.</p>

<p>You can check this if you output <code>_POST</code> data and then compare those values with the ones you get after <code>session_start()</code> or if you change your browser UA to exactly match that sent by Flash.</p>

<p><strong>The solution?</strong></p>

<p>Pass the session ID to the server whatever way you want, the default being <code>_POST</code>, and initialize the session with the correct id.</p>

<p>SWFUpload provides you with <code>post_params</code> that "<a href="http://demo.swfupload.org/Documentation/" rel="nofollow"><em>defines the name/value pairs that will be posted with each uploaded file</em></a>".</p>

<pre><code>// SWFUpload example - taken from you own config file
post_params : {
    "sid" : sid =&gt; THIS WOULD BE YOUR SESSION ID!; you can put &lt;?=session_id()?&gt;
},
</code></pre>

<p>And then on the server side...</p>

<pre><code>// Prior to starting the session as you normally do you'll want to check if 
// you're trying to pass a session id by post, if so, initialize session with it
&lt;?php
if(isset($_POST['sid']))
{
    session_id($_POST["sid"]);
}
session_start();
</code></pre>
