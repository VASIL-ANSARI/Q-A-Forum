<p>You have misunderstood inheritance. To create an instance of SubFoo, you just have to instantiate it like you would any other class: <code>SubFoo()</code>.</p>

<p>Python doesn't have constructors, and in any case a method not defined on a subclass will automatically inherit the superclass version without you needing to do anything.</p>
