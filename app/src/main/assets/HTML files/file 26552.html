<p>You should take these steps:</p>

<p>1: put a CCLog in the tick method just before this line <code>var myActor = ((CCNode)b.UserData);</code><br>
This will determine if the code has actually got to the point where it will position the ball to the b2body.<br><br>
2: If the CCLog displayed in the console, that means you are doing the position calculations wrong, or you aren't retrieving the userdata properly.<br><br>
If the CCLog did NOT display in the console, that means you aren't retrieving your body from the world properly.</p>
