<p>One possible strategy for finding a max value of an unsorted array is to go through the array (using a <code>for</code> loop, perhaps), and keeping track of the maximum value as you go through it.</p>

<p>I don't want to do your homework, but that might look like:</p>

<pre><code>   max = Integer.MIN (the smallest possible integer value)

   for item in array
       if item is greater than max
            store item in max
</code></pre>

<p>This strategy should find the max value -- hope this helps you!  Model the for loops and the print statements like the previous ones you've shown.</p>
