<p>There is a wide range of sort algorithms, but all (probably just most) need a way to compare two elements.</p>

<p>Compare functions in most languages work like this.
When the return Value is positive, the second value is smaller and when the return value is negative the first value is smaller. If it is zero, they are the same.</p>

<p>Which actual sort algorithm Javascript uses might vary from implementation to implementation and it could probably use multiple different algorithms in one implementation or even one sort.</p>
