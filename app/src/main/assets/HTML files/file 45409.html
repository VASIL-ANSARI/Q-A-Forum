<p>Raj, identity values in ASE cannot be set to maintain a sequence of negative values as you want. So that eliminates the simplest approach.</p>

<p>Let's assume your table looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE cars (
  id     not null,
  name   varchar(20),
  serial int null
)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>serial</code> is the column that may contain NULL values.</p>

<p>You could create a trigger on the table to update <code>serial</code> when it is null.</p>

<p>Alternatively if you are trying to update existing values in this table you could run the following code 40 times:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE  cars
SET     serial = -(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cars WHERE serial IS NULL)
WHERE   id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM cars WHERE serial IS NULL)
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, for 40 rows manually updating the values sounds attractive!</p>
