<p>Of course like you said second option is better. In WCF Project you have to create DataContract WcfStudent. In project which have service reference (this is what you call client) you have to just execute method (OperationContract) InsertStudent. How you create this object in theory it doesn't matter but I think it's a good practice to have in your 'client' also an object named for example StudentBO and create mapping between WcfStudent and StudentBO or use some tool for example Automapper. </p>

<p>If you're totally new in WCF please read about DataContract, DataMember.</p>

<p>Good luck! </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Speaking about your comment would be better something like:</p>

<pre><code>public WcfStudent(MyStudent myStudent)
{
    this.Id= myStudent.Id;
    this.Name= myStudent.Name;
}
</code></pre>
