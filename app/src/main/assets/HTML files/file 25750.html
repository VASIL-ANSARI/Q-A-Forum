<p>You have to use a bit of hacking to achieve this because badges in iOS natively can only be added to the tabbar items. There is a custom class called MKNumberBadgeView, which allows you to add it to the Nav Bar. </p>

<p>You would do it in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>MKNumberBadgeView *badge=[[MKNumberBadgeView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(92, 0, 40, 40)];
badge.value=6;
[self.navigationController.navigationBar addSubview:badge];
</code></pre>

<p>a few points: you will have to play around with placement of the badge on the nav bar, so adjust your cgrectmake.</p>

<p>I would suggest making the badge a property because eventually you will want to remove it from the view. In that case, you would call self.badge removeFromSuperview. </p>

<p>This class uses core graphics to draw the badge, looks really nice.</p>
