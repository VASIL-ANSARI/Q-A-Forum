<p>I'd use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagecopyresized.php" rel="nofollow">imagecopyresized</a>. I think it's faster because you skip one step. However, the actual resizing is probably the most time consuming, so you won't gain much unless you find a separate library/plugin that is faster.</p>
