<p>The only way to get the values of properties of all of the objects within the arrays is by looping through the array and checking specifically which values you need to be equal. This assumes that the <code>productID</code> will match for array elements with the same array index.</p>

<pre><code>for(var i=0;i&lt;arr1.length;i++){
    if (arr1[i].quantityOrdered == arr2[i].quantityList) {
        // execute code for if quanityOrdered = quantityList
    } else {
        // execute code for when they are not equal
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you ever have a situation where the indices of the objects with matching <code>productID</code> properties are different, then you may need to use an additional nested for loop to check the <code>productID</code> and <code>quantityOrdered</code> for every object in <code>arr1</code> against every object in <code>arr2</code>.</p>
