<p>Looks like RubyForge, a site that hosted many projects, has been shut down.  I could not find the source on rubygems.org or archive.org.  Looks like the last version of the project is from 2004.  If you go to <a href="http://littlelexer.rubyforge.org" rel="nofollow">http://littlelexer.rubyforge.org</a> and view the source of that page, there is an email address for the maintainer of littlelexer at the bottom.  You could try emailing that person.</p>
