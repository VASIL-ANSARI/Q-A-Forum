<p>Parameters are passed "by value" in Java.  What that means is that when you call</p>

<pre><code>input.range(lowRange, highRange);
</code></pre>

<p>it gives the current values of those variables to <code>input.range</code>, but it doesn't give <code>input.range</code> a way to modify them.  In the <code>range</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>public static void range(int lowRange, int highRange) 
</code></pre>

<p>the parameters <code>lowRange</code> and <code>highRange</code> (which have no connection with the variables in <code>GuessNumber</code>, even though the names are the same) are <em>copies</em> of what you pass in.  When you assign <code>lowRange = ...</code> in the method, it changes the copy but has no effect at all on the <code>lowRange</code> and <code>highRange</code> in <code>GuessNumber</code>.</p>

<p>You need to write a <code>range</code> method that <em>returns</em> two values.  This needs a little bit of work, but I'd write a <code>Range</code> class that has <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> members, and then change your method to</p>

<pre><code>public static Range range()
</code></pre>

<p>That method would have to create a new <code>Range</code> object.  I think it's OK for <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> to be public members of <code>Range</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Range {
    public int low;
    public int high;
    public Range(int low, int high) { 
        this.low = low;
        this.high = high;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, public data in a class is a bad thing, but for a class whose only purpose is to let a method return multiple values, it's OK in my opinion. </p>
