<p>This should be what you are looking for </p>

<p><strong>MYSQL</strong></p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(*) FROM tab1 as Count_1
WHERE id LIKE '%hello%'

UNION

SELECT count(*) from tab2 as Count_2
WHERE id LIKE '%yelo%' 
GROUP BY id;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>RESULT</strong></p>

<pre><code>COUNT(*)
6
1
</code></pre>

<p>So I think you're trying to COUNT the number of times a ID matching 'hello ... ' appears in Table1 and the number of times an ID matching 'yelo ..' appears in Table2. </p>
