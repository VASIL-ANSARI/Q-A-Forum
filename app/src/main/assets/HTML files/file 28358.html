<p>The problem is right here:</p>

<pre><code>cities[i] = "CITY"; //Its only a test value
</code></pre>

<p>This does <em>not</em> copy <code>CITY</code> into the memory you must allocated. Instead, it overwrites the pointer to the memory you just allocated with a pointer to the string literal "CITY".</p>

<p>When you try to delete that, problems arise because it's not memory that was allocated with <code>new</code>. Since you overwrote the pointer to the memory you allocated, it just gets leaked.</p>

<p>To make it work, replace <code>cities[i] = "CITY";</code> with <code>strcpy(cities[i], "CITY");</code> so you copy the characters into the memory you allocated.</p>

<p>Having said that, use <code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;</code> if you have any choice in the matter at all.</p>
