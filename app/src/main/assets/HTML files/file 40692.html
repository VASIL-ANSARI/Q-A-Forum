<p>You should state your Ruby version too, as this will make it easier to find out the specific pattern of behaviour exhibited.</p>

<p><code>require 'rubygems'</code> is no longer needed on more recent (~e. g. ~3 years old) Ruby versions.</p>

<p>To call Rubygems again explicitly makes no sense to me. Even if it were, I would consider this behavior a bug as the decision to integrate rubygems it was already made.</p>

<p>Rubygems comes bundled with default Ruby these days, the days of explicit <code>require 'rubygems'</code> ought to be over in my opinion.</p>
