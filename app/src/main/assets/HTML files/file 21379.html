<p>The problem here is the <code>ToolTip</code> structure is not a child of the <code>Chart</code> visual tree, so there is no way for it to walk up/down the tree and find what you are looking for - in fact, if you were to look at this with Snoop or some other WPF sniffing tool, you'd see that the <code>ToolTip</code> tree effectively "ends" right at your <code>StackPanel</code> (or very close to it)</p>

<p>Try using <code>ElementName</code> bindings instead of <code>FindAncestor</code>, and specify the name of your chart/series elements. That can sometimes be used to work around this type of issue.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to create a sort of "shim" that can proxy back to the <code>Chart</code> from inside that tool tip, but that's a bit outside of my willingness to type into my phone at the moment. :)</p>
