<p>I assume the code you are providing is the one for your detail controller.</p>

<p>Seems like you don't give parameter to <code>Data.dataService.fetchData</code>, you're probably returning a 'room' independently of the detail you're in. I recommend you to read some documentation or tutorials about how to pass data between 2 controllers.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You should pass an object or datas directly to your detail view controller in the performseguewithidentifier() method in your parent view (where you should already have this to initialize your cells).</p>
