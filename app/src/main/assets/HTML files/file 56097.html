<p>This is really simple you just initialize both textviews and get string from one and set it in another. Extending your class with TextView gives you all methods TextView can use.</p>

<pre><code>CustomTextView customtv = (CustomTextView) findViewById(R.id.customTv);
TextView tv = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.myTv);
customtv.setText(tv.getText());
</code></pre>

<p>Just set id on your CustomTextView whatever you want i used customTv id in this case.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>As far as i understood you want textChangeListener, here is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/20824665/6460744">example</a>.</p>
