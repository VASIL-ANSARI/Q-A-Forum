<p>I'd suggest you choose the technologies you want to showcase as a real example of your skills in these areas. If you want to work in LAMP then that's the logical choice to use to build your online resume, or other technologies if you prefer.</p>

<p>Your online presence if much more than the online resume you create. It's also your twitter, github, stackoverflow, etc profiles and activity. When I employ a developer I don't just look at their resume, I see how active they are in the development community.</p>
