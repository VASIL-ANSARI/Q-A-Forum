<p>In ASP.NET you can use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/eahwtc9e.aspx" rel="nofollow">RegularExpressionValidator</a> control.  </p>

<p>To determine the regular expression itself, you can experiment with a tool like <a href="http://www.ultrapico.com/Expresso.htm" rel="nofollow">Expresso</a>.</p>

<p>Be aware that validating emails with regular expressions is a hard task, if you want to allow all the possibly valid email formats; probably the best thing to do in that case would be to send an email to the entered address with a confirmation link, and when that link is clicked, you assume that the mail is valid.</p>
