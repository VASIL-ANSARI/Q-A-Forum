<p>As the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities" rel="nofollow">Selenium capabilities</a> page you mention points out, the value of <code>firefox_profile</code> must be a Base64-encoded profile. Specifically, you ZIP up a Firefox profile directory, Base64 encode it, and use that string as the value of <code>firefox_profile</code>. The <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/firefox-profile" rel="nofollow">firefox-profile</a> npm package can make this process easier. You'll end up with something like:</p>

<pre><code>environments: [
    { browserName: 'firefox', firefox_profile: 'UEsDBBQACAAIACynEk...'; },
    ...
],
</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend storing the profile string in a separate module since it's going to be around 250kb.</p>
