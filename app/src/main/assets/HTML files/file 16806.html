<p>If you need to defined functions, then you should use the JexlEngine#setFunctions(Map namespace2FunctorMap). See the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/apidocs/index.html" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a> (currently down ;-( )</p>

<p>If you need methods, then you should add to your JexlContext the objects having the methods you want to call. See "calling methods" in <a href="http://commons.apache.org/jexl/reference/examples.html#Example_Expressions" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Jexl uses reflection to call methods if I can properly remember.</p>
