<p>You need to create a custom block (inside of a custom module) to draw the list of products:</p>

<ol>
<li>On the page linked follow steps 1-4, creating a ReleaseCalendar block instead of Menu, and using your own company's identifier and your own module name rather than Gravitywell_Example.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gravitywell.co.uk/blog/post/how-to-creating-your-own-custom-block-in-magento" rel="nofollow">http://www.gravitywell.co.uk/blog/post/how-to-creating-your-own-custom-block-in-magento</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add a getReleasesCollection function to your block.</li>
<li>Inside of that function you'll want to get and return a collection of products, filter it by products with a release date greater than the current date then order the collection by release date.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/1_-_installation_and_configuration/using_collections_in_magento" rel="nofollow">http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/1_-_installation_and_configuration/using_collections_in_magento</a></li>
<li><code>$products = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')-&gt;getCollection();</code> will get you started with a collection of all products.  Don't forget to apply a visibility filter as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Format the collection into a calendar in your template file.  You can use $this->getReleasesCollection() to get the collection you created in steps 2 and 3 into the frontend.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have created the module your CMS page will be able to include the block using something like this:</p>

<p><code>{{block type="yourmodule/releasecalendar" name="releasecalendar" template="yourmodule/releasecalendar.phtml"}}</code></p>

<p>In the long run you'll want to get a better understanding of how you can use models (and possibly controllers) for something like this, but this solution is much more developer friendly until you're more experienced with magento.</p>
