<p>Arguments in C# are passed by value whether in static, non static, generic methods. 
The references are also passed by value. 
Since ListingFilters is an object, it is passed by value reference if that makes sense. And so you are overwriting the value as the reference argument passed in points to a valid memory location.</p>
