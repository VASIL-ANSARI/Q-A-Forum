<p>The following seems to meet all your requirements:</p>

<pre><code>/*
Must contain at least two lower case characters
Must contain at least two upper case characters
Must contain at least two numeric characters
Must contain at least two special characters i.e. @#$%
Must be at least 11 characters long
*/

var password ='12qaQ@#123456789A';
var pattern  =/^(?=(.*[a-z]){2,})(?=(.*[A-Z]){2,})(?=(.*[0-9]){2,})(?=(.*[!@#\$%]){2,}).{11,}$/;

alert( pattern.test(password) ); 
</code></pre>

<pre><code>^                     // start of line
(?=(.*[a-z]){2,})     // look ahead and make sure at least two lower case characters exist
(?=(.*[A-Z]){2,})     // look ahead and make sure at least two upper case characters exist
(?=(.*[0-9]){2,})     // look ahead and make sure at least two numbers exist
(?=(.*[!@#\$%]){2,})  // look ahead and make sure at least two special characters exist
.{11,}                // match at least 11 characters
$                     // end of line            
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck!!</p>
