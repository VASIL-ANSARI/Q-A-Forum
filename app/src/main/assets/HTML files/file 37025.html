<p>No, a configuration change occurs on the main thread.  It won't occur in the middle of execution of one of those functions.</p>

<p>An AsyncTask is asynchronous.  It may not finish before the activity is recreated and will not be killed by a configuration change.  It will continue to execute, and if it calls UI view functions in onPostExecute that will cause an exception (because those views no longer exist).  You need to protect against that.  IMO its one of the reasons the ending and recreating of Activities on configuration change ranks in the top 5 stupidest design decisions in history.  I highly recommend turning that off if you have async tasks or threads going on.  It will simplify your code and prevent having to redo the AsyncTask or having problems in onPostExecute.</p>
