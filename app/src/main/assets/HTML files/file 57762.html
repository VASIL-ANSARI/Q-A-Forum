<p>Yes. From <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/functions-matching.html" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>, <code>~</code> and <code>~*</code> use POSIX regular expressions, which means that these characters are treated specially:</p>

<pre><code>()[]{}^$|?:.\
</code></pre>

<p><code>preg_quote</code>, from <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-quote.php" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>, just blindly goes through and puts a backslash (i.e. escapes) all of these characters:</p>

<pre><code>.\+*?[^]$(){}=!&lt;&gt;|:-
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it escapes all of the characters that need escaping.</p>

<p>However, you should still be careful. If you decide to use <code>LIKE</code> or <code>SIMILAR TO</code> at some point in the future, <code>_</code> and <code>%</code> won't be escaped. Also, you have to remember not to use a different escape character; if you do, all that careful validation will go out the window, and you'd get a host of weird bugs.</p>
