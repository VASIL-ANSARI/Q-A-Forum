<p>You can get two identical UIBarButtonsItem by creating it in one segue and then copy-pasting the button in another segue (at least this is working in my case but I haven't been able to identify the root cause of the problem so far).</p>

<p>If creating directly a UIBarButtonItem is not working, drop a UIButton in the NavigationItem and it will create automatically a UIBarButtonItem with a UIButton inside (see below image). In this way you can configure an image or other attributes not present in a UIBarButtonItem. Once you are happy with the appearance of your UIButton (embedded in the Bar Button), copy paste it to a different segue and they should keep the same size. </p>
