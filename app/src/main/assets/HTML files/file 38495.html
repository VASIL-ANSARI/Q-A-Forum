<p>The <em>usual arthimetic conversions</em> for floating point types are applied before multiplication, division, and modulus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The usual arithmetic conversions are performed on the operands and determine the type of the result.</p>
  
  <p>Â§5.6 [expr.mul]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly for addition and subtraction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The usual arithmetic conversions are performed for operands of arithmetic or enumeration type.</p>
  
  <p>Â§5.7 [expr.add]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>usual arithmetic conversions</em> for floating point types are laid out in the standard as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many binary operators that expect operands of arithmetic or enumeration type cause conversions and yield result types in a similar way. The purpose is to yield a common type, which is also the type of the result. This pattern is called the usual arithmetic conversions, which are defined as follows:</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>â If either operand is of type <code>long double</code>, the other shall be converted to <code>long double</code>.</p>
  
  <p>â Otherwise, if either operand is <code>double</code>, the other shall be converted to <code>double</code>.</p>
  
  <p>â Otherwise, if either operand is <code>float</code>, the other shall be converted to <code>float</code>.</p>
  
  <p>Â§5 [expr]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual form/precision of these floating point types is implementation-defined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type <code>double</code> provides at least as much precision as <code>float</code>, and the type <code>long double</code> provides at least as much precision as <code>double</code>.  The set of values of the type <code>float</code> is a subset of the set of values of the type <code>double</code>; the set of values of the type <code>double</code> is a subset of the set of values of the type <code>long double</code>. The value representation of floating-point types is implementation-defined.</p>
