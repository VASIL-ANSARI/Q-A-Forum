<p>The source of the click event is the button. What you're interested in is the action command instead.</p>

<pre><code>if (e.getActionCommand().equals("TRANSLATE TO PIG LATIN")) {
</code></pre>

<p>Also note <code>equals()</code> instead of <code>==</code>. However, it's usually needless to use the same action listener for everything and then figure out between the sources in the listener. You could as well use an anonymous class, when the source is guaranteed to be the one you're interested in:</p>

<pre><code>button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        // Get the English they entered
        String text = original.getText();
        text = text.trim();
        text = text.toLowerCase();

        // Display the translation
        translation.setText(englishToPig(text));
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The clear button can then similarly have its own, as their functionality is not really related. </p>
