<p>Based on this <a href="https://gist.github.com/damianh/10086352" rel="nofollow">gist</a> by damianh the property containing the user identity is different. In the gist they access the identity within a module using</p>

<pre><code>var env = ((IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;)Context.Items[Nancy.Owin.NancyOwinHost.RequestEnvironmentKey]);
var user = (IPrincipal)env["server.User"];
</code></pre>

<p>I have not tried it yet. Let us know if it works for you.</p>
