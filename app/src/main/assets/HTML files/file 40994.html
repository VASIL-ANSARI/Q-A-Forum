<p>This link will show you what null and blank do: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8609192/differentiate-null-true-blank-true-in-django">differentiate null=True, blank=True in django</a></p>

<p>If you can arrange your csv file to have all of the null values at the end, you can just remove the commas.  That might work.  Or perhaps create a temporary model that assigns those fields to a Charfield.  Then copy appropriate fields to your final model</p>

<p>This is untested:</p>

<pre><code>update &lt;table&gt; set &lt;field&gt; = 0 where id in (select id from &lt;table&gt; where &lt;field&gt; = "");
</code></pre>

<p>Fill in your table name and the field name as appropriate.  You can run this from your sql command line program</p>
