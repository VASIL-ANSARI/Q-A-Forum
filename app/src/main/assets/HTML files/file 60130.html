<p>You need to customize your adapter (you can have an adapter per-model if you want, as far as I know).</p>

<p>In your specific example I think you want to customize the <a href="http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPIAdapter.html#method_urlForFindAll" rel="nofollow"><code>urlForFindAll</code></a> method.</p>

<pre><code>// maybe in app/organization/adapter.js (if using pods for a model specific  adapter)
urlForFindAll(modelName) {
    return 'urlYouWantToUseWithOrganizations';
}
</code></pre>

<p>A good article on this situation is on <a href="https://emberigniter.com/fit-any-backend-into-ember-custom-adapters-serializers/" rel="nofollow">Ember Igniter</a></p>
