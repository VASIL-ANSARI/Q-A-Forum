<p>This is basic boolean boolean logic.  The following do the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>CHECK (NOT (age &gt;= 5 AND price &lt; 5000) )
CHECK (age &lt; 5 OR price &gt;= 5000)
</code></pre>

<p>And both of these implement the constraint as you describe it:  if age &lt; 5 then price >= 5000.</p>

<p>The <code>NOT</code> is simply there because some people understand this condition as saying that you cannot have both age >= 5 and price &lt; 5000.</p>
