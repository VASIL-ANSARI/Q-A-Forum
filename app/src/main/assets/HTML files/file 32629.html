<p>The <strong>error 3</strong> can be corrected just by going to the <strong>Artifacts Settings, Modules, Sources tab,</strong> and you will see 2 folders called "gen" and "gen[generated]", <strong>delete "gen"</strong> by clicking on the X icon to the right of it.</p>

<p>Now, to use both "projects", you need to understand that what in Eclipse is a "Project" would be equivalent to what a "module" is in Intellij, so all you need to do is <strong>open one project, and then "Import Module"</strong>, so you select the other "Project", this way they will be able to see each other resources and codes.</p>
