<p>Are you talking about the time to live (TTL)? You should be able to use the <code>IP_TTL</code> socket option (see ip(7)) to set the time to live of packets sent on that socket. If the packet goes through enough hops for the TTL to become zero, the node that discards the packet should send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the originating host. To receive the error, I think you might have to create an ICMP socket. This is what <code>traceroute</code> does, so you might want to take a look at the source code.</p>
