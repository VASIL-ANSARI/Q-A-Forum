<p><code>libvlc</code>/<code>video</code>/<code>set_format_callbacks</code> is meant completely for different things thatn <code>libvlc</code>/<code>media_player</code>/<code>set_hwnd</code>. While the use of the latter is fairly obvious (selecting target screen area), the former (according to <a href="http://projectsymphony.blogspot.com/2013/04/finally-one-libvlcvideosetformatcallbac.html" rel="nofollow">this source</a>) is callback replacement for <code>libvlc_video_set_format</code>, well, I didn't check the libvlc docs though, but it would probably be described there. I'm no expert in libvlc, but, IMHO, they are far from each other.</p>

<p>Regarding other functions that were visible in comments in the code:</p>

<ul>
<li>libvlc_media_player_set_nsobject -- uses NSView (Cocoa)</li>
<li>libvlc_media_player_get_nsobject -- returns NSView (Cocoa) previously set by the former</li>
<li>libvlc_media_player_set_agl -- likewise, but for AGL (Apple OpenGL)</li>
<li>libvlc_media_player_get_agl -- likewise, but for AGL (Apple OpenGL)</li>
<li>libvlc_media_player_set_xwindow -- likewise, but for XWindows (genric Linux+XWin)</li>
<li>libvlc_media_player_get_xwindow -- likewise, but for XWindows (genric Linux+XWin)</li>
<li>libvlc_media_player_set_hwnd -- likewise, but for Microsoft Windows</li>
<li>libvlc_media_player_get_hwnd -- likewise, but for Microsoft Windows</li>
</ul>

<p>(see <a href="https://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/doc/doxygen/html/group__libvlc__media__player.html" rel="nofollow">the docs about them</a>)</p>

<p>So, it depends on <strong>what platform</strong> you are trying to use the libVlc, because that dictates the way the VLC can draw upon the screen.</p>

<p>If you are building for whatever on MS Windows - use HWND pair.<br>
If you are building for Linux with XWindows - use XWindow pair.<br>
If you are building for Cocoa on MacOS/iOS - use NSObject/NSView pair.<br>
If you are building for OpenGL on MaxOS/iOS - use AGL pair.  </p>

<p>On MS Windows, you must use HWND. Even if you are using WPF/GTK#/whatever. Every windows in MS Windows uses HWND in its roots. Dig it out from your UI library. It is somewhere there. But it might be unsatisfactory. For example, WPF (unless you do some tricks) uses exactly one HWND handle for each Window object. Passing this HWND to VLC would result in VLC drawing all other the window, not just the region you would want. That must be solved by different means - I don't know how yet.</p>
