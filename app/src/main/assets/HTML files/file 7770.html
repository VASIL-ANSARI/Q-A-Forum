<p>If the request is set as a "GET" request to cartmanager.net, you should be able to do it this way by sending it through your PHP script first and after you've inserted the data in your database doing this:</p>

<pre><code>header('Location: https://www.cartmanager.net/cgi-bin/cart.cgi?' . $_SERVER["QUERY_STRING"]);
exit;
</code></pre>

<p>If cartmanager.net expects a "POST" request, you'd have to make the PHP script return an HTML form with all of the necessary inputs that automatically submits itself to cartmanager.net using JavaScript. I wouldn't recommend this as it not good practice and it won't work on browser with JavaScript disabled.</p>
