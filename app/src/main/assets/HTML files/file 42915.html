<p>Restart the listening when you receive a result. No loop needed, no waiting needed.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert on Speech recognition on Android but you are probably blocking the Main thread with the call</p>

<pre><code>new Task().execute().get();
</code></pre>

<p>So the speech recognition is probably never started.</p>
