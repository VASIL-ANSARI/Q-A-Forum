<p>You'll want to pass the currently selected org into the view, maybe as <code>current_org</code> so that when you're iterating through the orgs you can compare with the current one to determine whether or not to select it, like:</p>

<pre><code>{% for org in organisation %}
   &lt;option value="{{org.id}}"
       {% if org == current_org %}selected="selected"{% endif %}&gt;
       {{org.name|capfirst}}
   &lt;/option&gt;
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>
