<p>CASE can only return a column, not a row, and you can't correlate queries into it afaik. And no matter what, a result set must have a static amount of columns.</p>

<p>I think what you would want would be a result set where if the <code>First Name</code> or <code>Last Name</code> was filled out the Name was <code>null</code>.</p>

<pre><code>a.ID | a.SN | Name | First Name | Last Name
1    | #    | Name | null       | null
2    | #    | null | John       | Doe
</code></pre>
