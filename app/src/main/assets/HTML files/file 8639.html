<p>I think you can use the script from this <a href="http://www.phpied.com/rgb-color-parser-in-javascript/" rel="nofollow">page</a> that does exactly what you want: you pass a string to it and tries to figure out the color. Ok, it's not exactly what you wanted to do but it should work. </p>

<p>I think that in any case at some point you should do a name lookup (i don't think there is some magic way to determine the hex value from the string "light blue") so just snatch the work some one else has done (the script is by Stoyan Stefanov which is very good at javascript, i've read some good books from him, and if he does a lookup, well, i don't think there is another solution)</p>
