<blockquote>
  <p>The SetValue method opens a registry key, sets the value, and <strong>closes the key</strong> each time it is called. If you need to modify a large number of values, the RegistryKey.SetValue method might provide better performance. The RegistryKey class also provides methods that allow you to add an access control list (ACL) to a registry key, to test the data type of a value before retrieving it, and to delete keys.</p>
