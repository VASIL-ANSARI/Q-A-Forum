<p>When it comes to OpenGL and OOP programming no clear cut answers can be given. Due to the way the OpenGL API mixes global state, certain object types confined to a single context and other object types shareable among multiple contexts it's very difficult, if not impossible to perfectly map OpenGL into a OOP model.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shouldn't it be better to have the context create, compile and bind a shader?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! In fact it makes a lot of sense for a OpenGL context to be a <em>factory</em> for OpenGL objects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And does a shader necessarily have to know it's context?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact every OpenGL object should know the contexts it's related to. I recommend to implement this via a dedicated abstract context reference class; from that class derive a <em>single context reference</em> that's instanciated by objects that are not shareable (shaders, programs, framebuffer objects, VAOs, â¦) and a <em>shared context reference</em> that's instanciated by objects that <em>are</em> shareable (images, textures, buffer objects, â¦).</p>

<p>And then you somehow should implement a way to track context sharing setup and map this into the shared context reference.</p>
