<p>I'm out of my field here, but I suspect wxPython works like other toolkits by sending messages to child windows via the GUI thread, then waiting for the answer. If this is the case, the GetLabel() or SetLabel() methods have to go through the main message loop (== GUI thread), and stop the calling thread until the answer comes in.</p>

<p>When you call cancel() from the GUI thread, it sets the abort variable, then waits for the other thread to end with <code>self._thread.join()</code>, so no further messages are processed until the other thread has halted. But the other thread keeps waiting for the answer to its GetLabel() message -> bingo!</p>
