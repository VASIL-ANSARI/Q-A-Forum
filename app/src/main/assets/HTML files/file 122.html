<p>This example was taken from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html">JDK 1.6 docs of <code>BlockingQueue</code></a>. So You can see that you are doing it the right way. Here's the quote which tells you that it have to work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Memory consistency effects: As with
  other concurrent collections, actions
  in a thread prior to placing an object
  into a BlockingQueue happen-before
  actions subsequent to the access or
  removal of that element from the
  BlockingQueue in another thread.</p>
