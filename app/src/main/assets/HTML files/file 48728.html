<p>You can create a <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/doctrine.html#joining-related-records" rel="nofollow">method in the repository</a> that performs the joins to avoid the additional queries. It's possible to replace the <code>findBy</code> method with your own implementation but my preference is to create methods that are more descriptive.</p>

<p>Although the examples in the Symfony documentation use <a href="https://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html" rel="nofollow">DQL</a>, you can use the <a href="https://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/query-builder.html" rel="nofollow"><code>QueryBuilder</code></a> if you prefer.</p>
