<p>Your problem is undefined behavior. First you forget to count the terminating <code>\0</code>, so <code>Michael Nguyen</code> is actually 15 chars, not 14. However your crash is the result of the previous line there <code>Angelo Morrison</code> is 16 long, more than <code>studentFirst</code> can hold! And <code>Abigail Peterson</code> is 17 long, so <code>studentFirst</code> needs to be 17 long. <code>studentLast</code> only needs to be 9, but that is not a problem.<br>
It does not appear that you have understood fscanf wrong. You might not understand that strcat uses <code>studentFirst</code> to hold the full name.</p>
