<p>I believe, the root cause of your issue is that the linux server doesn't have X11 installed, on the other hand the code you're running uses the graphics environment, or at least your graphical output is not configured properly.</p>

<p>I think <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/headless/" rel="nofollow">this</a> article can be useful in this case.
In addition the link provided by Alex K can also be an answer to your question.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>
