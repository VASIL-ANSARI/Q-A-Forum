<p>Those are <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/initialization-lists-c++.html">constructor initialization lists</a>, and for <em>fundamental types</em> there is no difference with respect to the form you are used to, which is based on <em>assignment</em> rather than initialization.</p>

<p>However, for user-defined types there might be a difference in terms of performance (and semantics perhaps) between:</p>

<ol>
<li>default-constructing an object and <em>then</em> assigning a value to it, and </li>
<li>directly initializing it with that value.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, you do not have a choice for those types that are not default-constructible other than using a member initialization list to initialize them, and you do not have a choice for <code>const</code> and reference members either, that must be initialized immediately.</p>
