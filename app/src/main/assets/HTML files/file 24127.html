<p>When sending a simple push notification with a message only, the max length of your message is, deterministically, 236 characters.</p>

<p>Your payload is that JSON string, which must be 256 characters. Apple does not change your JSON or interfere with the packet, so you are in control of the whole payload.</p>

<p>Just remember, you do NOT need to null-terminate your JSON string.</p>
