<p>Build scripts may need it to be present but you can always keep <code>layout</code> folder empty anyway, however this is not the best approach imho. I'd consider <code>layout</code> the <strong>default</strong> layout - but it is up to you if you put portrait or landscape layouts there (I'd suggest putting portrait) so in that case you need just <code>layout</code> and <code>layout-land</code>.</p>
