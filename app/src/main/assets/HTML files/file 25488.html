<p>You should consider not using your Alive property at all, and treat the objects that are in your List as enemies that are alive.  This in mind, I would refactor your code to the following:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; Enemies.Count; i++)
    {
        //If player intersects enemy
        if ( player.Bounds.Intersects(Enemies[i].Bounds) )
        {
            Enemies.RemoveAt(i);
            i--;
            continue;
        }               
    }
}


protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
{
    foreach (Enemy enemy in Enemies)
    {
        spriteBatch.Draw(enemy.texture, enemy.position, Color.White);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my code, we now loop through each Enemy checking for an intersection.  If an intersection is found, we remove that enemy from the list.  This removes him forever, and greatly simplifies your code.</p>

<p>Typically when using a property such as .Alive, you would be using a Pool data structure.  </p>
