<p>That will happen if the action is invoked by ajax. Make it a non-ajax action.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: as per your question update, replace <code>&lt;a4j:commandButton&gt;</code> by <code>&lt;h:commandButton&gt;</code> to make it a non-ajax action. By the way, in JSF 2 you do not need navigation cases anymore if the from outcome equals the to view ID already. Remove the whole <code>&lt;navigation-rule&gt;</code>, you don't need it.</p>
