<h2>Activity / Service communication</h2>

<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> keep a <strong>static</strong> variable of your activity, that would lead to leaks and bugs!</p>

<p>Your activity will be re-created and removed by the Android system depending on various conditions (needing the memory resources, configuration change, etc.)</p>

<p>You should implement communication between your Activity and your Service using Intent.</p>

<p>Set you activity <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#lmode" rel="nofollow"><code>launchMode</code></a> to <code>singleTop</code> if you don't want to create a new activity each time. You would then need to handle the intent in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onNewIntent%28android.content.Intent%29" rel="nofollow"><code>onNewIntent(Intent)</code></a> method of your activity</p>

<h2>Loading url from a Service</h2>

<p>You cannot use a webView inside a service. You have to use a class like  <code>HttpUrlConnection</code>. See <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/connecting.html#download" rel="nofollow">Connect and Download Data</a> for more information</p>
