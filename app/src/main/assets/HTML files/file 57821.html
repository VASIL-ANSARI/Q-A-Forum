<p>I can't think of any issues with this code. </p>

<p>However I am not sure you need dispatch groups at all for this example. 
You are executing three requests. Request 2 and Request 3 both depend on the result of the Request 1. You need to call the function's completionHandler when Request 2 is finished. Can't you do it into the completion handler of Request 2?</p>
