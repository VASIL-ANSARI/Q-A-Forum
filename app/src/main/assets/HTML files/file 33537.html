<p>There is at least one way I know of to get the information you are looking for, and that is to use a PIVOT:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT pvt.*
FROM
(
  SELECT ClientPartner, ClientManager, WIPAmount FROM tblTranWIP
) AS tranwip
PIVOT
(
 SUM(WIPAmount) FOR ClientPartner IN ([46], [58], [177], [207])
) AS pvt
</code></pre>
