<p><code>curl --header etc etc</code> is a shell command. The tutorial you link to says <em>From your terminal, run the cURL command below</em></p>

<p><em>Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier</em> is a JavaScript error message. You appear to be trying to enter that code in a JavaScript program (possibly by pasting it into a browser's Developer Tools Console or a Node.JS REPL). </p>

<p>You need to run the command on a shell (such as Bash or Windows Power Shell) not in a JS program.</p>
