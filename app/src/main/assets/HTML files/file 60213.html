  <p>This seems like a bug somewhere, but where?</p>

<p>Right here:</p>

<pre><code>android:background="@color/colorPrimary"
</code></pre>

  <p>Is it in the code generation or is this a bug in Android 4.4? </p>

<p>No, it is your replacement background. It is a color, without any intrinsic padding, and without being wrapped in a <code>StateListDrawable</code>.</p>

<p>The stock background of <code>Button</code> widgets has some amount of padding enforced as part of the background itself (e.g., via some transparent pixels in the nine-patch PNG used for the background). The actual background itself is a <code>StateListDrawable</code>, which chooses one of several other drawable resources to apply based on the state of the <code>Button</code> (e.g., normal, pressed, focused, disabled).</p>

<p>To replace a <code>Button</code> background, you need to first use a <code>StateListDrawable</code> of your own. Otherwise, your <code>Button</code> will not appear to respond visually to click events or other state changes (e.g., being disabled). Then, you can either incorporate some padding into the backgrounds for your states, or put padding on the <code>Button</code> widget itself, as you see fit.</p>

  <p>I think Android Studio should be doing whatever needed to make it work correct on both platform levels</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Android Studio assumes that you know what you are doing. There is no hard-and-fast requirement that <code>Button</code> backgrounds have this sort of padding, and there is no hard-and-fast requirement that a <code>Button</code> be something that makes sense to users (versus "hey, why does this button seem to not respond visually when I tap on it?"). There will be scenarios where developers <em>do</em> want <code>Button</code> widgets to have no padding, such as in an implementation of a segmented-list-control sort of compound widget.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the decision to have some intrinsic padding in the <code>Button</code> background is regrettable. But, that's the way it was implemented back in Android 1.0, and Google has elected to maintain the approach, even with newer themes, presumably for backwards compatibility.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I set only the backgroundTint, then the button has the correct padding on the virtual device, but not the correct color</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have not played with <code>backgroundTint</code> with <code>appcompat-v7</code>. It is possible that you are seeing a bug there. You might consider posting a separate question with a complete example, plus screenshots, to get more specific help with that particular concern.</p>
