<p>The compiler is trying to evaluate the last <code>if</code> as if it were written</p>

<pre><code>if( (ten==10 &amp;&amp; assignBool)=boolTrue  )
</code></pre>

<p>which makes no sense because the left side is not an lvalue (to borrow some vocabulary from C). This is because <code>&amp;&amp;</code> has higher precedence than <code>=</code> in Java.</p>
