<p>Maybe your device does not support the screen recorder, there are many devices which does not support screen recorder thus this is device issue. If you want to record your app screen then simply run the app on android emulator or on genymotion and start your desktop screen recorder and adjust the desktop screen to fit emulator. There are many screen recorder for PC but i prefer cam studio 8.
Thanks</p>
