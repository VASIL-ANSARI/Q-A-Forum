<p>I believe this is happening as you are instructing the ParseSDK to <em>become</em> that other user, which looks like it doesn't work if it's the same as the current user (i.e. your session is valid).</p>

<p>I handle the session check a little bit differently. Instead, I refresh the user, then trap any errors and check for an invalid session. This works well :)</p>

<pre><code>[[PFUser currentUser] fetchInBackgroundWithBlock:^(PFObject *object, NSError *error) {
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@"Error refreshing user %@", error.localizedDescription);

        // check if the session token is invalid... force a logout!
        if ([error.domain isEqualToString:PFParseErrorDomain] &amp;&amp; error.code == kPFErrorInvalidSessionToken) {
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                [PFUser logOut];

                // Show your login screen or whatever here
            });
        }

        return;
    }
}];
</code></pre>
