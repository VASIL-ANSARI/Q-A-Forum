<p>You need to escape the special <code>\</code> escape character to place an actual <code>\</code> in the string. Also, you do not need to escape all these characters, just the ones that have a special meaning within the brackets.</p>

<p>Try with:</p>

<pre><code>"[\\w Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³ÃºÃ±Ã,.()!\\-+%$]"
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>this pass ----> "||Â°Â°dafsasdf" but this didnt pass the valid --->
  "||Â°Â°"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, it's because right now as long as a single character in the string matches the regex, it will pass. You have to create a whole pattern match with a defined <em>start</em> and <em>end</em>.</p>

<pre><code>"^[\\w Ã¡Ã©Ã­Ã³ÃºÃ±Ã,.()!\\-+%$]*$"
</code></pre>
