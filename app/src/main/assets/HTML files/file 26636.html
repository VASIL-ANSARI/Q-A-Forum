<p>MySQL only ever interacts with the server it's running on so it will only ever give the time zone of that server. You'd have to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13/determining-a-web-users-time-zone">get the time zone on the client side</a>.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>MySQL doesn't have a time zone literal so you can use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function%5Futc-timestamp" rel="nofollow">UTC_TIMESTAMP()</a> to get the current time in UTC or you can convert the time elsewhere.</p>
