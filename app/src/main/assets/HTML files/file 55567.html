<p>You need to write <code>count(b.id)</code> instead of <code>b.count(id)</code>. Use below query. </p>

<pre><code>$getBillsSumQuery = "SELECT a.totalBillsAmount , count(b.id) FROM apartments AS a , bills AS b 
WHERE a.number = "'.$apartmentNum.'" AND b.apartmentNumber = '.$apartmentNum.'";
</code></pre>
