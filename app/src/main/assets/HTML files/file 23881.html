<p>Are you working with the latest ADT plugin and SDK revision? That is rev 22.x. If so there has been an important change to the dependency management. </p>

<h3>Possible solution</h3>

<p>For some reason the contents of the <code>Order and Export</code> tab has completely changed and you now have to export the <code>Android Private Libraries</code> from your library projects. See screenshot below:</p>

<h3>More details</h3>

<p>The tricky part of this change is that your project still compiles properly in Eclipse so you're not aware of any issues. Until you deploy the app on an emulator or device and you get the <code>ClassDefNotFoundException</code> on any call of a library project.</p>

<p><sup>Not confirmed but I believe this is related to recent changes for maven support, also related to android studio preview</sup></p>

<h3>Similar change in the past</h3>

<p>This reminds me of a similar change in the update to rev 17 where the <code>lib</code> folder suddenly changed to <code>libs</code> and all content from the original <code>lib</code> folder wasn't packaged so you wouldn't see any issues in eclipse. Only once installed on a device.</p>

<p>More information that 'issue' is available on <a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/dealingwithdependenciesinandroidprojects" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. If you search on stackoverflow for "sdk 17" and "classdefnotfound' you'll also get enoug questions about that change.</p>
