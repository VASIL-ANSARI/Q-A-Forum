<p>Based on <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db">this</a> page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Android does not impose any limitations beyond the standard SQLite
  concepts. We do recommend including an autoincrement value key field
  that can be used as a unique ID to quickly find a record. This is not
  required for private data, but if you implement a content provider,
  you must include a unique ID using the BaseColumns._ID constant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The limit is tied to <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html">SQLite limitation</a>. As for what happened when we hit that limit, I guess android will raise <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteFullException.html">SQLiteFullException</a>.</p>
