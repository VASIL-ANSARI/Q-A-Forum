<p>I may say you should not use a container directly into your class library. Your class library should have dependecies between classes within the library. The application(Front-End / root of the apps graph) will use a container to resolve all dependencies including those into your class library.
IMHO using an <code>IoC</code> within a class library smells like a ServiceLocator.</p>
