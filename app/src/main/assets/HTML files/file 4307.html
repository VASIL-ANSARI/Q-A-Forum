<p>If all of the images are hidden, then there will never be a 'scroll' even called as the element will never scroll.</p>

<p>What exactly are you trying to achieve? If it is to have new images that weren't previously visible, but now may be, become visible then you will have to do something like;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="b1" style="overflow:auto;"&gt;
&lt;?php $result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM images");

while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
    echo "&lt;img src='$row[photo]' style='visibility:hidden'&gt; &lt;br&gt;";
} ?&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

function imgCheck() {
    var scrollCheck = $("#b1").scrollTop() + $("#b1").height();

    $("#b1 img").each(function() {
        var position = $(this).offset().top;            
        if (scrollCheck &gt; position) {
            $(this).fadeIn("fast");
        }
    });
}

$(document).ready(imgCheck);

$("#b1").scroll(imgCheck);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I haven't tested the above, and I can imagine that it will result in all images being shown immediately, since all of their 'top's will be 0 due to them all being hidden and not having their position effected by previous images in the DOM.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I've changed the code above so the img's have visibility:hidden, which should give them a height and take up space in the DOM</p>
