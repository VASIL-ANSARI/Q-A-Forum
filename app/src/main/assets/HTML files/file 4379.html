<p>When you present ViewController(VC) B as a modal from VC A it should not dealloc any of VC A variables(unless maybe a Memory Warning is sent).  If you want to reload table data that resides in VC A when you dismiss B then you can use [UITableView reloadData].  You should call this from the viewDidAppear method since this will be called anytime the view is coming back onto the screen.  Hope this helps!</p>

<p>ps.. replace UITableView with appropriate table to reload.</p>
