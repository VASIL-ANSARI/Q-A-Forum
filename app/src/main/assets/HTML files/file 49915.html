<p>The first two elements after <code>Split</code>: <code>"8 5 5 4"</code> and <code>" 2 6 5 3"</code>, their <code>Length</code> being <code>7</code> and <code>8</code> respectively. Replacing spaces with spaces does nothing: <code>Length</code> is still <code>7</code> and <code>8</code>. Also note that <code>100 3</code> and <code>1 2 3</code> have the same <code>Length</code>.</p>

<p>What you want to check is if each element of <code>Split(';')</code> which was then <code>Split(' ')</code> has the same <code>Length</code> (<code>4</code> in the first example, and <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> in my second example). You would also want to do it in a loop, because testing just first two rows does not protect you from <code>[1 2; 3 4; 5 6 7 8]</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>Console.WriteLine</code> is not throwing an exception, which is what I suppose you should be doing in this exercise, given the wording of your task: you need <code>throw</code>.
