<p><code>this</code> is a valid reference to an instance of <code>Everything</code>. As such, it is a valid reference to the <code>Everything</code> class, and therefore a valid way of accessing any static member and/or method of that class.</p>

<p>You can even do:</p>

<pre><code>Everything nothing = null;
nothing.answer; // Does not throw an NPE!!
</code></pre>

<p>Generally, this is not very good practice... IDEA, for instance, will warn you that you "access a static member via an instance reference".</p>
