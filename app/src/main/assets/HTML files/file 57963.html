<p>I had the same error, and finally figured out that phpmailer wants to use a normal smtp connection and then STARTTLS or STARTSSL to initialize encryption. In other words: it wants to connect to a submission service instead of an smtps service. Submission is on port 587 (usually) and smtps is on port 465. In fact, the smtps protocol was deprecated a long time ago. There are still many ISPs out there using smtps, but apparently they shouldn't.</p>

<p>If your mail provider allows you to use submission (port 586) instead of 465, then change your port number in your config and it will work! If you happen to be the sysadmin on the smtp server, then simply start a submission service, listening on port 587. If your ISP only supports smtps, then probably you are stuck. It seems that phpmailer does not handle SMTPS connections that are encrypted from the beginning. It only support connections that can be switched to encrypted (using STARTTLS).</p>

<p>The difference between the two is also described here:</p>

<p>UPDATE: before you try sending out any email, please update to the very latest version of phpmailer. Download the latest from github ( <a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer</a> ). Do not try to use any other version! Sometimes a small change in the minor version will decide between a successfully sent email and an "smtp connection error".</p>
