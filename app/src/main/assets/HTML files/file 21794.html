<p>You seem you be (just) asking how to create an <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/imageio/stream/ImageInputStream.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ImageInputStream</code></a> that reads from a byte array.  From reading the javadocs, I think this should work:</p>

<pre><code>new MemoryCacheImageInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(myimagedata))
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>FileImageInputStream</code> class doesn't have a constructor that allows you to read from anything but a file in the file system.</p>

<p>The <code>FileCacheImageInputStream</code> would also be an option, but it involves providing a directory in the file system for temporary caching ... and that seems undesirable in this context.</p>
