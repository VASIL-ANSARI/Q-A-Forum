<p>First off, are you entirely sure that you can't solve your problem by specifying options to the spinner object?  It seems that with the <code>min</code>, <code>max</code> and <code>step</code> options you could make the <code>step</code> be any percentage of the range that you wanted at the time you created the spinner or set the range.  Here's <a href="http://api.jqueryui.com/spinner/#option-step" rel="nofollow">the doc</a> for the <code>step</code> option.</p>

<p>If this is an internal function (not exposed in a public API or as a method on a public object), then it all depends upon how it is coded.  If it is not put into a public namespace and it is defined within some other function, then you can't get at it to redefine it.  The internals of a function are not something you can get to from outside the function in Javascript unless they are explicitly make accessible to the public somehow.</p>

<p>If it is in a public API somewhere, then you can just assign a new function to whatever symbol the API is on and that will replace the original function (usually you save the original function first so you can still use it if needed).</p>

<p>We can't really help you more specifically without you showing us the actual code you're wanting to override.  FYI, I can't find a function called <code>_doSpin</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui" rel="nofollow">jQueryUI source repository</a>, so I don't really know which function in which code you're trying to override.</p>

<p>Edit: In a Google search, I found <a href="https://code.google.com/p/struts2-jquery/source/browse/trunk/struts2-jquery-plugin/src/main/resources/template/js/plugins/jquery.ui.spinner.js?r=1604" rel="nofollow">another version of a jQuery UI spinner</a> that does have a <code>_doSpin()</code> method.  In that version the <code>_doSpin()</code> method ends up as a method on the prototype for the spinner widget object (which is a jQuery UI object structure it uses for all its objects).  I don't personally have much experience with jQueryUI, but from reading their doc on the widget factory, it sounds like you can inherit from an existing widget and replace methods on the prototype.  Or, you could probably hack on the prototype directly - though it would take some doing to figure out how/where jQueryUI stores it or how to get to it.</p>
