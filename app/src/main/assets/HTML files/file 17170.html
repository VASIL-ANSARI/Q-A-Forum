<p>You could re-render image with lines on top of it</p>

<pre><code>- (UIImage *)renderImage:(UIImage *)image atSize:(CGSize)size
{
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(size);
    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, size.width, size.height)];
    //Draw your lines here
    UIImage *newImage=UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
    return newImage;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Although depending on what you are doing with your app this might not be the best approach.
Hope this helped.</p>
