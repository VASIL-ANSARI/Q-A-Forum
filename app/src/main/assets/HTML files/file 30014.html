<p>There are a few ways to do this nicely, but they all have the basis of using 1.) static assert. 2) Static eval functions.</p>

<p>Personaly, I'd use (in the constructor)</p>

<pre><code>static_assert(std::is_base_of&lt;ElementEx,T&gt;::value,"T must derive from ElementEx")
</code></pre>

<p>But there is probably a better way. What is the X part of your problem (what are you trying to achieve with this weird inheritance structure?)</p>
