<p>You <strong>have</strong> to register your application with Twitter <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new" rel="nofollow">here</a> to get your key and secret. You don't have to provide a real website if you're just testing. Make sure you provide real information when you release your application. </p>

<p>I also recommend sticking with OAuth, it's worth it and shouldn't be too complicated to work with. I personally use twitter4j for integration with android which you can find more info on <a href="http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'm sure JTwitter is also fine but I cannot comment on it since I never tried it. </p>

<p>Once you get your key and secret, it should be pretty straightforward. If you require further assistance, there are plenty of tutorials you can find around to help you.</p>
