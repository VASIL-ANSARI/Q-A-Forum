<p>The result of your aggregation and sorting call is a pandas series whose index are the groups you are looking for. So to find the groups with greater than a certain <code>cutOffvalue</code></p>

<pre><code>cutOffValue = 80
counts = data[data["gender"]=="male"].groupby('age').city.nunique().sort_values(ascending=False)
groups = counts[counts &gt; cutOffValue].index
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, if you want it as a list or set, you could easily cast the final value</p>

<pre><code>groups = list(groups)
</code></pre>
