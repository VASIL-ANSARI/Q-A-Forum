<p>Using NLog, you need to separate what you log, from what you save.</p>

<p>You can send anything to be logged - <a href="https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/Event-context%20layout%20renderer" rel="nofollow">this page</a> should explain how to pass custom values. What you then need to do is define your target. this would be your DB, but could equally be a text file, or any of the other targets NLog supports.</p>

<p>For each parameter define a layout, using the layout syntax. you could therefore pass a custom value in as outlined about &amp; map this to a particular parameter.</p>

<pre><code>class SomeServerApi
{
    private Logger _log;
    private LogEventInfo _theevent;

    public SomeServerApi()
    {
        _log = LogManager.GetCurrentClassLogger();
        _theEvent = new LogEventInfo(LogLevel.Debug, "", "Pass my custom value");
    }

    public void SomeMethod()
    {
       //something happens here

        _theEvent.Properties["MyValue"] = "My custom string";
        _log.Log(theEvent);
    }
}
</code></pre>
