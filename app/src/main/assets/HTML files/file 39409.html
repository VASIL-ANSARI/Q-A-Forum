<p>It seems like you didn't provide correct launch screen images to your app. When there is no correct launch images set, the app will run like on iPhone 5/5S, that's why you are having these confusing results while logging. iPhone 6 screen size is 375x667 px scale x2, iPhone 6+ 414x736 px scale x3. So, if you want to set launch screen for iPhone 6 it should have 750x1334 px size, and 1242x2208 for iPhone 6+ respectively. Good Luck!</p>
