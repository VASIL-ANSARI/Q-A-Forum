<p>I'm not sure where in your architecture you're using AutoMapper, but you could conceptually whitelist the properties before doing the automapping.  For example, if you're in MVC and you're doing modelbinding, there are techniques (e.g. in the UpdateModel method) to include or exclude a list of properties. </p>
