<p>May be the other way is assume list has all 1's. Set it to false as soon as you see 0 and return from the loop.</p>

<pre><code>  boolean isSearchValue = true;


    for (Field formFieldValMap : fieldList) {
                if (formFieldValMap.getIsSearchableField().equals("0")) {

                    isSearchValue = false;
                    return;
                } 
            }
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: You may need to take care of other conditions like what do to if list empty etc.,</p>
