<p>Instead of defining <code>touchesMoved</code> in a view controller, define it in a <em>view</em>. The main view of the view controller will do. (You will need to subclass UIView and make the main view of the view controller an instance of this subclass.)</p>

<p>It will have the same effect, but now you are not in the view controller hierarchy and you won't get messages from the other view controller's views.</p>

<p>Another alternative: pull a UITouch out of the <code>touches:</code> and look at its <code>view</code>. If this isn't your view, ignore this call.</p>
