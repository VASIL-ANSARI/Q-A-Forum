<p>First, as CommonsWare said, you should be using the v2 maps API. When did you request the key? You can't request Maps v1 keys after March 2013. I suspect you may be trying to use a v2 key with the v1 API. Check your logcat to see if there's a message.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/" rel="nofollow">Google Maps API (v2)</a></p>

<p>Another possibility is that you registered the key incorrectly. Are you sure you have the SHA1 fingerprint of the right key? If you registered a v1 key when they were available, are you sure you're signing with the same key you registered?</p>

<p>Also - it looks like, based on your status bar, that you're not getting a good connection. Google maps requires a network connection. Try turning on wifi to check if it works. If so, it's likely that you just weren't getting the maps downloaded. If wifi works, try allowing the app to sit for a bit with wifi turned off and see if the maps eventually load over 3G.</p>
