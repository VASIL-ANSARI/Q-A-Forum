<p>The problem is to do with the fact that the <code>ul</code>s are set to <code>display: inline</code>, when the jQuery <code>.toggle()</code> method sets them to <code>display: inline-block</code> when it is showing them.</p>

<p>So I suggest you tweak your CSS to have the <code>ul</code>s look right as block level elements, and then jQuery's functions should work.</p>
