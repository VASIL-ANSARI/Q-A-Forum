<p>The problem is that they probably 'orverwrite' each other. Best way to fix this is as follows (I use JasperSoft Studio, which is the follow up of iReport and works great):</p>

<ul>
<li>In your Project Outline (don't know what it's called in iReport); the panel in which 'Detail_1' part is visible as well as the Title, Styles etc. Right-click on 'Detail_1' and then click 'Add band'. This way you add a new band, which does it's own sizing.</li>
<li>Move youre second table to Detail_2 and you're done.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope it helps</p>
