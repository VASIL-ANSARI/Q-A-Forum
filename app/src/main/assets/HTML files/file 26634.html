<p>This does seem to simply be a limitation in some versions of IE. But, you seem open to alternatives:</p>

  <p>How can I rearrange this to work?</p>

<p>I'm guessing this snippet came from frustration that <code>i</code> seemed to change value for the <code>.show()</code> towards the end. That would be due to JavaScript's current lack of block-level scoping and mixing in the asynchronous nature of <code>.mouseover()</code>, so it would reference <code>i</code> after the loop had already run to completion and incremented it to <code>showContain.length+1</code>.</p>

<p>Eventually, you'll be able to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let" rel="nofollow"><code>let</code></a> in place of <code>var</code> to create a block-level <code>i</code> within the loop (the keyword is part of the upcoming ECMAScript 6 standard). But, you can currently use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures" rel="nofollow">closure</a> to isolate each value of <code>i</code> in its own <code>function</code> scope.</p>

<pre><code>function eachShowcase(i) {
    $('#showdiv' + i).mouseover(function(){
        $('.showcaseoff').hide();
        $('#showcase' + i).show()
    });
}

for (var i=0; i&lt;showContain.length+1; i++) {
    eachShowcase(i);
}
</code></pre>
