<p>Your expression is almost unreadable, and most of the <code>\</code> backslashes are actually meaningless. Those that do have meaning though are the <code>\[</code>, <code>\(</code> and <code>\)</code> combinations, most of which look like they should not be there <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>For example. the part <code>\[^\&lt;]</code> is broken, as the escaped <code>\[</code> makes the <code>]</code> bracket unbalanced.</p>

<p>Removing all the backslashes makes the pattern compile:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.compile('([^&lt;/td *&gt;([^&lt;]*)&lt;/td *&gt;[^&lt;]*&lt;/td *&gt;([^&lt;]*)&lt;/td *&gt;([^&lt;]*)&lt;/td *&gt;([^&lt;]*)&lt;/td *&gt;&lt;/tr *&gt;')
&lt;_sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x7f8c61c76d50&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Not that the pattern makes any more sense in that case, as there is a <code>[^</code> there at the start signifying a opening character class, but the characters that follow it suggest that that was not the intent there, the <code>\[</code> we saw early might be part of that class then but then you'd be matching anything that is not in the set <code>{'&lt;', '/', 't', 'd', ' ', '*', '(', '[', '^', '&lt;'}</code>, which is probably not what you wanted either.</p>

<p>In short, the whole expression is severely broken, and won't work in the current form in any Python version.</p>

<p>It also looks like you are trying to parse HTML with a regular expression. That is not going to work very well. Use a proper HTML parser instead, BeautifulSoup for example would make the task of extracting table cell data much simpler.</p>
