<p>If all you need to do is save the file, then you can get the JSON from the website, save it in a file locally and then read it in like so:</p>

<pre><code>json_file = open('/path/to/metataste.json').read()
data = json.loads(json_file)
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't think you've explained your question very well. You want to save this file so you don't need to fetch it from metataste each time? Okay, so just save the file. Why is that so difficult? Explain what you've tried so far w/ reading the file that made that difficult.</p>
