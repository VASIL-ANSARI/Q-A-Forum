<p>I would go with <code>group by</code> and <code>union all</code>:</p>

<pre><code>select team, count(*), sum(won), sum(lost)
from ((select team1 as team,
              (case when winner = team1 then 1 else 0 end) as won,
              (case when winner = team1 then 0 else 1 end) as lost
       from cricket_details cd
      ) union all
      (select team2,
              (case when winner = team2 then 1 else 0 end) as won,
              (case when winner = team2 then 0 else 1 end) as lost
       from cricket_details cd
      )
     ) tt
group by team;
</code></pre>
