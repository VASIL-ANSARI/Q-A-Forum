<p>1) Your example code is incomplete: you use dummy function which is not in your listing.
It is important that the dummy function returns size*nmemb (see manual for CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION), so it is difficult to say what went wrong.</p>

<p>2) you don't output your error code: please use curl_easy_strerror to decode your error in the result, then you would know why it failed.</p>

<p>3) if I supply my own "dummy" callback, then I get an HTML page without errors, and the page itself does not complain about wrong password or anything (which is strange, but it kind of works).</p>

<p>Here is my dummy:</p>

<pre><code>    size_t dummy(char *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userdata)
    {
      printf("%.*s", size*nmemb, ptr);
      return size*nmemb;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I looked a bit further what mydlink.com is doing and it is doing acrobatics with the email address (like deciding if it is local, tries to guess a region etc), then manipulates cookies -- it is all in javascript, thus I am afraid one has to dig that Javascript in order to emulate proper login POST, or perhaps find some proper documentation about mydlink.com services, sorry.</p>
