<p>It means that there's no function <code>angleplayer</code> in the current scope. </p>

<p>Since the <code>angleplayer</code> function is part of your <code>Player</code> class, you have to call it through an instace of that class.</p>

<pre><code>if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
    player.angleplayer()
</code></pre>

<p>(you didn't show your complete code, I just guess <code>player</code> is accessible here.)</p>
