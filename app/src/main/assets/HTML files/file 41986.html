<p>Try not controlling the pagination in that subquery, instead just use a more conventional query with a composite where clause. HOWEVER, because you are using left joins take care adding filters through the where clause that would override the outer join to produce the effect of an inner join.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT seltable.*, 
       tbl2.name AS tbl2name, 
       tbl3.name AS tbl3name, 
       tbl4.name AS tbl4name 
FROM selecttable AS seltable
LEFT JOIN table1 AS tbl1 ON seltable.tbl1_uid = tbl1.uid
LEFT JOIN table2 AS tbl2 ON tbl1.tbl2_uid = tbl2.uid
LEFT JOIN table3 AS tbl3 ON tbl2.tbl3_uid = tbl3.uid
LEFT JOIN table4 AS tbl4 ON tbl3.tbl4_uid = tbl4.uid
WHERE seltable.value = 99 
...
ORDER BY seltable.datetime DESC 
LIMIT 50 OFFSET 0 
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively use more subqueries, like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT seltable.*, 
       tbl2.name AS tbl2name, 
       tbl3.name AS tbl3name, 
       tbl4.name AS tbl4name 
FROM
       ( SELECT * FROM selecttable 
         WHERE value = 99 
         ORDER BY datetime DESC 
         LIMIT 50 OFFSET 0 ) 
       AS seltable
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT uid, name
            FROM table1
            WHERE 1=1 -- amend to suit
            ) AS tbl1 ON seltable.tbl1_uid = tbl1.uid
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT uid, name
            FROM table2
            WHERE 1=1 -- amend to suit
            ) AS tbl2 ON tbl1.tbl2_uid = tbl2.uid
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT uid, name
            FROM table3
            WHERE 1=1 -- amend to suit
            ) AS tbl3 ON tbl2.tbl3_uid = tbl3.uid
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT uid, name
            FROM table4
            WHERE 1=1 -- amend to suit
            ) AS tbl4 ON tbl3.tbl4_uid = tbl4.uid;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is another attempt, based on your sqlfiddle it appears that INNER JOINS may be used:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT theteam.*, 
       trnmnt.name AS tournamentname, 
       cat.name AS categoryname, 
       sport.name AS sportname 
FROM ( 
  SELECT * FROM team 
  ORDER BY team.name ASC ) 
AS theteam 
INNER JOIN tournament_team AS tntm ON tntm.team_uid = theteam.uid 
INNER JOIN tournament AS trnmnt ON tntm.tournament_uid = trnmnt.uid AND trnmnt.name = 'Tournament2'
INNER JOIN category AS cat ON trnmnt.category_uid = cat.uid 
INNER JOIN sport ON cat.sport_uid = sport.uid
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 0
;
</code></pre>

<p>The result of that query is:</p>

<pre><code>| UID |   NAME | TOURNAMENTNAME | CATEGORYNAME | SPORTNAME |
|-----|--------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
|   2 | Team02 |    Tournament2 |      Germany |    Soccer |
|   3 | Team03 |    Tournament2 |      Germany |    Soccer |
|   4 | Team04 |    Tournament2 |      Germany |    Soccer |
|   5 | Team05 |    Tournament2 |      Germany |    Soccer |
|   6 | Team06 |    Tournament2 |      Germany |    Soccer |
</code></pre>
