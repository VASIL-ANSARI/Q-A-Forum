<p>The trick here is that a Context is associated with a theme. That theme determines all sorts of things like default text colors, etc.</p>

<p>Before Honeycomb Dialogs always had the same theme whether they were generated from light or dark themed Activities, and with the exception of lists Dialogs were dark background, light foreground. In Honeycomb and forward, Dialogs have different themes determined by the Activity that spawns them.</p>

<p>When inflating content in a Dialog, always use the Context returned by the <code>Dialog#getContext()</code> method instead of the Activity that spawned the Dialog. Instead of the line of code you use to get your <code>LayoutInflater</code> above, try:</p>

<pre><code>LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(getContext());
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: It looks like you're using an AlertDialog.Builder instead of a Dialog. AlertDialog.Builder added a <code>getContext()</code> method for this purpose in API 11 (Android 3.0, a.k.a. Honeycomb) but it didn't exist before that. You can build your own themed context with a <code>ContextThemeWrapper</code> for older devices. Just make sure you never try to call that method on an older version of the platform. You can guard it with a simple check:</p>

<pre><code>Context themedContext;
if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.HONEYCOMB) {
    themedContext = getContext();
} else {
    themedContext = new ContextThemeWrapper(activity, android.R.style.Theme_Dialog);
}
LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(themedContext);
</code></pre>
