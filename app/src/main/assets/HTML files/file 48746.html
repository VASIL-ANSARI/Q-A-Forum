<p>There are a number of things wrong here.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is no span element in your buttons. <code>button span</code> style isn't doing anything for you. If you want to hide the text, I suggest using <code>color: transparent;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to apply a different image for each button, which means you need different selectors.</p>

<p>button#previous {
    background-image: url('prev.jpg');
}</p>

<p>button#next {
    background-image: url('next.jpg');
}</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, applying styles to a button won't affect listeners added in js. Something must be wrong in your js if the buttons aren't working anymore. Please post the relevant code if you'd like help with this.</p></li>
</ol>
