<p>Yes, Wrap native Winsock2 socket with a class that manages it. </p>

<pre><code>class Socket{
  SOCKET m_NativeSocket;

public:
  Socket(){
    m_NativeSocket = ::socket(...);
  }

  ~Socket(){
   ::closesocket(m_NativeSocket);
  }

};
</code></pre>

<p>You should follow this pattern because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sockets are suitable as objects, not just floating variables</li>
<li>Adding destructor makes sure that no matter if the application suddenly aborts, an exception is thrown, socket is out of scope - the socket closes properly</li>
<li>It's nicer and cleaner to work with sockets as objects.</li>
</ol>

<p>make sure you implement proper move constructor.</p>
