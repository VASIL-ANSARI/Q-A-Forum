<p>Update Feb 2016:</p>

<p>The AWS SDK can handle a lot more of this now.  Check out <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HTTPPOSTForms.html" rel="nofollow">how to build the form</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-authentication-HTTPPOST.html" rel="nofollow">how to build the signature</a>.  That should prevent you from needing the bandwidth on your end, assuming you need to do no processing of the content yourself before sending it to S3.</p>
