<p>On such instance where i faced this problem was due to apache web server configuration.</p>

<p>The server was configured to accept x mb of data and my payload was more than x.</p>

<p>Check the access log if this is happening.</p>

<p>In this case for me, firebug was showing "aborted" and chrome developer tool was showing "pending" on the POST request.</p>
