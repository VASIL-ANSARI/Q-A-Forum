<p>You could use <code>explode</code> and <code>implode</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>$category = implode(", ", explode(" ", $category));
</code></pre>

<p>Then just print out the new contents of <code>$category</code>.</p>

<p>After taking your edit into consideration, the above would not really work, however if you were to use <code>split</code> instead of <code>explode</code> you could use regular expressions to do a backreference match on a list of pre-defined words such as: "A", "The", etc... (See: <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html</a> )</p>

<p>This could be a solution, but is still rather problematic. The best approach would be to find a way to delimit your list better.</p>
