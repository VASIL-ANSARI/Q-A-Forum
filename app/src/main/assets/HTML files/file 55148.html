<p>The Excel C API (which Excel-DNA uses) does not have a way to define mandatory (or optional) parameters. If your parameter is of type 'object' then you'll get an object of type ExcelMissing if the parameter was not entered in the formula. You can then return an error like 'ExceErrorValue' to get a #VALUE result.</p>
