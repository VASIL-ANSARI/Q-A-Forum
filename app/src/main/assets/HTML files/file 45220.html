<p>As far as I understand you want to close the drawer when <code>DeleteAll</code> method is called, right? If so, the problem is that you are calling <code>drawer.closeDrawer(navList)</code> into the anonymous <code>OnItemClickListener</code>. You have to move <code>closeDrawer</code> invocation out of the listener object and put it into the <code>DeleteAll</code> method scope.</p>
