<p>PictureBox does not support vector-based images. If you do not want to use WPF, you might want to download an SVG view control. Here's one from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Systems" rel="nofollow">Adobe</a>: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/</a></p>

<p>Once you installed it, the control DLL file should be located at, for example,
<code>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\SVG Viewer 3.0\NPSVG3.dll</code>.</p>

<p>If you add the control on your form, you can load the file as stated below.</p>

<pre><code>AxSVGCtl1.SRC = Filename
</code></pre>
