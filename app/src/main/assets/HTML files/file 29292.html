<p>the link from @mike states:  a fallback implementation using GeoCoder handler and asynctask class both needs to be synchronized - like if no service we can get the address from URL.
This is the only solution we can provide unfortunately @Poutrathor.</p>

<p>Refer here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7109240/service-not-available-geocoder-android">Service not Available - Geocoder Android</a></p>

<p>Also we cannot force user to reboot but at least inform a solution about it.</p>
