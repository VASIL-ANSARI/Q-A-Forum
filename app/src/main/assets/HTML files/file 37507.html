<p>The solution was actually something bizarre and strange. I had the "next" and "previous" buttons contained in each hidden div. They all contain #next and #previous which in theory wouldn't matter if the buttons are switch because the script itself is only listening to those tags. However, once I moved the button away from each individial page and set inside the div that contains each page, it works. There must be something in Jquery that affects the DOM element structure and what it listens to despite that fact that all of those buttons contain virtually the same attribute.</p>

<p>I don't quite understand it myself, but tl;dr, the fix was just putting the next and previous buttons somewhere else. My code works perfectly, so for the one person who attempted to help me, thank you. For the one person who downvoted this question, well, I hope your day sucks.</p>
