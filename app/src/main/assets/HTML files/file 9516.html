<p>The reason because the word Item is being added is because the following:</p>

<pre><code>public enum KopRate
{
    0,
    13,
    21,
    56,
    ts,
    kp
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Is not valid for C# Syntax. The workaround to keep the WSDL as is an be able to deserialize the possible values is to add a letter or something as a prefix. In this case the "Item" word.</p>

<p>If you have control over the WSDL, It's recommended to change the values of the enumeration in order to respect the naming conventions.</p>

<p>If you do <strong>not</strong> have control over the WSDL. You can always change the enumeration as you want, but keeping the XMLEnum attribute, in order to let the deserialization process work correctly.</p>

<p>e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>namespace TestNmsp
{
    [GeneratedCode("System.Xml", "4.0.30319.1")]
    [XmlType(Namespace = "http://www.kop.com/test/schema")]
    [Serializable]
    public enum KopRate
    {
        [XmlEnum("0")] Rate0,
        [XmlEnum("13")] Rate13,
        [XmlEnum("21")] Rate21,
        [XmlEnum("56")] Rate56,
        ts,
        kp,
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please be aware that if you regenerate the proxy you will lose this change.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
