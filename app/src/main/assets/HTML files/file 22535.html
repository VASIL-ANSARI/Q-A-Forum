<p>If you want to have n of something and be able to reference them - put them into an array.</p>

<pre><code>var myLists = []; //Shorthand for new Array()

var list = new DynamicList("[user input title from form]"); //first list
list.buildList()
myLists.push(list);

list = new DynamicList("[user input title from form]"); //second list
list.buildList()
myLists.push(list);
</code></pre>

<p>You could also get rid of the buildList() call by creating a constructor.</p>
