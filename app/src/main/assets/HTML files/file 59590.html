<p>Undertow is only a servlet container.  Weld (or OWB) provide CDI support.  I'm not sure how you're instantiating Undertow, but you need to leverage Weld (or some other CDI implementation).</p>

<p>Here's one example how to do it.  Leverage a <a href="https://github.com/hammock-project/hammock/blob/master/web-undertow/src/main/java/ws/ament/hammock/web/undertow/websocket/UndertowWebSocketExtension.java#L31" rel="nofollow">CDI Extension</a> to find the endpoints, and once you have them you can <a href="https://github.com/hammock-project/hammock/blob/master/web-undertow/src/main/java/ws/ament/hammock/web/undertow/UndertowWebServer.java#L88,L93" rel="nofollow">register them in Undertow</a></p>

<p>Feel free to leverage Hammock for this.</p>
