<p>Because there is no bit data type that exists on the physical computer. The smallest allotment you can allocate on most modern computers is a byte which is also known as an octet or 8 bits. When you display a single bit you are really just pulling that first bit out of the byte with arithmetic and adding it to a new byte which still is using an 8 byte space. If you want to put bit data inside of a byte you can but it will be stored as a at least a single byte no matter what programming language you use.</p>
