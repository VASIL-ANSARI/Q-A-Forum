<p>Sqoop and Sqoop2 have <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/sqoop/1.99.4" rel="nofollow">binary distributions</a> that differ based on Hadoop version. This kind of error can be seen in Sqoop2 if it is compiled with the wrong version of Hadoop or if the wrong hadoop libraries are on your system. Things to try to fix this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Look for old hadoop jars that may make it into the classpath. <code>find / -name 'hadoop*.jar'</code> should work.</li>
<li>Make sure you've downloaded a binary distrubtion of Sqoop. If you're using Hadoop2, download Sqoop2 for Hadoop2. If you're using Hadoop1 download Sqoop2 for Hadoop1.</li>
<li>Explicitly set the classpath via the tomcat properties in <code>&lt;server configuration directory&gt;/catalina.properties</code>. Jars can be explicitly added to <code>common.loader</code>.</li>
<li>If all else fails, reach out to the <a href="http://sqoop.apache.org/mail-lists.html" rel="nofollow">Sqoop mailing list</a>.</li>
