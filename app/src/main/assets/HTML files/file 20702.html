<p>I did not find any direct way to solve this Issue.But what I did was via DataUtils we can get the rows from the cursor add to a list.this List I have passed to the ContentProvider.The contentProvider creates a MatrixCursor and converts to Cursor and send back to the UI. There could have been a better solution If able to read the raws[] from the CursorWindow.</p>
