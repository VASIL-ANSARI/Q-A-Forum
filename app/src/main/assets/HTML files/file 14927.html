<p>Justin Boo pointed me to the best thread and although there are many votes and answers, the user who asked that question seems to have abandoned stack overflow. </p>

<p>I won't attempt to duplicate the best answer other then resume in a paragraph:</p>

<p>Xcode got confused with all my common headers declared in the <strong>.pch file</strong>, and the setting "<strong>Precompile Prefix Header</strong>" in Build Settings meant that Xcode was getting into some internal conflicts due to recursive imports of frameworks. <strong>So change that setting to NO</strong>.</p>

<p>So to keep things tidy, here's a link to the true answer that had me in a headlock: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6033009/662605">http://stackoverflow.com/a/6033009/662605</a></p>
