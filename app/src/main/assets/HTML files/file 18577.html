<p>The issue is you're looking at the default memory column shown in Task Manager, which is "Memory - Private Working Set." This doesn't reflect what is actually reserved for use. </p>

<p>In Task Manager, go to the View menu and choose Select Columns. Add the "Memory - Commit Size" column. You should see this column reflects the reserved heap size from Java. In my tests, it shows around 6.6GB committed for a commandline of -Xms6G.</p>

<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows-vista/What-do-the-Task-Manager-memory-columns-mean" rel="nofollow">Here is Microsoft's page that explains what each column means.</a></p>

<p>"<strong>Memory - Private Working Set:</strong> Subset of working set that specifically describes the amount of memory a process is using that cannot be shared by other processes."</p>

<p>"<strong>Memory - Commit Size:</strong> Amount of virtual memory that is reserved for use by a process."</p>
