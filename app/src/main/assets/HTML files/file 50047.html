<p>This issue comes from the requirement of upgraded build tools, just as referred <a href="https://github.com/gabrielemariotti/cardslib/issues/444" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>In my case all I needed was change in <code>build.gradle</code> from.</p>

<pre><code>...
compileSdkVersion 23
buildToolsVersion "21.1.2"
...
</code></pre>

<p>To</p>

<pre><code>...
compileSdkVersion 23
buildToolsVersion "22.0.1"
...
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using Android Studio and you don't have latest build tools installed, you will be prompted with wizard that can install it automatically.</p>
