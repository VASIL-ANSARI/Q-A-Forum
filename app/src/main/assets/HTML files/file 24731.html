<p>I believe you need to treat separately the architecture you're implementing and the frameworks you're using to implement the architecture.</p>

<p>Java has a rich set of tools for working on the three standard tiers of your application and choices depend on some factors like expected load and server resources, if you have a two or three users application then it is just a matter of taste.</p>

<p>In terms of DAO/DTO then you have also some options, for example you can build your Data access layer with hibernate and then for your service layer API use DTO's. In this situation you probably want to use a tool for mapping between your domain model and your DTO's (for example jDTO Binder).</p>

<p>Another common approach is to use Spring JDBC Template, there you can go a little bit more crazy and use the same Domain objects as part of the Service layer API.</p>

<p>Finally, the truth is, you can do this by the book or you can do it completely different choice is based on your scenario, taste and experience.</p>
