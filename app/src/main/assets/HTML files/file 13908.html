<p>I wouldn't necessarily try to replicate what you can do in Visual FoxPro since it's usually a good idea in that language to avoid macro substitution unless you absolutely <em>have</em> to use it, and you can't use a name expression instead.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a name expression:</p>

<pre><code>STORE 'city' TO cVarCity
REPLACE (cVarCity) WITH 'Paris'
</code></pre>

<p>This is much faster especially in loops.</p>

<p>On the Java side you're probably looking at using the <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/Reflection/index.html" rel="nofollow">Reflection</a> API.</p>
