<p>If you join all the tables together correctly, you'll get one row for each stop time, so a <code>COUNT(*)</code> will give you the total stops.</p>

<p>As for the count by direction, I'll assume the direction values are <code>1, 2, 3, ...</code>. I can't tell which table <code>direction_id</code> is in so I've left it unaliased in the query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT routes.Route_ID
   COUNT(*) AS TotalStops,
   COUNT(CASE WHEN direction_id = 1 THEN 1 END) AS Direction1Stops,
   COUNT(CASE WHEN direction_id = 2 THEN 1 END) AS Direction2Stops,
   COUNT(CASE WHEN direction_id = 3 THEN 1 END) AS Direction3Stops,
   ... and the remaining direction_id values
FROM routes
INNER JOIN trips ON routes.Route_ID = trips.Route_ID
INNER JOIN stoptimes on trips.Trip_ID = stoptimes.Trip_ID
GROUP BY routes.Route_ID
</code></pre>
