<p>You need a <em>definition</em> of the struct to be able to instantiate it. But you seem to have only a <em>declaration</em> (missing <code>#include</code>?).</p>

<p>I believe your 'fix' compiles, but it doesn't actually <em>work</em>: it allocates a new pointer to a struct, but it does not create a struct to be pointed to.</p>
