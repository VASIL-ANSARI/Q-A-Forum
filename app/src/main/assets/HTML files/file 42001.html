<p>Do you have 3 separate onClickListeners for the TextViews? If you have only one, this may be the problem and you could solve it by doing something like this in the listener:</p>

<pre><code>public void onClick(View v){
   switch(v.getId()){
      case R.id.amenities_view:
          //Click first
          break;
      case R.id.cancpolicy_view:
          //Click second
          break;
      case R.id.reviews_view:
          //Click third
          break;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not create this switch, all the views associated with the listener will react to the click.</p>
