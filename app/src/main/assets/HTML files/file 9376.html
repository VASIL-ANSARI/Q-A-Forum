<p>This may seem like an odd answer, but it's consistent with what I've seen happen in chrome before with animations:</p>

<p>Are you including your javascript after your CSS?  Depending on how your page is set up, I've seen Chrome flake out as it's trying to run javascript before CSS styles are loaded, so your animation won't work because it doesn't have the element's <code>position</code> attribute loaded yet.</p>
