<p>One possibility would be to use polar coordinates, and have the radius be a function of the angle. For smooth blobs you want the radius to be smooth, and have the same value at 0 and 2*pi, which can be done using a trigonometric polynomial :</p>

<pre><code>radius(theta) = a_0 + a_1*sin(theta) + a_2*sin(2*theta) + ... + b_1*cos(theta) + ...
</code></pre>

<p>where the coefficients are "random". To control how big and small the radius gets you could search for the max and min of the radius function, and then shift and scale the coefficients appropriately (ie if you want rlo&lt;=r&lt;=rhi, and have found min and max, then replace each coefficient a + b*original, where b = (rhi-rlo)/(max-min) and a = rlo-b*min).</p>
