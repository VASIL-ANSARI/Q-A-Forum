<p>I answered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11904803/generating-java-code-from-xml-in-eclipse">a similar question, but for Java code</a>. The generation technology is language neutral, but your success will depend on how much of your design you can encode in the templates (as in the Java example).  I think the other approach in which you try to code your entire app in the model and then have all your code generated for you will never be more than a fantasy, however.</p>
