<p>The string catenation in <code>bar()</code> can be done at compile time, because it's an expression composed of nothing but compile-time constants. Although the length of the String <code>s</code> is obviously known at compile time, the compiler doesn't know that <code>length()</code> returns that known value, so it won't be used as a constant.</p>
