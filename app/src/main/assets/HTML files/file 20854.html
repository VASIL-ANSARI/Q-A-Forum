<p>I think your problem may be resolved if you assign events for both elements. In the getView method of your adapter, you need to assign the clickListener event and set the tag to both views. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>        relativeLayout1.setOnClickListener(yourClickListener);
        relativeLayout1.setTag(yourPositionTag);
        relativeLayout2.setOnClickListener(yourClickListener);
        relativeLayout2.setTag(yourPositionTag);
</code></pre>

<p>This way, you are able to detect which view was selected in your onClick method:</p>

<pre><code>    public void onClick(View v) {
    yourTag = v.getTag();
    switch (v.getId()) {

    case R.id.relativeLayout1:
        // your code here
        break;
    case R.id.relativeLayout2:
        // your code here
        break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this help!</p>
