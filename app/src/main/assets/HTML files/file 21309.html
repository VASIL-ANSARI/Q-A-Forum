<p>One way to solve this is using ObservableCollection, which is made for situations like this. </p>

<pre><code>public ObservableCollection&lt;Part&gt; Parts
{
    get { return parts; }
    set { parts = value; NotifyPropertyChanged("Parts");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could implement the interface INotifyCollectionChanged manually</p>

<p>The problem is, basically, that the binding system does not know when you call Add. If you were reassigning the Parts property each time, then the system would just redraw everything, so it would reflect the changes too, but if ObservableCollection is not a problem, that's the prefered way</p>
