<p>take alook at this question <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/164310/pan-panel-for-ol3">here</a>. There is a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/expedio/hLzm22um/" rel="nofollow">fiddle</a> in the answer. I think you can set </p>

<pre><code>dragPan: false;
</code></pre>

<p>and use the pan controls like the one in the fiddle</p>
