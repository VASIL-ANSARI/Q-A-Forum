<p>Typically when deploying an application to an end user that needs to email, the user will need to enter their own SMTP server information in order to send mail.  Even if you encrypt your username and password a motivated attacker would be able to grab them once they are unencrypted for use by your application.  If you have to send mail on your user's behalf the best way would be to create a service that accepts requests from your application and sends the mail server side.</p>
