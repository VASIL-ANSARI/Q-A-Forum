<p>It seems that, the method on which you create the <code>LeveyPopListView</code> triggers more than once when you tap fast to create the list, resulting in creation of more lists than the required.</p>

<p>I think you should insert a check in the list creation method which confirms that 'if the list is already been created than does not create the new one else create one'.</p>

<p>You can do so by declaring the instance of <code>LeveyPopListView</code> as member variable as -</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, strong) LeveyPopListView *m_lplv;
</code></pre>

<p>inside create list</p>

<pre><code>- (void) createLeveyPopList
{
    if(self.m_lplv != nil)
        return;

    self.m_lplv = [[LeveyPopListView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Share Photo  to..." options:_options];
    self.m_lplv.delegate = self;
    [self.m_lplv showInView:self.window animated:YES];
    [self.m_lplv release];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also create a remove method to remove the list from super view as -</p>

<pre><code>- (void) removeLeveyPopList
{
    self.m_lplv.delegate = nil;
    [self.m_lplv removeFromSuperview];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Call the above method <code>removeLeveyPopList</code> when you are done with the list, which will remove the list from the superview.</p>

<p>And again when you need to create the list call <code>createLeveyPopList</code> which will check if the list is already created, if YES than it won't create the new else create one.</p>
