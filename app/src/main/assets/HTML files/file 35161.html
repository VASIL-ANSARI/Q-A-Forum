<p>Vertex Array Objects are simply a container for the settings that determine where OpenGL gets vertices from. They are NOT associated with any shader; you can use the same VAO with multiple shaders, as long as the vertex attributes match up. Therefore, they should be their own, separate class.</p>

<p>For a 2D sprite based game, where you are mostly drawing rectangles, I recommend simply creating one VAO with the rectangle mesh, and using it whenever drawing sprites.</p>
