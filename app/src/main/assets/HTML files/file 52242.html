<p>Location 0x00000008 is very near to zero. This usually means that you tried to access a member of a class, but a pointer to the object equals zero. (member of a class is at offset 8 within a class, which probably means there are two other members before it of size 4, since most members take 4 bytes). </p>

<p>Accessing a member through a zero pointer is an "Undefined Behavior", which means that at this point a program can do anything, including spontaneously combusting the comp, but in this case it actually assumes there's an object at address zero, and tries to access it.</p>

<p>In your case <code>temp == nullptr</code>, so accessing <code>temp-&gt;next</code> must not be done if you want your program to live. And this means <code>LinkedList::first_ == nullptr</code>. I think you need a special handling of this special case.</p>
