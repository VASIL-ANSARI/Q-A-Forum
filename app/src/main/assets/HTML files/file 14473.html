<p>It should be easy to determine the size of the <code>POST</code> request so long as it's just text input. If you also have file inputs it'll be a bit harder but doable with HTML5 stuff.</p>

<p>Just add up all the fields and their values.</p>

<p>Typically <code>POST</code> form-data looks like:</p>

<p><code>"key=value&amp;key2=value"</code></p>

<p>So add 1 byte for each field (for the <code>=</code>), and n-1 bytes in total (for the <code>&amp;</code>).</p>

<p>Then get a good number for the header, 100 bytes or so? Maybe 200.</p>
