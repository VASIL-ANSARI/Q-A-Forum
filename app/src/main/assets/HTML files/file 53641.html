<p>For example, say your MEDIA_ROOT is set to '/home/media', and upload_to is set to 'photos/%Y/%m/%d'. The '%Y/%m/%d' part of upload_to is strftime() formatting; '%Y' is the four-digit year, '%m' is the two-digit month and '%d' is the two-digit day. If you upload a file on Jan. 15, 2007, it will be saved in the directory /home/media/photos/2007/01/15.</p>

<p>If you wanted to retrieve the uploaded fileâs on-disk filename, or the fileâs size, you could use the name and size attributes respectively; for more information on the available attributes and methods, see the File class reference and the Managing files topic guide.</p>

<p>So to get the name of <code>screenshot</code>, you'd do <code>screenshot.name</code> and respectively <code>screenshot.path</code> to get the full path.</p>
