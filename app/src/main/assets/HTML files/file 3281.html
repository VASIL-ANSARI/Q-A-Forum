<p>You want AJAX - write a server-side data feed in PHP and browser-side mini-application in JS that talks to the server feed and updates the webpage accordingly. This is achieved using Javascript's XMLHttpRequest object. I highly recommend you learn to use it and then rely on a JS library that wraps around it and provides higher level services (like jQuery)</p>
