<p>The list items in your navigation have a large padding and they are also positioned inline. When they break on the next line (because there is not enough horizontal space) they overlap. The padding of the ones coming last in the list extend over the links above and cover them up. That's why you can't click them.</p>

<p>Try this as a quick fix:</p>

<pre><code>li {
    display: inline;
    font-family: 'bikoregular';
    color: #2d9471;
    padding: 0 4em; /* removed padding at the top and bottom */
}
</code></pre>
