<p>Most of the ASP.NET server side controls use JavaScript to post a <code>form</code> tag that surrounds the entire page content (look for the <code>&lt;form runat="server"&gt;</code> tag in your source files, or for <code>&lt;form name="aspnetForm"&gt;</code> in the HTML source in your browser).</p>

<p>Really, this behavior is so tightly engrained in WebForms, the use of 1 <code>form</code> tag for the entire page, and hidden inputs for the ViewState, event target, command argument, etc.</p>

<p>If you need functionality without JavaScript, you'll need a back to basics approach of simply relying on the HTTP protocol, by using just <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests with your own <code>form</code> tags (which can't be nested), and regular <code>a</code> tags. </p>

<p>Honestly, if you need functionality without JavaScript, it would probably be easier to switch over to <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET MVC</a>.</p>
