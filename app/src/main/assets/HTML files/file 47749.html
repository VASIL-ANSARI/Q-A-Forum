<p>You're right, there is no need to provide this value as it is already the default one. Could you tell me where you read that such value must be set?</p>

<p>I don't understand what really happens with the second part of your question, as I'm not able to reproduce it (with CorsFilter, or CorsService).</p>

<p>Could you try using the CorsService instead? This service helps to configure the Cors feature, and is integrated in the list of services either of the Application, or the Component, for example in the constructor of the application:</p>

<pre><code>public TestCorsApplication() {
    CorsService corsService = new CorsService();
    corsService.setAllowedCredentials(true);
    corsService.setSkippingResourceForCorsOptions(true);

    getServices().add(corsService);
}
</code></pre>
