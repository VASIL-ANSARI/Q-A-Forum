<p>Two things, not guaranteed to fix the issue, but can certainly help. They're both related:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT CenterLocationId,
       [Location].Stdistance(@h) * Cast(0.000621371 AS FLOAT(53)) AS Distance
FROM   [dbo].[CenterLocation]
WHERE  [Location].Stdistance(@h) &lt;= @Distance / Cast(0.000621371 AS FLOAT(53))
       AND IsDeleted = 0
ORDER  BY [Location].Stdistance(@h)
</code></pre>

<p>That is, prefer to not perform maths in the <code>WHERE</code> clause on expressions that depend on column values - you're forcing the server to perform that maths for each row and destroying any potential for using an index.</p>

<p>Also, similarly, it's pointless to perform a multiplication in the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause, since multiplication (by a positive number) doesn't change ordering.</p>
