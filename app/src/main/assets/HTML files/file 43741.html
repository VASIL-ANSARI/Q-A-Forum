<p>The <code>%</code> operator works on the floating-point types <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> as well as the integral types in Java.  Any number that ends in ".0" or ".5" is divisible by <code>0.5</code>.</p>

<pre><code>if (num % 0.5 == 0)
{
    System.out.println("Ends in .0 or .5!");
}
</code></pre>
