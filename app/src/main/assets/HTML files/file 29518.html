<p>the javascript variable data contains your echoed $response variable. So using your example, it would be something like this. Be sure you are also asking for html as your return data in the ajax function. here is the docs on that: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/</a></p>

<pre><code>success: function( data ) {
    if( data == 'This failed' ) {
        // do something
    } else {
        // do something else
    }
},
</code></pre>
