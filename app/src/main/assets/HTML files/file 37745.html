<p>This can't be accomplished properly on saving, because <em>no visibility declaration</em> means <em>package scope</em> in the java language. You couldn't declare package scope if you would automatically convert <em>no visibility declaration</em> to <em>private scope</em>.</p>

<h2>Use Templates</h2>

<p>In my eclipse installation there is a java template called <em>static_final</em>. Try to trigger it by using <code>Ctrl + Space</code>. You could use this template or add an own similar template, to enforce a visibility declaration. (See <em>Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Templates</em>)</p>

<h2>My best practice</h2>

<p>Don't care about private variables at first. Only introduce them the moment they are needed. Use eclipse auto completion and refactoring features, to introduce your variable.</p>
