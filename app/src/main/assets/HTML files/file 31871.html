<p>My only understanding of applying matrices is related to manipulating 3D vectors so I don't know the answer to your question directly. But in looking around, I did find this link to a blog where your specific issue is addressed. The comments at the bottom are from a bunch of people that could be a good pool of resources to chat with who have knowledge in this area. Also, If you follow the links there is a lot of good image compression info.</p>

<p>The author appears to be heavily involved in photo forensics. He explains how pHash is more robust than the average hash and mentions using a 32 x 32 matrix.</p>

<p>This could be a really good starting point. Take care.</p>
