<blockquote>
  <p>Cryptography - Modified the default implementations of SecureRandom and Cipher.RSA to use OpenSSL. Added SSL Socket support for TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 using OpenSSL 1.0.1</p>

<p>This means that they are using another provider, and probably another <em>default</em> RSA padding mechanism. You should always provide a complete algorithm string and not rely on provider defaults, e.g. try <code>"RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA1AndMGF1Padding"</code> for new applications and <code>"RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding"</code> for compatibility with older libraries.</p>

<p>Note that you usually do not encrypt a file directly using RSA. Usually you encrypt the file with a random data key using e.g. AES, a symmetric cipher. Then you encrypt that AES key with the RSA public key and send the result with the ciphertext. This way you can encrypt an (almost) arbitrary number of bytes. This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem" rel="nofollow">hybrid cryptography</a>.</p>
