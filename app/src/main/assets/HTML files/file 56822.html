<p>After a bunch of scouting this site, I have found an answer.</p>

<pre><code># Manually re-route test/ requests to test
DirectorySlash Off
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} test/$
RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ $1 

# Hide extension
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.php -f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.php
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing is I have to do that separately for each directory that I wish to have this condition.</p>

<p>Answer found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2017748/htaccess-proper-rewriting-of-directory-and-file-with-same-name?rq=1">here</a>.</p>
