<p>What about something like this?</p>

<p>Your model has option keys as columns and values as rows. Why have both keys and values be rows? If you don't need complex type-based validation, it should suffice to have a single options table with a one to optionally many relationship to itself to account for suboptions. To enumerate all options and values, just retrieve all rows from the table. If <code>ParentOptionId</code> is null, then it is a base-level option; otherwise it is a suboption.</p>

<p>EDIT: After reading through your question and comments again, I've come up with a more complicated but more robust design for you to consider:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ghpP.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ghpP.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>It works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every user input is an <code>Option</code>. Every option consists of a display text (<code>OptionText</code>), tooltip/subtext/etc (<code>Description</code>), a default and then user supplied value (<code>Value</code>), a value type (<code>ValueType</code> boolean,text, date, etc). It also has a <code>DisplayOrder</code> so you know where to situate it in relation to other <code>Options</code> in its group. <code>Options</code> can also have a parent/child relationship with other <code>Options</code>. You can do the same for the other entities if you want but I did not model that.</li>
<li>Every <code>Option</code> is contained within an <code>OptionGroup</code> with 0 or more sibling <code>Options</code>. <code>OptionGroups</code> are just a collection of one or  more related <code>Options</code>. The <code>GroupType</code> field dictates how your form builder needs to treat that group. The most obvious example would be for your radio button groups; each of those would be an <code>OptionGroup</code> and each radio button would be a boolean <code>Option</code> within the <code>OptionGroup</code>. An <code>OptionGroup</code> could just as easily handle a multiple selection checkbox group or just some related text inputs that need a common header text (like a street address).</li>
<li>For further dynamic design <code>OptionGroups</code> are contained within <code>GroupSections</code>, even if there is  just one default <code>GroupSection</code> in a form.</li>
<li>Finally, a <code>Form</code> models your final actual UI form and consists of one or more <code>GroupSections</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be flexible enough for you to tweak to your liking. What do you think?</p>

<p>Final note: if you are looking into dynamically building your forms in Javascript, check out a few frameworks like <a href="https://vitalets.github.io/x-editable" rel="nofollow">X-editable</a> or <a href="http://angular-formly.com/#/" rel="nofollow">formly</a>. They take JSON or configuration objects and build out the entire form with validation/etc from there while giving you some hooks for event handling. Chances are you don't need to completely reinvent the wheel unless you want to keep your implementation as simple and specific as possible.</p>
