<p>Inline HTML almost always overrides CSS, and JS sets styles by writing to the inline HTML. I would start by checking your HTML and any style setting in your JS. </p>

<p>In this case, however, it does not appear that BrandonGrotesque-Regular or Helvetica Neue are websafe fonts. Therefore, the text should be rendering in Helvetica, which is the first websafe  font on your specification and looks very close to TNR.
A more or less complete list of websafe fonts may be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>You may also embed your own fonts in the CSS like this:</p>

<pre><code>@font-face {
    font-family: "Copperplate Gothic Bold";
    src: url("/font/COPRGTB.TTF");
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then calling it:</p>

<pre><code>font-family: 'Copperplate Gothic Bold';
</code></pre>
