<p>You could read the file and do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>//Get Source
$Source = ENGINE_DIR . '/data/top.txt';
$Read = file($Source);

$News = array();

foreach ($Read as $line) {
    list($id, $views, $date) = explode('|', $line);
    $News[$id] = array(
        'id' =&gt; $id,
        'views' =&gt; $views,
        'date' =&gt; $date,
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you have the array <code>$News</code> which contains every news item and you can change them as you wish (example: <code>$News[2]['views'] = 242;</code>).</p>

<p>The only thing you're missing now is the writing back to the file part, which is also easy.</p>

<pre><code>$fh = fopen(ENGINE_DIR . '/data/top.txt', 'w'); //'w' mode opens the file for write and truncates it

foreach ($News as $item) {
    fwrite($fh, $item['id'] . '|' . $item['views'] . '|' . $item['date'] . "\n");
}

fclose($fh);
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it! :)</p>
