<p>Create a stack (last in, first out) data structure containing a node pointer an integer, which is where you'll store your index variable.</p>

<p>As you move down your trie, push the current node pointer and index onto the stack, move on to the corresponding node and reset the index variable to 0.</p>

<p>When you get to an end, perform which-ever action you intend to perform on the current node, pop a node pointer and index from your stack increment the index.</p>

<p>When there are no more nodes to push or pop, your job is done.</p>
