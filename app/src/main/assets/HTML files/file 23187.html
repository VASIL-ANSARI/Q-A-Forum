<p>Once you have the app id and API key you can create new notes just like creating any Simperium object as referenced in the <a href="https://simperium.com/docs/reference/http/#objectpost" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The bucket to post to is <code>note</code> and it'll also need to conform to the schema in the following sample note:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "tags" : [ "todo", "later" ],
    "systemTags" : [],
    "creationDate" : 1335390338.091436,
    "modificationDate" : 1335390338.091436,
    "deleted" : false,
    "shareURL" : "",
    "publishURL" : "",
    "content" : "new note content!"
}
</code></pre>

<p>All fields are needed when creating, but you can just specify the fields that have changed when updating.</p>
