<p>Remove <code>autoplay="1"</code> or else the <code>&lt;google-youtube&gt;</code> player will start playback immediately on desktop browsers.</p>

<p>The <code>playsupported</code> property is set to <code>true</code> on platforms that support calling <code>play()</code> (desktop browsers) and <code>false</code> on platforms that don't (most mobile browsers). See <a href="http://googlewebcomponents.github.io/google-youtube/components/google-youtube/" rel="nofollow">the docs</a> for more info.</p>

<p>You can check for <code>playsupported</code> and call <code>play()</code> within the <code>iron-overlay-opened</code> event if it's supported. If it's not supported, well, you can't automatically start playback.</p>

<p>Calling <code>pause()</code> to stop playback is recommended. While the underlying YouTube Player API supports a <code>stopVideo()</code> method, it's something of a last resort and leaves the player in an inconsistent state, which makes it less than ideal if you're going to start playing back a new video later. (See <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#stopVideo" rel="nofollow">the Player API docs</a> for more info.) For this reason, <code>stopVideo()</code> isn't exposed on <code>&lt;google-youtube&gt;</code>.</p>
