<p>I would say the the easiest may not always be the best!  If you're looking to make games I would suggest using C++ with the Android NDK.  If you're looking to make apps the way that would give you the most control is going to be using the SDK.  If you have an existing web app you can use PhoneGap or Air.  It's all about picking the right tool for the job but for 99% of all cases I would say your best bet is to use the SDK.</p>
