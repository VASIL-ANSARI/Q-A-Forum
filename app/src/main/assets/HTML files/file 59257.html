<p>This is using jQueryUI accordion implicitly @Stew.</p>

<p>You have a wrong attribute in your accordion setup code, use the <code>animate</code> in place of <code>animated</code>.</p>

<p>Take a look in this API documentation: <a href="http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion" rel="nofollow">http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion</a> </p>

<p>And it's the original component demonstration: <a href="http://jqueryui.com/accordion/" rel="nofollow">http://jqueryui.com/accordion/</a></p>

<p>I suggest you to take a look in your jQuery files too, if they are OK and in the correct order (in <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section).</p>

<p>Another point is to put your JavaScript in <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section of your HTML and be sure you have no conflict or using older jQuery files versions than the component needs.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
