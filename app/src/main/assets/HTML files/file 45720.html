<p><strong>The notification is delivered when the app isnât running in the foreground.</strong> The system presents the notification, displaying an alert, badging an icon, perhaps playing a sound, and perhaps displaying one or more action buttons for the user to tap.</p>

<p><strong>The notification is delivered when the app is running in the foreground.</strong> The app calls the UIApplicationDelegate method application:didReceiveLocalNotification: or application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:. (If application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: isnât implemented, the system calls application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:.)</p>

<p>So you need handle the notification yourself when received foreground.
