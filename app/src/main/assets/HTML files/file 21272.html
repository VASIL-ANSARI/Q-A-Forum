<p>The issue was that is was taking the charatcters from the string not the array</p>

<pre><code>Dim Part3 As New ArrayList(P3.Split("|"c))
   TextBoxA.Text = P3(0)
   TextBoxB.Text = P3(1)
</code></pre>

<p>it now looks like</p>

<pre><code>Dim Part3 As New ArrayList(P3.Split("|"c))
   TextBoxA.Text = Part3(0)
   TextBoxB.Text = Part3(1)
</code></pre>

<p>which corrected the issue, thank you for your help, sometimes you just need an extra set of eyes to wake you up</p>
