<p>The best examples are located in the unit-tests shipped with the code. <a href="https://github.com/dahlia/wand/blob/master/tests/sequence_test.py" rel="nofollow"><code>wand/tests/sequence_test.py</code></a> for example.</p>

<p>For creating an animated gif with wand, remember to load the image into the sequence, and then set the additional delay/optimize handling after all frames are loaded.</p>

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from wand.image import Image

with Image() as wand:
    # Add new frames into sequance
    with Image(filename='1.png') as one:
        wand.sequence.append(one)
    with Image(filename='2.png') as two:
        wand.sequence.append(two)
    with Image(filename='3.png') as three:
        wand.sequence.append(three)
    # Create progressive delay for each frame
    for cursor in range(3):
        with wand.sequence[cursor] as frame:
            frame.delay = 10 * (cursor + 1)
    # Set layer type
    wand.type = 'optimize'
    wand.save(filename='animated.gif')
</code></pre>
