<p><code>rpy</code> works by running a Python process and an R process in parallel, and exchange information between them. It does not take into account that R calls are called in parallel using <code>multiprocess</code>. So in practice, each of the python processes connects to the same R process. This probably causes the issues you see. </p>

<p>One way to circumvent this issue is to implement the parallel processing in R, and not in Python. You then send everything at once to R, this will process it in parallel, and the result will be sent back to Python. </p>
