<p>You don't need anything outside of standard JDK to read from a text file easily and efficiently. For example you can do so like this:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"));
try {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    String line = br.readLine();

    while (line != null) {
        sb.append(line);
        sb.append(System.lineSeparator());
        line = br.readLine();
    }
    String everything = sb.toString();
} catch(IOException e) {
  }
  finally {
    br.close();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>everything</code> String contains the contents of the <code>file.txt</code>, which must be located in the same directory as where the java class file is being run from.</p>
