<p>This may help : </p>

<p><strong>1st thing we have to check is -</strong> </p>

<p>multipartResolver maxUploadSize: maximum upload size for a single request. That means the total size of all upload files cannot exceed this configured maximum. Default is unlimited (value of -1). </p>

<p><strong>2nd thing we have to check is -</strong></p>

<p>which server you are using to run your application?</p>

<p>If it is tomcat then, 
you have to do some configuration in it </p>

<p>Refer : <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html" rel="nofollow">https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/http.html</a>   </p>

<p>maxPostSize</p>

<p>The maximum size in bytes of the POST which will be handled by the container FORM URL parameter parsing. The limit can be disabled by setting this attribute to a value less than or equal to 0. If not specified, this attribute is set to 2097152 (2 megabytes).</p>

<p>Another Limit is:</p>

<p>maxHttpHeaderSize The maximum size of the request and response HTTP header, specified in bytes. If not specified, this attribute is set to 4096 (4 KB).</p>

<p>You find them in </p>

<p>$TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           maxPostSize="4294967296"
           redirectPort="8443" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will set the maximum file upload size to 4GB.</p>
