<p><code>urllib2.Request()</code> looks like a function call, but isn't - it's an object constructor. It creates an object of type Request from the urllib2 module, documented <a href="http://code.reddit.com/docs/urllib2.Request-class.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>As such, it probably doesn't do anything except initialise itself. You can verify this by looking at the source code, which should be in your Python installation's lib directory (urllib2.py, at least in Python 2.x).</p>
