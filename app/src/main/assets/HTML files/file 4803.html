<p>Design your XML schema so that representation of the information actually makes sense. Usually, the decision between making something in attribute or an element will not affect performance.</p>

<p>Performance problems with XML are in most cases related to large amounts of data that are represented in a very verbose XML dialect. A typical countermeasures is to zip the XML data when storing or transmitting them over the wire.</p>

<p>If that is not sufficient then switching to another format such as JSON, ASN.1 or a custom binary format might be the way to go.</p>

<p>Addressing the second part of your question: The main difference between the <code>XDocument</code> (LINQ) and the <code>XmlReader</code>  class is that the <code>XDocument</code> class builds a full document object model (DOM) in memory, which might be an expensive operation, whereas the <code>XmlReader</code> class gives you a tokenized stream on the input document.</p>
