<p>This construct prevents exception from stopping your program and bubbling up the stack trace. It also returns that exception as a value, which can be useful.</p>

<pre><code>a = get_me_data rescue $!
</code></pre>

<p>After this line, <code>a</code> will hold either requested data or an exception. You can then analyze that exception and act accordingly. </p>

<pre><code>def get_me_data
  raise 'No data for you'
end

a = get_me_data rescue $!
puts "Execution carries on"

p a
# &gt;&gt; Execution carries on
# &gt;&gt; #&lt;RuntimeError: No data for you&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>More realistic example</h3>

<pre><code>lines = File.readlines(filename) rescue $!
</code></pre>

<p>You either get the lines or the error (if file doesn't exist, you don't have permissions, etc). In any case, execution doesn't stop.</p>
