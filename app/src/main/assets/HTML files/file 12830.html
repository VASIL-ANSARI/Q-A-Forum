<p>The problem was that I was sending my test http request to paypal.com rather than sandbox.paypal.com. The answer was in the FAQ left by Jukebox. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Check the script.When testing Payment Data Transfer (PDT) in the
  Sandbox, make sure your PDT script POSTs back information to
  www.sandbox.paypal.com. If testing on the Live PayPal site, make sure
  the script POSTs data back to www.paypal.com. Currently, all sample
  code on the Live and Sandbox sites "point" back to the live PayPal
  site.</p>

<p>Hope it helps someone else get up and running quicker than I did. I am now onto my next issue which is the token being returned as empty rather than an error.. sigh..</p>
