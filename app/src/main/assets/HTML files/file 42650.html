<p>Generally the controls are marked as private to stop code in other modules from reaching in and changing attributes of the class directly. The good news is that there is another (IMHO) better way to do what you are trying to do. Since the generated class is marked as partial you can use a non generated partial Settings class with whatever internal methods you add for what your other class needs to interact with the UI.</p>

<p>This approach is generally considered superior as it will allow you to control how the other class interacts with the Settings class's private members (the controls). So you could add a method like this:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class Settings
{ 
    internal void SetModel(ModelType model)
    {
        // Check if valid model and throw some type of argument exception if not
        settingsTreeView.Model = model;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>settings.SetModel(settingsListStore);
</code></pre>
