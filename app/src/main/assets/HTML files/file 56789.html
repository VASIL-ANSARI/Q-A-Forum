<p>The whole point of virtual functions is being able to access derived functionality from a base reference or pointer - that is how polymorphism works. A <code>Base</code> reference has an underlying derived as its dynamic type. In fact because your <code>Base</code> is abstract (i.e. has pure virtual methods) its dynamic type cannot be itself (apart from some limited edge cases, such as during destruction) as you generally can't create objects of an abstract type.</p>

<p>For the same reason, calls pure virtual methods <em>have</em> to resolve (apart from again some limited circumstances) to calls to derived classes.</p>

<p>One exception to the above is when you attempt to call a pure virtual method from a destructor, where it is likely cause a runtime crash ('pure virtual method called').</p>
