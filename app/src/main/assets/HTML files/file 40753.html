<li><p>You shouldn't call <code>finishAfterTransition()</code> in <code>onBackPressed()</code>. The <code>Activity</code> super class will already do this for you.</p></li>
<li><p>You should call <code>requestFeature()</code> before <code>super.onCreate()</code>. Requesting <code>Window.FEATURE_ACTIVITY_TRANSITIONS</code> is not necessary if you are using the <code>Theme.Material</code> theme (or similar).</p></li>
<li><p>Calling <code>setAllowEnterTransitionOverlap(false)</code> and <code>setAllowReturnTransitionOverlap(false)</code> is redundant here. These determine the activity's window content transitions overlap... they don't affect the activity's shared element content transitions at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting exit and reenter shared element transitions is rarely necessary. You almost always want to use enter and return transitions instead. If you set only the exit and reenter shared element transitions and leave the enter and return shared element transitions null, the called activity will have no way of knowing how to animate the shared elements when the transition begins, and the animation will appear to be broken.</p></li>
