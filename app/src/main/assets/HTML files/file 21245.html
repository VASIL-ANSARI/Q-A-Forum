<p>Creating of a UITableView cell should be just that, creation and not population of data, since we re use cells we should always assume the cell data is stale and needs a refresh, therefore you should always have a way to reset the values of the cells, if you have a custom cell you should expose the controls you are using and set their values accordingly in cellForRowAtIndexPath, if you require to change a cell you should either change the data source values and reload the cell via <code>- (void)reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:(NSArray *)indexPaths withRowAnimation:(UITableViewRowAnimation)animation</code> , or grab a hold of the cell with cellForRowAtIndexPath and change the values accordigly... my point is no need to recreate the cell..</p>
