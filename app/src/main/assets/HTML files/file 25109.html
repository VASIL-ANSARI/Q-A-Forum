<p>I suggest reading <a href="https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.9/dojox/grid/example_Adding_and_deleting_data.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. You can add rows with:</p>

<pre><code>myStore.newItem({ ... });
</code></pre>

<p>or in case of a grid:</p>

<pre><code>myGrid.store.newItem({ ... });
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know the data will automatically change in your grid. Inserting your item between two other rows however is something else. By default your store sorts your data based on the fields of your object. You can of course customize this by defining a <code>comparatorMap</code> on your store.</p>

<p>However, I don't see what benefits you get from doing such thing. If you click the header row ("Name" for example), you expect that the data in that column get sorted. In your case that should be A, B, C, FOO... . I don't know why you would disable/override such feature. </p>
