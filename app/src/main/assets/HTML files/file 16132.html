<p>You have some other issue going on.  The code, as typed, works.  Try this fully functional program to see, which prints (as expected) "Foo!123":</p>

<pre><code>using System;

namespace Test
{
    public class Program
    {
        private static void Main()
        {
            var foo = new Foo();
            Console.WriteLine(foo.Name);
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public class Foo : Bah
    {
        public Foo() : base("Foo!") { }

        public override string Name
        {
            get { return _name + "123"; }
            set { _name = value; }
        }
    }

    public class Bah
    {
        protected string _name;

        public Bah(string name)
        {
            Name = name; // &lt;&lt; -- No Exception here (or anywhere!)
        }

        public virtual string Name
        {
            get { return _name; }
            set { _name = value; }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That being said, calling virtual methods (including Property accessor methods) in a constructor is a very bad idea.  It can lead to very odd behavior, which is likely the culprit in your real code. </p>
