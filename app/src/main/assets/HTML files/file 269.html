<p>You could perhaps take a look at the <a href="http://www.alexmac.cc/tablet-apps/tablet-apps-0.3.1.tar.bz2" rel="nofollow">software</a> described <a href="http://www.alexmac.cc/tablet-apps/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It is a gnome applet, written in Python.</p>

<p>From the web site:</p>

<p>"The gnome wacom applet is a small gnome panel applet that shows how much pressure is being applied to your wacom tablet by the current device. Clicking on the panel icon brings up a dialog allowing you to select a different device and check what pressure and tilt information is being recieved from it. This dialog also contains a small drawing test area to give your pen a quick test."</p>
