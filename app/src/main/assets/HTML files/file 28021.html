<p>I some how figured out the solution for this.</p>

<p>The TeamCity Agent runs as a windows service. So, it can not access the User environment variable for e.g. %include% and %lib%.</p>

<p>What I did is, I passed these two variables as environment variables to TeamCity Build. And voila!!! It works. :)</p>
