<p>You can access the list containing the deputies with <code>data['votes']</code>. Iterating through the list, you can access the keys you're interested in as you would with dict key lookups. Nested dicts imply you have to walk through the keys starting from the root to your point of interest: </p>

<pre><code>for d in data['votes']:
    print(d['deputy']['id'], d['deputy']['name'], d['deputy']['faction']['id'])
</code></pre>
