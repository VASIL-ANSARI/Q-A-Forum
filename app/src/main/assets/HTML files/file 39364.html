<p>I have a few open source SPEAK applications on GitHub if these will help you. These were built on Sitecore 7.2 and SPEAK 1.1. You can take the changes to the JS page code in Pierre's blog post and apply it to my examples. They also have patch include files for including new component into SPEAK. </p>

<p>I have TDS packages with these applications so you can see how the core DB is set up for a SPEAK application. </p>
