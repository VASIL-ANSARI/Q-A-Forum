<p>So I'm going to throw my vote in for WPF.</p>

<p>Firstly, I am talking XAML with C#. Do not consider win JS unless you're a JavaScript expert and are too lazy to learn xaml!</p>

<p>The ideals you are talking about seem to be future support, availability of talent and multi platform. </p>

<p>WinForms is dead and we know that, XAML is part of windows phone, the most recent SDKs and a major focus for MS. The store variants may get some extra tools and out the box controls, but the fundamental language and therefore knowledge is shared so support isn't going anywhere. </p>

<p>You're right to think about what would happen post bus-vs-developer. WPF is definitely more soug after and I see way more junior devs knowing WPF then WinForms. You'll also see way more wpf questions on here - although that could be simply because it's trickier. That said, for every wpf dev I come across, there are 10 HTML web app devs.</p>

<p>As far as multi platform, XAML does give you access to mobile which on its own is not that marvellous. But if your application is MVVM pattern, which WPF feels really naturally paired with - you start developing solutions with reuse baked in. </p>

<p>Finally, WinForms is really fast to put together a mock up, it is way more drag gable and predictable, but looks 10 years out of date. WPF, once understood offers some really engaging UI and a far quicker delivery path when including media and animation.</p>

<p>My two cents.</p>
