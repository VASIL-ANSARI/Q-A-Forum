<p>In the main loop you are using same name for the Function and the String i.e "time".
This is causing ambiguity. Give them a different name and it will work fine.
Use Like this.</p>

<pre><code>for timeString in sys.stdin:
        hours, minutes = timeString.split(':')
        y = time(timeString,hours, minutes)
        print (y)
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
