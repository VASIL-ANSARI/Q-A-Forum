<p>The "main thread" is actually running code that looks something like this (heavily simplified):</p>

<pre><code>while(1) {
    get command off dispatch queue
    execute command off dispatch queue
}
</code></pre>

<p>where the "command" is a callback or a block to execute.</p>

<p>Therefore, the main thread divides its work into individual callbacks (like <code>viewDidLoad</code>). After each callback executes and completes, the main thread goes to process another command.</p>
