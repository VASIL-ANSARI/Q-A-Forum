<p>Maybe you should include in the logic, the tab indexes first, and when you add the control, set the tab index to the last tab index + 1, your job would be easier, if you set the tab order first on the controls, and set the constant to the last tab index at design time, see here,:</p>

<pre>
private const int LAST_TAB_INDEX = 5; // an Example
private int lastTabIndex = LAST_TAB_INDEX; 

private void AddControl(){
   // Set up your control
   Control ctl = new Control();
   // ....
   ctl.TabIndex = lastTabIndex;   
   this.Add(ctl);
   this.lastTabIndex++;
}
</pre>

<p>You can see from the example how the tab index is incremented, in that way, it will prevent 
the controls from stealing the focus...</p>

<p>Hope this helps,
Best regards,
Tom.</p>
