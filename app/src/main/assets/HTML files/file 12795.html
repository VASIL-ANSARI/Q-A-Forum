<p>Rather than have bits of native and bits of HTML you would be better to develop the entire thing in <a href="http://phonegap.com" rel="nofollow">Phonegap</a>. Phonegap is developed in HTML and JS and then compiled into a native app utilising the OS's web view. This means that you will have the exact same code across devices and will allow for a more consistent UI.</p>

<p>Phonegap allows for native device functions to be used such as geolocation, accelerometer, audio, video, notifications, storage and more.</p>
