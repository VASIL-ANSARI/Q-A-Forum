<p>According <a href="http://bigflake.com/mediacodec/" rel="nofollow">bigflake</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MediaCodec class first became available in Android 4.1 (API 16). It was added to allow direct access to the media codecs on the device.</p>
  
  <p>In Android 4.3 (API 18), MediaCodec was expanded to include a way to provide input through a Surface (via the createInputSurface method). This allows input to come from camera preview or OpenGL ES rendering.</p>

<p>So if it's possible please think about increasing MinSDK to 18 and use  <a href="https://github.com/saki4510t/AudioVideoRecordingSample" rel="nofollow">AudioVideoRecordingSample</a> or <a href="https://github.com/OnlyInAmerica/HWEncoderExperiments" rel="nofollow">HWEncoderExperiments</a> as examples.</p>
