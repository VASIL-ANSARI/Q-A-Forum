<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM tbl 
WHERE (MONTH(date) &lt; MONTH(CURDATE()) AND YEAR(date) = YEAR(CURDATE())) 
      OR
      YEAR(date) &lt; YEAR(CURDATE())
</code></pre>

<p>The predicates used in the above query essentially say: if both dates are on the same year, then you can compare month, otherwise you have to only compare the year value.</p>
