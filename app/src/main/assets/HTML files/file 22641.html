<p>I recommend the solution from Romain Guy. As far as I know this is the simplest (and possibly most efficient method since <em>he</em> recommended it). The solution is based on <code>Shader</code>s.</p>

<p>You can find code, description, whole project, sample video and screenshots here: <a href="http://www.curious-creature.org/2012/12/13/android-recipe-2-fun-with-shaders/" rel="nofollow">http://www.curious-creature.org/2012/12/13/android-recipe-2-fun-with-shaders/</a></p>

<p>You would start your customization by adjusting the mask PNG file. Then you'd probably supply a shader parameter for the fragments which they would utilize when drawing. Finally you'd set the proper shader for each of the fragments after every pointer movement event.</p>

<p>I know it's just a sketch of the solution, but the whole project code provided in the link above should get you going really fast.</p>
