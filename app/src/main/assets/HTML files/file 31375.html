<p>Here you got some choices...</p>

<p><strong>Total hours entire table</strong></p>

<pre><code>select 
  sum(hours)
from
  tasks;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Total hours per end date</strong></p>

<pre><code>select 
  end_date, sum(hours)
from
  tasks
group by end_date;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Total spended hours per project</strong></p>

<pre><code>select 
  project_id, sum(hours)
from
  tasks
group by project_id;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Total spended hours per employee</strong></p>

<pre><code>select 
  emp_id, sum(hours)
from
  tasks
group by emp_id;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Total spended hours per employee per project</strong></p>

<pre><code>select 
  project_id,emp_id, sum(hours)
from
  tasks
group by project_id,emp_id;
</code></pre>

<p>I think you got it :)</p>

<p>You could of course add a where clause, e.g. <code>where start_date between</code> ... or <code>end_date =</code></p>
