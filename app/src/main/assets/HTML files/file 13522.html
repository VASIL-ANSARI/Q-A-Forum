<p>Think there is no reasonable way to convert Ppt/Pptx on Windows Phone. </p>

<p>Best way to do it is in your system architecture. Mobile devices are good for client applications. Therefore, you need client and server. Server will be responsible for converting ppt/pptx to images and client will let you to download or see this images, like e.g. Evernote, Dropbox and other do. Even better, when except mobile client and server application, there is also web or desktop clients, which let user to upload ppt/pptx from desktop.</p>
