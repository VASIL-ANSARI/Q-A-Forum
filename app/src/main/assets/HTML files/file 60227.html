<p>If you add a function that returns the attributes of your Person class, then you should be able to do what you want. How you would process these values is another story. Below is an example of how you would change your Person class:</p>

<pre><code>class Person{
    var name: String
    var city: String
    var country: String

    init(name: String, city: String, country: String){
        self.name = name
        self.city = city
        self.country = country
    }

    func returnAttributes() -&gt; [AnyObject]{
        return [name, city, country]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With your current scenario, you could also have the return type be [String], but it sounds like you are looking for a solution that allows for flexibility in terms of what types of objects its returning, so perhaps [AnyObject] is best.</p>

<p>So then you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>let totalAttributes = attributes.count - 1
for i in 0...totalAttributes{
    values[0].returnAttributes //returns (for example): ["Peter", "Paris", "France"]
}
</code></pre>
