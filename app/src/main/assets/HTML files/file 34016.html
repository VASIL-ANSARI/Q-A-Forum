<p>Your query is doing a cartesian product of the three tables and then filtering out rows where one of the emails doesn't match -- very computationally intensive as well as inaccurate.</p>

<p>The following should do what you want:</p>

<pre><code>  SELECT id FROM pims WHERE email = '{$email}' UNION ALL
  SELECT id FROM dms WHERE email = '{$email}' UNION ALL
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = '{$email}';
</code></pre>
