<p>I would seriously recommend to use the gio library (part of glib). Using that library, you connect functions to the socket operations such as when data is available, or when data can be written to the socket. The library will call these function when necessary, and you don't need a wait loop. Which is more CPU-friendly.</p>

<p><a href="http://jcoppens.com/soft/howto/gtk/chat_socket.php" rel="nofollow">http://jcoppens.com/soft/howto/gtk/chat_socket.php</a> contains an example of communications between a C program and Python, using gio, which might be useful to you.</p>

<p>This way, you can start monitoring the sockets after the GUI has started, and you do not need threads to attend the communications. </p>
