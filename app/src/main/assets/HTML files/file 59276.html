<p>A destructor is going to get called exactly once for every instance of a class. I am excluding the marginal case of program termination making the entire process go away without invoking the oustanding objects' destructors (no point to it).</p>

<p>In your example, <code>p</code> is a pointer to an array containing two instances of a class. <code>delete[] p</code> is going to destroy two instances of the class. The class's destructor gets called once for each object getting destroyed, for a total of two times. <code>p2</code> is a pointer to one instance of the class, but since it is not explicitly <code>delete</code>d, that one falls into the marginal case. Finally, there's an instance of the class in function automatic scope. That instance gets destroyed when execution leaves the function scope, so that's another destructor call.</p>

<p>Whether or not a class has a default destructor, or an explicitly declared destructor, that makes no difference. Whatever destructor that class has, that destructor gets called.</p>

<p>Now, keep in mind that even though the destructor gets invoked multiple times here, it is being invoked exactly once for each instance of the class getting destroyed, and you have multiple instances.</p>
