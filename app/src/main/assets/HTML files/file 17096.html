<p>I wouldn't recommend removing the label as it makes the form inaccessible. You could <a href="http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2487/">add a custom CSS class</a> to the field, and in your CSS <a href="http://xhtml.com/en/css/reference/visibility/">make that class invisible</a>. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I missed that the input was hidden so accessibility isn't a concern.</p>

<p>You can render the form fields directly in your template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form ...&gt;
    {% for field in form.hidden_fields %}
        {{ field }}
    {% endfor %}

    {% for field in form.visible_fields %}
        {{ field.label }} {{ field }}
    {% endfor %}
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
