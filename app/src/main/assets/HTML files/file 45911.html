<p>You cannot move a <code>const</code> object as a move operation is a modification.  When you move you swap the contents of the old object into the new object.  this in turn puts the indeterminate value of the new object into the old object.  You could not do that if the old object is <code>const</code> as you would not be able to write to it.</p>

<p>When you use move semantics you want to pass by value.  When you pass by value you make a copy that will never be accessed so you are free to move from it.  See: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7592630/is-pass-by-value-a-reasonable-default-in-c11">Is pass-by-value a reasonable default in C++11?</a></p>
