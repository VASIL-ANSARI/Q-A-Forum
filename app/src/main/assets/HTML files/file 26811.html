<p>You can reduce the data in a <code>where</code> clause</p>

<p>if you wan to select top 10 results, use <code>limit</code> in SQLite.</p>

<pre><code>select your_column
from your_table
where status = 'A'
order by your_column asc
limit 10
</code></pre>

<p>That of course makes only sense if you order the data in some way. Otherwise selecting top results would return unpredictable data because a DB does not have a default order in which the data will be presented.</p>
