<p>You should look into using something like a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2890170/is-there-any-good-universal-php-mysql-http-tunnel">HTTP Tunnel</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/class-dbmysql-connect-via-mysql-tunnel.27723/" rel="nofollow">This post</a> outlines a method of doing this for Android. </p>

<p>Basically you connect through this tunnel which is placed on your server, and can the communicate with the server as if you were <code>localhost</code>. </p>

<p>SSH is also another option, although you'll need remote SSH access enabled by your host. That's normally something you'll have to specifically request for them to enable.</p>

<p>You would then create an SSH tunnel using a technique <a href="http://www.example-code.com/android/sshTunnel_database.asp" rel="nofollow">like this</a> and then use that as your connection for your database. Once you've initiated the connection you would then query it as normal.</p>
