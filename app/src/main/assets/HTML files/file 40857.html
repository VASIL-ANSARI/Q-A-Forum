<p>You need to have a sequence table so that you can do left join with that table and give all values</p>

<p>Here  is one way to do this</p>

<p>generation of numbers is taken from this post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/186756/generating-a-range-of-numbers-in-mysql">Generating a range of numbers in MySQL</a></p>

<pre><code>select T1.SeqValue as Qty, isnull(T2.totalCount,0) as Count
from

(

 SELECT
    (TWO_1.SeqValue + TWO_2.SeqValue + TWO_4.SeqValue + TWO_8.SeqValue + TWO_16.SeqValue) SeqValue
FROM
    (SELECT 0 SeqValue UNION ALL SELECT 1 SeqValue) TWO_1
    CROSS JOIN (SELECT 0 SeqValue UNION ALL SELECT 2 SeqValue) TWO_2
    CROSS JOIN (SELECT 0 SeqValue UNION ALL SELECT 4 SeqValue) TWO_4
    CROSS JOIN (SELECT 0 SeqValue UNION ALL SELECT 8 SeqValue) TWO_8
    CROSS JOIN (SELECT 0 SeqValue UNION ALL SELECT 16 SeqValue) TWO_16 

)T1
left join
(
  select count(*) as totalCount, qty
  from table1
 group by qty
)T2
on T1.SeqValue = T2.qty
</code></pre>
