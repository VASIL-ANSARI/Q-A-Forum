<p>You didn't assign <code>"s3:ListBucket"</code> permission, that the account was stopped at the access to buckets of <code>staging</code> and <code>prod</code>, then has no permission to access the files/folders in these buckets.</p>

<p>Remember you have to seperate the code as below, and don't add <code>/*</code> after bucket name. </p>

<pre><code>   "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::staging",
                "arn:aws:s3:::prod",
            ]
        },
</code></pre>
