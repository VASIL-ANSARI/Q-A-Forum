<pre><code>    for (Object someObject : ret) {
        if (
            field1.trim().equals(someObject.get1())&amp;&amp; 
            field2.trim().equals(someObject.get2())&amp;&amp;
            field3.trim().equals(someObject.get3())&amp;&amp;
            field4.trim().equals(someObject.get4())     
            ){
            ret.add(aSomeObjectsList);

        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The above loop wouldn't work, since it has the size of zero.</p>

<p>Here you go,</p>

<pre><code>public Set&lt;ObjectList&gt; duplicates(ArrayList&lt;ObjectList&gt; someObjectsList) {

    Set&lt;ObjectList&gt; originals = new HashSet&lt;ObjectList&gt;();
    Set&lt;ObjectList&gt; duplicates = new HashSet&lt;ObjectList&gt;();

    for ( ObjectList aSomeObjectsList: someObjectsList) {
        boolean added = originals.add(aSomeObjectsList);
        if(!added){
            duplicates.add(aSomeObjectsList);
        }     
    }
    return duplicates;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>This would work, provided your <code>ObjectList</code> class have the correct implementation of <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code> methods. </p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This implementation will not provide the information about how many times a particular object was duplicated in the provided list. It will just tell you that a particular object was duplicated. I assumed that that was your real intention. If you wanna count, how many times, you have to modify the code accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Hint/Suggestion:</strong> You should override the <code>equals()</code> method and place your field equality check in there instead, once and for all.</p>
