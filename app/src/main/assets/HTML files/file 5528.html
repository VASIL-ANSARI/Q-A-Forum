<p>In most dialects of SQL, you cannot use the 'display label' or the name in 'AS name' to refer to an expression inside the body of the query - much to the chagrin of people.  However, you can use the expression in the WHERE clause.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT X*X + Y*Y AS DistanceSquared, POINTS.* from POINTS 
 WHERE X &gt; 0 
   AND Y &gt; 0
   AND (X * X + Y * Y) &lt; 50;
</code></pre>

<p>The HAVING clause is associated with aggregates and comparisons on aggregates:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT name, COUNT(*)
  FROM SomeWhere
 GROUP BY Name
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1;
</code></pre>

<p>The conditions in a HAVING clause must (should) involve at least one 'direct' aggregate; the other term in the condition might be a constant (as shown) or another direct aggregate, or a sub-query, possibly involving 'indirect' aggregates.  (AFAIK, I've invented the 'direct/indirect' terminology for this answer - you probably won't be able to search for the expression usefully.)</p>
