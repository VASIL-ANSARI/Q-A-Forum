<p>You can specify the source file and line of the end of the loop, like so, on the gdb command line:</p>

<pre><code>b file.c:123
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to go right after the for loop, you'll want to actually set the break for the line of the closing bracket of the while() loop, I believe. But you can try both and see what gives the desired result.</p>
