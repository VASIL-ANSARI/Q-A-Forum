<p>Because that is exactly how for-loops work in Python.  The expression on the right of the <code>in</code> operator (which must return an iterable when evaluated) is evaluated only <em>once</em>, before looping commences. Then, the for-loop loops over the iterable returned by that evaluation.</p>

<p>Below is an excerpt from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement" rel="nofollow">docs</a>*:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence
  (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:</p>

<pre><code>for_stmt ::=  "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite
              ["else" ":" suite]
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>The expression list is evaluated once</strong>; it should yield an iterable
  object.</p>
