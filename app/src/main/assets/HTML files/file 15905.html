<p>I guess that such member (argument) should be not public within boost::function class. If I am right, you won't be able to do it. At least without some strange operations.</p>

<p>If you really need something similar and are creator of func objects, the most clean way I can imagine right now is:
<code>std::pair&lt;boost::function&lt;bool(int)&gt;, CClass *&gt; funcAndObj</code>, then call <code>funcAndObj.first()</code> and get the pointer from <code>funcAndObj.second</code>.</p>
