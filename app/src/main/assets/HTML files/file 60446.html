<p>To my knowledge, there is no golden method and i usually apply one of the following options:</p>

<p>1) Preload the files separately e.g. create key "body" for each entry in your json and then set the value of it to the contents of the file.</p>

<p>2) Do not display items until they are not fully loaded in the DOM and before you show them, sort them in the DOM by e.g. their position in the json array.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
