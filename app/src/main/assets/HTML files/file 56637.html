<p>DirectX 2D is what you want if you will only do 2D.  It is hardware accelerated and you can use the math library that is shared with DirectX 11 &amp; 12 to ease you into the workings of a 3D Engine.  If you will eventually convert it to 3D, Chuck W. Comment on DirextX tool kit is a good one.<br>
Chuck, BTW, are you still writing a DirectX 12 Sprite batch class you mention last year?  Would be awesome to see that.</p>
