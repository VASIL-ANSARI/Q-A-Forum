<p>the file you are looking for is named <code>tnsnames.ora</code>. The location depends on the OS you are using. Try to look at the TNS_ADMIN registry entry value, it should point to that file. Another tip: if the path containing <code>tnsnames.ora</code> contains <code>'('</code> or <code>)</code> as for example <code>( x86</code> ) you can experience troubles, so change the location.</p>
