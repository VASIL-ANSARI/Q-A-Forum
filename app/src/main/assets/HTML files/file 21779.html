<p>Because in first case , you create the canvas, it is not backed up by a hardware layer.
Also, as of now, you cannot enable HWA on just any Canvas, it must belong to an HWA View.</p>

<p>A view on the other hand, has access to system's hardware capabilities. You can use that by calling <code>setLayerType( LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE)</code> as described in docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indicates that the view has a hardware layer. A hardware layer is
  backed by a hardware specific texture (generally Frame Buffer Objects
  or FBO on OpenGL hardware) and causes the view to be rendered using
  Android's hardware rendering pipeline, but only if hardware
  acceleration is turned on for the view hierarchy. When hardware
  acceleration is turned off, hardware layers behave exactly as software
  layers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, The performance concern applies more to the rendering part, and less to drawing. All draw operations are recorded as a Picture object. Its the rendering operation where HWA plays an important role.</p>
