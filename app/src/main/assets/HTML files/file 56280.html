<p>First off I want to say that you cant release your open source project with the client id and client secrete that you created on Google Developers console this is against <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/" rel="nofollow">googles terms of service</a>.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep
  your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent
  and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials.
  Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.</p>

<p>My Answer on another question about exposing client id in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/28109307/1841839">open source projects</a>.</p>

<p>Second you could instruct your users to use either Oauth2 or a service account or both its really up to you.</p>

<p>If the user will only be accessing their own data and wont need to access someone else's data then they can use a service account you will need to instruct them in how to share a folder on Google Drive with the service account.  However from your side permissions can be tricky when they are uploaded the service account will own the file uploaded to the users google drive account you will need to have the service account add permissions for the user so the user will then also be able to access said file.</p>

<p>The easiest way to go will be Oauth2 when the code uploads files they are owned by the authenticated user so you wont have the same permissions issue you had with a service account. </p>
