<p>By the way your code doesn't have memory issue as Raghunandan says if it memory issue it should be outofmemory error and also not have any VM problem .</p>

<p>You have to understand that here you are using an adapter class which is responsible to fill the custom data for your ListView.</p>

<p>Every adapter class should get data(for e.g ArrayList) from its appropreate activity throuugh its constructor with the current context.
Like:</p>

<pre><code>MyAdapter adapter = new MyAdapter(context, arraylist_data);
</code></pre>

<p>And this adapter object used as the adapter of the listview or gridview and use the setAdapter() to put.</p>

<p>And in your MyAdapter class you should be define your constructure with the appropreate parameters.Like:
    public class MyAdapter  extends BaseAdapter{
    private Context mContext;
    private ArrayList mData;</p>

<pre><code> public MyAdapter (Context mContext, ArrayList&lt;DTO_Truyen&gt; mData){
 this.mContext = mContext;
 this.mData = mData;
}

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
      //do any thing here... 
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where your getView() method get all data through current position and put inside the custom layout ass well as any reaction.</p>

<p>Basically this is the way to put custom layout and data inside ListView. And about the exceptions, Raghunandan and Gopal Rao already explained. So just change your way of writing code and it will be fine. </p>
