<p>Does your server config allow the use of PHP short tags?</p>

<pre><code>You don't have permission to access /mytesting/&lt; on this server.
</code></pre>

<p>It looks as though your form action is pointing towards "/mytesting/&lt;" and the following "?" is being removed from the error message, as it's interpreted as a query string.</p>

<p>Change this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action = "&lt;?base_url();?&gt;" method = "POST"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="&lt;?php echo base_url(); ?&gt;" method="POST"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or enable PHP short tags in your php.ini or .htaccess.</p>
