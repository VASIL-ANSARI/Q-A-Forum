<ul>
<li><code>g_</code> is a global variable</li>
<li><code>s_</code> is a static</li>
<li><code>m_</code> is a member (an instance variable)</li>
<li><code>_</code> is either a member, or more specifically a private member (both usages turn up)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is common enough that many developers know about it, although it is not (to my knowledge) universally accepted. I don't think you are missing any others.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Integrating comments below for better visibility</p>

<ul>
<li><code>_</code> can also be used to denote a local variable (this one really isn't "standard")</li>
<li><code>k</code> can be used to denote a constant</li>
</ul>
