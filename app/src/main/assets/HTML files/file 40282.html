<p>Usually its a better idea to use a list of stopwords of your own. For this purpose, you can get a list of French stopwords from <a href="http://www.ranks.nl/stopwords/french" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The article word 'les' is also on the list. Create a text file of them and use the file to remove stopwords from your corpus. Then for punctuations you have to write a punctuation removal function. How you should write it, highly depends on your application. But just to show you a few examples that would get you started, you can write:</p>

<pre><code>import string
t = "hello, eric! how are you?"
print t.translate(string.maketrans("",""), string.punctuation)
</code></pre>

<p>and the output is:</p>

<pre><code>hello eric how are you
</code></pre>

<p>or, another way is to simply write:</p>

<pre><code>t = t.split()
for w in t:
    w = w.strip('\'"?,.!_+=-')
    print w
</code></pre>

<p>So, it really depends on how you need them to be removed. In certain scenarios these methods might not result in what you exactly wanted. But, you can build on them. Let me know if you had any further questions.</p>
