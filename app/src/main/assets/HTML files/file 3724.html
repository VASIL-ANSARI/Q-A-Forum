<p>I don't think there are attributes for these fields. That list is a list of properties found on ModelMetadata, and my guess is the default Data Annotations metadata provider doesn't populate those. You can build some custom attributes, and a custom metadata provider without to much fuss or muss. You can also populate that field from procedural code anywhere you have the ViewData instance.</p>
