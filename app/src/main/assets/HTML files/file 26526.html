<pre><code>q)t:([] b:1 2 3; a:("abC";"aBc";"AbC"))
q)t
b a
-------
1 "abC"
2 "aBc"
3 "AbC"

q)select from t where upper[a] like "ABC"
b a
-------
1 "abC"
2 "aBc"
3 "AbC"

q)select from t where lower[a] like "abc"
b a
-------
1 "abC"
2 "aBc"
3 "AbC"

<p>However this way the conversion has to happen on each query. Faster to store the column in the format that it will be queried. </p>
