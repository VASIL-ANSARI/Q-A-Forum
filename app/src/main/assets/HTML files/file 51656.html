<p>You need to write some data to a certain characteristic first. 
In my case that characteristic was <code>8A81</code>. I wrote a byte array of a UTC Time code I generated through an algorithm that I cannot publish here.
Try writing any 5-byte long array/char to it and see what happens (For example: <code>[1,1,1,1,1]</code>)</p>
