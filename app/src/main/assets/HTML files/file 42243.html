<p>I use a simple bash script for this.  Here's a one-liner you can use:</p>

<pre><code>$ while true; do python manage.py runserver; sleep 2; done
</code></pre>

<p>That will wait 2 seconds before attempting to restart the server.  Insert whatever you think is a sane value.</p>

<p>I usually write this as a shell script named <code>runserver.sh</code>, put it in my project root (the same directory with manage.py in it) and add it to the gitignore.</p>

<pre><code>while true; do
  echo "Re-starting Django runserver"
  python manage.py runserver
  sleep 2
done
</code></pre>

<p>If you do this, remember to <code>chmod +x runserver.sh</code>, then you can execute it with:</p>

<pre><code>./runserver.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>Ctrl-c Ctrl-c</code> to exit.</p>
