<p>If you can't change the remote server's database, your best option may be to come up with some sort of hash function on the values of a given row, compare the old and new tables, and pull only the ones where function(oldrow) != function(newrow).</p>

<p>You can also just do a direct comparison of the columns in question, and copy that record over when not all the columns in question are the same between old and new.</p>

<p>This means that you cannot modify values in the new table, or they'll get overwritten daily from the old. If this is an issue, you'll need another table in which to cache the old table's values from the day before; then you'll be able to tell whether old, new, or both were modified in the interim.</p>
