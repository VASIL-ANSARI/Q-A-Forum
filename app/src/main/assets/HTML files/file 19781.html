<p>It looks like you're hiding the sub-menu using Javascript - the flash is being caused by the sub-menu loading before the Javascript runs to hide it.</p>

<p>To fix this, hide the sub-menu in the CSS so that it won't display until the Javascript has loaded:</p>

<pre><code>.sub-menu {
    display: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will prevent it being shown when the page loads, but shouldn't affect it's function (since that's controlled elsewhere).</p>
