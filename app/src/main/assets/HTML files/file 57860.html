<p>This is an issue with AppXBundling. When Installing bundles, it checks with the current OS for the installed Language packs and copies the relevant language resources from the bundle and omits the other language files. The objective of a single bundle is to copy necessary resources and build the application and therefore the languages which are not in the system are considered irrelevant. As a fix you could stop generating single bundles and create package for each CPU architecture. <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/1d42c900-5591-45c9-b36d-1b5309cf3731/localization-does-not-work-properly-when-package-windows-81-c-xaml-app-by-setting-generate-app?forum=windowsstore" rel="nofollow">Check this for more info</a></p>
