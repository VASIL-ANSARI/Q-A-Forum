<p>Adding in the resolution as answer here. </p>

<p>The pdb files contain additional debug information wrt your binaries. Any failures that show up on a machine with pdbs deployed will show a richer stack information referring back to the source code files with line numbers etc. Deleting out the pdbs will resolve your issue. Plus you ideally should not be deploying pdbs with your retail product bits unless you are actively debugging something in production.</p>
