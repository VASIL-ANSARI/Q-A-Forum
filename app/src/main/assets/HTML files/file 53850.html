<p>I have met the same problem! I can tell you how to resolve this in my way.
Your aar library must be an AndroidStudio library project.
Import it to your app with code. The build.gradle in library project must declare the .so file path. </p>

<pre><code>sourceSets {
        main {
            manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'
            java.srcDirs = ['src']
            resources.srcDirs = ['src']
            aidl.srcDirs = ['src']
            renderscript.srcDirs = ['src']
            res.srcDirs = ['res']
            assets.srcDirs = ['assets']
            jniLibs.srcDirs = ['libs']
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure jniLibs.srcDirs is correct! You can see this in <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/wangdong20/article/details/49385203" rel="nofollow">my blog</a></p>

<p>I hope this will help you!</p>
