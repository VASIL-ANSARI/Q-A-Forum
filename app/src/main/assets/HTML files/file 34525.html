  <p>Any pointers to getting this working?</p>

<p>Just install ccache. It would be helpful even if you did not have this issue because it somewhat speeds the compilation up on embedded. We are also using it at the company, fwiw, even with icecream, eventually.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ccache
</code></pre>
