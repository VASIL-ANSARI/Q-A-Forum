<p>I don't think it's a right way to do, cause to dtermine the final <code>hashcode</code> it has to be unique for specifyed object. In your case you do a <code>Sum()</code>, which can produce the <em>same</em> result with different hashcodes in collection (at the end hashcodes are just integers).</p>

<p>If your intention is to determine equality based on the content of the collection, at this point just compare these cillections between two objects. It <em>could</em> be time consuming operation, by the way.</p>
