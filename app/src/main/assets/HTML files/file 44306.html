<p>In your question, the term <em>program</em> is a little ambiguous. For the sake of clarity, let me divide the question is two seperate parts. </p>

<p>If your question is regarding the possibility for below cases,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how many times a <strong>function</strong> has been executed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, use a <code>static</code> variable as a counter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how many times a <strong>binary</strong> has been executed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes again, but cannot be achieved using without a file i/o. You need to use file i/o to write the value to a file once a binary has been executed. For each execution of the binary, read the value from the file, update and write back to it.</p>
