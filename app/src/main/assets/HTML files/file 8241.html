<p>Well, first of all it looks like you could probably just re-run your query with the correct from clause instead of the staging_fact table, and it will overwrite any booboos you made. That's the good news, and the joy of working with fact tables.</p>

<p>Bad news is that from my experience, SSMS doesn't roll anything back unless you actually run it within a transaction, so your data is probably a big bucket of fail right now.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed that last 12 minutes of your life, because you're about to have the pleasure of doing it again.</p>
