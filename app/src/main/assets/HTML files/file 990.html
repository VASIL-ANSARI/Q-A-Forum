<p>Is the submit button really submitting the form (sending out a post/get) or is it calling JavaScript code to perform checks or other actions? If so, my first guess is some JS error happening. You should have a look at the JS console? (In case IE has one, not using IE myself, however, according to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2004/10/26/247912.aspx" rel="nofollow">this MS page</a>, it has one, you just need to enable it).</p>
