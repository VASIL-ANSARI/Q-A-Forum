<p>Typically this can be solved by setting a background image for the input boxes. If you're trying to stay a little more simplistic, figure out where things are inconsistent, and explicitly set them in your CSS.</p>

<pre><code>input.inputbox { 
    background: url(input.gif) 0 0 no-repeat; 
    width: 150px; 
    height: 30px; 
    ... /* fonts, padding, borders, etc */
}
</code></pre>
