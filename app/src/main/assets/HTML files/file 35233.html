<p>No, there is no risk of garbage collection as the service/factory is a singleton and once created will live for the lifespan of the application. Also there is no real need for the prv object as anything created within the service that is not part of the return object (<code>pub</code> in your example) is inherently private, because it is not exposed via the return object.</p>

<p>My services/factories are typically structured like so:</p>

<pre><code>.factory('MyService', function() {
    function doStuff(){doPrivateStuff();}
    function doPrivateStuff(){}

    return {
        doServiceStuff: doStuff
    };
});
</code></pre>
