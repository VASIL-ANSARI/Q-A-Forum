<p>1- record input in a String</p>

<p>2- split(" ") String in an array --> without the space</p>

<p>Now if the date is always at spot #2,3 and 4 in the array, it's easy to just look for them. But If they are not always at the same place, then you should create an array "month", "date" and "year" and compare each index of the original array. If they are the same --> record date, else continue.</p>
