<p><em>Update: 10/21/2015: The following answer required you to explicitly provide values such as 100em in order to achieve offsets. This is not ideal. Instead, <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/yxppkv3j/" rel="nofollow">you can translate the element</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>You can indeed do this <em>today</em> without flash or JavaScript. You can use the <code>keyframes</code> feature in modern browsers to move text in modern browsers. I took the liberty to work up a quick demo demonstrating the concept: (horizontal) <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/XxUXD/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/XxUXD/</a>, and (vertical) <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/h7SYp/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/h7SYp/</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially we set the initial starting-point of the animation to <code>text-indent: 100%</code> to set it out of view and to the right. Then we set the last frame to <code>text-indent: -100%</code>, or whatever is needed to hide the text (will vary depending on character-length).</p>

<p><strong>Old Answer</strong></p>

<p>You won't be able to do this without flash or Javascript. HTML is structure, while CSS is presentation. Neither of the two provide animation-capabilities. I would suggest you go a route that includes a small javascript framework like jQuery, as this can convert standard HTML into the animated effect that you desire.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to look into the <a href="http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/" rel="nofollow">Cycle Plugin</a> for jQuery.</p>
