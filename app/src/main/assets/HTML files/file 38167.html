<p>You need to keep updating <code>l</code> (length of the longest word) and <code>s</code> (length of the smallest word)</p>

<pre><code>if(word.length()&lt;s)
{
        sw=word;
        s = word.length();
}
if(word.length()&gt;l)
{
        lw=word;
        l = word.length();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, there are boundary conditions that you need to take care of.
For example, what happens if the string is a single word. What happens when the input string is null etc.</p>
