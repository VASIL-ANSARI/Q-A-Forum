<p>The advice to "avoid dots" for performance is (1) only something you should do if you actually have a performance problem, i.e. not if it's just called a lot of times but if it actually <em>takes too much time</em>, and (2) not going to be solved by using <code>partial</code>.</p>

<p>The reason dots can take more time than locals is that python has to perform a lookup each time. But if you use <code>partial</code>, then there's an extra function call each time <em>and</em> it also copies and updates a dictionary each time <em>and</em> adds two lists. You're not gaining, you're losing.</p>

<p>However, if you really want you can do:</p>

<pre><code>strip = str.strip
split = str.split
...
fields = split(strip(line), '\t')
</code></pre>
