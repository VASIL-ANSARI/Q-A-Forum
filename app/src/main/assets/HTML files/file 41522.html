<p>evenThread and oddThread implement Runnable.</p>

<p>To get startable Threads you have to wrap them in Threads</p>

<pre><code>Runnable even = new evenThread();
Thread t1 = new Thread(even);

t1.start();
</code></pre>

<p>It is not possible to start Runnables alone in Java.</p>

<p>Oh, and of corse, the run-Method must not be static.</p>
