<p>When I face this problem usually, I go with a clean build in eclipse if the project is configured correctly. In order to use any jar files in general you right click on the project 
Build Path->Configure Build Path and make sure that you see those jars in libraries tab, if not add them; having them in a 'lib' directory serves no purpose as they must be included in the .classpath file of the project regardless the directory.</p>
