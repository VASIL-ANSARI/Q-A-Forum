<p>You have to redirect to <code>/editor</code> yourself.  If you want to do exactly what the form does normally including redirect, there's really no point in having JavaScript do it at all.  However, since you asked:</p>

<pre><code>$.get(/* what you have */).done(function () { window.location = '/editor'; });
</code></pre>
