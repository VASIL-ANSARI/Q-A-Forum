<p>I believe Jackson is having problems because the method that you have delegated as a creator does not have a parameter for the <code>readOnly</code> field. So rather than silently ignore this missing parameter Jackson is throwing an error (good behaviour). Try using the <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHowToIgnoreUnknown" rel="nofollow"><code>JsonIgnoreProperties</code></a> annotation. I've not had need to use if before, but for deserialisation you can explicitly denote fields that are not required by the creator.</p>

<p>Oh, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4168095/jackson-ignore-json-configuration-value">this</a> appears related as well.</p>
