<p>This is not really equivalent to you expression since this is not in-place, but you achieve the same end matrix using something like:</p>

<pre><code>lambda_function = lambda height, width, src, mask: [[src[h][w] if mask[h][w] &gt; 0 else mask[h][w] for w in range(width)] for h in range(height)]
</code></pre>

<p>But I would not recommend using it, ever. If you're after speed you should definitely use <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" rel="nofollow">Numpy</a> for these kinds of things. Assuming that your <code>src</code> and <code>mask</code> are stored in Python-lists, you get the same result much, much faster doing:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
src_np = np.array(src)
mask_np = np.array(mask)
mask_np[mask_np &gt; 0] = src_np[mask_np &gt; 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Which on my computer is ~50 times faster than your solution.</p>
