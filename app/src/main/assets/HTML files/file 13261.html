<p>OK so I imported the AppDelegate.h into my view controller and used its managedObjectContext to enter an item in core data.</p>

<pre><code> AppDelegate *appDelegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
    NSManagedObjectContext *context = [appDelegate managedObjectContext];
</code></pre>

<p>It works! </p>

<p>I would like to know however if we have to import the delegate and get a local reference to the context every time we need to use core data. </p>
