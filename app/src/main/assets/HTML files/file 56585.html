<p>The problem is that <code>#productChoice div</code> has the style <code>vertical-align: middle;</code> set. So when you increase the size of the first div, all of the others re-align themselves downwards because #productChoice has increased in size to cater for its bigger first child. </p>

<p>Change this style to <code>vertical-align: top;</code> to solve the problem.</p>
