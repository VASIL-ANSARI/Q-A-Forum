<p>It is common to write error messages to <code>stderr</code> and normal output to <code>stdout</code>. To print an error message to <code>stderr</code> do</p>

<pre><code>std::cerr &lt;&lt; "Something went wrong\n";
</code></pre>

<p>(You can also do this with <code>fprintf</code>, but that is usually not needed.)</p>

<p>Output written to <code>stderr</code> will not be redirected by</p>

<pre><code>&gt; someFile
</code></pre>

<p>but only by</p>

<pre><code>2&gt; someFile
</code></pre>

<p>so the user can choose where he wants to see the "normal" and the "error" output separately.</p>

<p><code>std::cerr</code> also has the nice property that it does not buffer the output (unlike <code>std::cout</code>). That means that the user will see the error message before the program continues after the output line.</p>

<p>If you do not want this non-buffer functionality, use <code>std::clog</code>.</p>
