<p>It would be good to see a working or non-working example so I could provide a less rough code sample, but rather than changing the ID's of the inputs, instead just use the parent as the selector i.e:</p>

<pre><code>$('select').on('change', function (e) {
     $(this).parent().find('#fname').val("Set Value");
     ....
});
</code></pre>

<p>Although as the others have suggested you should be using class names as selectors rather than IDs (which are meant to be unique)</p>
