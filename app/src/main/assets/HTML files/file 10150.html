<p>I don't think there exists SCons integration for cedet.
However, it is easy to set up an EDE project manually. </p>

<p>An lisp-snippet for a C++-project is given below.</p>

<pre><code>(ede-cpp-root-project "myProject"
           :name "myProject"
           :file "my_project.txt"
           :include-path '("myproject/include")
           :system-include-path '("/usr/include/c++/4.5.1"
                                  "/usr/include/"))
</code></pre>
