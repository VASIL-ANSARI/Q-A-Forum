<p>It would be beneficial to verify the form's data before sending it via POST. You should create a JavaScript function to check the form for errors and then send the form. This would prevent the data from being sent over and over again, possibly slowing the browser and using transfer volume on the server.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If security is a concern, performing an AJAX request to verify the data would be the best way. The response from the AJAX request would determine whether the form should be submitted.</p>
