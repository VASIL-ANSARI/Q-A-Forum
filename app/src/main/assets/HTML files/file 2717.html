<p>You could have an ivar in your controller for tracking the start of the drag. When you get a 'touch down' event, save the starting point.  As you get 'touch moved' events, calculate the distance from the current point to the saved point.  The Euclidean distance between the two can give you the rotation (the sign telling you which direction to rotate).  Scale the rotation appropriately (ie. perhaps half the view width is equivalent to 180deg), and set the rotation of the image's transform.</p>
