<p>You not showing enough of your configuration. I'm concerned about the fact that the URL doesn't have anything after the "<a href="http://shoponline.com/" rel="nofollow">http://shoponline.com/</a>" It may be because your index.html (or index.jsp) page is doing a "forward" to your servlet and the request parameter is not included. In short, there is no reason the code won't work, so you need to look at how your web-application is configured.</p>
