<p>For the size of the viewport, you use <code>window.innerWidth</code> and <code>window.innerHeight</code>.  For the whole window, including decorations, use <code>window.outerWidth</code> and <code>window.outerHeight</code>.  Then, all you need to do is subtract one from the other.</p>

<p>Edit: There is no supported way of doing this in IE8 and older. This is explained in <a href="http://help.dottoro.com/ljlbbqca.php" rel="nofollow">this article</a> and also provides a workaround which involves resizing the browser window.  There is also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1045050/getting-the-width-height-of-the-entire-browser-in-ie/1045407#1045407">this Stack Overflow answer</a>.</p>
