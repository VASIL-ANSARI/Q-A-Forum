<p>The variable is <code>private</code> and so can only be referenced by the containing (abstract) class.  As you have stated, from a subclass, you can invoke the superclass method (rather than the overridden one).</p>

<p>If you want to make the variable accessible from the subclass directly (without requiring the accessor method), make it <code>protected</code> instead.  Here is the documentation on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html" rel="nofollow">Controlling Access to Members of a Class</a>.</p>
