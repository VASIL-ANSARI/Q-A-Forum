<p>First, were you using a DOCTYPE flag when you test this?  You should add whatever DOCTYPE your site is using to get useful results.  Add the DOCTYPE and IE will start to act like Firefox (assuming you use the right doc type).</p>

<p>One thing thats difference is not due to z-index...  The browsers are giving your bordered box a different height.  Put something in it, or set its height to a non-relative value and they will start to look the same (given the doc type I have).</p>

<p>I added the DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional doctype for my tests.</p>

<p>I think Firefox is behaving correctly.  The elements with -1 z-index don't show because they're within the body tag.  Also, since your body tag doesn't have a height set, setting a relative height on the contained elements is kind of meaningless.  Set a fixed height on the body tag, or set the html and body tag to have 100% height.</p>
