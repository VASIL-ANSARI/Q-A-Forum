<p><code>audio</code> only exists inside the function. if you need access to it outside the function then return the instance of the <code>Audio</code> object you are creating:</p>

<pre><code>function getAudio(song, play) {
var audio = new Audio("audio/" + song + ".ogg");
  if(play) {
    audio.play();
  }

  return audio;
}

var theTrack = getAudio('my_song', true);
theTrack.pause(); // pause the song
theTrack.play();  // play the song
</code></pre>

<p>The second example refers to what i assume is an audio element which in turn exposes the functionality of the <code>Audio</code> object. The reason the second function works anywhere is because the DOM element is always present in the DOM and you are referencing that to get at the underlying Audio API, as opposed to a using the Audio object/API directly.</p>
