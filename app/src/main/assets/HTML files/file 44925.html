<p>Database triggers are good for complex default values or complex data validation. Don't use them for application logic like sending messages. When there will be any problem with http connection, you won't be able to change your data.
Anyway, you can create notification queue (using for example new table or Oracle Queue) and fill it using triggers, that could be safe. Then write a job, which will query this queue and send notifications.</p>

<p>When you look at Database change notification concept (see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14251/adfns_dcn.htm#BGBDBAIJ" rel="nofollow">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14251/adfns_dcn.htm#BGBDBAIJ</a>, fig. 13.2), you see, that it uses the same approach.</p>

<p>So I vote for Database change notification. You need not use triggers, just register objects and write notification procedure code.</p>
