<p>Your vector usage is wrong.</p>

<pre><code>coordHistory[coordHistory.size()][0] = snake.getsnakexCoord();
coordHistory[coordHistory.size()-1][1] = snake.getsnakeyCoord();
</code></pre>

<p>You appear to assume that <code>vector[n-1]</code> will automatically create as many elements as needed to result in a vector of size <code>n</code>. <em>It doesn't</em>.</p>

<p>You are twice accessing the first element of vector <code>coordHistory</code>, a vector which is actually empty.</p>

<p>To add elements, in general use the member function <code>push_back</code> or <code>emplace_back</code>. You're really going to struggle with a vector of arrays, though, since arrays are neither assignable nor copyable. That's why I can't use <code>push_back</code> here; I have to explicitly resize the vector then access the newly-created elements as you were doing before:</p>

<pre><code>coordHistory.resize(1);
coordHistory[0][0] = snake.getsnakexCoord();
coordHistory[0][1] = snake.getsnakeyCoord();
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty awkward. why don't you instead store a nice delicious class type with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> members?</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;deliciousClassType&gt; coordHistory;
coordHistory.emplace_back(
   snake.getsnakexCoord(),
   snake.getsnakeyCoord()
);
</code></pre>
