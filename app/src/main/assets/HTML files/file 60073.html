<p>I managed to make it work using examples from <a href="http://kingkode.com/free-datatables-editor-alternative/" rel="nofollow">http://kingkode.com/free-datatables-editor-alternative/</a> and some of my own code, feel free to comment or ask any questions if you need any help.</p>

<p>Instead of creating a dataSet with static variables, I did a DB query and returned the results as an array and set that array as the dataSet in the dataTable function. </p>
