<p>Just have the function return the number of steps it and its descendants took:</p>

<pre><code>def rwSteps (where, low, hi):
    print("{}~".format(' ' * where))

    if low &lt; where &lt; hi:
        return 1 + rwSteps(where + rs(), low, hi)
    else:
        return 0
</code></pre>

<p>however, this is a poor use of recursion - it is slow and very likely to run out of stack space and can easily be rewritten iteratively:</p>

<pre><code>from random import randint

def rs():
    return randint(-1, 1)

def rw_steps (where, low, hi ):
    """
    Returns the number of steps the sleepwalker took
    before hitting the lower or upper bound

    Input:
        where: int    starting location of the sleepwalker
        low: int      &gt;=0, the lower boundary
        hi: int       &gt;low, the upper boundary
    """
    steps = 0
    while low &lt; where &lt; hi:
        print("{}~".format(' ' * where))
        steps += 1
        where += rs()

    print("Went out of bounds after {} steps".format(steps))
    return steps
</code></pre>
