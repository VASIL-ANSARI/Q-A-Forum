<p>In C#, you'd typically use <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code>, and use a <code>DateTime</code>, not a unix timestamp.</p>

<p>You can always check to see if its been less than 24 hours via:</p>

<pre><code>if (timeStamp &gt; DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-1))
{
   // It's been less than 24 hours
}
</code></pre>
