<p>To get the questions and the choices for each question:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT question, choice_text
FROM questions
JOIN choices
ON questions.question_id = choices.question_id
</code></pre>

<p>Add LEFT before JOIN if you also want questions that have no choices.</p>

<p>To get the counts for each answer you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT question, choice_text, COUNT(answers.choice_id)
FROM questions
JOIN choices
    ON questions.question_id = choices.question_id
LEFT JOIN answers
    ON questions.question_id = answers.question_id
    AND choices.choice_id = answers.choice_id
GROUP BY questions.question_id, choices.choice_id
ORDER BY questions.question_id, choices.choice_id
</code></pre>

<p>To get the number of people that selected each answer as a percentage (per question) use the following query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT question, choice_text, COUNT(answers.choice_id) * 100 / questiontotal
FROM questions
JOIN (
        SELECT questions.question_id, COUNT(answers.choice_id) AS questiontotal
        FROM questions
        LEFT JOIN answers ON questions.question_id = answers.question_id
        GROUP BY questions.question_id
    ) AS answercounts
    ON questions.question_id = answercounts.question_id
JOIN choices ON questions.question_id = choices.question_id
LEFT JOIN answers
    ON questions.question_id = answers.question_id
    AND choices.choice_id = answers.choice_id
GROUP BY questions.question_id, choices.choice_id
ORDER BY questions.question_id, choices.choice_id;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the testdata I used:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE questions (question_id int, question nvarchar(100));
INSERT INTO questions (question_id, question) VALUES
(1, 'Foo?'),
(2, 'Bar?');

CREATE TABLE choices (choice_id int, question_id int, choice_text nvarchar(100));
INSERT INTO choices (choice_id, question_id, choice_text) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Foo1'),
(2, 1, 'Foo2'),
(3, 1, 'Foo3'),
(4, 2, 'Bar1'),
(5, 2, 'Bar2');

CREATE TABLE answers (answer_id int, question_id int, choice_id int);
INSERT INTO answers (answer_id, question_id, choice_id) VALUES
(1, 1, 1),
(2, 1, 1),
(3, 1, 3),
(4, 2, 4),
(4, 2, 5);
</code></pre>

<p>And the output I get with the last query on this data:</p>

<pre><code>'Foo?', 'Foo1', 66.6667
'Foo?', 'Foo2', 0.0000
'Foo?', 'Foo3', 33.3333
'Bar?', 'Bar1', 50.0000
'Bar?', 'Bar2', 50.0000
</code></pre>

<p>In the update to your question you say you want to return all the values for one question on one row. I would recommend that you do <em>not</em> try to do this, and instead use the method I have given you above. If you need to present the data in one row to your end-user, this can be done using PHP.</p>
