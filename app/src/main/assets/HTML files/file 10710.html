<p>Your best bet is to use <code>Contract.Assume</code> when the static checker isn't able to verify an expression.</p>

<p>You'll end up with a lot of places where you have to use <code>Contract.Assume</code> if you're trying to get to zero static checker warnings unless your program is trivial because most of the .Net libraries don't yet have contracts so I wouldn't worry about it. Most of the time having clear code and a good set of unit tests is better than having zero contract warnings. That said, leave squigglies on so you can verify that the warnings are a false positive when you're coding.</p>
