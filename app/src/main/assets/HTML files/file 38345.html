<p>Assuming your view controller is in a UINavigationController it's possible using UINavigationControllerDelegate.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set your view controller to be the delegate of your navigation controller (<code>self.navigationcontroller.delegate = self</code>)</li>
<li>Implement the method <code>-navigationController:animationControllerForOperation:fromViewController:toViewController:</code> and return an object that conforms to the <code>UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning</code> protocol.</li>
<li>Implement the methods for that protocol. In the method <code>-animateTransition:</code> you will be passed a parameter that conforms to <code>UIViewControllerContextTransitioning</code>. This object will allow you to get a reference to the view controller you're transitioning to &amp; from as well as a container view.</li>
</ol>

<p>As with most custom animations, this isn't a trivial thing but this should get you going down the right path. Hope this helps.</p>
