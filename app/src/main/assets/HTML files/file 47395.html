<p>Your two snippets do different things: try with <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> equal to <code>7</code>, <code>8</code> and <code>9</code> respectively.</p>

<p>The first snippet sets the three variables to <code>9</code>, <code>8</code> and <code>9</code>. In other words, <code>max(a, b)</code> is calculated <em>before</em> <code>a</code> is assigned to the value of <code>c</code>. Essentially, all that <code>a, b = c, max(a, b)</code> does is push two values onto the stack; the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are then assigned to these values when they are popped back off.</p>

<p>On the other hand, running the second snippet sets all three variables to <code>9</code>. This is because <code>a</code> is set to point to the value of <code>c</code> before the function call <code>max(a, b)</code> is made.</p>
