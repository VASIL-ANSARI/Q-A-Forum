<p>An EventWaitHandle is not the appropriate synchronization object here.  You require <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion" rel="nofollow"><em>mutual exclusion</em></a> so that only <em>one</em> thread can be in a state where it sent a command and is waiting for the response.  In other words, threads must strictly take their turn to talk to the device.</p>

<p>A ManualResetEvent doesn't give you that guarantee, as soon as you call Set() then <strong>all</strong> the threads that are blocking on the WaitOne() call will be unblocked.  If that's more than one then your program will malfunction when two or more threads try to send a command at the same time.</p>

<p>A Mutex provides MUTual EXclusion.  That's how it got its name.</p>
