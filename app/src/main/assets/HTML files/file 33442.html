<p>If you're selecting based on a calculated field (generated via DB::raw() in your select list), rather than on an actual table column that is stored on the database, then you need to use a <code>having()</code> clause rather than <code>where()</code> clause.</p>

<p>This isn't specifically a Laravel/Eloquent or an ORM issue, but is a general requirement for SQL.</p>
