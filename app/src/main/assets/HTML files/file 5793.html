<p>Presumably because you are not specifying a store id nor scope, the collection doesn't know which attributes to load along with the product models. You can include that and shorten your code by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>$cat_id = 10; // category_id for "specific category"
$_category = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')-&gt;load($cat_id);
$_productCollection = $_category-&gt;getProductCollection();
</code></pre>
