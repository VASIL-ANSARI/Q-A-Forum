<blockquote>As of PHP 5.3.0, PHP implements a feature called late static bindings which can be used to reference the called class in a context of static inheritance.  [...] "Late binding" comes from the fact that static:: will not be resolved using the class where the method is defined but it will rather be computed using runtime information. It was also called a "static binding" as it can be used for (but is not limited to) static method calls. </blockquote>  

<p>Unfortunately you can't "force" a subclass to define this static member like you can with abstract member methods.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
abstract class Class_A {

    public function __construct()   {
        echo get_class($this), "\n";
    }

    public function get_table_name_protected() {
        return static::$table_name;
    }
}

class B extends Class_A {
    protected static $table_name="Table_shape_B";
}

class C extends Class_A     {
    protected static $table_name="Table_shape_C";
}

$NewObject1= new B ( );
$NewObject2= new C ( );

echo $NewObject1-&gt;get_table_name_protected(), "\n";
echo $NewObject2-&gt;get_table_name_protected(), "\n";
</code></pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre><code>B
C
Table_shape_B
Table_shape_C
</code></pre>
