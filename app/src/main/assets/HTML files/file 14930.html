<p>Maybe this helps you <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2569355/Geo-Distance-Search-with-MySQL" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/2569355/Geo-Distance-Search-with-MySQL</a></p>

<p>Basically the problem is that lat/lng are spherical coordinates (lat and lng are angles), and you want to make a search using a linear distance over the spherical surface. Then, you are trying to compare two different things, I mean, angles with kilometers. To do it, you must make a coordinate transformation and then compare.</p>
