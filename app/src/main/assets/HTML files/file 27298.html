<p>When you're in popup, you can access page that opened popup via <code>opener</code> keyword. So, for example if opener page has <code>function acceptLetter()</code> you can call it from the popup as <code>opener.acceptLetter()</code>.</p>

<p>Knowing this you can follow these steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the opener page define function <code>acceptLetter(position, letter)</code> it will accept "row_column" position and letter pressed by the client.</li>
<li>In the popup when client pressed the letter - call that function as <code>opener.acceptLetter</code> and pass, as parameters, position (which you already know from query string) and letter pressed.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example if popup is opened as "keyboard.aspx?0_8" and client pressed letter "W" you will call the function as <code>opener.acceptLetter('0_8', 'W');</code>. Also, I assume after letter is pressed, popup is no longer needed, so after above call, make a call to <code>window.close();</code> to close the popup.</p>
