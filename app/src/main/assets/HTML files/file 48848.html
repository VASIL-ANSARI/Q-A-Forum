<p><em>Immutable</em> objects cannot be changed. Their state remains constant after creation. Thus, "s" is constant. But the references that point to it could change. </p>

<pre><code>String s1 = "s";
String s2 = s1;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, "s" is an immutable object (String), <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>are just references. </p>

<p><strong>Defensive copies</strong> are used to prevent state changes on an Object - <em>part of the immutability story</em> , by returning a new Object with the same values. </p>

<p>PS : You are not doing deep copying here. You are just re-assigning references.</p>
