<blockquote>
  <p>Why do memory leaks occur with the inner classes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the inner class maintains a reference to the outer class.</p>

<p>If the inner class doesn't actually <em>need</em> that reference, which is quiet common for anonymous classes, and the outer class is otherwise unreachable, it is nevertheless not garbage collectable because of that reference.</p>

<p>That is considered a "leak", i.e. memory that should be freed is not being freed, as long as a reference to the inner class is maintained.</p>

  <p>When using inner classes, what are the most common memory leaks that can occur?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See answer to first question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are remedies to memory leaks that one can come across frequently?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use static nested classes instead of anonymous, local, and inner classes. Top-level classes are of course also an option.</p>

<p>This is of course only necessary when the lifetime of the inner class exceeds the lifetime of the outer class.</p>
