<p>You can use <code>header()</code>, you just need to make sure that you don't have any <code>echo</code> running before your call to <code>header()</code>, and that you don't have any extra spaces or lines at the beginning of a PHP script (before the first <code>&lt;?php</code>. I bet the error you see is "Headers already sent".</p>

<pre><code>header("Location: " . $url3);
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can echo a JS redirect at the end of your script. Assuming you are running this in a browser.</p>
