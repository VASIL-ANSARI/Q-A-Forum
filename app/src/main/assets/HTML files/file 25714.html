<p>Java returns references to the Array, so it won't be a copy and it will modify the List. In general, unless its a primitive type (<code>int</code>,<code>float</code>,etc) you will be getting a reference to the object.</p>

<p>You have to explicitly copy the array yourself if you want a duplicate to be returned.</p>
