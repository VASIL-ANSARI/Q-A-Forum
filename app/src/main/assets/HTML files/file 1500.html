<p><code>755</code> means :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rwx</code> : read,write,execute for owner</li>
<li><code>r-x</code> : read,execute for group</li>
<li><code>r-x</code> : read,execute of others</li>
</ul>

<p>So, everyone can read <em>(and execute)</em> that file, but only the owner can write to it.</p>

<p>Maybe the user that owns the file is not the one that runs your PHP script ? i.e. the file could belong to anyone, while your script is being run by Apache's user <em>(often <code>www-data</code>)</em> ?</p>

<p><br>
A first idea might be to delete the file, let your script try to re-create it ; if it's re-created properly <em>(which means Apache has the requires <code>write</code> rights on the directoy containing it)</em>, it should be able to modify it, after that.</p>

<p>Else, you should try giving the <code>write</code> privilege to <code>other</code> -- if your script is being run by another user than the owner of the file ; <code>chmod o+w rss.xml</code> should do the trick.</p>
