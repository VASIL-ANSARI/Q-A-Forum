<p>I see two problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>All 6 calculation blocks contain the exact same formulas (as others have also pointed out).</li>
<li>You are doing integer math, meaning the results are also integers, and they may all be rounded to 0 for certain inputs, e.g. if PL &lt; L. Fix: use <code>Double.Parse(...)</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
