<p>Yep, this is a pretty standard approach.</p>

<p>If you are on Linux you may like to use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/sendfile.2.html" rel="nofollow"><code>sendfile()</code></a>. This way you don't have to maintain a buffer into which it reads a file in blocks and then sends it through a socket.</p>
