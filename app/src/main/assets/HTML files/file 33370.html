<p>You can always moke it by generating a soft link like this</p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /opt/X11/lib/libpng.dylib /usr/local/lib/libpng15.15.dylib
</code></pre>

<p>Not the cleaner solution but I haven't figure out why matplotlib stubbornly asks specifically for libpng15 and not any 15 or greater.</p>
