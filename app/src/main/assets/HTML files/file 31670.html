<p>SSIS Is compatible with Transactions across different data sources, however as I understand it they require the use of the MSDTC service. If your data source is not compatible with this then it will fail. If your data source is compatible I.E. another Windows machine with SQL Server, then check that the service is switched on and configured correctly.</p>

<p>You could also set the specific parts of the sequence container to set the TransactionOption to not support to get around it, although I don't know if that will work for a source.</p>
