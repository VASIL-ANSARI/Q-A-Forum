<p>It's well supported. You just need to add the platform before it appears in drop-down lists:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build/Configuration Manager</li>
<li>Active Solution Platform</li>
<li><code>&lt;New...&gt;</code></li>
<li>x64</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are using VS 2008 <em>Express</em>, it will not include x64 support.</p>

<p>EDIT: If the configuration already exists on the solution, but not on the project, use this sequence:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build/Configuration Manager</li>
<li>Go to the line with the project, column Platform</li>
<li>Drop-Down list, <code>&lt;New...&gt;</code></li>
<li>x64</li>
</ol>
