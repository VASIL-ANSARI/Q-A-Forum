<p>Think this is the culprit</p>

<pre><code>$("#league_id").val(null)..
</code></pre>

<p>If you inspect the DOM after making it <strong>null</strong> the value field is still existent , may be the DOM was not refreshed yet..</p>

<p>So when the form is posted maybe the value="11" is being sent.</p>

<p>Why don't you try removing the attribute completely and then try again.. </p>

<pre><code> $('#league_id').removeAttr('value');
</code></pre>
