<p>Your <code>DB</code> class is not public, so you can't make a <code>public</code> method (or constructor) that takes it as a parameter.  (What would callers outside your assembly do?)</p>

<p>You need to either make the <code>DB</code> class <code>public</code> or make the <code>SqlCatalogRepository</code> class (or its constructor) <code>internal</code>.</p>

<p>Which one you do will depend where your types are being used.<br>
If the <code>SqlCatalogRepository</code> is only meant to be used inside your assembly, you should make it <code>internal</code>.  (<code>internal</code> means that it's only visible to other types in the same assembly)</p>

<p>If it's meant to be exposed by your assembly to other assemblies, you should make the class <code>public</code> but the constructor <code>internal</code>.</p>

<p>If the <code>DB</code> class itself is meant to be used by types outside your assembly, you should make the <code>DB</code> class itself <code>public</code>.</p>
