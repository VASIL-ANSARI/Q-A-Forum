<p>One would assume, if you are using knockout, to maybe bind onto some listeners, or attach listeners to an event.</p>

<p>Most events through JavaScript always have a callback function, this is good practive so that once a function has finished executing some long <code>I/O</code> or <code>Database</code> query it will immediately execute that function. Obviously that callback will be defined by you.</p>

<pre><code>someLongTimeFunction(function (data) {
  // usually this callback will be fired when the function has finished.
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you are familiar with knockout, then you would know that once the data has been retrieved and you pass through an <code>observable</code> that <code>observable</code> would update its binding.</p>

<p>Here is the link for extending observables: <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/extenders.html" rel="nofollow">knockout js</a></p>

<p>As far as I can understand from you question, this <code>loadGeoJson</code>, is it server side? If so, you do a long poll from client side and tie into that:</p>

<pre><code>function doRequest() {
  var request = $.ajax({
    dataType: "json",
    url: 'loadGeoJson',
    data: data,
  });

  request.done(function(data, result) {
    if (result !== "success") {
      setTimeout(doRequest, 10000);
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>
