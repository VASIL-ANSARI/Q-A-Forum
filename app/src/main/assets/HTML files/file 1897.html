<p>Actually, you would need <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html" rel="nofollow">"Offline Web Applications"</a> functionality of HTML5 in order to serve pages locally (i.e. act as a local Web Server).</p>

<p>Another way to serve Web applications locally can be through CouchDB: easily installable on Linux (not sure on Windows) and provides an integrated Web server with of course a database.  You could "push" your HTML/JS site to CouchDB from a browser provided the user installs an extension (easily done in Firefox &amp; Chrome).</p>
