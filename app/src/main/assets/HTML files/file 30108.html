<p>I was being foolish and simply changed the function that created the request operation to <code>managedObjectRequestOperationWithRequest:managedObjectContext:success:fail</code> rather than using <code>objectRequestOperationWithRequest:success:fail</code>. I simply read what I wrote in the first paragraph of my question.</p>

<p>God I'm a moron.</p>
