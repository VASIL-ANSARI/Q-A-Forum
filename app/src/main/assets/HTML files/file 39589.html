<p>From the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#start()" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Causes this thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine calls the run method of this thread.</p>
  
  <p>The result is that two threads are running concurrently: the current thread (which returns from the call to the start method) and the other thread (which executes its run method).</p>
  
  <p>It is never legal to start a thread more than once. In particular, a thread may not be restarted once it has completed execution.</p>
  
  <p>Throws:
  IllegalThreadStateException - if the thread was already started.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look closely at the last 2 sentences, and you shall find your answer.</p>
