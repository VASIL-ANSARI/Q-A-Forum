<p>The exception <code>string index out of bounds exception: length=0, index=12</code> is telling you exactly what the problem is.</p>

<p>In the code <code>CaughtInBrMode.charAt(12)</code> you are asking for the char at location 12. Unfortunately, <code>CaughtInBrMode</code> currently has a length of 0 - there is no 12th location.</p>
