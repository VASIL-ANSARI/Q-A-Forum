<p>This should do ya:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$xml = file_get_contents('myxml.xml');
$xml = nl2br($xml);
echo strip_tags($xml,"&lt;br&gt;");
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason you were missing line breaks was because in XML, it is stored as plaintext linebreaks <code>\n</code> whereas when displaying as HTML you must have explicit <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> linebreaks. Because of this the good PHP folks made a handy function called <code>nl2br()</code> to do this for you.</p>
