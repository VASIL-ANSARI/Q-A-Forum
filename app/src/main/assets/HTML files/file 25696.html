Usually, using cake's internal routing you can only get one of those three versions. Always.</p>

<p>But if someone would get hold of the wrong url and does link it from somewhere it might actually be followed by google and indexed wrongly. So yes, there is a possibility.</p>

<li>use htaccess to prevent the / (or vica versa) and 301 redirect to the other one</li>
<li>use canonical tag in your layout to always route to the correctly routed url - not matter what the full url including /index etc might currently look like).</li>
</ul>
