<p>The comment response is good, but you could also just have an array defined globally, say error names like so:</p>

<p>NSArray *errorNames = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"MyErrorCodeOne", @"MyErrorCodeTwo", nil];</p>

<p>and reference it by [errorNames objectAtIndex:MyErrorCodeOne];</p>

<p>Only if that's easier for you. The first response would be the best, in my opinion.</p>
