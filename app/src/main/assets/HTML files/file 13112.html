<p>I'm guessing this has nothing to do with XMLHttpRequest.  What happens when you try accessing those resources directly, through the address bar in your web browser, or something like cURL?</p>

<p>The default security configurations on IIS are most likely preventing serving of "unrecognized" files.  You probably need to register MIME types for them, or disable the security configurations.</p>

<p>Some details around this are available at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/44aa974e-ad27-4800-adfb-13c4ae39a602.mspx?mfr=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/44aa974e-ad27-4800-adfb-13c4ae39a602.mspx?mfr=true</a> .  Note specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can also configure IIS to serve undefined file types by adding a
  wildcard character (*) MIME type. Do not use wildcard MIME-types on
  production servers. Doing so can result in IIS serving unrecognized
  files and displaying sensitive information to users. Wildcard
  MIME-types are intended for testing purposes or in scenarios where
  Internet Server API (ISAPI) filters have been developed specifically
  to handle these wild card scenarios, for example, a custom
  authentication ISAPI.</p>
