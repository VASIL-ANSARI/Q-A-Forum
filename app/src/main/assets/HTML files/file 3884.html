<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f02979c7.aspx" rel="nofollow">TryParse</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb347013.aspx" rel="nofollow">TryGetValue</a> family of methods?</p>

<p>Get a value and an indication of success, without having to parse/search twice.</p>

<p>I've used this myself to split and address into a street and housenumber. Within the method I have both, if I only have a return value, I would have to split the data twice.</p>

<p>The example you use does not look usefull, except in an interop context.</p>
