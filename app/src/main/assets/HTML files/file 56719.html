<p><code>queries[i]</code> is just a string. It's a stringified instruction. My guess would be to evaluate it with <code>eval(queries[i])</code>.</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; length; i++){
        var start = new Date().getTime()
        eval(queries[i]);
        var end = new Date().getTime();
        var timeElapsed = (end - start)/1000;
        print ( "Time taken to run query : "+timeElapsed+" secs" )
 }
</code></pre>

<p>However, one often says that <a href="https://24ways.org/2005/dont-be-eval" rel="nofollow">eval is evil</a> and has to be used ONLY in last resort.</p>
