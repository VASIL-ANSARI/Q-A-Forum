<p>After further research i can safely say it's a default menu bar provided by MacOS. If you create another menu and assign it to the top level window, it replaces this default one.</p>

<p>It's also mentioned here: <a href="http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/menus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/menus.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because on Mac OS X all windows have a menubar, it's important to make
  sure you do define one, either for each window or a fallback menubar
  for the root window. Otherwise, you'll end up with the "built-in"
  menubar, which contains menus that are only intended for use when
  typing commands directly into the interpreter.</p>
