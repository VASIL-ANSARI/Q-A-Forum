<p><code>dispatch_block_t</code> is a struct, not an object. In fact it's a C struct. I don't understand why you need to use a dispatch_block_t, why not just pass the closure around. If you have to pass it to a <code>dispatch_</code> function wrap it in a dispatch_block_t at the call site.</p>

<p>To Swiftify this:</p>

<p>In Swift, <code>dispatch_block_t</code> is simply an alias for <code>() -&gt; ()</code> i.e. a void function/closure returning <code>Void</code>. So you can simply say</p>

<pre><code>let a = { self.pickImages() }
// etc

let actionArray = [ a, b, c, ...]
</code></pre>

<p>However, <code>pickImages</code> is a function that has the same type (technically it is curried over <code>self</code> but don't worry about what that means) so you can forget about the a, b, c bit and just do this</p>

<pre><code>let actionArray = [ self.pickImages, self.takePhoto, ... ]
</code></pre>

<p>And in Swift, you can use one of the "objects" in that array any time you have a parameter that takes a <code>dispatch_block_t</code> e.g.</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_after(someTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), actionArray[0])
</code></pre>
