<p>If you are sure that <code>getDirection()</code> really returns a signed char, it should work, since a signed char of <code>0xff</code> should correctly be promoted to a -1 integer.</p>

<p>If unsure, you could try to write </p>

<pre><code>int dir = getDirection();
// optionnally for extensive tests : fprintf(stderr, "getDirection : %d\n", dir);
if ((dir == -1) || (dir == 255)) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>The 255 would catch any conversion problem, for example <code>getDirection()</code> returning a signed char ... what your last edit suggests ...</p>
