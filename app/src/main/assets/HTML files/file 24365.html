<p>Unfortunately c# and visual studio doesn't work very well with anonymous classes that crosses method boundaries. You have to make it into a concrete class or tuple in order to get intellisense in your calling method. </p>

<p>Another option is to use dynamic (n.Cast&lt; dynamic >()) - but that still won't give you intellisense - however you will be able to use the property.</p>
