<p>In a console, standard output (produced by the running program(s)) and standard input (produced by your keypresses) are both sent to screen, so they may end up all mixed.</p>

<p>Here your thread 1 writes 1 <code>x</code> by line every second, so if your take more than 1 second to type <code>HELLO</code> then that will produce the in-console output that you submitted.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid that, a few non-exhaustive suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>temporarily interrupt thread1 output when a keypress is detected</p></li>
<li><p>use a library such as ncurses to create separates zones for your program output and the user input</p></li>
<li><p>just suppress thread1 input, or send it to a file instead.</p></li>
</ul>
