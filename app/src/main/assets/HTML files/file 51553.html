<p>If you are coding entirely in this Java program then it is pointless to convert the window handle to a text representation. Simply use the <code>HWND</code> value directly. </p>

<p>If in fact the issue is that you send the text to some other party, and need to obtain the numeric value of the window handle, then simply convert the text to a numeric value. I see little point in prefixing the text with <code>native@</code> and the hexadecimal prefix <code>0x</code> is probably also superfluous. The two parties can simple agree that the value will always be passed as hexadecimal. Presumably you know enough about Java and the other programming languages that are involved to be able to convert between numeric values and hexadecimal text. </p>
