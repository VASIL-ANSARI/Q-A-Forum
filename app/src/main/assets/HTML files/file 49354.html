<p>You are using encapsulation for the <code>name</code> attribute.  You could do the same for age.</p>

<pre><code>class AStudent {
    // ...
    private int age;
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
        if (age &lt; 1) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code changes the <code>age</code> attribute to private so that access is restricted to the getter and setter.  So you will also have to add a getter method and change <code>TestStudent2</code> to use the new getter and setter.</p>

<p>What makes an age invalid?  The above code assumes any value less than 1 is invalid.</p>
