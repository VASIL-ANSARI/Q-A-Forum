<p>I don't know why the order in which the events are fired is inconsistent between browsers, but I don't see why you can't move everything in to a single <code>change</code> handler. If you must use separate handlers, you could add a timeout, the click event would still fire first in Firefox, but its code wouldn't be executed until after the change handler fires.</p>

<pre><code>var myBoolean = false;

$('#example').on({
    'click': function() {
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log('clicked'); 
            console.log(myBoolean);
        }, 1);
    },
    'change': function() {
        console.log('changed');
        myBoolean = true;
    }
});
</code></pre>
