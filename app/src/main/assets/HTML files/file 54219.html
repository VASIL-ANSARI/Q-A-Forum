<p>The strange appearance of the distribution is likely due to your data not fitting well the distribution (in particular alpha distribution). Since I do not have your data I can't go into further detail. It looks good enough with the sample you provided.</p>

<p>The histograms are plotted but the bars are just too small compared to 1e29 so you can't see them.</p>

<p>The legend and other plot elements are accumulating because you are always plotting in the same subplot without clearing it so in each iteration you keep everything you plotted before.</p>
