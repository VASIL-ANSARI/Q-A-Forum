<p>To answer your why question, it's not in the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/formatDate" rel="nofollow">allowed list of formats</a>.  Since it's a date picker and not a time picker, I guess the issue doesn't come up enough to warrant adding the weight to the library to support it.</p>
