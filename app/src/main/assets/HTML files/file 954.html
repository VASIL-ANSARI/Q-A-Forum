<p>It would only happen if the Java interpreter is producing machine code that is actually <em>better</em> optimized than the machine code your compiler is generating for the C++ code you are writing, to the point where the C++ code is slower than the Java and the interpretation cost.</p>

<p>However, the odds of that actually happening are pretty low - unless perhaps Java has a very well-written library, and you have your own poorly written C++ library.</p>
