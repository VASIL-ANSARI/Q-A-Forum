<p>An <code>await</code> blocks only the current <code>async function</code>, the event loop continues to run normally. When the promise settles, the execution of the function body is resumed where it stopped.</p>

<p>Every <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> can be transformed in an equivalent <code>.then(â¦)</code>-callback program, and works just like that from the concurrency perspective. So while a promise is being <code>await</code>ed, other events may fire and arbitrary other code may run.</p>
