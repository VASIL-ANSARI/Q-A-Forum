<p>You only have one localStorage property which is <code>"tasks"</code>.</p>

<p>The value of this property is the json you stringify.</p>

<p>In the line <code>localStorage.removeItem(tasks[taks_id]);</code> the value of <code>tasks[taks_id]</code> is not <code>"tasks"</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore you are looking to delete something in localStorage that doesn't even exist</p>

<p>What you need to do is remove the item from your <code>tasks</code> javascript array and then save the modified array to localStorage again.</p>

<p>Assuming <code>task_id</code> is the index in array:</p>

<pre><code>//remove from array
tasks.splice(task_id,1);
//store again
localStorage.setItem('tasks',JSON.stringify(tasks));
</code></pre>
