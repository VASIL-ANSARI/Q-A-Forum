<p>A rectangle on the world plane will appear as a quadrangle in your image.<br>
In a bird's eye view, you want it to appear as a rectangle again. 
You must know at least the aspect ratio of this world rectangle for the top view to be correctly and equally  scaled along both axes. </p>

<p>Given the 4 quadrangle 2D points in your image, and the destination rectangle corners (for which <em>you</em> essentially choose the 2D coordinates) you can calculate the homography from your quadrangle to a rectangle and use <code>warpPerspective()</code> to render it.</p>

<p>This is often the easiest way to do it. </p>

<p>You can also go through the camera and matrices themselves. For this you will need to rotate the camera to be above the plane with orthographic projection. See the homography decomposition <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography_(computer_vision)" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>
