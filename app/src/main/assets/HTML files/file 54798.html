<p>After more than 10 days after opening the issue on the Solr jira I have not get any reply (this is not a good sign for an open source community) so I have spent some time to find a workaround. I basically close the references to the core I want to unload before actually unloading it. Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>SolrCore core = coreContainer.create("newcore", coreProps)
coreContainer.swap("newcore", "livecore")

// the old livecore is now newcore, so unload it and remove all the related dirs
SolrCore oldCore = coreContainer.getCore("newCore")
while (oldCore.getOpenCount &gt; 1) {
  oldCore.close()
}
coreContainer.unload("newcore", true, true, true)
</code></pre>
