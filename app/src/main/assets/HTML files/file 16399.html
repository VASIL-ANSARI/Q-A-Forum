<p>This happens because your keyboard is doing what is called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/appliedsciences/antighostingexplained.mspx" rel="nofollow">ghosting</a>. This is normal for the majority of keyboards used by people today. It's wired up so that it's a lot cheaper to produce, and as a result, things like this happen consistently.</p>

<p>Basically when three keys in the same row/column are pressed at once, they cannot all be uniquely identified, causing at least one not to go through. The only thing you can do is buy an anti-ghosting keyboard, or redesign your controls to avoid conflicts.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I found out about this a day or two before I presented my game and ended up having to make the controls something like P1: SZXC and space and P2: /789 and +. It really is a good thing to know beforehand.</p>
