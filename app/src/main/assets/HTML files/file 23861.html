<p>Good for you for attempting! But it seems there's just one thing you're misunderstanding: <code>^</code> is an <em>anchor</em>&mdash;it matches the beginning of a string&mdash;it cannot be quantified, <em>e.g.</em> made optional via <code>?</code>, nor does it make sense to appear <em>after</em> some part of the string has already been matched, since then it could definitely not be the beginning of the string. Try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>/^TEXT|TEXTTWO|([\+][0-9]{1,3}[ \.\-])?([\(]{1}[0-9]{2,6}[\)])?([0-9 \.\-\/]{3,20})((x|ext|extension)[ ]?[0-9]{1,4})?$/
</code></pre>

<p>So, you had the right idea with alternation (<code>|</code>). Note that alternation has one of the lowest precedence of all operators in regex, so no grouping is necessary here.</p>
