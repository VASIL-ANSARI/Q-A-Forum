<p>I see any of the below possible reasons :</p>

<ol>
<li>You did not include all the jars in classpath, they might have
interdependent classes. </li>
<li>You jar is an old version which is not
having that method.</li>
<li>Some dependent jar is missing which not allowing the class constructor to initialize the class object.</li>
</ol>
