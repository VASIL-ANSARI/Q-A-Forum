<p>Nevermind, I found the answer, I can map variables like this; <code>a, b = [1, 2]</code>, so I can also do <code>a,b,c,d = [a,b,c,d].shuffle</code> to shuffle the array before mapping. Of course, if we are going for readability, we can do this;</p>

<pre><code>shuffled = [a, b, c, d].shuffle
a, b, c, d = shuffled
</code></pre>
