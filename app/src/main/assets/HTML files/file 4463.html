<p>Are you using <code>event.preventDefault()</code> to trap mouse clicks? That could be the reason why the text box seems read only &ndash; it can never gain focus. To fix this, use:</p>

<pre><code>textbox.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    event.stopPropagation();
}, false);
</code></pre>

<p>This would keep the click event from bubbling up to your general event handler used to intercept most mouse clicks.</p>
