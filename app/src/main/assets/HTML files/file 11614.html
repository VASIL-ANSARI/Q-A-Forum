<p>The best practice is to keep your text as much as possible in a text form :</p>

<ul>
<li>Easier to translate (otherwise multiple export of your image are required which could lead to heavy apk)</li>
<li>Image are asier to strech which can be a real problematic with the great number of screen you have to handle in an app (see NinePatch about that, and you'll that it's not suitable for images including text).</li>
</ul>

<p>TMHO the only benefit of embedding text in images would be to use custom font, this feature can be achieve by setting the typeface of your TextView.</p>
