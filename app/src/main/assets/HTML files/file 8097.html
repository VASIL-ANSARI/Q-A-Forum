<p>No, AFAIK that is not possible. Even if you <code>new</code> the properties to add data-member markers it'll still complain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type 'BaseClass' cannot be serialized. Consider marking it with the DataContractAttribute attribute, and marking all of its members you want serialized with the DataMemberAttribute attribute.  If the type is a collection, consider marking it with the CollectionDataContractAttribute.  See the Microsoft .NET Framework documentation for other supported types.</p>
