<p>you can't assume that the <code>rowCount+1</code> is going to be the next Id.let's say you have 4 records in database with ids 1,2,3,4. Then say you delete the record with id 2. Then you have count equal to 3.  So according to your algorithm the next record id will be 4. It is not goiing to work because there is a record with id 4 already in the database.   </p>

<p>So what you can do is, let the database to generate the identity column. If you are using SQL Server  database   you can enable the Identity specification for a column. And you can get  last identity value inserted using a SQL command <code>SCOPE_IDENTITY</code>(http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190315.aspx) .</p>
