<p>I would suggest:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have a service that gets loaded on startup with BOOT_COMPLETED event.</li>
<li>The service polls the db and creates a map of special objects, which contain PendingIntent, your unique long and whatever more.</li>
<li>From the activity you bind to a service and ask it to do somethings, would it be returning an intent, or creating new or whatever.</li>
<li>Application class can know about the service from the activity, you have binded to the service.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure the service is necessary here. If your work with pending intents begins from the concreate activity, you can simplify this solution with using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" rel="nofollow"><code>Singleton</code></a> pattern for the class, which contains the pending intents data.</p>
