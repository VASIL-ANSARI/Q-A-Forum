<p>The DataField property approach isn't complicated enough to support dot notation; it expects a direct reference in your underlying data source; it takes that field and checks the data source, which it can't find it by the exact string.</p>

<p>The second approach, eval, is more dynamic, but actually I wasn't sure if it supported dot notation...  learn something everyday.</p>

<p>HTH.</p>
