<p>There is not enough information in your post to determine the cause. You must post the RAW HTTP response for anyone to help you. The server is probably returning a HTTP 415 since you are not constructing the request correctly.</p>

<pre><code>request.setHeader("Content-type", "application/json");          
</code></pre>

<p>You are setting the content type to json for a GET request. That is not possible. The server might be try to match that and get confused. It could also be that the server has a genuine HTTP 500 error from the request. From the way the response error is constructed, the service seems to be complaining that the request itself is not valid.</p>

<pre><code>server encountered an error processing the request.Please see the service help page for constructing valid requests to the service.
</code></pre>
