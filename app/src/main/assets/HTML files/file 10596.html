<p>Errors like this can happen if the MySQL server isn't reachable and PHP error handling is not implemented to anticipate this. mysql_connect() returns as MySQL resource pointer to the database server, but only if the connection actually works. If not, the resource pointer is empty and functions further down the line start to complain, which is what you're seeing there. If this happens only intermittently, this is a typical sign of MySQL server overload.</p>

<p>If you're on a shared hosting server, chances are that another tenant is sometimes exhausting all the resources, so there is little you can do. But there may be a couple of things you can do to trace the problem further. If your phpMyAdmin interface allows you access to the Status tab, you can use it to gain some insight into the MySQL server's status. </p>

<p>For example, look at the number of queries it performs, and the number of simultaneous connections it allows. Sometimes, connections are denied because the max connection number is exhausted (some hosting environments allow you to change this). The server also keeps track of the failure statistics, it might give you some clues as to what's going on.</p>

<p>However, if you have no access to those statistics, or can't change any settings on the server and you are sufficiently sure that your app isn't causing the traffic overload, you should probably open a support ticket with your hosting provider.</p>
