<p>I think, but I'm not sure, that you can't just transmit data like this. The reason is that the carrier directs calls with those numbers (codes). Transmitting an extra number(or an extra single digit) means wrong (or incorrect) number and will probably cancel the call. What you want to do seems to me like a way to manipulate the network, but I don't think it's possible. The data center of the carrier has probably at least some kind of a check on this.</p>

<p>I don't know why you need those symbols "*1" to be transmitted, but since this is hardcoded, it can easily be hardcoded into your application too. I think that you can use the telephone number to identify the calling party, but if you need to transfer information dynamically this way, it should not be possible.</p>

<p>Maybe you should try communicating directly with the other device, which has your app installed. Here's an interesting <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8853305/android-api-for-inter-device-communication">THREAD</a> about this, even though there, this kind of communication is used for multiplayer games it provides a way for the devices to communicate.</p>
