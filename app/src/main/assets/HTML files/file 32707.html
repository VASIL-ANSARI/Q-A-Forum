<p>This is because no visible interface of <code>NSString</code> declares the selector <code>performSTringGeocode</code>. </p>

<p>In fact, it is a method of <code>MapViewController</code>, as far as your code is telling. </p>

<p>Try</p>

<pre><code>[self performStringGeocode:[self fromAddr]];
</code></pre>
