<p>You can create a basic function like strategy to handle this type of Scenario. Hence if you include the function file alone your DB will be connected on the fly and you can use this using the variable that you connect to the DB.</p>

<p>You can have two files and then you can perform the scenario like this.</p>

<p><strong>db.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
class DB {
    function __construct(){
        $username='root';
        $password='';
        $host='localhost';
        $db='store';
        $this-&gt;connection = mysqli_connect($username,$password,$host,$db);
        if(mysqli_connect_errno){
            echo "Failed to connect to MYSQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
        }
    }

    function fetchData(){
        $get_query = "SELECT * FROM TABLE"
        $result = mysqli_query($this-&gt;connection, $get_query);
    }

}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And you can call the function in the page as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usage of the class that we have created</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>listpage.php</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
include('db.php'); // Include the DB file over this line
$conn= new DB(); // Initialize the class that we have created
$conn-&gt;fetchData();// This query will select all the data and return it.
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I hope so my explanation over the code are clear and you can understand it well and continue your project codes on the fly.</p>

<p>Happy Coding :)</p>
