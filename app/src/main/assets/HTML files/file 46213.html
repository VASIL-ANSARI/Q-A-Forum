<p>Since PHP is a dynamically typed scripting language it allows for <code>Dynamic Properties</code>. I refer you to this <a href="http://krisjordan.com/dynamic-properties-in-php-with-stdclass" rel="nofollow">this article</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Languages like JavaScript and Python allow object instances to have
  dynamic properties. As it turns out, PHP does too. Looking at the
  official PHP documentation on objects and classes you might be lead to
  believe dynamic instance properties require custom __get and __set
  magic methods. They don't.</p>
