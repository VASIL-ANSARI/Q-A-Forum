<p>The <code>disconnectButton</code> method has two errors.  First the <code>peripheral</code> variable is used without being initialized (are you ignoring compiler warnings?).  Second, the <code>if</code> statement checks if the peripheral is disconnected and then disconnects it again (you should be checking that the peripheral is <em>connected</em>).</p>
