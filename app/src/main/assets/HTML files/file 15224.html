<p>"How do I load these objects" - there can be multiple way as per your need-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>you can use concurrent threads to load thing.</p></li>
<li><p>You can go for lazy loading - first load those thing which needs to be show on first screen(considering you are loading couple of data which is not needed on first screen).</p></li>
