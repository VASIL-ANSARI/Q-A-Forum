<p>Sorry, I'm not real familiar with gRaphael, but I did find that converting your <code>yVals</code> into whole numbers (by multiplying each by <code>1e5</code>) seemed to rid your chart of the awkward behavior.</p>

<p>This suggests that it could be related to the algorithm gRaphael uses to find the max axis value (as you ask in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/21098797/1225950">your related question</a>) when your values are small decimal values (and alter at even more significant digits).</p>

<p>I know there are inherent issues with float precision, but I can't be sure that applies to your case, or that your values are low enough to consider this.</p>

<p>Not the best workaround, but if it would be feasible for you, you could display the <code>yValues</code> in an order of magnitude larger, and remind the viewer that they are actually smaller than presented.  For example, your chart could go from 0 to 3100 and remind your viewer that the scale is <code>scale * 1e-5</code>.</p>
