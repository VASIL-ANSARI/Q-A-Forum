<p>Try something like this</p>

<pre><code>class KApp { 
private:
    Input input;
    Game game;
    KApp() : game(&amp;input) {}
};
</code></pre>

<p>What is going on with <code>Game game(&amp;input);</code> is that you're declaring a member <code>game</code> which the compiler has picked up as a function declaration and is complaining that the parameter doesn't have a type.</p>

<p>This way, you're explicitly calling <code>Game::Game(Input*)</code> in the constructor of KApp (at which point input should be initialized using its default constructor).</p>

<p>edit - Input* vs Input&amp;</p>
