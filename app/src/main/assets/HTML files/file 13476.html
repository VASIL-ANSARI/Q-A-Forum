<p>this is a new API offered by HTML5 so only few browsers support it at the moment...</p>

<p>you can check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Using_full-screen_mode" rel="nofollow">MDN</a> for some basic explanation and examples</p>

<p>EDIT: worth to mention > difference between Gecko and WebKit: Gecko automatically adds CSS rules to the element to stretch it to fill the screen: "width: 100%; height: 100%"</p>

<p>EDIT 2: supporting browsers are only Firefox (since 10) and Chrome (I think very early not quite sure when they fully supported it)... as it is experimental you need the vendor prefixes...</p>

<p>EDIT 4: regarding IE support: 11/15/2011 Ted Johnson from IEBlog says that the IE10 team has not yet decided whether to implement the FullScreen API. He notes however that, âWindows 8 Metro style Internet Explorer is always full screen â¦ and as before, F11 enters full screen mode in desktop versions of IE.â</p>

<p>EDIT 5: <a href="http://caniuse.com/fullscreen" rel="nofollow">can I use</a> - another nice table showing that in latest Safari available as well... whether Opera supports it in Version 12 is still unknown</p>
