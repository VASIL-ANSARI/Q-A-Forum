<p>ImpulseEngine is using OpenGL, which is a very complex API programs use to access graphics hardware through dedicated drivers.  The drivers and the associated API are unavailable within the browser environment emscripten targets; you're not going to get it to work.</p>

<p>If you could find a similar library that targets SDL--a commonly-used library which provides a higher-level encapsulation of graphics APIs--you might port it to emscripten, since emscripten claims to support SDL.  In this case emscripten would be providing the lower-level implementation of the SDL graphics calls, translating them to the appropriate javascript-compatible APIs.</p>
