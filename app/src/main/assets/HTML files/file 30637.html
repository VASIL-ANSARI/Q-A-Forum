<p>Using await/async only stops you from blocking the UI if all the long-running operations you call are async. In your example your <code>Remote.Login</code> is a synchronous call, so regardless of what the prior <code>await</code> line does, this will block your UI. </p>

<p>You need to either get an async version of your actual long-running operation (eg something returning a <code>Task</code>) or if that is not possible, then you can resort to <code>Task.Run</code> in order to move this work to the <code>ThreadPool</code>.</p>

<p>What you want if possible:</p>

<pre><code>public async void LoginButtonClicked()
{
    await Remote.LoginAsync("user","password");
    // do anything else required
}
</code></pre>
