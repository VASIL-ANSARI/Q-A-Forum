<p>before java 7, you don't have standard way to check if a user can write to a java file using standard library. this is because the old java io just is not power enough. </p>

<p>for example, File.canWrite() will not work if consider file owner, etc....</p>

<p>what you can do is check it in directly, for example, try to write a empty line to it. (this need to consider you application,if your application just don't care a blank line at end and auto delete ending blank lines , then it works..... this is just an example, you can get many tricky ways considering your applicaton. </p>
