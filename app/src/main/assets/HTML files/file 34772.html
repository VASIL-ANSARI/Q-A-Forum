<p>I solved it by adding a "drawable"-folder in res/ and by moving the xml-file with the swapped values in drawable-hdpi to the "drawable"-folder.<br/><br/>
So at the end your folder structure should look like this:<br/>
- drawable (xml-file with swapped values)<br/>
- drawable-hdpi<br/>
- drawable-ldpi<br/>
- drawable-mdpi<br/>
- drawable-v12 (xml-file with the correct values)<br/>
- drawable-xdpi<br/></p>
