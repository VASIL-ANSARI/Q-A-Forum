<p>You idea is basically correct, but remember that any header can be set only while there is nothing written to the output yet. 
Be sure that function with this header command will be called before any other html code will go.</p>

<p>And also, use double quotes for header contents if you want it to work correctly </p>

<pre><code>header("Location: messages.php?page=3&amp;conversation_id=$conversation_id");
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>header('Location: messages.php?page=3&amp;conversation_id='.$conversation_id);
</code></pre>
