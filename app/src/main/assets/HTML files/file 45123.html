<p>When you use NetworkStream, it will throw an IOException if the underlying socket is closed while trying to read, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.sockets.networkstream.read%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">see MSDN documentation</a> . So your code is perfectly fine. You just have to handle the exception.</p>

<p>If you were to read the socket directly, you would just receive 0 when the socket is closed.</p>
