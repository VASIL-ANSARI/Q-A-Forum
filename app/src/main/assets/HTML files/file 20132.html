<p>If it's command line application, then you need to run it in some way. </p>

<p>Is it working overall and only problem is with slf4j/log4j?
I suppose it can be not the only problem with log4j, but other libraries can't accessible. Do you create jar with other dependencies? What is inside your manifest file?</p>

<p>Need more information on your problem.</p>
