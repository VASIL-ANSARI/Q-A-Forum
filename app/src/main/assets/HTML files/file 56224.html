<p>Some "strange" behaviour can occur depending on how your transitions are set up. For example, if there are many transitions attached to the same element, one might be interrupted when another one starts, and that may result on some element not being redrawn on screen.</p>

<p>For more about this see <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/transition/" rel="nofollow">D3 documentation: Working with transitions</a>, specifically <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/transition/#per-element" rel="nofollow">this section</a> which explains that "for a given element, transitions are exclusive: only one transition can be running on the element at the same time. Starting a new transition on the element stops any transition that is already running."</p>
