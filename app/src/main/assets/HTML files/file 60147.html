<p>You did not pass the id which row you want to update (or you want to update all rows?), ISSELECTED variable is not declared. I mean this line:</p>

<pre><code>sqldb.update(TABLE_PEOPLE, cv, "id=" + ISSELECTED, null);
</code></pre>

<p>I would write like this (now I can't test it). I would pass the selected id to the update method's third parameter (that is the where clause, see the documentation: <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html</a>):</p>

<pre><code>public String setStatus(String selected) {
    SQLiteDatabase sqldb = this.getWritableDatabase();
    ContentValues cv = new ContentValues();
    cv.put("isselected", 1);
    sqldb.update(TABLE_PEOPLE, cv, "id=" + selected, null);
    sqldb.close();
    return "Anything you want";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another possible solution is to write your query directly:</p>

<pre><code>public String setStatus(String selected) {
        SQLiteDatabase sqldb = this.getWritableDatabase();
        sqldb.execSQL("UPDATE TABLE_PEOPLE SET ISSELECTED=1 WHERE id=" + selected);
        sqldb.close();
        return "Anything you want";
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Sorry, I forget to tell to modify the button click event, where <code>db.setStatus();</code> is called: use <code>db.setStatus(people.getId());</code>, or something like this (people.id, or something which represents the id of the people object, if it have any. If it don't have id, somehow you should acquire the id from the database.)</p>
