<p>In <code>TimeLine.addColumn()</code> table structure notifications are fired using <code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater</code>. The notifications will be executed asynchronously on EDT once all other pending events have been processed.  </p>

<p>The trick is that <code>fireTableStructureChanged()</code> may trigger rebuilding of table's columns. You can find more details about <code>fireTableStructureChanged</code> in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12558548/1048330">answer</a>. So what may happen is that you set preferred sizes and then <code>fireTableStructureChanged()</code> is executed and it resets the sizes back to default. </p>

<p>Not sure what is the intended logic there in that method (ie comment "<em>fixes a nasty java vector bug</em>"), but if you execute <code>fireTableStructureChanged()</code> and <code>fireTableDataChanged()</code> without <code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater</code> you should see the resized column. </p>

<p>Of course, you have to be on EDT, so if that fix is impossible you can execute column width setting using <code>SwingUtilities.invokeLater()</code>. </p>

<p>Also note, that columns start from 0. You mention that you resize column 0, but in fact in code you access column 1. </p>
