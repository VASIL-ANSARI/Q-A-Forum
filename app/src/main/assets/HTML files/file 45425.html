<p>We ended up adding two Views of 1dp to fake the divider and checking on version to set Visibility. The problem is worse. We also needed to keep track of if the next row is enabled or not, if it is the last row. A lot of cheese on an already deficient ListView (as compared to UITableView for example).</p>

<pre><code>if(isItemAvailable(item) || Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &lt; Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
    rowView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.size_row, parent, false);
} else {
    rowView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.size_row_with_divider, parent, false);
}
</code></pre>
