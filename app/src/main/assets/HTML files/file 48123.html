<p>Transforming any recursive algorithm into a non-recursive equivalent is simple.</p>

<p>When you perform a recursive call, what you're actually doing is pushing a set of arguments onto a stack. This stack is provided to you by the Python interpreter.</p>

<p>So, the way you rewrite the algorithm without recursion is... you manage the stack yourself! When you would make a recursive call, instead you take all the arguments you would have passed and push them onto your stack object. Then you have a "driver" loop that repeatedly pops off the stack and does the computation listed therein.</p>

<p>The signature of this type of program is that there's one stack object, which you prime with an initial state tuple/object, and then a <code>while len(stack) &gt; 0</code> loop that runs until you're finished.</p>

<p>You basically do just what the recursion would do, but when you manage the relevant data structures yourself it gives you a better opportunity for efficiency gains.</p>

<p>This particular type of transformation works for any algorithm. Others, specifically those involving carrying global state across different calls to the function(s) in question, are algorithm-dependent.</p>
