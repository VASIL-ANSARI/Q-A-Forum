<p>Frederic Hamidi commented first, but thought of including it as my answer since he didn't answer it.</p>

<p>Saw your edit. You are including jquery 1.9.1 where <code>.live()</code> is <em>removed</em>.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/on" rel="nofollow"><code>.on()</code></a> instead.</p>
