  <p>utils.getFactorTodp</p>

<p>does, but if you want to pass the function and not evaluate it, you must remove the parenthesis. So if <code>dp</code> is called later by the eventListener, replace <code>utils.getFactorTodp()</code> by <code>utils.getFactorTodp</code> </p>

<p>That way, you will reference to the function instead of trying to evaluate it.</p>
