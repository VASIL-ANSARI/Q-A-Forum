<p>consider the following pseudo-code for insertion sort:</p>

<pre><code>for i â 1 to length(A) - 1
    j â i
    while j &gt; 0 and A[j-1] &gt; A[j]
        swap A[j] and A[j-1]
        j â j - 1
    end while
end for
</code></pre>

<p>1) so, in the process, you hold each element and compare it with its previous element and swap if the previous element is greater than the current element and this keeps on happening till the condition doesn't satisfy.</p>

<p>2) the algorithm works by swapping element by element and not by inserting the element right at the place where it is supposed to be.note:-each swap is o(1).</p>

<p>3)hence, in this form, if you use a list, you have 2 operations to do, connect the predecessor and the current element and vice-versa along with the neighbouring elements. On the other hand, sorted array would take only one step.</p>

<p>4)therefore, in this approach, a sorted array makes more sense than a list.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, if the approach of insertion sort was directly inserting the current element at the place where it is fitting, a linked list would have worked better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note:- a sorted array or sorted linked list, the overall proces would be same, it is the intermediary steps that make the difference than the sorting.</p>
