<p>It depends on what you are trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>Generally, if you only want to verify that the data is coming from your app, pass the data along with a hash that verifies the data hasn't been tampered with.</p>

<p>If you are looking to literally encrypt data in the request, you should look into encryption and not hashing.</p>

<pre><code>$a = 2;
$b = 3;
$hash = sha1($salt.$a.$b)

$link = "http://www.domain.tld/?index.php?a=$a&amp;b=$b&amp;hash=$hash";
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>$a = $_GET['a'];
$b = $_GET['b'];

$hash = sha1($salt.$a.$b);

if ($_GET['hash'] == $hash) {
  //data ok
} else {
  // data has been tampered with
}
</code></pre>
