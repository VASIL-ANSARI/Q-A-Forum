<p>To return a result from an activity started by <code>startActivityForResult()</code>, call <code>setResult()</code>, supplying the <code>Intent</code> containing the "result". Usually, this is immediately followed by a call to <code>finish()</code>, so control returns to the activity that had called <code>startActivityForResult()</code>, so it can use the result.</p>
