<p>The simplest solution uses this markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="complete"&gt;
  &lt;div class="orange"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="blue"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You want <code>.complete</code> and <code>.blue</code> to be non-floating block elements, which will cause them to use up as much width as possible, but you also need <code>.orange</code> to float in order to be on the same line as <code>.blue</code> and prevent <code>.blue</code> from overlapping it by using a hidden overflow. </p>

<pre><code>.complete { overflow : hidden }
.orange   { float : left ; width : 100px }
.blue     { overflow : hidden } 
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to leave a small space between orange and blue, add a right margin to the orange box.</p>

<p>Note that with this solution, the blue and orange boxes will have different heights. If you have graphical effects (such as backgrounds) that require boxes to have the same height, you will need more clever CSS. </p>
