<p>For anyone interested, i have achieved this by creating a list of BitmapImage, and adding all image(s) to the list. Then i override OnMouseEnter and OnMouseLeave.</p>

<p>OnMouseEnter i started a timer if there are multiple images in the list. And on timer elapsed i updated the image source with the next image in the list. </p>

<p>When OnMouseLeave event occurs i reset the image source with the image at zero index of the list. Which is the main image.</p>

<p>I use INotifyPropertyChanged for binding image source with the property.</p>
