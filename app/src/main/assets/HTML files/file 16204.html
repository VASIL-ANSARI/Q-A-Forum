<p>I would suggest use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder%28v=vs.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>StringBuilder</code></a> instead of string for large strings, also is better to show your code to see if any other optimization is possible. e.g for reading/writing from/into files you can use buffers.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As I can see in your code biggest problem (with this code) is in this line:</p>

<pre><code>newText += char.ConvertFromUtf32(charValue);
</code></pre>

<p><code>String</code> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object" rel="nofollow">immutable</a> object, and by <code>+=</code> operator every time you will create a new instance of <code>newText</code> and when the length is big this causes to time and memory problems, so instead of <code>string</code> if you use <code>StringBuilder</code> this line of code will be as this:</p>

<pre><code>newText.Append(char.ConvertFromUtf32(charValue));
</code></pre>

<p>and this function will be run extremely faster. </p>
