<p>You can solve this in O(1) space. One solution is to iterate on the matrix, for each 0 you see, you fill the corresponding row/col with some character, 'X' for example.</p>

<p>When you finish, you should have something like that:</p>

<pre><code>    X 2 X
M=  0 X X
    X X 0
</code></pre>

<p>Then you iterate again on the matrix and replace each 'X' with 0 to get:</p>

<pre><code>    0 2 0
M=  0 0 0
    0 0 0
</code></pre>
