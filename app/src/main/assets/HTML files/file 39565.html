<p>The <code>dbf</code> library will only fetch the record from the dbf file if it doesn't already exist in memory; when you do</p>

<pre><code>updated = list(source)
</code></pre>

<p>you are effectively freezing all the rows because <code>updated</code> is a list of records (not a list of <code>list</code>s or a list of <code>tuple</code>s; this means that when you later try to compare <code>source</code> and <code>updated</code> you are comparing the same data.</p>

<p>In order to make <code>updated</code> be a separate entity from <code>source</code> try</p>

<pre><code>updated = [tuple(row) for row in source]
</code></pre>

<p>which will give you a list of tuples, or</p>

<pre><code>updated = [scatter(row, dict) for row in source]
</code></pre>

<p>which will give you a list of dicts, which is what you need for your field comparison code further down.</p>
