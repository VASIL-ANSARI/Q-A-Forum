<p>I believe your question can be answered by another <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10779563/custom-segue-animation">stackoverflow post</a></p>

<p>And from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/CreatingCustomSegues/CreatingCustomSegues.html" rel="nofollow">Apple</a></p>

<p>The key is to implement your own <code>- (void)perform</code> method. Before the <code>+ animateWithDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:</code> method, set the viewController.view.origin to be below the screen and in the animations block adjust it's height.</p>
