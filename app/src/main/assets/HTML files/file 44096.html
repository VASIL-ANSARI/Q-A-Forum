<p>I guess the answer to your question is this:
That attribute allows Durandal to keep track of where, relative to the <code>root</code> directory of the application are views located.
<code>data-view="views/shell"</code> basically lets Durandal know that the <code>shell.html</code> template(view) is located in the <code>views/</code> directory, and whenever something triggers a full application refresh, Durandal knows where to pull this exact view. The <code>shell</code> view basically means the outer shell of the web application.
Here are the logs when reloading the application/clicking on the Flickr tab:</p>

<pre><code>Debug:Enabled
Application:Starting
Plugin:Installed plugins/router
Plugin:Installed plugins/dialog
Application:Started
XHR finished loading: GET "http://localhost:8000/app/views/shell.html".

Binding views/welcome ctor {displayName: "Welcome to the Durandal Starter Kit!", description: "Durandal is a cross-device, cross-platform client â¦ Applications (SPAs) easy to create and maintain.", features: Array[11], __moduleId__: "viewmodels/welcome"}
</code></pre>

<p>See those "XHR finished loading" messages? That's where Durandal is loading the views by fetching their paths from <code>data-view</code> attributes.</p>

<p>Clicking on the "Flickr" tab gives us the following:</p>

<pre><code>Activating Object {displayName: "Flickr", images: function, activate: function, select: function, canDeactivate: functionâ¦}
Navigation Complete Object {displayName: "Flickr", images: function, activate: function, select: function, canDeactivate: functionâ¦} Object {fragment: "flickr", queryString: null, config: Object, params: Array[0], queryParams: null}
XHR finished loading: GET "http://localhost:8000/app/views/flickr.html".
Binding views/flickr Object {displayName: "Flickr", images: function, activate: function, select: function, canDeactivate: functionâ¦}
</code></pre>

<p>See, "XHR finished loading ...views/flickr.html" -- the <code>data-view</code> attribute being queried again for view path and the view being retrieved via AJAX.</p>

<p>Hope this clears things out for you.</p>
