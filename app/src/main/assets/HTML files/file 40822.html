<p>The reason your code wont compile is you havent included any standard time-related library
just include <strong>time.h</strong> or <strong>ctime</strong></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;time.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This header file contains definitions of functions to get and manipulate date and time information.</p>
