<p>If I understand your question correctly, you want "Voorraad" text box to be filled with a random number when there is a selection in the "Kies een product" list box correct?</p>

<p>If so, you don't need to use an inline js trigger to engage it. Here is a jquery script that will do the job for you:</p>

<pre><code>$('.medicijnen').change(function(){
    var stock = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 1;
    $('#medicijnen').val(stock);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also, here is the JSlint of the code working (note I had to change some of the text to understand what was going on) - <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/t2D6S/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/t2D6S/</a></p>

<p>Hopefully this should get you on the right path.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
So I was able to get the list to replicate, and I was also able to get the Stock to populate, however the stock only populates on the first one and not on any other one.</p>

<p>Here is the updated fiddle = <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/q8f4K/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/q8f4K/</a></p>

<p>Sorry I couldn't be of any more help. Maybe someone else can fix the last bit.</p>
