<p>Just some basics: Realm is WIF language for EntityID in metadata. It should be a URI. Which means that it doesn't have to be a URL. Almost all implementations are very tolerant and do accept any string in EntityID.<br/>
Returnurl in this case means the url where the browser will go after the user has been authenticated and WIF has set the session cookie. It should be within the app (why else authenticate). If you really do want the application root then the ending slash is a good idea indeed (because of cookiepath). So the usage of Realm (in this particular case) is a mistake.</p>
