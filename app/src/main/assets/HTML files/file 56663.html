<p>If you want to be able to query onto those special data fields choose option 2.</p>

<p>If you only want a storage for the data choose option 3. Depending on the possible size of the data I would create an extra table for it and depending on your version of mysql give the column the json-datatype, if you need the validation etc. <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html" rel="nofollow">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html</a>.</p>

<p>Do not use option 4, in comparison to json xml creates too much overhead and adds no benefit in this scenario.</p>
