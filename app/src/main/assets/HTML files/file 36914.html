<p>OpenCV doesn't reallocate a Mat unless it needs to.  A Mat is essentially a smart pointer to a buffer. If you push_back a Mat into a vector, that is like making a copy of the pointer to the same buffer. Then you reuse the buffer and the pointer in the vector is pointing to the new content!</p>

<p>You need to clone the Mat when you push it onto the vector:</p>

<pre><code>frameBuffer.push_back(currFrame.clone());
</code></pre>
