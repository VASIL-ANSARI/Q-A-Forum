<p>The structure is 16 times bigger, so it should take 16 times longer to iterate through. Mathematically 12,7/1,7 = 7,47 times more, so it almost matches up mathematically.</p>

<p>Now imagine the structure containing the 128B elements was a structure containing 8B elements, but the same size. Do you see now that it really is 16 times larger?</p>
