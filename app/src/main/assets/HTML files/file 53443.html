<p>There is no need to use <code>NSUserDefaults</code> as "bridge". ObjC can directly access swift classes, if they subclass <code>NSObject</code>.</p>

<p>Open Xcode target build settings, in search field, type <code>swift</code>. Find <code>Objective-C Generated Interface Header Name</code>. Commonly, it will have something <code>Project-Swift.h</code>. In ObjC code import this header, and your swift classes and functions will be available in ObjC. </p>
