<p>xor'ing hashcodes doesn't guarantee uniqueness, but is usually used to improve the distribution over a table without complicating the hashing. </p>

<p>You want to make 2 different values map to different hash keys if they differ in any of the fields (i.e. - same <code>ModelType</code>, but different <code>Perspective</code>, or vice versa). So you need to incorporate both values into your hash key. You could have used <code>+</code> for example, or shift and concatenate them (the latter would be better in fact, as it <strong>would</strong> guarantee uniqueness, but also extend the key length which might complicate hashing). </p>

<p>xor won't guarantee this uniqueness since if you flip the same bit in <code>ModelType</code> and <code>Perspective</code>, you'd get the same hash key, for example 5 ^ 7 = 1 ^ 3 = 2, but it's usually good enough. Eventually it all depends on the ranges and distributions of the values you provide.</p>
