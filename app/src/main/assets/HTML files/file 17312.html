<p>I don't know what the <code>takes</code> table looks like, but assuming you're assigning it correctly, your WHERE statement isn't providing a comparison operation. WHERE needs to result in a true or false result for any given returned row. So you need to join <code>student</code> in your initial query, and use where to compare the results.</p>

<p>Your question is missing information about both the <code>takes</code> and <code>student</code> tables, so it's not possible to rewrite your query correctly.</p>
