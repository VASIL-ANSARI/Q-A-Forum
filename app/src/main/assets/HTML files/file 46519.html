<p><code>new AbstractList&lt;Integer&gt;() { ... }</code> is not an abstract class. It is a subclass of the abstract type <code>AbstractList&lt;Integer&gt;</code>. That particular type implements almost all <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> methods in terms of just two abstract methods: <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> (<code>size</code> is also needed for some operations), whose implementation is provided by your example.</p>

<p>In particular, there was no need to call the <code>add</code> method because the provided implementation is a closure wrapping the supplied <code>int[]</code>. The <code>AbstractList</code>'s implementation of <code>iterator()</code> will internally delegate to the provided implementation of <code>get</code>.</p>
