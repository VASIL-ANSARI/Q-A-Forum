<p>The url Creation isn't working if you're getting "found nil while unwrapping"</p>

<p>Generally you should stay away from !s as much as possible and cast them with <code>if let</code> or <code>guard let</code>. In this case I'm not sure why it would be failing, but if you isolate the url creation you might be able to figure out the issue.</p>
