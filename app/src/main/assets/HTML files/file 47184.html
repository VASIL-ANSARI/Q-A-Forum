<p>The return type of WhenAll is a task whose result type is an array of the individual tasks' result type, in your case <code>Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;[]&gt;</code></p>

<p>When used in an await expression, the task will be "unwrapped" into its result type, meaning that the type of your "all" variable should be <code>List&lt;string&gt;[]</code></p>
