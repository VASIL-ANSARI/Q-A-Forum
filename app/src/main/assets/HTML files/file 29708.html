<p>The isn't such a thing as a nil array, the proper description is that it is an NSArray pointer that points to <code>nil</code> an empty array is an NSArray pointer that points to a valid NSArray object that has no members.</p>

<p>In the code you are talking about, fetched objects isn't set to nil, it is set to the result of the method call.  If the method call fails, then it returns nil, and populates the NSError parameter, if it succeeds it returns an array, which could be empty if no results are found.</p>
