<p><code>gdb out/target/product/msm8974/obj/EXECUTABLES/vold vold.core</code></p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that your binary <code>out/target/product/msm8974/obj/EXECUTABLES/vold</code> is exactly the same as <code>/system/bin/vold</code> on the target system that generated the core dump (modulo stripping -- if one binary is a stripped version of another, that's ok).</p></li>
