<p>For me, creating a numpy array of shape (SIZE,4) and dtype float32 worked fine when I ran opencl kernel. Be sure second dimension matches what kind of floatN you want, it won't throw any errors if they don't match but in my case it crashed graphics card driver.</p>

<p>The way I inited my arrays: <code>np.zeros((SIZE,4), dtype=np.float32)</code></p>

<p>Hope this helps anybody who is wondering the same.</p>
