<p>You can try to center your current <code>#border-search</code> inner <code>img</code> element with the following change in your CSS, <strong>relative</strong>ly positioning your image with automatic (and equal) left- and right-margins, and making it centered.</p>

<pre><code>#border-search {
    margin: 0 auto;
    position: relative;
}

#border-search img {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
    position: relative;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>display: block;</code> statement is needed for your image to be considered a block element so it can be affected by the margin attributes.</p>
