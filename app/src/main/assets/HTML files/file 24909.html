<p>In your UsersController include SessionsHelper, so that the function is accessible. </p>

<pre><code>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
include SessionsHelper
.......
end
</code></pre>

<p>Functions like signed_in? which are generally needed in many controllers, better to include helper in the application controller itself.</p>
