<p>Well, as for me, that was one of my first questions when I started learning Android. But hey, I'll try to explain you why everyone uses fragments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fragments are easier to manage with sidemenu. Why? Because if you would implement each menu item as <code>Activity</code> - you'll need to implement that "menu part" in every <code>Activity</code> from menu. Menu is bounded to <code>Activity</code> and <code>Fragment</code> is just a part of it - you can add fragment to <code>Activity</code> as simple as view in layout.xml.</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you need only Activities? Fragment have <code>getActivity()</code> method which will return you a parent <code>Activity</code>. You can implement your own layout for fragment on <code>onCreateView(...)</code> method of the Fragment. And in general, you can implement some kind of a public method in Activity and then call <code>((MyActivity)getActivity()).[your_method_name]()</code> to actually call your Activity method.</p></li>
<li><p>Difficulties are the part of learning, so don't be afraid to learn something new. If 90% people using Fragments then maybe there's a point of using them, just think about it;)</p></li>
</ol>
