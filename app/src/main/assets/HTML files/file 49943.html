<p>Using LTO results in the compiler making drastic adjustments to any functions for which is it able to see the complete callgraph.</p>

<p>What you are seeing is expected and using <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> or <code>extern</code> on the functions that need to be utilised from a separate module or explicitly declaring them as part of a DLL .def file is the expected way to resolve the problem as the compiler will no longer consider the functions to be internal-only.</p>
