<p>If the data from the server is not going to change then you should store them but if the data is changed then you can do two things</p>

<ol>
<li>On the server keep a last updated data date and depending on that always fetch that date from server, check if the last updated data is not obsolete if yes then fetch again or there is no need</li>
<li>Second approach is Store as cache and fetch every time you start your app</li>
</ol>
