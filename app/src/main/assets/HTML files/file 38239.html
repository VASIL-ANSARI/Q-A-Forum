<p>When you do</p>

<pre><code>import A
</code></pre>

<p>That brings in all of the exportable functions and variables from the file <code>A.py</code> in, but with the namespace prefix of <code>A</code></p>

<p>Assuming you don't want to do the import of numpy again in B (the normal option), your code then needs to be one of</p>

<pre><code>import A
y = A.numpy.array([4, 5, 6])
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>from A import *
</code></pre>

<p>The former gets <code>numpy</code> via A, with the prefix of A (since that's where it was first imported), the latter explicitly imports all the things from A without a new prefix. The downside of the latter is it can bring in the rest of the kitchen sink too, so isn't generally a good plan for complex modules.</p>

<p>Normally though, if B needs numpy, it would import that directly. If A is making some changes to a module that it then exports, you would normally expect to import and reference it explicitly, to flag up to everyone looking at the code later that you're not dealing with the regular version of the library.</p>
