  <p>I'm trying to understand exactly what the javascript new keyword means</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>a = new X()</code> means something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>create new object A</li>
<li>set its prototype to the object called X.prototype (all functions have a "prototype" property which is just an object and you can modify it to add behaviour to objects created using this function and <code>new</code>),</li>
<li>call X with this=a to initialize the object.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is similar to:</p>

<pre><code>a = Object.create(/* prototype */ X.prototype, {});
a.constructor = X; /* magic property which can be read after */
X.apply(/* this */ a, /* args */[]);
</code></pre>

<p>It isn't and you don't have to. <code>Object.create</code> works more naturally with JS prototype-based object model and lets you create arbitrary prototype chains. </p>

<p>When <code>new</code> is used, it's used like this:</p>

<pre><code>function Class(constructor_args) {
   // init an object
   this.a = 10;
};
Class.prototype.method1 = function() {
   console.log(this.a);
}
var obj = new Class();
</code></pre>

<p>Then after you create an object using <code>new Class()</code>, its prototype refers to the object <code>Class.prototype</code> which contains its methods while the object itself contains the fields.</p>

<p><em>(Personal opinion: The keyword <code>new</code> was introduced to make it easier in Javascript to write code which resembles Java/C++ and classical non-prototypal object model.)</em></p>
