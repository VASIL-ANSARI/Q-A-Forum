<p>You are correct in considering that keeping track of what userId goes with what username using two arrays is dangerous, you in the correct direction with your approach. </p>

<p>First, I would just like to suggest that you use correct naming convention:</p>

<ol>
<li>Classes should be singular (except in very specific cases).</li>
<li>Variable/property names should begin with lowercase.</li>
</ol>

<p>This would mean that your user class should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class User {   
  var username : NSString = ""
  var userId : NSString = ""
  var following : Bool = false
}
</code></pre>

<p>I will keep your existing naming use for the next part. The main problem with your code is that the variable "u" is a object which you create only once and then modify it. You should be creating a new "Users" object for each user instead of modifying the original. If you don't do this you will just have an array with the same user multiple times. This is how your code would look now:</p>

<pre><code>  var t = [Users]()

  for object in users {

     if let o = object as? PFUser {

        let u = Users()

        u.Username = o.username!
        u.UserId = o.objectId!
        u.Following = o.IsFollowing!

        self.t.append(u)

     }

  }

 print(self.t)
</code></pre>

<p>Next you mention that when you print to console you see the text: <code>ParseStarterProject_Swift.Users</code>, that is because Swift does not automatically print a pretty text with the content of your object. In order for it to print something more detailed, your "Users" object would need to implement the <code>CustomStringConvertible</code>. You can see a more detailed answer about that here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24068506/how-can-i-change-the-textual-representation-displayed-for-a-type-in-swift">how-can-i-change-the-textual-representation-displayed-for-a-type-in-swif</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, you mention that when you loop trough "t" and display the username in the console it does not display anything. This is caused by one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Because there are no users being returned from parse, so the "t" array is actually empty. Try <code>print(t.count)</code> to see how many objects are in the array.</li>
<li>Because your "Users" object declares an empty string "" as the default username and the username is not being set correctly when getting the data from the parse. Which means that it IS actually printing something, just that it is an empty string. Try defining a different default value like <code>var username : NSString = "Undefined"</code> to see if it prints something.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck learning swift!</p>
