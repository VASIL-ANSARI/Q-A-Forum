<p>It seems you would need to use the PrintWriter.
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2885173/java-how-to-create-and-write-to-a-file">Java: how to create and write to a file</a></p>

<p>reading the file you would use something like this</p>

<pre><code>String delims = "[ ]+";
Scanner fileScan = new Scanner(new File("theFileName"));

while(fileScan.hasNext()){
    String str = fileScan.nextLine();
    String[] tokens = str.split(delims);
  ...

//now your tokens[0] has username
// and tokens[1] has password
...//do something with it
}
</code></pre>
