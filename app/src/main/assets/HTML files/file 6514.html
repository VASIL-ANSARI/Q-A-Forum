<p>at the basic level, javac is the compiler; that will produce the .class files.  There is also a "jar" command that will regenerate your jar file.  Depending on the number of dependencies, that can get complicated quick.  You can just type "javac" and "jar" (w/o quotes) to get the args to run it.  Another option is to setup an ant build script...</p>

<p>so you could do something like (assuming windows OS):</p>

<p>javac -cp %MY_CLS_PTH% *.java<br>
  where MY_CLS_PTH is where any dependent classes are.  If you have a package structure, this gets a little more complicated.</p>

<p>jar -cvf .\my_class_dir MyJarFile.jar
  where my_class_dir is the directory that contains the .class files.</p>

<p>I think that is right (didn't run it myself) but that should be about the basics...</p>

<p>EDIT: There is a way to just add/re-add a single .class file to an existing jar file.  Check out the "jar" command's usage, looks like "-u" will update it (of course you have to pass in the .class file).  Also remember that any package structure you have in these classes, you need that directory structure and you reference the class via that dir structure. (Hope that is clear...)</p>
