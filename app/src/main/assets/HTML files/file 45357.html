<p>In order to deploy a portlet in WebSphere Portal you need the portlet descriptor (portlet.xml), your class with the @Controller annotation, and all your libraries in the classpath. Check your server log to find the reason for the message "this portlet is not available". WAS v8 have the file in this path: /opt/IBM/WebSphere/wp_profile/logs/WebSphere_Portal/SystemOut.log.</p>
