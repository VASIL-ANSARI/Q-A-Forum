<p>this</p>

<pre><code>switch (tileMap[row, col]) 
</code></pre>

<p>should be</p>

<pre><code>switch (tileMap[col, row])
</code></pre>

<p>as you use col for you x values and row for y. </p>

<p>You also need to switch this in your rectangle calculations.</p>

<p>Another hint for performance based on my experience  (as Andrew mentioned this may not be worthwhile in every case) instead of creating new rectangles every frame define 2 rectangles in you Tile class and just change the x and y values every frame</p>

<p>EDIT: Color Problem=============================</p>

<p>You can completly get rid of the switch case construct by using</p>

<pre><code>public void Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch)
        {
    for (int row = 0; row &lt; tileMap.GetLength(1); row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col &lt; tileMap.GetLength(0); col++)
            {
                        spriteBatch.Draw(_texture, new Rectangle(row * _tW, col * _tH, _tW, _tH), new Rectangle(tileMap[row, col] * _tW, tileMap[row, col] * _tH, _tW, _tH), Color.White);
            }
        }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Note: _tH=_tileHeight, _tW=_tileWidth
I tested this out and it worked like a charm for me ;) 
If you want to keep the switch case make sure you set Color.White as your tinting color (last spritebatch parameter). And you need to correct the values of the switch case, as you use 0 and 2 in your map definition, but 0 and 1 in your switch case. Expanding the cases up to 3 (as it seems you have 4 tiles by now) also worked for me. </p>

<p>So I think your issue was based on the wrong color and a typo in the case structure.</p>

<p>Hope this helps :) </p>
