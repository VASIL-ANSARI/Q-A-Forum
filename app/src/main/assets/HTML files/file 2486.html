<p>Internet Explorer's legacy/proprietary DirectX opacity filters disable ClearType when you use them (because otherwise the text is completely corrupted). IE8 and below do not support CSS opacity, and hence there's no solid workaround. Typically, for IE, you'll want to remove the Filter when rendering the text for reading so that ClearType works properly.</p>
