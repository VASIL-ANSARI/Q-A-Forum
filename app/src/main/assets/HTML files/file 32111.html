<p>Don't try to change the bytes in your file.  Make a new file, copy the lines over until you find the one you want to replace, output your new line, then output the rest of your lines.  Because unless you're replacing one string, with another string with exactly the same number of characters, you're going to be overriding the next line in your file - and there's no good way to avoid that.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can then delete the original file, and rename your new file to that name.</p>
