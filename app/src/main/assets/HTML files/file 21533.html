<pre><code>_fvc = [[FirstViewController alloc]init];
[_fvc setMypDelegate:self];
</code></pre>

<p>You're setting the delegate to a completely new <code>FirstViewController</code>, but not the one who trigger your method <code>- (IBAction)button1Tap:(id)sender</code></p>

<p>You have to pass your delegate when you're doing the transition between your 2 view controllers, for example in <code>- prepareForSegue:</code> or when you doing <code>[self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES]</code></p>
