<p>Since you only have two possible types, I'd use a union for this sort of thing, like so:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct Bullet {
    enum ShipType owner_type;
    union {
        SHIP *ship;
        UFO *ufo;
    } owner;
} BULLET;

/* and then... */

void hit_asteroid(ASTEROID *ast, BULLET *bullet)
{
    SHIP *ship_owner;
    if (bullet-&gt;owner_type == SHIP_PLAYER &amp;&amp; bullet-&gt;owner.ship != NULL) {
        ship_owner = bullet-&gt;owner.ship;
        ship_owner-&gt;score += 1000;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I didn't use the pointer-to-a-pointer scheme that you used. I'm not really convinced of the necessity of it, and the code I suggested doesn't require such a technique.</p>
