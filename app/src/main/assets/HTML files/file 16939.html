<p>Your best bet is to use an existing matrix library. Check out ILNumerics, for example. It supports many common matrix decompositions (there is no one 'matrix decomposition'): <a href="http://ilnumerics.net/%24FeatureList.html" rel="nofollow">http://ilnumerics.net/$FeatureList.html</a></p>

<p>That's a commercial license, but because you are selling your engine, maybe it won't be a problem for you. </p>

<p>A free one is <a href="http://mathnetnumerics.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Linear%20Algebra&amp;referringTitle=Documentation" rel="nofollow">Math.NET</a>, but the 'Decompositions &amp; Least Squares Problems' section is empty which leads me to believe that they haven't implemented it yet.</p>
