<p>There's a very large degree of ambiguity with such operations. Suppose that case instead:</p>

<pre><code>a = '4'
b = 1
print(a + b)
</code></pre>

<p>It's not clear if <code>a</code> should be coerced to an integer (resulting in <code>5</code>), or if <code>b</code> should be coerced to a string (resulting in <code>'41'</code>). Since type juggling rules are transitive, passing a numeric string to a function expecting numbers could get you in trouble, especially since almost all arithmetic operators have overloaded operations for strings too.</p>

<p>For instance, in Javascript, to make sure you deal with integers and not strings, a common practice is to multiply a variable by one; in Python, the multiplication operator repeats strings, so <code>'41' * 1</code> is a no-op. It's probably better to just ask the developer to clarify.</p>
