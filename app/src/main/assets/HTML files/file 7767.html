<p>I believe your assumption that the app is "starting up with Super User permissions" is flawed.  The app itself is running inside the Dalvik VM, which implies that it cannot possess superuser permissions.  Whatever application you launch using the "su" command, <em>can</em> possess root permissions, and therefore can open ports &lt;1024.  But the Android application itself <em>cannot</em>.  See AOSP <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=4039" rel="nofollow">issue 4039</a> for discussion on the matter, and to place your vote for the Dalvik VM to gain this support.</p>

<p>If all you want to do is start an NTP server, you may be better off packaging ntpd with your application, and launch it via <code>su</code>.  Alternatively, you could try starting your Java NTP server on a non-standard port, and use a command-line utility (e.g., netcat) to "proxy" the protected port 123 into your non-standard (>=1024) port..  Something like:  <code>nc -l -u localhost 123 | nc -u localhost 1123</code> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat#Proxying" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
