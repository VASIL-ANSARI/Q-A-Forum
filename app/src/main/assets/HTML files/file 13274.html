<p>In RedBeanPHP versions older than 3 you can use an optimizer: <a href="http://www.redbeanphp.com/extra/optimizer" rel="nofollow">http://www.redbeanphp.com/extra/optimizer</a> It basically changes columns afterwards if possible.</p>

<p>You have to attach the optimizer yourself as a listener. Because I have seen people struggle with this I removed this system and replaced it for a more native approach. You can now just assign SQL formatted date or date-time values and the column will be created using the right data type. However if the column has already been used to store other data, the column will not change (this is to preserve the data already in the column).</p>
