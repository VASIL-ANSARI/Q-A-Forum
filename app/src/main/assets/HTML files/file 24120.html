  <p>And I want to redirect it to a server but with a specific header</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, you should realize what is the difference between HTTP <em>Response</em> Headers and HTTP <em>Request</em> Headers.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>header("Content-Type: image/png");
header("Location: http://www.someotherserver.com/image.png");
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are both <em>Response</em> headers that <em>your server</em> sends to the <em>client</em>.</p>

<p>Since you are instructing the client with the location header to request a new resource, the Content-Type header will be thrown away by the client - nothing to display in response to that request before following the redirect, so content type of no interest.</p>

<p>The client makes a new request to the (other) server in the location header - so any additional <em>request</em> headers for that request have to come from the client. Your server has no way of influencing what additional headers the client might send with that request. (Unless you write your own client, that passes received response headers on with his next request.)</p>
