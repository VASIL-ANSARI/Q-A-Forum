<p>"500 - Internal server error" error message when a user tries to access your Apache or Lighttpd based dynamic php application 
Generally, to solve this problem you need to take help of log files located at following location:
=> /var/log/message
=> /var/log/httpd/error_logs (/var/log/lighttpd/error_log or /var/log/httpd/error_log)
This error only occurs because of web server software. However after looking through logs you may not find many details. This problem may be caused by:</p>

<p>A malformed php cgi script
An invalid directive in an .htaccess or other config file
Limitation imposed by file system and server software (for example php log file size set to 10Mb)
Missing php.ini (or cannot read php.ini file)</p>
