<p>When the user presses <code>r</code>, you need to reset your gamestate variables i.e. <code>gameOver = False</code> and <code>gameExit = False</code> (second one not really needed although it helps in clean exit of the game).</p>

<pre><code>if event.key == pygame.K_r:
    gameOver = False
    gameExit = False
    reset_vars()
    gameLoop()
</code></pre>
