<p>So, you don't need jQuery for this.  CSS will take care of it.</p>

<p>Your first problem with width can be solved by adding <code>width:inherit;</code> to <code>#navigation.stick</code> which will apply the width of the parent (in this case the header at 960px) to the element.</p>

<p>The next problem is that the logo pushes the navigation over.  No problem, add this CSS:</p>

<pre><code>#logo{
    position:absolute;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will break it from the flow of the page and allow the navigation to move to the left.</p>

<p>Finally for centering.  You'll need some extra changes.</p>

<pre><code>#navigation.stick{
    text-align:center;
}

#navigation.stick &gt; div{
    float:none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem now will be that the slider effect over the menu might be broken because the menu is moving around but that'll be more involved to fix.</p>
