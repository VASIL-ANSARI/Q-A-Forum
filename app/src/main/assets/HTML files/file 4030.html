<p>I've ran this code in Firefox, IE,Chrome and they all caught the error so I assume you mean catch the miss spelling. The reason it wasn't caught is because standard JavaScript is not statically validated like languages such as C#. When the code is executed the name <code>XMLHdfattpRequest</code> has to be checked for in the surrounding lexical scope. If it isn't found it becomes an unresolvable reference. When you try to new up an unresolvable reference that is when a reference error occurs.</p>
