<p>A TIMESTAMP column is only updated automatically if the value of some other column changes. If you set MOD_EID to the same value as it already had, the TIMESTAMP won't be updated. I don't know why it used to work for you, here's what the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/timestamp-initialization.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the column is auto-updated, it is automatically updated to the
  current timestamp when the value of any other column in the row is
  changed from its current value. The column remains unchanged if all
  other columns are set to their current values. To prevent the column
  from updating when other columns change, explicitly set it to its
  current value. To update the column even when other columns do not
  change, explicitly set it to the value it should have (for example,
  set it to <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_current-timestamp" rel="nofollow">CURRENT_TIMESTAMP</a>).</p>
