<p>You can't. The closest you could come would be:</p>

<pre><code>[Obsolete(IsError=true)]
public new ComboBoxItemCollection Items
{
    get { return base.Items; } // Or throw an exception
}
</code></pre>

<p>Personally I'd be tempted to ask whether you should really be deriving from this if you don't want all the members though... can you use composition instead?</p>
