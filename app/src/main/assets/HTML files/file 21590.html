<p>Well once you get the result in the success callback of window.plugins.speechrecognizer.startRecognize you would use that as the the filter parameter for the contacts.find method:</p>

<pre><code>var options = new ContactFindOptions();
    options.filter=speechResult; 
    options.multiple
    var fields = ["displayName", "name", "phoneNumbers"];
    navigator.contacts.find(fields, onSuccess, onError, options);
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the onSuccess you need to get the phone number, you'll have to decide which of the multiple phone numbers the contact may have in order to use it. I'm just going to assume the first for this answer. Then you set document.location to a "tel:" url to make the call.</p>

<pre><code>function onSuccess(contacts) {
    if (contacts.length == 1) {
        if (contacts[0].phoneNumbers != null) {
            document.location = "tel:" + contacts[0].phoneNumbers[0];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should about do it.</p>
