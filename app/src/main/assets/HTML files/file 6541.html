<p>There isn't a standard.  It's more of personal preference.  Different frameworks do it in different ways, but I prefer to have my base font size at 13px and just use pixel values for anything that differs.  It used to be that you should use a fluid unit such as EMs because <em>some particular browsers</em> would not resize text with px values, but I dont think it should be any concern at this point in time.</p>
