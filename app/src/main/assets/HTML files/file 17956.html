<p>Since you are using content providers, according to the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider.html#onCreate%28%29" rel="nofollow">documentation</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This method is called for all registered content providers on the
  application main thread at application launch time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the way you try to use the content provider is seems wrong and,
You don't need to manually instantiate the content provider, once you made the request via the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver.html" rel="nofollow">ContentResolver</a> by passing the URI, the system inspects the authority of the given URI and passes the request to the content provider registered with the authority.</p>

<p>for example</p>

<pre><code>getContentResolver().delete(uri, null, null);
</code></pre>

<p>Where the uri is, the full URI to query.</p>
