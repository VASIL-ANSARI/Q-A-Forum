<p>I see what you mean, if <code>self::$DB_Open</code> DOES exist it sets it to null and creates a new instance of the object anyway.</p>

<p>Appears you are right and this does not seem like the singleton pattern. </p>

<p>Regarding singleton pattern with static properties. Unlike instance variables which are in the <strong>objects scope</strong>, static variables are in <strong>class scope</strong>. <br/>
What this means is that even if you create an object multiple times it will still use the same value for the static property every time. It's what allows them to be great for counters and therefore global singletons.</p>

<p>See the below:</p>

<pre><code>Class A {
static int y=1;
int x=3;
}
$newA = new A();
$newB = new A();
$newC = new A();
</code></pre>

<p>The above creates 3 instances of x. You can make a change in 1 instance and it will only make changes in that 1 Instance.<br/>
But only 1 instance of y is created. So a change in 1 and all 3 will change. They all exist in same context. Therefore point to the same value. If you increment one the others will display the same increment ect..</p>

<p>So to re-iterate, even though only a single instance of <code>DB_Conn</code> does exist it continually resets it and writes to it again (it does not have to act like this). </p>

<p>To fix the problem the author could return the <code>self::$DB_Open</code> property if it does exist.</p>
