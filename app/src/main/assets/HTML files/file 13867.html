<p>You can define y-axis to be positive, then it shouldn't overlap with your header:</p>

<pre><code>box-shadow:0px 5px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, it's then a bit longer on bottom than on sides, but making the box shadow more subtle (like <code>box-shadow:0px 5px 7px rgba(32,32,32,0.5)</code>) would maybe work better.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> z-index (like Lollero suggested) for #nav is probably better way than this.</p>
