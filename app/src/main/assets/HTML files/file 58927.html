<p>That's because of this part: <code>\d.\w+</code></p>

<p>The corresponding part for the other number is <code>\w+.\w+</code></p>

<p><code>24</code> (from the <code>24.000G</code> substring) does not fit the <code>\d</code>, so you either should use <code>\d+</code> or <code>\w+</code>.</p>

<p>Another note, in this excerpt it you want to use the dot literal as-is, you need to escape it as <code>\.</code>, since otherwise it matches <code>any character</code>.</p>

<p>How I found your problem: I opened it on <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow">https://regex101.com/</a> and removed the parts from the regular expression until it matched, then it was immediately obvious.</p>
