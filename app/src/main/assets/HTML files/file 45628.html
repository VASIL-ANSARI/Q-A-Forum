<p>A couple solutions:</p>

<p>Change the line <code>n.sq</code> to <code>n = n.sq</code> since the get method returns a value based on self and doesn't really mutate it. </p>

<p>If you want to just use a method in the way you currently are, write it within the extension like this:</p>

<pre><code>mutating func sq() {
    self = self * self
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can call  <code>n.sq()</code> and it will do what you're wanting</p>
