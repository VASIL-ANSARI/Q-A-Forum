<p>I'm guessing the wsdl emitted by or supplied with the service is not in a form that wsdl.exe or serviceutil can understand - can you post the wsdl or link to it?</p>

<p>how are you creating the proxy classes?</p>

<p>Also you might like to try and validate the wsdl against the wsdl schema to check its valid</p>
