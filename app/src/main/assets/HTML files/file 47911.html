<p>You're trying to instantiate the adapter which has this constructor</p>

<pre><code>public CustomListViewAdapter(ArrayList&lt;Item&gt; item, int ResourceId, Activity context)
</code></pre>

<p>although you're calling it like this</p>

<pre><code>adapter = new CustomListViewAdapter(this,item);
</code></pre>

<p>problem: the arguments don't match</p>

<p>It should be something like </p>

<pre><code>adapter = new CustomListViewAdapter(item, R.layout.list_row, this);
</code></pre>

<p>note that list_row is something I made up and should be an actual layout file in your app or in the android sdk</p>
