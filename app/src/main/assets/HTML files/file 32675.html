<p>I would think that your easiest method, would be to change the definition of your EntitySet in your StorageModel to tell it to regard it as a table, as opposed to a database-view.</p>

<p>Looking at the XML definition, where it says</p>

<pre><code>&lt;EntitySet Name="Products" store:Type="Views" ..
</code></pre>

<p>you change that to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;EntitySet Name="Products" store:Type="Tables" ..
</code></pre>

<p>(Note the "Products" is just an example)
This should be in your .edmx file.<br>
See pg 44, Lerman, "Programming Entity Framework", 2nd Ed.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
