<p><code>MediaExtractor</code> is a module that implements container or file-format parsing of a multiplexed data. In a file there will be multiple <code>track</code>s which correspond to specific data like <code>video</code> or <code>audio</code>. Similarly, in a <code>MP3</code> file, there could be multiple tracks which are identified by their index. The index in the function corresponds to a specific <code>track</code> of interest.</p>

<p>Now, why is this function required? Since <code>MP3Extractor</code> is another extractor in the framework, it has to support this function, the reason for which follows. Let's consider the <code>player</code> as an example. <code>AwesomePlayer</code> is a player engine which sets up the entire pipeline.</p>

<p>In this process, the player engine would setup the extractor first and then try to create a down-stream component like a <code>decoder</code> to consume the data. The <code>decoder</code> is specific to a track which is identified by the <code>index</code>. To create a <code>decoder</code>, one requires to know the characteristics of the data which is represented or captured in <code>meta</code> i.e. metadata which will be employed to create and initialize the down-stream component. </p>
