<p>You can also do this using something like:</p>

<pre><code>char *string = NULL;

printf("%s", string);
</code></pre>

<p>Many implementations of <code>printf()</code> will print <code>(null)</code> or something similar when passed a <code>NULL</code> pointer to <code>%s</code>. But they don't have to do that (it's not required by the standard).</p>
