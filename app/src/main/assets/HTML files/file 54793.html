<p>Here're some thoughts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>ASP.NET Core 1 requires DNX bootstrap to work. Yes, it works under .NET 4.5.2 but DNX is a must. So basically it's strange you can reference ASP.NET Core 1 libraries in .csproj net451.</p></li>
<li><p>DNX bootstrap libraries are not available under Nuget for net451 moniker. So you can't reference them from .csproj</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That means you can't DEBUG ASP.NET Core 1 using traditional .csproj class library or executable approach. Of course you can always connect to a running app but that's not convenient.</p>

<p>So our team now is working with DNX bootstrap for NET CORE 1 but we deliver outputs from .csproj build until RC2 release.</p>
