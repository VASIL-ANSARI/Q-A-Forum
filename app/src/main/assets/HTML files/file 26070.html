<p>This was solved by using a version older than 1.8.3 of jquery or adding the migrate file provided by the jquery camp on versions higher. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>jQuery Migrate plugin
  We have created the jQuery Migrate plugin to simplify the transition from older versions of jQuery. The plugin restores deprecated features and behaviors so that older code will still run properly on jQuery 1.9 and later. Use the uncompressed development version to diagnose compatiblity issues, it will generate warnings on the console that you can use to identify and fix problems. Use the compressed production version to simply fix compatibility issues without generating console warnings.</p>
