<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo.redirectstandardoutput.aspx">documentation for RedirectStandardOutput</a> describes not one, but two possible deadlock scenarios (how's that for a useful and non-dangerous class library?!)</p>

<p>One occurs when both StandardOutput and StandardError are both redirected, and when the stream being read is full. This seems to perfectly describe your situation.</p>

<p>A pretty annoying situation, but read the full documentation and they describe how to avoid it occurring.</p>
