<p>All pages that the user has navigated to will be added to the dom. See <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-links.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>. However jQM also has <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-cache.html" rel="nofollow">a mechanism</a> to keep the DOM from getting to big and slowing down the browser. It may or may not remove old elements from the DOM.
I would advice you not to trust on DOM elements getting removed automatically. If you really want to remove the page you are navigating away from, you can bind for example the following:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).one("pageshow",function(){
     $(document).one("pagehide",function(){
          $("#pageId").remove();
     });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Where pageId is the id you give to the <code>&lt;div data-role="page" id="pageId"&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Edit for the updated question:
To reload the whole page when following links:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Links that point to other domains or that have rel="external",
  data-ajax="false" or target attributes will not be loaded with Ajax.
  Instead, these links will cause a full page refresh with no animated
  transition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or you can change it with the <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html" rel="nofollow">following global variable</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false;
</code></pre>
