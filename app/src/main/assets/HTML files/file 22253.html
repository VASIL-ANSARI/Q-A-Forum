<p>Netbeans is right. If you think it can be null: remove the annotation. If you know it can't: remove the assert.</p>

<p>If there's ANY chance that your method could be called with a null value, then <code>@Nonnull</code> annotation shouldn't be there.</p>

<p>Like you said, that annotation doesn't actually do anything at runtime: it is only used by IDEs and static code analysis tools. It doesn't ensure that things aren't null. </p>
