<p>PHP goes here for the first occurrence of <code>]</code>, since you have an array, as you can see in the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php" rel="nofollow">manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similarly, an <strong>array index or an object property can be parsed</strong>. With array indices, the <strong>closing square bracket (]) marks the end of the index</strong>. The same rules apply to object properties as to simple variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means the end is the first index, e.g.</p>

<pre>echo "Citation: <b>$</b>names[1<b>]</b>[1987]".PHP_EOL;
              //^ Start ^ End
</pre>

<p>So that means your "second dimension" is just parsed as a normal string. So for more complex structures you have to use the complex syntax to mark the start and the end of your variable, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>echo "Citation: {$names[1][1987]}".PHP_EOL;
              //^ See here      ^
</code></pre>

<p>So this will give you the warning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice:  Uninitialized string offset: 1987 </p>
</blockquote>
