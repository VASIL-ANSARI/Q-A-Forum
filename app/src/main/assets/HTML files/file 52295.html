<p>If you are storing images in the document directory store only image name in the db </p>

<p>At the time of retrieval append the current document directory path with your image name like you done at save time </p>

<pre><code>let documentDirectory = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(.DocumentDirectory, .UserDomainMask, true).first! as String

//let localPath = documentDirectory.stringByAppendingPathComponent(imageName!)
//imageName which you have stored in the db at retrieval time
let imagePath = String("\(documentDirectory)/\(imageName!)")

let url = NSURL(string:imagePath)
let imageData = NSData(contentsOfURL:url)!
</code></pre>

<p>as i have also this type of issue at last if found that the app number of simulator(838FB5A1-4448-46C9-8BEC-2E939668B97D) is changes which cause the issue</p>

<p>Hope this may solve your issue  </p>
