<p>You have not set "title" to anything yet. You have only declared it to exist.
title is set in show() which is called after the constructor.
You need to do </p>

<pre><code>title = new Texture ("BGASTRO.png");
</code></pre>

<p>BEFORE you try to get the height of the texture. This goes for all other variables too, make sure they are set to something before using them.</p>

<p>Also, you should remove </p>

<pre><code> Gdx.gl.glClearColor(1,0,0,1);
 Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
 batch.begin();
</code></pre>

<p>from you render() in NinjaAssault class. It is unnecessary and if you call</p>

<pre><code>batch.begin()
</code></pre>

<p>you need to call </p>

<pre><code>batch.end()
</code></pre>

<p>too, but in this case its never used anyway so no need for it at all.</p>
