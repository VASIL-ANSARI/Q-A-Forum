<p>This question is pretty subjective and depends on many factors that can't be shown here. If the question was will a DataSet consume more memory than a generic collection of the same number of objects then the answer is generally yes. </p>

<p>Since the question is how much it's going to depend on the specifics of how you are using the DataSet (ie: typed data, DataViews?, indexes?) and only accurately measured through testing.</p>

<p>However, depending on how you are using the DataSets you might have to rebuild much of that functionality.</p>
