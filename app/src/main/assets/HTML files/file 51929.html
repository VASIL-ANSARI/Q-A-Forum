<p>Could you give more detail around what parts are html related. i.e the normal usage of [AllowHtml] </p>

<p><strong>AllowHtmlAttribute Class</strong></p>

<p>From mircosoft</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allows a request to include HTML markup during model binding by
  skipping request validation for the property. (It is strongly
  recommended that your application explicitly check all models where
  you disable request validation in order to prevent script exploits.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can not see what datatables have to do with [AllowHtml]</p>
