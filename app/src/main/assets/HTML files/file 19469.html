<p>Basically, content encoding error means the response was corrupted in some way, so it couldn't be rendered. IT could've been issue with just one browser, but since you're getting this with curl:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HTTP/1.0 500 Internal Server Error</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it  means that this is no browser issue, something has gone awry on the server side. You <strong>need</strong> server logs, especially error logs, to diagnoze this further. <em>Something</em> has happened on the server side, but the information presented doesn't even hint as to what would that be.</p>
