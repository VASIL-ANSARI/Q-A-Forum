<p>Ok, you're doing this in a loop, but all three checks have <code>i==1</code> so that means you'll only go into one of these blocks one time. (when <code>i</code> is 1).</p>

<p>Normally when you have the same check (logically AND'd) in an entire <code>if</code>/<code>else if</code> conditional block you can just pull it out of the block:</p>

<pre><code>if (i == 1){
   //do all the other checks
}
</code></pre>

<p>But think about if that's what you really want to do... based on your description of what you're trying to solve, I don't think you need to check for <code>i</code> at all.
<br>If you read what you wrote in this SO question the code actually emerges from that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if TextA has nothing in it then write word to TextA<br>
  if TextA does have something in it, write word to TextB<br>
  And if TextB has something in it, set TextC to word</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the code that follows that logic:</p>

<pre><code>if (strlen(TextA) == 0)       // if TextA has nothing in it,
    strcpy(TextA, word);      // then write word to TextA
else if (strlen(TextB) == 0)  // else (if TextB doesn't have anything in it)
    strcpy(TextB, word);      // write word to TextB
else                          // if TextA and TextB already have something
    strcpy(TextC, word);      // then write word to TextC
</code></pre>
