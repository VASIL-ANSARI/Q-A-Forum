<p>I ran some proof-of-concept apps using each of the above options. I ran numbers and bench-maked it against our existing solution (SQLCipher).
Looks like using core data with incremental store (<code>encrypted-core-data</code>) came out to be the best.</p>

<p>After analyzing runtime performance times for read, write and search on DB with small and large sizes, <code>encrypted-core-data</code> turned out to be the most efficient and simpler to implement.</p>
