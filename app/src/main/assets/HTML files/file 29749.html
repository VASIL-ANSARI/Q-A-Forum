<p>Seems like your DLL is a managed DLL (built on .net) since you said that you hardly do any Win32 API programming.</p>

<p>One solution is to install your DLL in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yf1d93sz%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">GAC</a>. Then every time you update the DLL assembly version and deploy to GAC, you have to redirect your applications to use the latest one. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7wd6ex19%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">See this</a>.</p>
