<p>Sounds like something like this would work. By using an <code>INNER JOIN</code> with <code>SELECT *</code>, you can compare the records side-by-side.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM [Table] A
    INNER JOIN [Table] B
        ON A.CCID = B.CCID
            AND A.SortOrder = B.SortOrder
            AND A.PackageBoxTypeId &lt;&gt; B.PackageBoxTypeId
</code></pre>

<p>However, if you just need a pure list of the records instead of a side-by-side comparison, you can use a correlated sub-query with <code>EXISTS</code> or <code>IN</code> as @gmiley points out in the comments. I chose <code>EXISTS</code> as an example since I don't know if your <code>PackageBoxTypeId</code> has NULL values, but I steer away from <code>IN</code> when there are NULL columns.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM [Table] A
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM [Table]
    WHERE CCID = A.CCID
        AND SortOrder = A.SortOrder
        AND PackageBoxTypeId &lt;&gt; A.PackageBoxTypeId
)
</code></pre>
