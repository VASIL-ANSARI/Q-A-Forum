<p>You can do the following</p>

<p>in the image properties on the report</p>

<ol>
<li>Image Source : Embedded</li>
<li>click import button and load the image </li>
</ol>

<p>in this way, the RDLC will save the image as base64 inside of the file rdlc, you can view by open with xml editor from the solution explorer pane, and no need to worry about the location of the image.</p>

<p>another way if you want to load the image from the database for example, you can do the following</p>

<ol>
<li>Image Source: Database</li>
<li>Use this field: [YourPropertyName]</li>
<li>Use this MIME type: image/jpeg</li>
<li>in the report dataset, add a byte[] column or property called YourPropertyName</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Last Note</strong>, if the logo is common in all the reports you have, its recommended to add subreport called header that contains this logo and you put it in each report you have, this way if you want to change the logo later, you only need to change it in that header subreport.</p>

<p>you can view this <a href="http://screencast.com/t/T1ixvRWa" rel="nofollow">demo</a> I prepared to show you how to achieve this ( to add a header report to your current report) </p>

<p>hope this will help you</p>
