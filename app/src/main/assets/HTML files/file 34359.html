<p>All you need to do is reduce the width of your right div and it will slide up to be side by side. I think you have a few other things you should probably rework to work well responsively. But anyways the problem is there isn't space for both divs to fit side by side currently. So you can fix it by reducing margin or reducing width.</p>

<p>Edit:
I'm definitely not into magic numbers, but as CodeMonkeyG said, there is a difference between magic numbers and mathematics. You could however use the css calc to calculate the difference. So for example: you would have the percentage be the fluid width and the 80px be what ever your fix margin and padding would equal. </p>

<pre><code>width: calc(100% - 80px);
</code></pre>

<p>You can also choose to do percentage based margins and padding if you so desire. Calc is probably going to give you better control though. Unless you plan on continuing with some media queries. </p>
