<p>I think you cannot do it that way for select tag.</p>

<p>As stated in W3 School <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_select_multiple.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_select_multiple.asp</a></p>

<p>Selecting multiple options vary in different operating systems and browsers:</p>

<p><strong>For windows</strong>: 
Hold down the control (ctrl) button to select multiple options</p>

<p><strong>For Mac</strong>: Hold down the command button to select multiple options</p>

<p>Because of the different ways of doing this, and because <strong>you have to inform the user that multiple selection is available</strong>, it is more user-friendly to use checkboxes instead.</p>

<p>Unless you will build a hard-coded jquery for that function.</p>
