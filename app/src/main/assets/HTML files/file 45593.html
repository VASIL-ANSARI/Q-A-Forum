<p>Looks like what you want to do is to replace each of the values with the one that appears in the replacement table, but you have three separate columns, and each of those three values will have a different corresponding entry in the replacement table.  So you will have to link to that table three different times, once for each value, to link to its replacement, something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  b.Pos,
  b.Posten,
  IsNull(c.Wert_Neu, b.Bez1) AS Bez1,
  IsNull(d.Wert_Neu, b.Bez2) AS Bez2,
  IsNull(e.Wert_Neu, b.Bez3) AS Bez3,
  b.Wert,
  b.Einheit
FROM
  Table_Values b 
  LEFT JOIN Table_Replacements c on b.bez1=c.wert_alt
  LEFT JOIN Table_Replacements d on b.bez2=d.wert_alt
  LEFT JOIN Table_Replacements e on b.bez3=e.wert_alt
</code></pre>

<p>It will be important that your replacement table have an index on wert_alt so that those links can be done efficiently.<p>
Another possibility is to actually store the replacement values in your main data table.  So the fields in it would be:</p>

<pre><code>bez1
bez1Replacement
bez2
bez2Replacement
...
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe have a trigger on the table so that on any insert or update, the trigger looks up each of the three replacement values from the replacement table and adds them to the main data record.  That would not be exactly normalized, but it would speed up your query.  But, you may not need to do that at all.  The above query is probably efficient enough if you do have that index.</p>
