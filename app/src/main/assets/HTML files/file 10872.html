<pre><code>/^[^'"=]*/
</code></pre>

<p>would work on your examples. It matches any number of characters (starting at the start of the string) that are neither quotes nor equals signs.</p>

<pre><code>/^[^'"=\s]*/
</code></pre>

<p>additionally avoids matching whitespace which may or may not be what you need.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>You're asking how to match letters (and possibly dots?) outside of quoted sections anywhere in the text. This is more complicated. A regex that can correctly identify whether it's currently outside of a quoted string (by making sure that the number of quotes, excluding escaped quotes and nested quotes, is even) looks like this as a PHP regex:</p>

<pre><code>'/(?:
 (?=      # Assert even number of (relevant) single quotes, looking ahead:
  (?:
   (?:\\\\.|"(?:\\\\.|[^"\\\\])*"|[^\\\\\'"])*
   \'
   (?:\\\\.|"(?:\\\\.|[^"\'\\\\])*"|[^\\\\\'])*
   \'
  )*
  (?:\\\\.|"(?:\\\\.|[^"\\\\])*"|[^\\\\\'])*
  $
 )
 (?=      # Assert even number of (relevant) double quotes, looking ahead:
  (?:
   (?:\\\\.|\'(?:\\\\.|[^\'\\\\])*\'|[^\\\\\'"])*
   "
   (?:\\\\.|\'(?:\\\\.|[^\'"\\\\])*\'|[^\\\\"])*
   "
  )*
  (?:\\\\.|\'(?:\\\\.|[^\'\\\\])*\'|[^\\\\"])*
  $
 )
 ([A-Za-z.]+) # Match ASCII letters/dots
)+/x'
</code></pre>

<p>An explanation can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8376897/20670">here</a>. But probably a regex isn't the right tool for this.</p>
