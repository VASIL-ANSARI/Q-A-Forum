<p>Since childbrowser is actually a native UIWebView (on iOS, idk about Android), you have all the benefits of the nitro javascript engine (as of June '11). That means the page/website you are loading can run it's own javascript code. However, the PhoneGap middleware is bootstrapped in the app itself and since UIWebView is native, I don't see how you could use any PhoneGap functionality unless you wrote a plugin to do just that.  I may be completely wrong here though...</p>

<p>EDIT: See this thread here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5757066/phonegap-childbrowser-executing-javascript">PhoneGap ChildBrowser Executing JavaScript</a></p>

<p>He has modified childbrowser to accomplish this very task</p>
