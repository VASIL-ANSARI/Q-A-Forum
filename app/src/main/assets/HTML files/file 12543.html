<p>The <code>ConnectException</code> is a quite fundamental error which simply means that your Java process could not establish a socket connection to the target machine and port, because that machine wasn't accepting connections on the target port.  In this case it's almost certainly trying to connect to your <code>localhost</code> IP address using the default JINI port.</p>

<p>I'd suggest that this error means you don't have a JINI service/registrar running on your machine at the time you executed the code.</p>
