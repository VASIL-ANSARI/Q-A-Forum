<p>I'm making this an answer because I can't demonstrate the multi-line part in the comments. You can solve your problem much better by setting an empty array then adding elements to them after the fact:</p>

<pre><code>$nav = array();
$nav['link1'] = "link";
$nav['link2'] = "link2";
$nav['home'] = "home";
$nav['search'] = "search";
</code></pre>

<p>It's also not that much work to create <code>$nav</code> in just one go in a multi-line format:</p>

<pre><code>$nav = array(
    'link1' =&gt; 'link',
    'link2' =&gt; 'link2',
    'home' =&gt; 'home',
    'search' =&gt; 'search', // The comma is okay - PHP doesn't mind, try it!
    // Add new lines here
);
</code></pre>

<p>It's simple to add more lines to this array declaration:</p>

<pre><code>$nav = array(
    'link1' =&gt; 'link',
    'link2' =&gt; 'link2',
    'home' =&gt; 'home',
    'search' =&gt; 'search',
    'newlink' =&gt; 'newlink',
);
</code></pre>

<p>and you can still declare more values after the fact with no problems. If you do it this way, <code>process.php</code> doesn't need to even exist.</p>
