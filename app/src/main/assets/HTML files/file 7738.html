<p>You might want to take a look at using a list search functionality as described in this <a href="http://www.msjoe.com/2011/06/ropdown-search-with-jquery/" rel="nofollow">post</a> it uses a jQuery plug in and you could always hook it up through an jquery ajax to get further data back from an MVC action method.</p>

<p>If this doesn't help then let me know and I'll try and put together an example in the morning.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
