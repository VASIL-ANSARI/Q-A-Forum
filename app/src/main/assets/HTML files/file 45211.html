<p>reverse the way you are doing it, instead of iterating through the dictionary and searching for potential matches.  iterate through potential matches and search the dictionary</p>

<pre><code>import re
for part in re.findall("\&lt;X\&gt;(.*)\&lt;\/N\&gt;",the_whole_text):
    key = part.split(" ",1)[0]
    if key in my_dict:
       do_something(part)
</code></pre>

<p>since dictionary lookup is <code>O(1)</code> as opposed to string finding of <code>O(N)</code> (searching the whole file for every key is expensive ...)</p>

<p>so searching your file contents is <code>~O(500,000,000)</code> and you are doing that 18,000 times</p>

<p>this way you only search the file once finding all potentials ... then you look up each one to see if its in your data dictionary</p>
