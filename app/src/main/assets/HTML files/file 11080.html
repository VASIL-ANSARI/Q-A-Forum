<p>You need to explicitly call Dispose on any objects that implement IDisposable.  If you use the using() {} code construct the compiler will automatically call Dispose at the end of the using block.</p>

<p>A good pattern is to also track via a private boolean field whether dispose has been called or not, and if not call it from the objects finalizer (and also call GC.SuppressFinalize() from your Dispose method assuming that you handle all finalization tasks from there also).</p>
