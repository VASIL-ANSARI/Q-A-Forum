<p>If this is on El Capitan (OS X 10.11), then it's almost certainly a side effect of System Integrity Protection. From the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/RuntimeProtections/RuntimeProtections.html">System Integrity Protection Guide: Runtime Protections</a> article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a process is started, the kernel checks to see whether the main
  executable is protected on disk or is signed with an special system
  entitlement. If either is true, then a flag is set to denote that it
  is protected against modification. â¦</p>
  
  <p>â¦ Any dynamic linker (<code>dyld</code>)
  environment variables, such as <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, are purged when
  launching protected processes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything in /usr/bin is protected in this fashion. Therefore, when you invoke /usr/bin/lldb, all DYLD_* environment variables are purged.</p>

<p>It should work to run lldb from within Xcode.app or the Command Line Tools, like so:</p>

<pre><code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=whatever /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/lldb &lt;whatever else&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I don't believe that copy of lldb is protected. /usr/bin/lldb is actually just a trampoline that executes the version in Xcode or the Command Line Tools, so you're ultimately running the same thing. But /usr/bin/lldb is protected so the DYLD_* environment variables are purged when running that.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you will have to set the environment variable inside lldb as shown by Greg Clayton in that thread you linked. Or, you can disable System Integrity Protection, although it serves a good purpose.</p>
