<p>You need to fix two things. First, the class declaration of LinkedList says:</p>

<pre><code>public class LinkedList&lt;T extends Node&lt;T&gt;&gt; {
</code></pre>

<p>which means that T has to be both a Node and the element of a Node. This doesn't work with Character since a Character is not an instance of Node. If you remove the constraint so that T can be any value, it works with Character.</p>

<pre><code>public class LinkedList&lt;T&gt; {
</code></pre>

<p>Next you should add the generic part to the main file for the listOfChars as well:</p>

<pre><code>LinkedList&lt;Character&gt; listOfChars = new LinkedList&lt;Character&gt;(n1);
</code></pre>

<p>Also make sure that you have imported the right LinkedList and not the java standard class.</p>
