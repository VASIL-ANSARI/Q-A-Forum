<p>Instead of putting your development files in ~user/Sites, I would put them in the webserver root, which is in /Library/WebServer/Documents. I've had better luck with that.</p>

<p>Then, make sure that your AllowOverride All in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf is inside the directory tag marked <code>&lt;Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents"&gt;</code>. There are several AllowOverride directives in httpd.conf, the one you want to modify is around line 217ish if you use my approach.</p>

<p>Also make sure that the line <code>LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so</code> is uncommented.</p>

<p>Finally make sure you restart apache with <code>sudo apachectl graceful</code>.</p>

<p>If you do want to use your user sites directory, this blog entry has some tips.
