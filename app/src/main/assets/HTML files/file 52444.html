<p>It makes sense that your FPS is dropping if you call <code>.getImageData</code> constantly because it involves duplicating and transferring a large amount of memory. Also, <code>.getImageData</code> does not use the GPU so the processing burden is passed onto your probably-busy CPU.</p>

<p>No ... you can't keep a "live" reference to canvas's image data.</p>

<pre><code>var idata=context.getImageData(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height);
</code></pre>

<p>...returns a static "snapshot" of the pixels of the current canvas content. If you draw something new on the canvas, then <code>idata</code> will not contain the new drawing. </p>

<p>Your question does not contain enough info to help with more detail, but the common workaround is to refactor your app to not use <code>.getImageData</code>.</p>
