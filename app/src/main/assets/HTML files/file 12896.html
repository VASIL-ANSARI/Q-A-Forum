<p>Assuming standard SQL is allowed, you can execute the following statement:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM complete UNION SELECT * FROM incomplete;
</code></pre>

<p>This only works if the structure of both tables is the same. And it is not a very efficient way to check whether data is in both tables.</p>
