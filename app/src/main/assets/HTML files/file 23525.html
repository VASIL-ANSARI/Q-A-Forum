<p>If I get you well, back ground thread can not operate the UI controls directly. If you are using WPF, you can try to use Dispatcher. Instead of creating your own thread do something like this for the background work</p>

<pre><code>Object[] args = {path.FullName, true };
this.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(delegateTextBox, args);
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this will help.</p>
