<p>You're not actually running the main() as a function in your code, main is a class instead. Change main to a function, and instead, write this at the bottom of the program:</p>

<pre><code>If __name__ == "__main__": 
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>This way, the code actually runs. Also, get rid of <code>fruit = main()</code>. It just makes it more confusing and you're going to be running it anyways with this, hence why it says that the process finished. You may also want to move things previously in the main class in the main function. For example, take functions inside of the class such as the machine() function and put it as a separate function outside of your code, and call it in the main function with machine(). </p>
