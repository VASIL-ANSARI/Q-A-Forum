<p><code>PropertyModel</code> works both ways. Instead of using the attribute modifier, just change the headline like so:</p>

<pre><code>backingObject.setHeadline("[desired initial text]");
</code></pre>

<p>You can do this anywhere, it doesn't have to be after the <code>TextField</code> declaration. Of course, if you don't want to touch <code>backingObject</code> beforehand, this won't work, but I'm going to assume that's not an issue since you didn't mention it.</p>
