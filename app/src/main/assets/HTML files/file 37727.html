<p>From the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html#accel-vm" rel="nofollow">Android docs</a> (March 2016):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before attempting to use this type of acceleration, you should first
  determine if your development systemâs CPU supports one of the
  following virtualization extensions technologies:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Intel Virtualization Technology (VT, VT-x, vmx) extensions </li>
  <li>AMD Virtualization (AMD-V, SVM) extensions <strong>(only supported for Linux)</strong> </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The
  specifications from the manufacturer of your CPU should indicate if it
  supports virtualization extensions. If your CPU does not support one
  of these virtualization technologies, then you cannot use virtual
  machine acceleration.</p>
  
  <p><em>Note: Virtualization extensions are typically enabled through your
  computer's BIOS and are frequently turned off by default. Check the
  documentation for your system's motherboard to find out how to enable
  virtualization extensions.</em></p>

<p>Most people talk about Genymotion being faster, and I have never heard anyone say it's slower. I definitely think it's faster, and it will be worth the ~20 minutes it will take to set up just to try it.</p>
