<p>Wait wait. You have multiple rows of data here and you want to submit one specific row of data, but have it all in the same form? I'm a little confused. It looks like what you're really looking for here is to generate a different form element for each row. But you cannot have multiple submit buttons submit different parts of the same form, that's not how forms work. A submit button will submit all data belonging to the form.</p>

<p>In that case, just move the opening form tag to the very beginning of the inside of your while loop, and move your submit button and closing form tag into the bottom of your while loop. It will generate each form and still maintain the structure of your table. But you cant have one form that submits only certain parts of itself, that goes against basic HTML principles.</p>

<p>I'd <strong>strongly</strong> suggest slapping an ID on each form, for future reference and update purposes.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
