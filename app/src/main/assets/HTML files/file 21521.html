<p>I beleive the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/dd370784%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Windows Core Audio API</a> in Vista+ allows you to get the VU levels for each application (After all, the mixer shows it). This should allow you to turn down one application when another is playing, etc.</p>
