<p>Order is a reserved keyword in any SQL language known. I really suggest to change that table name to something less problematic. In the meantime you could change the query to</p>

<pre><code>query = "insert into `order` (UserId, OrderStatus, OrderDate) " &amp; _
        "values (@UserId, @OrderStatus, @OrderDate)"
</code></pre>
