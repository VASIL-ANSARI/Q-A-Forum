<p>If you want to preserve the data in fields, you need to push instead of presenting the VC modally.</p>

<p>Create a navigation controller and init with your VC and then present the VC like:</p>

<pre><code>   UIStoryboard *storyBorad = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName: @"Main_iphone" bundle:nil];
   UIViewController *secondController = [Storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"ControllerB"];

   UINavigationController *navController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:firstViewController];

   [navController pushViewController:secondController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, when you click on back button, you will be taken back to your previous VC and you won't loose any data!!!!</p>

<p>If you don't want o have back button, you can hide the navigation bar, and if you want to dismiss the <code>secondController</code>,you can simply call:</p>

<pre><code>     [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>Also make sure you don't clear all the data in the fields when you move away from your VC!!!! (Make sure to check <code>viewDidDisappear/viewWillDisappear</code> if data is getting nil or not)</p>
