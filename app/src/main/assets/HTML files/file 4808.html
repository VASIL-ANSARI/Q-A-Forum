<p>I think the issue that you might be experiencing is that when so item is selected either in the select box or via checkboxes then no data is coming back with the request to the controller. If you want to be able to remove all objects from the association you need to add an extra hidden field to the form.</p>

<p>For example if there is a product that has many categories add the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;g:hiddenField name="categories" value=""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>apart from the usual <code>select</code>.</p>

<p>You can write a test for the controller to make sure that the desired functionality behaves as expected.</p>
