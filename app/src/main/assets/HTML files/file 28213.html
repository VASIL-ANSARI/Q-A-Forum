<p><code>sizeof</code> operator shall not be used on function types, this is explicitly forbidden by ISO/IEC C standard. So returned value has no meaning.</p>

<p>Reference <strong>ISO/IEC 9899:201x รยง6.5.3.4</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>sizeof</code> operator shall not be applied to an expression that has function type or an incomplete type, to the parenthesized name of such a type, or to an expression that designates a bit-field member.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess that enabling <code>-pedantic</code> flag should raise a warning.</p>
