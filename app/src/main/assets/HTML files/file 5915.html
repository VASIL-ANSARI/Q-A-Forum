<p>You can do anything you want in native code. It's just cumbersome - you need the JNIEnv object to first find the class ID, then the method ID, if you have any non-primitive types, you need to create those too. But then you just call the method, and you're done.</p>

<p><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/spec/functions.html" rel="nofollow">JNI Docs</a> - look for <code>FindClass</code>, <code>GetMethodId</code>, <code>CallVoidMethod</code>, etc.</p>
