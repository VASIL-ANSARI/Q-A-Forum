<p>Mergesort, as the name suggests, is based on merging: combining two sorted lists into one.  The algorithm divides the list to be sorted into two (roughyly) halves, and sorts each half (this is done by the recursive calls to <code>merge sort</code>).  The next two loops each copy half of the results from array <code>a</code> into array <code>b</code>; the last loop re-fills <code>a</code> from <code>b</code>, walking along the two halves of <code>b</code> and, at each step, taking the smaller of the two (or, once one half has ben used up, just taking it form the other) for the next value to go into <code>a</code>.</p>
