<p>It's very likely that some of the links do not have a protocol (http, https, etc.) prepended to it. Anything in the href without a protocol is assumed to be a relative path, which is why some links are appended in relation to your site and others are not.</p>

<p>Going through and ensuring all links include a protocol would be one way to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>
