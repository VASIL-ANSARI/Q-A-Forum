<p>Yes. There is a benefit to overriding them.</p>

<p>Not everybody actually updates or deletes a row of data when an update or delete happens.</p>

<p>In some cases, deleting a record really simply means setting an EffictiveUntil date to an existing record and keeping the record in the database for historical purposes.</p>

<p>The same can go for an Update. Instead of updating an existing row, the current row gets the EffectiveUntil date set and a brand new row gets inserted with the new data with a null EffectiveUntil date (or similar mechanism).</p>

<p>By providing Insert/Update/Delete logic to Entity Framework, you are allowed to specify exactly what those operations mean in terms of your database rather than what they mean in the scope of an RDBMS.</p>

<p>As for the second question (that I apparently originally missed), if you're happy with what is currently being generated, then no it's not worth creating them. You'd just add the extra headache of having to remember to update your Stored Procedures whenever you change the table structure.</p>
