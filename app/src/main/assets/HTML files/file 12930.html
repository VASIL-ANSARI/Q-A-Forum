<p>You should really share your code that's causing the exception, but the exception indicates that you're using an internal Java API (any class contained in the <code>com.sun</code> packages). You shouldn't be using those APIs directly, as they're considered private implementations and subject to change. As those APIs are private, it isn't as simple as looking for the Javadoc to see what methods are available, but suffice it to say that the method you're calling doesn't exist. You have a few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you're calling this method directly, you need to refactor. You should look for ways to accomplish the same work using public APIs.</li>
<li>If this happens after calling a library method, you should file a bug with the library maintainer informing them about the error and the risks of using the <code>com.sun</code> APIs.</li>
<li>If this happens after calling a public Java API (anything in the <code>java</code> or <code>javax</code> packages) then You should file a bug report with Oracle. This one seems unlikely though.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, if you share your code, we may be able to better help you.</p>
