<p>Look into the Data Protection API (DPAPI), which is FIPS compliant (as far as I can tell; you can review the evaluation <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc750357.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>

<p>DPAPI is exposed in .NET 2.0 and greater with the System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData class.  It uses the user's current credentials as the encryption key.  See my more complete answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/154430/persistent-storage-of-encrypted-data-using-net">here</a>.</p>
