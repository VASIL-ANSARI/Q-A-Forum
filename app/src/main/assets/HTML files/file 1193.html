<p>I would recommend using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd140088.aspx" rel="nofollow">Validation Application Block</a> from the Enterprise Library released by the Microsoft Patterns and Practices team.</p>

<p>This allows you to put the validation logic on the domain object (maintaining DDD), but also  to populate the object, and <em>then ask</em> is it valid, rather than throwing an exception.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what your UI is, but the Validation Application Block can be integrated with ASP.NET, Windows Forms, and WCF.</p>
