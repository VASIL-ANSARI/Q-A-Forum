<p>The Carbage Collector handles the objects lifetime. It is also divided roughly into 3 'pieces' in memory, called gen0, gen1, gen2 (Generations).</p>

<p>In gen0 the fast living objects reside, where the allocated memory is small. The garbage collection is run frequently because there are many short lived objects there. If an object suvives gen0 it is moved to next gen.</p>

<p>When an object is garbaged collected all the other objects are re-arranged in memory, to keep the free memory space available.</p>

<p>But in gen2, where the biggest and long lived objects live, the memory is rarely re-arranged because it costs too much to move objects in gen2.</p>

<p>All this memory references and garbage collection is given to you for 'free' in a managed environment like C#.</p>

<p>Furthermore sometimes, optimizations are done, such as: "string interning". </p>
