<p>just do <code>a.compareTo(b) &lt; 0</code> instead of the <code>&gt; 0</code></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I've figured out the problem. But since this is homework (thanks for being honest), I won't post my solution, but here are a few tips:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are doing selection sort. The algorithm isn't as complicated as you made it. You only have to swap if the two elements you are checking are in the wrong order. I see you have 3 branches there, no need.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a look at when you are assigning <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Through the inner loop, where <code>j</code> is changing, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> never change, because <code>i</code> and <code>iPosMin</code> stay the same. I hope that helps.</p></li>
<li><p>It's always good to break your algorithm down to discreet parts that you know works by extracting methods. You repeat the same swap code twice, but with different arguments for indices. Take that out and just make a:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-</p>

<pre><code>// swaps the object at position i with position j in all arrays
private static void swap(String[] sDeptArr, int[] iCourseNumArr, int[] iEnrollmentArr, int i, int j)
</code></pre>

<p>Then you'll see you're code get a lot cleaner.</p>
