<p>On a 64-bit installation, I had no problems with the file size you mentioned using PHP 5.3.6. A 32-bit installation gave me:</p>

<pre><code>failed to open stream: Value too large for defined data type
</code></pre>

<p>But that said, I would not even use <code>readfile</code>. Instead:</p>

<pre><code>header("X-Sendfile: $filepath/$filename");
</code></pre>

<p>It requires mod_xsendfile be installed and configured. </p>
