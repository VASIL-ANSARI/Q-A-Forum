<p>sum is the accumulator object, for example the following code:</p>

<pre><code>(1..10).inject(0) do |sum, num| #sum is initialized to 0 and passed in as the accumulator
    sum + num #since sum is the accumulator, the result of this addition is stored in sum
end
</code></pre>

<p>The above code is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>sum = 0
(1..10).each do 
    |num|
    sum = sum + num
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can give the accumulator object any valid variable name, of course better with a meaningful name in the context.</p>
