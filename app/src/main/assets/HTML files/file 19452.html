<p>It looks like the Windows machine already has some configuration done so that it knows where to find this <code>Finch</code> class, and your Mac doesn't. Fairly sure the Windows vs. Mac thing is a red herring here: if you went and found another (unconfigured) Windows machine, it won't work.</p>

<p>You probably need to download a library that has the <code>Finch</code> class and then configure Eclipse on where to find it. The best place to get this information is probably going to be in the class notes/website. If those don't have it, then just ask the professor.</p>
