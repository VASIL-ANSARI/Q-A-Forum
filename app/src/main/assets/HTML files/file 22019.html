<p>You can filter the entries you get in the SQL query you are building in this line:</p>

<pre><code>String selectQuery = "SELECT  * FROM " + table;
</code></pre>

<p>To filter the dataset your retrieve, you would add a WHERE clause to it. When you would, for example, only want those entries where the rating is over 3, you would change this to:</p>

<pre><code>String selectQuery = "SELECT  * FROM " + table + " WHERE rating &gt; 3";
</code></pre>
