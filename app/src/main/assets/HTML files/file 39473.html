<p>You could add a parameter-less constructor on your base class that creates the new List for you?  Other than that, no, you have to do that.</p>

<p>You would have two constructors, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public BaseClass(List&lt;MyInterface&gt; newList)
{
    //blah blah blah
}

public BaseClass()
{
    var myList = new List&lt;MyInterface&gt;();
}
</code></pre>
