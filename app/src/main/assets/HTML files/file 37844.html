<p>You should be able to add the plugin OK.</p>

<p>If you just delete the plugin to remove it then you would have to restart Eclipse specifying the <code>-clean</code> and <code>-clearPersistedState</code> options to clean things up.</p>

<p>If the RCP you are extending includes the Eclipse p2 install manager you could create an update site so that the plugin can be installed 'properly' see <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugIn/article.html#p2deployplugin" rel="nofollow">http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugIn/article.html#p2deployplugin</a></p>
