  <p>But is it safe to assume that it will also work for user-defined implicit conversions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. From section 6.4.2 of the C# 4 spec:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a user-defined conversion operator that convers from a non-nullable value type <code>S</code> to a non-nullable value type <code>T</code>, a <em>lifted conversion operator</em> exists that converts from <code>S?</code> to <code>T?</code>. This lifted conversion operator performs an unwrapping from <code>S?</code> to <code>S</code> followed by the user-defined conversion from <code>S</code> to <code>T</code>, followed by a wrapping from <code>T</code> to <code>T?</code>, except that a null-valued <code>S?</code> converts directly to a null-valued <code>T?</code>.</p>
  
  <p>A lifted conversion operator has the same implicit or explicit classification as its underlying user-defined conversion operator. The term "user-defined conversion" applies to the use of both user-defined and lifted conversion operators.</p>
