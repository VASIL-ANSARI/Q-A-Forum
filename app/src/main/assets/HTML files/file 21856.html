<p><a href="http://socket.io/" rel="nofollow"><code>socket.io</code></a> keeps sending events to the server repeatedly until it gets an acknowledgement. Depending on the server load, acknowledgements might not be immediate. So multiple identical requests were being sent, and since <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async#paralleltasks-callback" rel="nofollow"><code>async.parallel</code></a> uses a counter instead of individually tracking each function, the final function was getting prematurely called.</p>
