<p>indexOf() in javascript does not perform a deep comparison of objects. On top of that, any two objects that are created will never be "equal" to each other. If you do:</p>

<pre><code>var a = {};
var b = {};
a == b; //false
a === b; //false
</code></pre>

<p>You need to perform a <strong>deep comparison</strong> against all values (if that's even what you're looking to do, because there could be other equalities you're looking for). I won't go into how to do a deep comparison because, well, Google.</p>
