<p>It seems this is a Disk I/O related issue. The SQL Server reads the image's binary data from disk, and this hits query performance (it takes time to read 8000*5MB from disk).</p>

<p>You can move your table with the images to a faster disk array or to SSD storages by moving it to a new filegroup. (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175905.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175905.aspx</a>)
This could give you minor performace gaint.</p>

<p>Depending on the count ant total size of images you retrieve from the table at once, you should consider to query the info about the images in one query. After that, you should query only the binary data (one image per query) when it is really necessary.</p>

<p>Do you really need to query all records (with image data) at once? If not, than limit your results (use pagination to iterate throught the images stored in the database) or query only the non-binary data, and query image data when it is really necessary (and possibly add some kind of caching in your application).</p>

<p>Try to limit the number of records to a reasonable size when you query image or large binary data.</p>

<p>If you are using SQL Server 2008 or later, you should test if using <code>FILESTREAM</code> provides some performance gain or not.</p>

<p>The <code>IMAGE</code> datatype is depricated. Try to change it to <code>VARBINARY(MAX)</code>
 and read this article about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186981.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Row-Overflow Considerations</code></a> </p>

<p>I know that you are mentioned that you can not move your files outside of the database, but this is your best chance and a best practice. Try to get a timeframe from your bosses to implement it.</p>
