<p>is this Object a custom class? If so i would write a "Reset()" method to do all the resetting you'd need.</p>

<p>for example you would call</p>

<pre><code>private void method(int someValue, int someValue2)
{
 obj.Reset();
 obj.Val1 = someValue;
 obj1.Val2 = someValue2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in the Reset function you would do whatever you need to consider the object "re-initialised"</p>

<p>i.e</p>

<pre><code>public void Reset()
{
    this.Val1 = 0;
    this.Val2 = 0;
    this.Name = "";
    this.Date = DateTime.MinDate;
    //You get the Idea, reset whatever needed to whatever you need.
}
</code></pre>

<p>using this function you can also then, in the constructor simply call "Reset();" so you know the values are the same when another method calls "Reset" on this object along with a new object being made.</p>
