<p>Make sure you're using the same character set throughout your PHP and database interaction. A few things must be checked:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick an appropriate character set.  In this case I'll assume UTF8.</li>
<li>Save your PHP file as UTF8.</li>
<li>Add a query <code>SET NAMES 'utf8'</code> to your PHP immediately after opening the connection.</li>
<li><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/charset-table.html" rel="nofollow">Set your table and column char sets to UTF8</a>. At the very least use <code>CHARSET=utf8</code> in your table definitions.</li>
</ol>
