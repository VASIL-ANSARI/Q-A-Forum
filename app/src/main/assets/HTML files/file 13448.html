<p>I ran into the same problem and finally figured out what was missing.  There is a little code in the AppDelegate to performs some initialization.  It is in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method.  Here is the code that goes in there:</p>

<pre><code>UISplitViewController *splitViewController = (UISplitViewController *)self.window.rootViewController;
UINavigationController *navigationController = [splitViewController.viewControllers lastObject];
splitViewController.delegate = (id)navigationController.topViewController;
</code></pre>

<p>They're all important to operate the split view controller, but the last line is the most line for getting the method to fire is the last one.  I am building a universal application and this was missing.  To ensure that it didn't affect my iPhone side I wrapped it in a UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM check.</p>
