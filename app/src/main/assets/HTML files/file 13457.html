<p>You could create a template using SVG (create in Inkscape or any SVG editor) and then manipulate the XML using PHP. Finally to get some dynamic output, render the modified SVG file using <code>inkscape</code> on the command line, to get either bitmap or PDF output. The results will be of excellent quality.</p>
