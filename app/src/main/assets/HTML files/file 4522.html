<p><code>void *</code> means pass-by-pointer in C++, meaning you pass in a pointer, but it's actually a copy of the pointer. If you modified this pointer in your function, like changing its address, it is not reflected in the pointer you passed in.</p>

<p>Combining that with pass by reference, <code>void *&amp;</code> means you are passing an alias of the original pointer to this function. If you modified it, like changing its address, it will be reflected in the original pointer.</p>
