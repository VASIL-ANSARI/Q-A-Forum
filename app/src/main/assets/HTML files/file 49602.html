<li>Do not create a bitmap with full <code>height</code> and <code>width</code>. Try to reduce the height or width without affecting the aspect ratio.</li>
<li>If inSampleSize = 4 is reducing clarity, go for something less than that.</li>
<li>Why are you creating another bitmap <code>scaledBitmap</code>? If you really want to create a scaled bitmap, try <code>Bitmap.createScaledBitmap()</code>.</li>
<li>Don't forget to call <code>Bitmap.recycle()</code> once you don't need a <code>bitmap</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more detailed info on the above points read here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/33394336/4747587">http://stackoverflow.com/a/33394336/4747587</a></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The crash happened not because of <code>BitmapFactory.decodeFile()</code>, but because of the below line of code:</p>

<pre><code> Bitmap scaledBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(original1, 0, 0, width, height, matrix, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Replace this with:</p>

<pre><code> Bitmap scaledBitmap= Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(original1, (int)(width/1.5f), (int)(height/1.5f), false); 
</code></pre>

<p>So, play around with the <code>1.5f</code> value here to one that suits you. You are trying to create a <code>bitmap</code> the same size as the screen with full resolution. That would take huge memory. Instead you need to create a smaller image. All this is well documented in the above link.</p>
