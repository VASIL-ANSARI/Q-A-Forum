<p>Call <code>locale.getpreferredencoding(False)</code> on your OSX device.  That's the default encoding used for reading a file on that device.  Save in that encoding on Windows and you won't need to specify the encoding on your OSX device.</p>

<p>But as the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow">Zen of Python</a> says, "Explicit is better than implicit."  Since you know the encoding, why not specify it?</p>
