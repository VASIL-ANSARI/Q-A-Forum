<p>Looks like what you're doing is forcing a nil object to an array, which will work, yt isn't an ideal solution. You can wrap the whole thing in this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if @taxonomies &amp;&amp; @taxonomies.any? %&gt;
  #your code goes here
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...which will check for the presence of a taxonomies variable and make sure it isn't an empty array before running your code. As far as getting the code on the server goes, you'll have to post more info about your deployment setup and version control to answer that question.</p>
