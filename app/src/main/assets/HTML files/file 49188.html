<p>You can keep your .htaccess as it is. If you remove -f condition, you're router will need to handle all requests to css, images and javascript-files as well and that's just a pain.</p>

<p>Set a default controller in your Router-class instead:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;request = isset($_GET['url'])? $_GET['url] : 'default';
</code></pre>

<p>then you just need to create the file <code>controllers/default.php</code> which will be used if the <code>$_GET['url]</code> isn't set.</p>
