<p>Your bark method should be lower case. Second, it needs a return type, i.e. void, String, int, whatever...  As it stands now, it's syntax is that of the constructor, but the constructor for a class called Dog must be called Dog().  See below:</p>

<pre><code>public class Dog {
    public String mHairColor;
    public int mShedRate;
    public int mSpeed;

    public Dog() {
        // example
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }


}
</code></pre>
