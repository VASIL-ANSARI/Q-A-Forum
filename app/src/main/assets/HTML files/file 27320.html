<p>It is probably not the best way of dealing with this but you can try using window function:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT object_id, MAX(event_timestamp)
OVER (PARTITION BY object_id)  
FROM test_select ORDER BY max DESC;
</code></pre>

<p>From the other hand it works as well:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT object_id, MAX(event_timestamp) as max_event_timestamp
FROM test_select 
GROUP BY object_id 
ORDER BY max_event_timestamp DESC;
</code></pre>
