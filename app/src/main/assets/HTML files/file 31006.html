<p>Suggestion: If you are just doing a sample project to learn migrations as you say, stick to one DbContext. Keep it simple - merge your entities into one DbContext that inherits from <code>IdentityDbContext&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;</code></p>

<p>Delete your existing migrations folders you've created - and re "enable-migrations" after deleting your second DbContext. This will help you to continue learning migrations, instead of learning how to use two DbContext's in one project.</p>

<p>Also, @Lajos, I'm not sure which MVC you are talking about, but my DbContext's have never inherited from DbMigrationsConfiguration - they inherit from DbContext, or IdentityDbContext. What you are referring to is the MigrationsConfiguration class that gets generated when issuing "enable-migrations" on a project. It is used for generating migrations and seeding data.</p>
