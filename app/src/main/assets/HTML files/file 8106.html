<p>Reading samples from input device (Microphone) and detecting a linear amplitude of a signal is one way. </p>

<p>There are more sophisticated ways to do this, like applying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" rel="nofollow">"Fourier transform"</a> and detecting amplitude of specific range of "voice" frequencies, but that is harder and requires some knowledge of signal processing.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can read raw LPCM sample data using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord.html" rel="nofollow">AndroidRecord</a> class.</p>
