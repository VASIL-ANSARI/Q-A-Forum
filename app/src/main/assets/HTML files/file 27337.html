<p>We can do this using bit wise operators. The idea is to read each bit, one at a time, of the number from right to left and generate another number using these bits from left to right. Finally, we compare these two numbers. 
If they are same, the original number is a binary bit palindrome. </p>

<pre><code>int isBitPalindrome(int x) {
    int reversed = 0, aux = x;
    while (aux &gt; 0) {
        /* 
        Before doing that shifting reversed to 
        right, to build it from left to right. 
        Takes LSB of aux and puts it as LSB of reversed
        variable.
        */
        reversed = (reversed  &lt;&lt; 1) | (aux &amp; 1);

        /*
        Loop depends on number of bits in aux. Takes next bit into 
        LSB position by shifting aux right once.
        */
        aux = aux &gt;&gt; 1;
    }
    return (reversed  == x) ? 1 : 0;
}
