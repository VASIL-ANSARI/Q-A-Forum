<p>You haven't indented the for loop body:</p>

<pre><code>for row in data:
    first_name = row['first_name']
    sql = Prospect(first_name=first_name) #truncated for brevity
    db.session.add(sql)
    db.session.commit()
</code></pre>

<p>If it's not that, then it's probably mixed tabs and spaces. Python can handle one or the other, but never both!</p>

<p>You're better off using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow"><code>csv</code> Python library</a>. There's no need to try parsing csv files yourself!</p>
