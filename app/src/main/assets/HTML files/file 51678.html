<p>Not sure if this is your problem, but a common scenario is to have your app installed under a virtualenv and supervisor installed directly on the host.</p>

<p>Under this scenario, you need to make sure that the celery version your are running is the one installed in your virtualenv and not a version that might be installed in the host's root environment.</p>

<p>As an example, lets assume your virtualenv is located at <code>/opt/virtualenvs/foo</code> and your supervisor program is configured at <code>/etc/supervisor.d/foo.conf</code>.</p>

<pre><code>[program:foo]
command=/opt/virtualenvs/foo/bin/celery -A celery.conf worker
...
</code></pre>
