<p>Your ELSE part in the CASE returns a numeric value, which results in a numeric datatype for the returned value. You have to move the CAST outside the SUM:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(SUM(CASE 
        WHEN DATEPART(dw, DTH.ActivityDate) = 2
            THEN DTH.[Hours]
        ELSE 0
        END) AS VARCHAR(80)) AS Monday
</code></pre>
