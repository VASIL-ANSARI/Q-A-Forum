<p>Strtotimes return is </p>

<p>Returns a timestamp on success, FALSE otherwise. Previous to PHP 5.1.0, this function would return -1 on failure.</p>

<p>It seems like the function is failing and returning false. When passed to a function expecting an int. False is cast to 0.</p>

<p>The timestamp 0 is the Unix epoch which is the 1st of Jan 1970. </p>

<p>Check for failure of the strtotime function and handle it. </p>
