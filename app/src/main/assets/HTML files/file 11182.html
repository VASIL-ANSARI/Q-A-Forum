<p>You can't play "any" online radio stream.</p>

<p>Android Mediaplayer is notorious for streaming problems due to unsupported formats (raw AAC for ex.) or trouble with some protocols (Icecast for ex).</p>

<p>With that said, you can still play lots of existing stuff just by loading the URL. Like Dawid Sajdak commented on your question, make sure the stream follows one of those formats.</p>
