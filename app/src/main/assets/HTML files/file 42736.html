<p>You have to set the variables as public <code>public int x1;</code> if you want to access them externally.</p>

<p>However it is good practice to use getters and setters instead:</p>

<pre><code>//things
private int x1;
//more stuff
public int getx1(){
    return x1;
}
public void setX1(int x){
    x1 = x;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>

<p>appears I've missed the point of the question, to actually answer it, you cannot access a variable outside of where it is defined. If you want to use <code>one</code> somewhere else, you will have to either create a setter for it, or define it in a broader scope.</p>

<p>If you must, I recommend doing something like i show above, define <code>private Shape one;</code> then set it in main <code>one = new Shape(...)</code> and add a getter for it <code>public Shape getOne(){...}</code></p>

<p>then in the test class you can call <code>getOne()</code> and access the variables.</p>
