<p>Dynamic behavior in SVG that is used as an HTML image is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG/SVG_as_an_Image#Restrictions" rel="nofollow">disabled for security reasons</a>. The reason is quite obvious - you can use an SVG image from a different domain and wouldn't really want it to run JavaScript code in the context of your document. So SVG used as an HTML image is essentially always static. There are some more details on <a href="http://www.schepers.cc/svg/blendups/embedding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.schepers.cc/svg/blendups/embedding.html</a> (thanks @<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1038015/robert-longson">RobertLongson</a> for this link).</p>

<p>There is a work-around in Firefox: if you have <em>inline</em> SVG code (can be hidden) you can use a filter from that SVG code using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter#url%28resource%29" rel="nofollow"><code>filter</code> CSS property</a>. Depending on what you are trying to achieve this can be a rather <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2008/06/applying-svg-effects-to-html-content_04.html" rel="nofollow">powerful tool</a>. According to MDN Chrome and Safari should also support this but I'm not certain that they do.</p>
