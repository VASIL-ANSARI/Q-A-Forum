<p>its is always better to use system format for date to prevent localization  issues . </p>

<p>Different countries and regions have different conventions for formatting numerical and time-based information. Locale settings provide information about the formats used by the current user and must be considered when writing code that handles user-facing data types. The user sets the locale by choosing a region in Settings on iOS devices and System Preferences on a Mac. The user can also change locale settings while the app is running. Therefore, if you manipulate data objects in your code and then present them to the user, use the locale APIs to format the data correctly.</p>
