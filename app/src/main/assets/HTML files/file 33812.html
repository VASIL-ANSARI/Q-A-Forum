<p>In my opinion you should not use shared Preferences. Try out this.
Keep an mysqlitedatabase table that could store the checkbox value i.e 1 for checked and 0 for not checked. 
When a checkBox is clicked , call its listener and change the value in the database . If your worried about processing use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/LoaderManager.html" rel="nofollow">LoaderManager</a> class </p>
