<p>In <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling#step_3_generate_an_oauth_20_client_id" rel="nofollow">Step 3. Generate an OAuth 2.0 client ID</a> it specifically gives a warning as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Warning: 
Do not open the Google APIs Console directly and manually add

when you send requests to the game services.
</code></pre>

<p>So my experience was that you need to follow the guide religiously: <a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services/console/enabling" rel="nofollow">Setting Up Google Play Game Services with the Google Play Developer Console</a> </p>
