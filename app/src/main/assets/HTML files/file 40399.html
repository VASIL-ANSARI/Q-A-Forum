<p>I believe what you are describing that you have seen in some games is called "Immersive Mode".  The navigation bar disappears completely, and a gesture from the edge of the screen brings it back.  This feature is available starting at Android version 4.4.</p>

<p>Before Android 4.4, since Android version 4.0, you can use the "Hide Navigation" flag, which will temporarily hide the navigation bar.  The problem with this mode is that any interaction with the screen will cause the navigation bar to reappear.  This of course isn't very useful for apps that require a lot of interaction with the screen, like most games.</p>

<p>I typically use the following functions for moving in and out of immersive mode:</p>

<pre><code>private void hideSystemUI() {
    mDecorView.setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE); // This flag only for 4.4+
}

private void showSystemUI() {
    mDecorView.setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION
            | View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my onCreate, I set mDecorView and call hideSystemUI:</p>

<pre><code>    mDecorView = getWindow().getDecorView();
    hideSystemUI();
</code></pre>

<p>The code is similar to what you have though, so this may not help.  There is a detailed video on the subject, including much more detailed source code examples, here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBi8fjv90E4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBi8fjv90E4</a></p>
