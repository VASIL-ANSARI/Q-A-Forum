  <p>is there a more efficient way to download from multiple URLs other than receiving a response from this download service and restarting until all urls are downloaded?</p>

<p>Use a <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> and run a few threads in parallel. Dump your <code>Messenger</code>-and-<code>HandlerThread</code> stuff and have <code>onStartCommand()</code> just hand each job over to the <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>. Use a packaged event bus (e.g., greenrobot's EventBus, <code>LocalBroadcastManager</code>) to let your UI layer know about the work that was done.</p>

<p>The <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> logic would then be fairly standard Java. The only Android-isms would be <code>onStartCommand()</code> being the recipient of the work to do and using the event bus to relay results.</p>
