<p>There is no universal way of telling this. Many docks just appear as a USB hub with a stack of devices attached and duplicating some IO ports, some do actually behave as a 'dock' which would allow what you've tried already.</p>

<p>What you'd likely have to do is use complete hardware profiling to check. Asking the user to undock the laptop, check all the attached devices, ask the user to dock it and then check again. You'd want to check all enumerable devices on the PCI and USB busses.</p>

<p>You'd also have to do a bit of magic to cope with removable devices, so you'd have to ask the user to remove them all before both checks.</p>
