<p>Via HTTP request and response, they would only see the input and output but not the PHP code since PHP is interpreted server-side.</p>

<p>This means that they could have potentially reverse-engineered the algorithm. For instance, if I sent a service 2 and received 4 then sent 4 and received 16 and so on, I might be able to reverse engineer the maths behind that (in this example the square function).</p>

<p>If they managed to access your server without going through a PHP server, then they would also be able to download the PHP source file. For instance, a PHP file on an Apache Tomcat server (a Java server) would be served as plain text and would therefore reveal the code.</p>
