<p>Well there are lots of different ways to compress data, but it can be quite a task to undertake. One area you might want to research is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding" rel="nofollow">Huffman Coding</a> which can help with compression, especially for plain text. The reason I point it out is that it is more approachable than other compression techniques, and can be a good starting point.</p>

<p>Sure it is possible to do on your own, but it will be <strong>much</strong> longer than using pre-built functions and probably not as effective.</p>

<p>If you want to look up the implementation you can find open source libraries and look over the code that actually implements various compression algorithms.</p>

<p>Researching and learning about the code is a great idea, but unless there is a very good reason not to you should stick to using the pre-built modules.</p>
