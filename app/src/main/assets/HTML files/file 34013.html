  <p>What is the purpose of this field?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To give you the metadata for the component, as specified by <code>&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> elements in the manifest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When should we use it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you want to access the contents of the <code>&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do we really need it ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have <code>&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> elements, yes. Otherwise, no.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what is the meaning of just using 0 as the flags? will it get all of the apps?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It always gets "all of the apps". What the flags control is what data <em>about</em> those apps it retrieves. I assume this is to minimize the amount of data transferred over IPC in response to these calls, but that's just an educated guess.</p>
