<p>I kept plunking away in the basicWriter function until eventually I was surprised to find one place that actually does work. Basically, this is the process I used to solve this problem without editing ckeditor.js</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and open an uncompressed version of the ckeditor.js file. </li>
<li>Locate and copy the entire <code>CKEDITOR.htmlParser.basicWriter</code> function into the bottom of your config.js file. This basically redefines the function, overriding the real one but allowing us to make customizations to it without necessarily breaking future updates.</li>
<li>In the copied function within config.js, locate the getHtml section and customize the <code>html</code> variable before it gets returned. Below is a template to help you locate this section</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<pre><code>getHtml: function( reset ) {
var html = this._.output.join( '' );

  // this is where we can replace individual characters or make other 
  // customizations
  html = html.replace('â', '"');
  html = html.replace('â', '-');

  if ( reset )
    this.reset();

  return html;
}
</code></pre>
