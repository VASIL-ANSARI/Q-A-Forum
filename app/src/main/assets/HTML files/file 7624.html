<p>for the android market you need to register an account and just publish your app. google doens't really have any restrictions like apple has for the iphone apps. its quite simple and straightforward. you just need to pay 25$ for creating the market account through google checkout.</p>

<p>And what exactly do you mean by publishing an enterprise app? how is that different from a normal android app? There really isn't a different way of deploying the apps on the market. its just the standard normal way of building, signing and uploading the app. The app code in a regular app isn't with a different structure than an enterprise app (apps build with the help of the android sdk, tested on android devices written with the help of the same classes and ment to be deployed on the same phones as any other app out there)...</p>
