<p>Since this query is just scanning all rows, you need an index on <code>lastdate</code> to avoid MySQL from having to order the results manually (using filesort, which isn't always to disk/temp table).</p>

<p>For super read performance, add the following multi-column "covering" index:</p>

<pre><code>user(lastdate, username, idu)
</code></pre>

<p>A "covering" index would allow MySQL to just scan the index instead of the actual table data.</p>

<p>If using InnoDB and any of the above columns are your primary key, you don't need it in the index.</p>
