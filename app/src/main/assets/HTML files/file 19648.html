<p>Some other process is using port 8888 then. Use the GWT DevMode parameter <code>-port 8889</code> (or any other port that fits you) and you should be fine.</p>

<p>You might use <code>netstat -p</code> (or your OS variant that shows process names) to figure out what's on port 8888.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
