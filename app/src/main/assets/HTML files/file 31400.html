<p>I recommend spending some time learning about joins in sql. You would only need one SQL query, and it would be something like this...</p>

<pre><code>select * 
  from status inner join users 
  on status.userid = users.userid
  where active = '1' and connect = '1'
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Although using mysql functions is not recommended (see the note at the top of this page - <a href="http://uk3.php.net/mysql_query" rel="nofollow">http://uk3.php.net/mysql_query</a>),  your lines should be like this..</p>

<pre><code>$query = "select * from status inner join users on status.user_id = users.id where active = '1' and connect = '1'";

$result = mysql_query($query);

WHILE ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)){

...  rest of your code....
</code></pre>
