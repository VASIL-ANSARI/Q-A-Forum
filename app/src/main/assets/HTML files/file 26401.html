<p>This question is a little unfocused for Stack Overflow, but you do have some clear questions in there. For coding standards, start with a read of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html" rel="nofollow">Apple's guidelines</a> and look at Apple source code. Try to always read methods with their full signatures. <code>NSColor colorWithDeviceRed:green:blue:alpha:</code> -- this is the way the compiler understands them.</p>

<p>The initializing of collections is a bit of relic now that ARC handles release/retain, basically using the "init" format would return a retained object and the class methods <code>[NSArray array]</code> would return an autoreleased one. I would use <code>@[ ]</code> since it is short and clear.</p>

<p>With the dictionary instantiation question, initializing one dictionary with another makes it such that the objects contained in A are now also contained in B. If you actually want copies of the object contained in A to go into B, <code>initWithDictionary:copyItems:</code> will perform a (shallow) copy of those items.</p>

<pre><code>NSMutableString *someString = [@"abc" mutableCopy];
NSDictionary *a = @{ @"key" : someString };
NSDictionary *b1 = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary:a];
NSDictionary *b2 = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithDictionary:a copyItems:YES];

[someString appendString:@"def"];
// b1[@"key"] == abcdef
// b2[@"key"] == abc
// Note also that b1[@"key"] will be a mutablestring, b2[@"key"] will not
</code></pre>

<p>Generally you do not need to copy unless you know you need to copy. Good luck!</p>
