<p>In the project properties, you will find the browse information under:</p>

<p>Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Browse Information</p>

<p>Just tell it not to generate browse information.  All it is used for is quickly browsing between code components (like using 'Go to Definition') and so forth.  I personally like being able to quickly jump between the components, but if it is adding unnecessary time to your compile don't worry about turning it off.</p>
