<p>You <em>can</em> insure that the numbers are between 0 and 255 with a regex, but I highly recommend against it.  An easier method here is to capture the numbers with a regex and check that they are between 0 and 255 by simply casting to an int and comparing:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = r"(\d+),\s*(\d+),\s*(\d+)"
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(r, "0, 254,10").groups()
('0', '254', '10')
&gt;&gt;&gt; all(0 &lt;= int(group) &lt;= 255 for group in re.match(r, "0, 254,10").groups())
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; all(0 &lt;= int(group) &lt;= 255 for group in re.match(r, "0,256, 190").groups())
False
</code></pre>
