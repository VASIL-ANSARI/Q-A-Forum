<p>Last time I used Yahoo's data was about a year ago and they didn't have an API, so I had to request all the data by modifying the URL. You can find all of the information <a href="http://mlai-lirik.blogspot.com/search/label/data%20mining" rel="nofollow">on my blog.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Daily 'leaders' with stock symbols, ETFs, options, etc.  </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, there is no query which would result in "daily leaders", but if it's part of the quote (which it may be), then you should be able to get it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Any breakout symbols using any classic tecnical analysis [indicators]?  </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I don't know of any way to query for technical indicators in a manner that would show you the breakout symbols. However, if it's part of a quote, then you should be able to get it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Can this be done in real time? Does any one know of a way to do this using programmatic or automated way?  </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no... you can query the data frequently, but Yahoo only updates the data every 15 minutes. They do update <strong>some</strong> of the symbols in "real time", so you can get updates as frequently as you hit up Yahoo and as frequently as Yahoo refreshes the information.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have used the classic 'wget' or C# request methods. Any URLs would be helpful. I just want to output the actual symbols into a text, XML, or CSV format. Many Thanks </p>

<p><a href="http://www.gummy-stuff.org/Yahoo-data.htm" rel="nofollow">Gummy stuff</a> is VERY informative when it comes to querying Yahoo data. You can query most of the data shown on yahoo finance. Note that there are a lot more things that are considered as part of the "quote" than just the Open, High, Low and Close, so you <strong>might</strong> be able to get all the information that you need.</p>

<p>You can get quotes in CSV format: <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=" rel="nofollow">http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=</a> + STOCK_SYMBOL(S) + &amp;f= + TAG(S)</p>

<p>You can also get historical data in CSV format: <a href="http://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=</a> STOCK_SYMBOL(S) + &amp; + output=csv </p>
