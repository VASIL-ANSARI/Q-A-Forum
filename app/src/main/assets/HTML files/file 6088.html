<p>I think you'll need to create your own method, using a graphics object and "manually" (read "with code") create the image. Easiest way would be to create a single graphics object, add a circle, then in each quadrant of the image add the extras you need, then split the object into fourths. Or return the whole thing as one image then use CSS sprites to place the image in the right spots with the right coordinates (probably the better solution as it uses less calls to the graphics library and returns just one file, so less calls to the web server).</p>
