<p>Try calling <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JComboBox.html#setPrototypeDisplayValue%28E%29" rel="nofollow"><code>setPrototypeDisplayValue</code></a> on the combobox. This will set the width based on the amount of text used. As mentioned in the linked documentation, if this is not there then it uses the preferred width basing this on the size of each element.</p>
