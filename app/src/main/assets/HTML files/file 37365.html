<p>It's possible to produce a Java component from MATLAB code using the add-on product MATLAB Builder JA. However, this component isn't suitable for running on Android as it depends on the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR), which has a footprint much too large for a typical Android device.</p>

<p>Typically, if you have MATLAB code that you'd like to incorporate into an Android app you would do one of the following, depending on the purpose and scale of the code you want to include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Deploy your code to a standalone component using either MATLAB Builder JA for Java or MATLAB Builder NE for .NET, put this component on a server and have your Android app call it via a web service, or</li>
<li>Use another add-on product MATLAB Coder to automatically convert your MATLAB code to C, which can then be incorporated directly into your Android app.</li>
</ol>

<p>With route 2, you're correct that MATLAB Coder only supports a subset of the MATLAB language, and you'll need to make sure your algorithm falls within that subset. However, there are only a few major limitations, and so long as you avoid those it's usually not too much trouble. A majority of the algorithms in Image Processing Toolbox and Computer Vision Systems Toolbox are supported.</p>
