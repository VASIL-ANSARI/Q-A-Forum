<p>Hard to tell based on just the output of your admin panel but it could be that the server / nginx is caching a lot of memory to improve performance. If you have shell access, you can see more details using for example the <code>top</code> command.</p>

<p>If caching is the case, there is nothing wrong with that, it just optimizes your memory use versus disk use.</p>
