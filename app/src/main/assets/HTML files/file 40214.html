<p>A Qt application relies upon Qt's libraries, which must be shipped with the application, inside the built application bundle. The steps for deploying a Qt application for OS X are detailed in the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/macosx-deployment.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not using any other libraries, besides those of Qt, you just need to run the tool <strong>macdeployqt</strong>, which is part of the Qt installation, in the bin directory. You can set this up to run as a build step in Qt Creator, but I suggest only doing it before you actually deploy the final bundle to another machine.</p>

<p>Calling macdeployqt will copy the necessary Qt frameworks into the bundle and setup the paths to the frameworks so that the binary in the bundle knows where to find them.</p>

<p>If you use any other frameworks or libraries, you need to copy those yourself and set the references to them using <a href="http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/install_name_tool/" rel="nofollow">install_name_tool</a></p>
