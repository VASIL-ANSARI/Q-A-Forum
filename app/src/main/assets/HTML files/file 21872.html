<p>Just try something like this. Dont think prepare likes variables</p>

<pre><code>$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('DELETE FROM :table WHERE id = :id');
$sth-&gt;execute(array(':table' =&gt; $table, ':id' =&gt; $file_upload_id));
</code></pre>

<p>If this done work try to echo out the sql and try it in phpmyadmin or mysql terminal if you got one.</p>
