<p>You should never save htmlentities in the database. If you want to generate something from database that isn't HTML what would you do?</p>

<p>You can save it exactly like you have it, for mysql save with <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> and then decode it with <code>htmlentities($field, ENT_QUOTES)</code>.</p>
