<p>I would implement two code paths</p>

<ul>
<li>one for XMLHttpRequest2 supporting Browsers using its file api (with easy to implement DnD support)</li>
<li>a fallback if XMLHttpRequest2 is not available (IE) that uses swfupload</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know if Dropbox supports DnD upload in IE, but my guess would be no.</p>
