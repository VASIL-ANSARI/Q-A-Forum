<p>Imagine simple DSL <em>that has a state</em> (very naiÌve implementation):</p>

<pre><code>@tasks = []
@current = nil

def desc text
  @current = Tasl.new(desc: text)
end

def task params, &amp;cb
  @current.update(params)
  yield
   ....
  @tasks &lt;&lt; @current
  @current = nil
end
</code></pre>

<p>The code above requires additional checks etc, but the idea is that: stateful DSL collects tasks with their descriptions.</p>
