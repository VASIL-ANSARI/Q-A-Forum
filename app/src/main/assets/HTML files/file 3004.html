<p>It seems to be you are trying to load <code>persistence.xml</code> as a Spring configuration file (probably, you added it to the file list when calling constructor of <code>FileSystemXmlApplicationContext</code>). You shouldn't do it, because <code>persistence.xml</code> is not a Spring configuration file.</p>

<p>It's a JPA configuration file, which should be placed into <code>META-INF</code> folder in your classpath.</p>
