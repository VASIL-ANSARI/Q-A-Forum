<p>First of all, my answer relates to WP7 + Async CTP, not WP8. However, I doubt this was changed in WP8.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My assumption is that navigation will not complete until the awaited
  call returns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong assumption. Navigation will complete on the first await.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>any exception inside my async method will crash the app completely</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily. You can subscribe to <code>TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException</code> event, and mark the exeption as observed by calling <code>UnobservedTaskExceptionEventArgs.SetObserved</code>. But I'd rather catch exceptions..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How likely is that you'll recommend it you to your friend or colleague?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It works OK if you understand what you're doing. However because the navigation will complete long before your async method will finish, the approach brings very little value.</p>

<p>P.S. My question "<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13283607/wp7-synchronous-web-request">WP7 synchronous web request</a>" on the related topic - no answer given :-(</p>
