<p>In your ZipEntry check the full path of zipEntryName, it must be something like: "music/Pink/try.mp3" just invoke a substring in order to obtain as zipEntryName "Pink/try.mp3", your zip file will be the same "songs.zip" but inside of it you'll find the folder "Pink" instead the main folder "music/Pink..."</p>

<p>It worked for me.</p>
