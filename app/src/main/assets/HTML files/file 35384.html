<p>edit: Oh wait, did I misunderstood the problem? You don't want to hide the slider but change the slider items just to show as a list?</p>

<p>You're not trying to hide the slider with that css, it does what it says: sets opacity to 1 on a scale from 0 to 1 sot it's fully visible.</p>

<p>Set the slider instead to display: none</p>

<pre><code>.single-portfolio .bxslider {
    display: none;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thou, I believe there's some setting where you could disable the usage of bxslider in portfolio page. But I don't know the theme so this will have to do.</p>
