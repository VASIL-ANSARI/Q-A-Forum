<p>I know first hand how frustrating those <em>Twilight zone</em> issues can be. There's obviously too little information to diagnose but I thought I'd share how I'd approach the debugging.</p>

<ol>
<li>Override the setter for switch_displayDetail, in there, log the value but also <code>self</code></li>
<li>Then in <code>viewWillAppear</code>, log the same thing</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a feeling we're not talking about the same instance here. If I'm right, the setter will display a value, but not <code>viewWillAppear</code>. If I'm wrong, then both will be nil and in that case either you're not calling the right <code>init</code> method, or your linkage isn't right in IB.</p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>
