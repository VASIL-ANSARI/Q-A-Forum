<p>Assuming your code snippets are accurate, your <code>setUp()</code> method instantiates a <code>shandler</code> field while your <code>testCreate()</code> test uses a <code>handler</code> field. And the stacktrace clearly shows that you have a NullPointerException in <code>testCreate()</code>. So the thing that you are doing wrong is trying to call a method on an object whose value is null.</p>
