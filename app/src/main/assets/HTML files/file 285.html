<p>The "Publish" target you are trying to invoke is for "OneClick" deployment, not for publishing a website...  This is why you are getting the seemingly bizarre message. 
You would want to use the AspNetCompiler task, rather than the MSBuild task.  See <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164291.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164291.aspx</a> for more info on this task.  Your "PublishDir" would correspond to the TargetPath property of the task. </p>
