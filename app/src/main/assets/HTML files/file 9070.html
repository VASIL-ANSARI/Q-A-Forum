<p>Caution: Excel and Excel-VBA use two different algorithms. </p>

<p>In Excel:</p>

<p><code>=ROUND(0.5,0)</code> returns 1. </p>

<p><code>=ROUND(1.5,0)</code> returns 2. </p>

<p>In Excel-VBA: </p>

<pre><code>Print Round(0.5,0)
 0 
Print Round(1.5,0)
 2 
</code></pre>

<p>VBA uses banker's rounding: rounds 0.5's to the nearest <em>even</em> integer. Note that the same logic transfers to lower-order decimal places if you <code>Round</code> to more decimal places. For example, <code>Round(0.05,1)</code> returns zero in Excel-VBA (as opposed to 0.1 in Excel). </p>

<p>This is one of the features of VBA I dislike most. It being inconsistent with Excel makes it even worse. </p>

<p>The number format makes no difference to this issue.</p>
