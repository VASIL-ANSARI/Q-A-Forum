<p>Using a LinkButton works for me in our <code>Login</code> control.  However, I noticed that your LinkButton has no text.  I've often-times had problems with links working properly when they're completely empty.  Does your LinkButton work when filled with text, even if it's an <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>?</p>
