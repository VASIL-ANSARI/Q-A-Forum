<p>You don't need to use a ScrollView with a ListView. As stated in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ScrollView.html" rel="nofollow">Android Dev docs</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should never use a ScrollView with a ListView, because ListView takes care of its own vertical scrolling. Most importantly, doing this defeats all of the important optimizations in ListView for dealing with large lists, since it effectively forces the ListView to display its entire list of items to fill up the infinite container supplied by ScrollView.</p>
