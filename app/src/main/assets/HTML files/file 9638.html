<p>There is no such thing as a Java "linker".  There is, however, the concept of a classloader which - given an array of java byte codes from "somewhere" - can create an internal representation of a Class which can then be used with <code>new</code> etc.</p>

<p>In this scenario interfaces are just special classes.  Methods and fields are available when the class has been loaded.</p>
