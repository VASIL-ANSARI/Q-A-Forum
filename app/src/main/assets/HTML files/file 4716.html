<p>Funny because copy-pasting "MySQL Connector/J" into Google got me the source code as the first result.</p>

<p>But if you're looking for source code for a free application, the most convenient way I've found is to look up the related package in Ubuntu (or Debian) and download the related source code.</p>

<p>It works best if you're using them, you can simply use aptitude search / apt-get source combo to download it. But if you're using another operating system, you can simply do a Google search like <code>site:packages.ubuntu.com mysql connector/j</code></p>
