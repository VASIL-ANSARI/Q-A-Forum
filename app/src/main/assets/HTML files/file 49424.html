<p>The timeout of a MySQL connection is defined in the /etc/my.cnf file in the <code>wait_timeout</code> server system variable. It's defaulted to 28800 (seconds) - we usually set it for our clients to a very low value - ranging from 10 seconds to 60 seconds. So, if you leave a connection unclosed, then it'll close, by default, after 28800 seconds (that's very high if you have a large number of clients using the app).</p>

<p>In your case, <code>interactive_timeout</code> doesn't apply, since you are not really using the console.</p>
