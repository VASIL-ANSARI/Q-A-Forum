<p>I think the problem was as follows:</p>

<p>the StructDescriptor for the 'O_FLIGHT_DETAILS' object was expecting an array containing 3 values, as per the SQL object.  Since the array supplied contained only 2 values, a mismatch occurred and exception was thrown.  The error message 'inconsistent java and sql object types' was accurate.</p>

<p>I changed the fltDetailFields instantiation line to:</p>

<pre><code>Object[] fltDetailFields = new Object[] { flightNum, flightDateUTC, null };
</code></pre>

<p>and it worked as expected.</p>
