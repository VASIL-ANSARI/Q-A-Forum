<p>I have implemented bundles in several apps and in all of them we have created a separate IAP productID for the bundles in addition to the individual item productIDs. This allows you full control over prices.</p>

<p>Then we just handle the activate/restore in the "provideContent:(NSString <em>)productId receipt:(NSData</em>)receipt" method. It is no more difficult to unlock multiple items as it is a single item.</p>

<p>We have not really worried to much about whether the user has already purchased an item that is in the bundle, or if they try to purchase something they already own. We pretty much leave it up to the user to keep that straight. If they want to spend their money, we let them. </p>

<p>You could always run a check before you submit the transaction to Apple to see if they already own the item and let them know.</p>
