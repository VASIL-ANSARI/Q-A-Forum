<p>Unless you're doing this as a learning experience, I suggest leveraging an existing implementation... avoid reinventing the wheel.  Differencing files efficiently is not a trivial undertaking.</p>

<p>There's a C# port of Google's Diff Match Patch</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/</a></p>

<p>You can compile that as C# into a DLL and then use the DLL from your VB.Net project.</p>

<p>Even if your objective is to learn, with such a complex topic, I would suggest studying an exiting implementation.</p>
