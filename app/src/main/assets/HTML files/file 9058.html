<p>No it isn't. The short version is that it wasn't considering inheritance of surrogates, and (for various reasons) most of the callbacks are only invoked by the effective base type of an inheritance chain (the exception here is OnDeserializing, which is invoked at sub-type levels as objects are created).</p>

<p>This is fixed in r414</p>
