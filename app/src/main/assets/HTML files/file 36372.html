<p>You have at least a couple of possibilities.</p>

<p>One would be to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363803.aspx" rel="nofollow">NTFS change journals</a> to track what files have been modified.</p>

<p>Each file also has an "archive" flag associated with it. This is typically used by backup programs. Any time you write to a file, the flag is set. When you copy/back it up, you clear the flag. When you want to see what files to copy/backup, you just check whether the flag is set or clear. Obvious problem: collisions with other backup programs.</p>

<p>There is also a <code>ReadDirectoryChangesW</code><sup>1</sup>. This, however, can only detect changes that happen while your code that uses it is running. So, to use it to track changes you need to do something like setting up a service that runs in the background all the time to keep track of changes. Depending on the file and how it gets modified, it's still possible for even this to miss changes that happen during boot (before your service starts executing).</p>

<p>I've listed these in roughly descending order of how well they seem to fit your needs--i.e., change journals are almost certainly the best fit, the archive flag second and <code>ReadDirectoryChangesW</code> (by quite a large margin) the worst fit for your apparent needs.</p>

1. There's also an older <code>FindFirstChangeNotification</code>/<code>FindNextChangeNotification</code>, but they're less versatile and have all the same shortcomings as <code>ReadDirectoryChangesW</code>. At one time they were useful for code that needed to be compatible with Windows 95/98/SE (since those didn't include <code>ReadDirectoryChangesW</code>) but it's been years since there was a good reason to use them.
