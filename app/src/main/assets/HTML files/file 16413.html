<p>Have you tried using <a href="https://github.com/archiloque/rest-client" rel="nofollow">rest-client</a>?</p>

<p>It is a gem and works quite nice. It is probably better than using <code>system()</code>or <code>%x()</code> and it is definitely more secure (You can inject malicious bash commands on <code>system()</code> so it needs to be used carefully).</p>

<p>It is quite simple to use. Just install the gem and require it one your ruby file.</p>

<p>NOTE: If using Rails just add it to your Gemfile(No need to require it on each file).</p>

<pre><code>require 'rest_client'

RestClient.get 'https://api.github.com/user/repos', {params: {id: 50, foo: 'bar'}}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use some params for <code>--insecure</code> ssl.</p>
