<p>A regex to match "190" between ~ symbols would be:</p>

<pre><code>/~190~/
</code></pre>

<p>If you're trying to match the eighth field in your ~ delimited file, split on ~, then take the eighth field. In Perl, for example:</p>

<pre><code>my @fields = split /~/, $string;
my $wanted = $fields[7];
</code></pre>

<p>Your question is fairly ambiguous as to what you're actually trying to do.</p>
