<p>I believe that this is what you are looking for:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM (
  SELECT name, date, SUM(volume) AS sumVolume, SUM(value) AS sumValue
  FROM table
  WHERE id = 12
  GROUP BY date
) AS TempTable 
ORDER BY TempTable.date DESC
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you the sums of volume and value for each day, then order the results for you by day.</p>

<p>The previous version with no 'group by' doesn't give you sum by dates correctly in many circumstances.</p>

<p>Using <code>ORDER BY TempTable.date</code> in the outer select statement clarifies that what you want presented in date order is the results of the inner query.</p>
