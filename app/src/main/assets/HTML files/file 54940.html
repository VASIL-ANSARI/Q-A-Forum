<p>First install the SVG Support plugin (and restrict it's use to adminstrators for security reasons). Then you'll encounter an error after uploading SVGs in which the 2nd step wants you to crop the image, but you can't do that for SVGs.  So do this:</p>

<p>to provide a button to "skip cropping" on the 2nd screen after selecting your svg image, which must be already cropped as the exact size you need.</p>

<p>All you need to do is take that array you defined above for custom header support, where you define the height and width, then add this:</p>

<pre><code>'flex-width'             =&gt; true,
'flex-height'            =&gt; true,
</code></pre>

<p>so for my own custom theme the full snippet is:</p>

<pre><code>function hikeitbaby_custom_header_setup() {
    add_theme_support( 'custom-header', apply_filters( 'hikeitbaby_custom_header_args', array(
        'default-image'          =&gt; '',
        'default-text-color'     =&gt; '000000',
        'width'                  =&gt; 190,
        'height'                 =&gt; 84,
        'flex-width'             =&gt; true,
        'flex-height'            =&gt; true,
        'wp-head-callback'       =&gt; 'hikeitbaby_header_style',
        'admin-head-callback'    =&gt; 'hikeitbaby_admin_header_style',
        'admin-preview-callback' =&gt; 'hikeitbaby_admin_header_image',
    ) ) );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'hikeitbaby_custom_header_setup' );
</code></pre>

<p>which will provide you with a screen like this:

<p>I've found that sometimes if you just click onto "skip cropping" and you've already had an image designated there before, you may encounter the site freezing. re-implementing svg header on dev site. To fix this, it's necessary to remove the pre-existing header image, save that change. Exit the customizer. Then go in and reapply the image, clicking "skip cropping" for it to not freeze.</p>

<p>As this question is a year old at this point, I hope this is useful to someone else.</p>
