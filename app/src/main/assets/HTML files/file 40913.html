<p>The service is using CloudFlare, which provides a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos" rel="nofollow">form of DDoS protection</a> that requires you to use a full web browser to connect.</p>

<p>Although you could likely work around it, by deciding to use this service, the site operators are declaring that they don't want you to connect using a script. </p>

<p>This is not a programming problem; you'll need to determine why the service is not available to scripts.</p>
