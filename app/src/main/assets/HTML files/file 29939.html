<p><strong>1. Do I have any disadvantages with my implementation (memory, time) ?</strong></p>

<p>Well, you are always initiating your db, even if you dont use it at all during that session, same goes for the other classes. Couldnt think of anything else, since you would use application context anyways, at least for database.</p>

<p><strong>2. Why do classes like Toast require a context at all?</strong></p>

<p>Toast requires a context since it touches the UiThread, so it needs a reference to access the thread.</p>
