<p>Your authentication seems a bit off from what I normally use. Also ApiKey  is only needed if you want to access public data.  </p>

<pre><code>string[] scopes = new string[] { YouTubeService.Scope.Youtube };


 // here is where we Request the user to give us access, or use the Refresh Token that was previously stored in %AppData%
UserCredential credential = GoogleWebAuthorizationBroker.AuthorizeAsync(new ClientSecrets { ClientId = clientId, ClientSecret = clientSecret }
, scopes
, "test"
, CancellationToken.None
, new FileDataStore("Daimto.YouTube.Auth.Store")).Result;

YouTubeService service = new YouTubeService(new YouTubeService.Initializer()
     {
     HttpClientInitializer = credential,
     ApplicationName = "YouTube Data API Sample",
     });
</code></pre>
