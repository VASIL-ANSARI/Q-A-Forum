<p>You need to maintain a mapping of old page url to new page url. You can keep this mapping in properties file, xml or database and the avi_redirect.jsp looks up this mapping and redirects to the new page.</p>

<p>Other thing you need to take is about the url parameters if they are same or not. If they are also not same then you need to a mapping for them as well.</p>
