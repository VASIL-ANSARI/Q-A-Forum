<p>Try</p>

<pre><code>dynamic data = serializer.Deserialize(json);
</code></pre>

<p>and then inspect the data object in the debugger - you may not need to deserialise to a fixed interface to get out the data you need. Using dynamic may also be a more robust solution to deal with upgrades to the service that may make a set interface/object more brittle. </p>
