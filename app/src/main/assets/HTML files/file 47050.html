<pre><code>def example():
    yield 'ip: {}'.format(ip)
    yield 'count: {}'.format(count)
</code></pre>

<p>What strikes me as strange in this solution is not the use of <code>yield</code> itself (which can be perfectly valid) but the fact that you're losing a lot of information by turning your data into strings prematurely.</p>

<p>In particular, for this kind of data, simply returning a dictionary and handling the sending in the caller seems more readable:</p>

<pre><code>def example():
    return {'ip': ip, 'count': count}
</code></pre>

<p>This also helps you separate content and presentation, which might be useful if you want, for example, to return data encoded in XML but later switch to JSON.</p>

<p>If you want to yield intermediate data, another possibility is using tuples: <code>yield ('ip', ip)</code>. In this way you keep the original data and can start processing the values immediately outside the function</p>
