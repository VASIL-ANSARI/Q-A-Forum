<p>If you want to stick with Payments Standard you could do that sort of thing using the "<a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/paypal-payments-standard/integration-guide/cart_upload/" rel="nofollow">cart upload command method</a>".  Your initial button could submit to your PHP script, which then compiles all the data into an HTTP request that gets posted to PayPal accordingly. This way you could check the pricing and things before it ever redirects to PayPal.</p>

<p>Another option, which I prefer, is to use the Express Checkout API's instead of Payments Standard.  This requires more coding knowledge and experience with web service API's in general, but the use of class libraries like my <a href="https://github.com/angelleye/paypal-php-library" rel="nofollow">PHP library for PayPal</a> can make it very simple for even novice PHP coders. It comes with fully functional samples, so you could get Express Checkout implemented pretty quickly and easily. </p>

<p>When working with the API's the user can't see any hidden fields or anything in the code. Express Checkout also has lots more features and fewer restrictions than PayPal Standard.</p>
