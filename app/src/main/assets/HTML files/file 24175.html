<p>Doing some testing, I tried to add to datavalue2 property the same condition as in datavalue, thats it, firing the property changed event after updating the value</p>

<pre><code>        public int datavalue2
        {
            get
            {
                return mydatavalue2;
            }
            set{
                mydatavalue2 = value;
                if (PropertyChanged != null)
                {
                    PropertyChanged(this,
                        new PropertyChangedEventArgs(
                        "datavalue2"));
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisingly it worked althought it shouldnt be necessary to use it. I was wondering if this could make some incompatibilities as far as throwing 2 events if I modified it directly, but it worked fine, only one event throwed for textbox2... Still I do feel uneasy for this approach.</p>
