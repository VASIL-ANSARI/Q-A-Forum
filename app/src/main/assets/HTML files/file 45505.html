<p>It appears that your <code>@ManagedProperty</code> markup may have been the problem, in that <code>(value = "#{BeanFactory}")</code> should have been <code>(value = "#{beanFactory}")</code>, unless your BeanFactory class was specifically named "BeanFactory" in the @ManagedBean markup within it.  </p>

<p>By default, beans annotated with @ManagedBean will be mapped to their class name, but the first character will be lower case, e.g.: "BeanFactory" becomes mapped as "beanFactory", FooBean becomes "fooBean".</p>
