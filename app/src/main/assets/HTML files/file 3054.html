<p>You can try the <a href="http://crstylecop.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=30407" rel="nofollow">StyleCop for CodeRush</a> plugin. You only need to install the <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/DXCore/" rel="nofollow">DXCore</a> plugin from DevExpress (which is free). One warning: this project is in alpha and there doesn't seem to be any activity.</p>
