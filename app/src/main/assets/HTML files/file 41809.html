<p>An exception is being thrown, but the caller (e.g. in libFontParser and libTrueTypeScaler) is handling it and it is not reaching your program.</p>

<p>Unless you see other evidence of a problem (such as a log message) or the exception reaches your program, assume that the implementation is handling it. You can continue past these instances in the debugger without worry.</p>
