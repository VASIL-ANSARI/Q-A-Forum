<p>All of the widgets created in <code>_make_layout</code> are created without a parent. This means they're children of the default root. You need to pass a parent to each of them, the same way you do to the <code>Frame</code>. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>self.frame.user_name_label = Label(self.frame, text="User name:")
self.frame.user_name_text = Entry(self.frame)
# etc.
</code></pre>

<p>When I run your exact code, I don't get a second window, on any platform I try. The closest I get is on OS X, where an entry for the default root window appears in the Window menu, but the window itself still doesn't appear and the widgets all end up on the <code>Toplevel</code> (although not on the <code>Frame</code> where you wanted them). But it certainly would be legal for Tkinter to show a second window here, and put some or all of your widgets on it.</p>
