<p>The queue runners you are starting there are multiple threads loading data from disk and adding it to the queue. <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.11/tensorflow/models/image/cifar10/cifar10_input.py#L117" rel="nofollow">There are 16 of them by default</a>. </p>

<p>The queue itself is thread-safe, but there is nothing enforcing order.</p>

<p>So even though you're not using the shuffling queue, the race-condition between the threads to fetch and insert the items randomizes the order slightly.</p>

<p>The easiest way to make it completely repeatable is to only use 1 thread to fetch items. This will probably be slow.</p>
