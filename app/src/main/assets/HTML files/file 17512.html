<p>The issue was due to the fact that I <strong>wasn't</strong> using a dummy data source for round trips. I was performing the same databinding even when there was no data to bind to. The reason it worked for the featured listings was due to the fact that there are empty solts that will get rendered even if there is no data for them. So basically I needed to loop through the items again and render them without databinding after a postback.</p>
