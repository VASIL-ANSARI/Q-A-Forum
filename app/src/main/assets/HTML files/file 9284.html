<p>first of all, the global variable current should be defined before the handler starts(3),because the function goto which called in start() need this "current".</p>

<p>then, the sentence</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$('#my_div').html("Hiding all " +
  maximum + " sets and showing set #" +
  current + "..." + sankar[current] +
  "..");</p>
</blockquote>

<p>set the innerHTML of a div with id my_div which not found in the context.
and in the setting handler there are three variables,'maximum
 and 'current' are ok, but 'sankar[current]' is not defined in context.</p>

<p>so fix these problems, the code will be ok.</p>
