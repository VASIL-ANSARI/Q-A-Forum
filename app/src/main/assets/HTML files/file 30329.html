<p>To show my mate this is possibly true, I did some benchmarking with <code>None, 0</code> and <code>False</code>:</p>

<p>I have read before this question, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3647692/when-is-the-operator-not-equivalent-to-the-is-operator-python">When is the `==` operator not equivalent to the `is` operator? (Python)</a>. And I even added some benchmarking to try and convince my mates that this could be optimized:</p>

<pre><code>In [92]: def TestInt():
   ....:     i = 0
   ....:     if i:
   ....:         pass
   ....:     

In [93]: def TestBool():
   ....:     i = False
   ....:     if i:
   ....:         pass
   ....:     

In [95]: def TestNone():
   ....:     i = None
   ....:     if i:
   ....:         pass
   ....:     


In [97]: timeit.timeit(TestInt, number=10**5)
Out[97]: 0.01352691650390625

In [98]: timeit.timeit(TestBool, number=10**5)
Out[98]: 0.014671087265014648

In [99]: timeit.timeit(TestNone, number=10**5)
Out[99]: 0.009851932525634766
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously comparing if an object is not <code>None</code> is always a little bit faster!</p>
