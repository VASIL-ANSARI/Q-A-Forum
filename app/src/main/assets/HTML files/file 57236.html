<p>While you don't need to use the DataMember attribute to decorate your service types (WCF will still serialize them, as long as they only contain serializable types), you should generally still use the attribute. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>without [DataContract], you cannot define an XML namespace for your data to live in</li>
  <li>without [DataMember], you cannot serialize non-public properties or fields</li>
  <li>without [DataMember], you cannot define an order of serialization (Order=) and the DCS will serialize all properties alphabetically</li>
  <li>without [DataMember], you cannot define a different name for your property (Name=)</li>
  <li>without [DataMember], you cannot define things like IsRequired= or other useful attributes</li>
  <li>without [DataMember], you cannot leave out certain public properties - all public properties will be serialized by the DCS</li>
  </ul>
