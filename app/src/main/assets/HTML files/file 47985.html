<p>When you try to <code>pickle.load</code> the <code>tmp_dict</code>, the modules for any of the objects in the incoming data stream need to be loaded.</p>

<p>So yes, you were in fact doing an <code>import</code> call when the error was thrown: you were unpickling an object of some type that needed <code>ICgen_settings</code>. NB: unpickling code can run arbitrary Python statements. Never unpickle objects you don't trust!</p>

<p>Now, as to why it's "clearly found <code>ICgen_settings</code>": No, just being in a file called <code>ICgen_settings.py</code> does not mean that the line <code>import ICgen_settings</code> will succeed. Whether the import succeeds depends on <code>sys.path</code>, which originates from your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable. It also depends on the module layout of <code>ICgen_settings</code>: normally, it would be an <code>ICgen_settings</code> <strong>folder</strong> (not file) containing a <code>__init__.py</code> file.</p>
