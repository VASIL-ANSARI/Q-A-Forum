<p><code>Method</code> is the class of all methods you can extract from a <code>Module</code>. If you want to define methods dynamically, use <code>define_method</code>, as methods can't be defined unbound (even though there is <code>UnboundMethod</code>. What you're looking for is <code>Proc.new</code> to define an anonymous method. If you want to bind that method, you can use <code>define_method(:method_name, &amp;proc_you_defined)</code>.</p>
