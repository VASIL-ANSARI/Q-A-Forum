<p>In order to support faster build times, the r16 tools are creating their own jar files inside of Android Library Projects.  You can use this feature to solve this issue.  If you would like to release your Android Library Project but without source code, you can make a copy of that Android Library Project that contains everything except for the source code tree.  Next, include the jar file from the original Android Library Porject (the one that the r16 tools built.)  This will allow you to have a component you can distribute that does not require source code.  The consumer of this new Android Library Project will need to manually add any necessary meta data to their own project's AndroidManifest.xml file as needed (Activities, Providers, Permissions, etc).</p>
