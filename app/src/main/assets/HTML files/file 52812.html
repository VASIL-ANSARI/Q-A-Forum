<p>If you have any row in your table this will always be false:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT `shippingid` FROM `table`)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems you might need to add correlation:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT `shippingid` FROM `table` WHERE shippingid = view.shipment_id)
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that, theoretically, sub-queries execute once for every row of outer query. So to understand the flow.. take some sample data and understand how the query will produce results.</p>
