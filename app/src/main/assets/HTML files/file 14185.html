<p>there's an suhosin setting <code>suhosin.request.max_vars</code> but that's only for suhosin, not regular php.</p>

<p>since php 5.3.9 theres <code>max_input_vars</code>, which seems to fit the behavior

<p>apache has settings to limit request size, but they're specified in bytes, not number of variables, as far as I know. I'd imagine apache would just stop and issue abad request instead of truncating the data like you're seeing.</p>
