<p><strike>As far as I can tell the javascript is only detecting when the height grows greater than the width and vice versa.  So when you change your browser size to a height > width it will launch the event.  This seems to be the expected behavior of the function, I am not sure how to circumvent that for your use.  </strike></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I found that when you check the window.orientation property when the event is fired you can see that it is still set to landscape.  Maybe try filtering your landscape only code by putting it inside an if statement?  See <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/sJ9Hx/2/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/sJ9Hx/2/</a></p>

<pre><code>$(window).on('orientationchange', function (e) {
    if(window.orientation == 0){
        alert("Portrait");
    }
    else{
        alert("Landscape");
    }   
});
</code></pre>
