<p>Here is one idea, but I have not tried it: </p>

<p>The <code>UITabBarController</code> has a property <code>moreNavigationController</code>, which is a plain <code>UINavigationController</code>. Unfortunately it is <code>readonly</code>, so subclassing won't help, but you can most likely still manipulate it by setting a different <code>topViewController</code>. </p>

<p>This seems worth a try. Let us know if it works.</p>
