<p>maybe an image of what is the problem could help, but anyway you should take care about the size of tiles.
On most of the devices the size of the tiles (or how gmaps tiles the world) is 256x256 px, but on devices with higher density (I had experience with a Nexus 10), the size of tiles is 512x512. It means that if you have/download a tile that is 256 and show at 512 it decreases quality.
Look at here:

<blockquote>
  <p>When creating images for a tile layer, you will need to create an
  image for each tile at each zoom level that you wish to support.
  Google Maps targets 256 dp (device-independent pixels) when displaying
  tiles. For high resolution devices, it is recommended that you return
  high dpi tiles (512x512 px). Refer to the Android Developers
  documentation for information on supporting different screen sizes and
  densities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are using an URLTileProvider you can give the size in the constructor, if you are using custom created tiles you should either create 2 version of the tiles (for normal/high densities), or simply create high densities and let the system do the downscaling for normal devices.</p>

<p>If the problem is not this, please attach a picture of your issue!</p>
