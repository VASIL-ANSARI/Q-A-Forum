<p>Sorry to hear that you're having issues with py2neo. I haven't carried out any testing under Windows since I only run Linux so I'm unsure whether there are any general incompatibilities there. I am also aware that error reporting is less than it should be which has been limited by the amount of time I've had to work on the project.</p>

<p>That said, I notice that you are running on port 4747 instead of the default 7474 - or this this a typo? Have you tried your short cURL test against the root database URI directly?</p>

<p>You seem to have covered all the bases looking at the layers involved so I'm unsure what else to look at here. I have considered adding an option to be able to switch between the curl_httpclient and the simple_httpclient - this may give an alternative to try. I will try to get something put up over the next few days.</p>
