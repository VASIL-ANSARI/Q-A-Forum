<p>Borrowing a tip from a module for mongoose that provides an easy way to work with base schemas and differentiate different types of models in the same collection (aka 'tables' in dynamodb) you could add a <code>_type</code> property to each model's schema and use that as a hint to deserialize them with the right class.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><strong>JSON representation for Class B</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
  "foo" : ["some string-a", "some string-b", "some string-c"],
  "bar" : 890,
  "maz" : {"x":-11, "y": 0, "z":89},
  "_type" : "modelA"
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>JSON representation for Class B</strong></p>

<pre><code>{
  "abo" : [{"key": "val", "anotherKey": "anotherValue"}]
  "seq" : [4, 7, 1, 3],
  "_type" : "modelB"
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may or may not want to remove <code>_type</code> property when serialising to JSON (if you decide it's useful to have exposed on the object you could just name it <code>type</code>).</p>

<p>I've used this approach in the past in conjunction with a routine to automatically treat all properties beginning with "_" as private fields and just stripping them when serialising to JSON (e.g. <code>_password</code> for password hashes in User objects, and for other metadata that I'd don't intent to directly expose).</p>
