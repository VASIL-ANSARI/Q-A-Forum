<p>There is a ticket opened for it in Android project: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=29939" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=29939</a>.</p>

<p>Seems the problem is confirmed by Google, as the first comment is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i think we should rewrite this to use the same underlying libcore
  stuff, and get the interruption behavior for free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The workaround can be to send a custom shutdown command to the LocalServerSocket from another thread to unblock accept. </p>
