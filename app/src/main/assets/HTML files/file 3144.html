<p>The <code>&amp;</code> operator is the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/600202/understanding-phps-operator">bitwise AND operator</a>. <code>0x0000FFFF</code> represents 16 unset bits (zeroes) followed by 16 set bits (ones) in hexadecimal.
<code>$lat &amp; 0x0000FFFF</code> will then give you the 16 least significant bits (on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" rel="nofollow">little endian machine</a>, which is the most common architecture) of $lat.</p>

<p>As to why is that needed here it depends on what does <code>self::derive_peano_32()</code> do. I'd imagine it takes two 16 bit values and concatenate them somehow so they fit in a regular 32 bit integer.</p>
