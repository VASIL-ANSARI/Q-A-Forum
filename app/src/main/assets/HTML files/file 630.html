<p>First off, use cookie based only unless you have a very specific good business reason not to. I had a client that insisted on url based sessions only for a project. very insecure and a pain to work with.</p>

<p>One good idea is to regenerate the session on each request. this makes hijack much less likely. For example.</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
$old_sessionid = session_id();
session_regenerate_id();
$new_sessionid = session_id();
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing that is good practice is if you are doing some kind of user login as part of the system, completely invalidate and empty the session data on a logout to insure that the user is truly logged out of the system. I have seen systems where logout is just accomplished by removing the session cookie.</p>
