<p>Instead of locking, I would advise to use a collection that is thread-safe. Now, when at the same time the <code>Add</code> method is called by multiple threads / tasks, the collection can become invalid. For me, it is easier to use thread-safe collections than <code>lock</code> for example. Also, <code>lock</code> is quite hard to use when your collection is used by multiple classes.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/251267/dave-black">Dave Black</a> pointed out in a comment, the thread-safe collections use lock-free synchronization which is must faster than taking a lock, as you can read on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997305(v=vs.110).aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN</a>.</p>

<p>One of the collections you can use is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd381779%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ConcurrentBag&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, which can be compared to <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
