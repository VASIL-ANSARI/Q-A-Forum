<p>No, they are not the same:</p>

<pre><code>glOrtho(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1);
</code></pre>

<p>will just generate a <code>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</code> error, and the commend has no further effect. The error occurs when left==right or top==bottom or near==far. (If it did not check for that condition, a division by zero would occur).</p>

<pre><code>glOrtho(-1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1);
</code></pre>

<p>is effectively doing nothing, as it will multiply the current matrix by an identity matrix.</p>

<p>It might appear as if those commands have the same result, but what actually happens is quite different.</p>
