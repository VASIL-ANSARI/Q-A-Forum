<p>I'd guess it's because the new classloader isn't a child of the classloader that loaded <code>MyInterface</code>, which means you end up with two different classes which aren't the same despite being to all appearances identical. Try changing</p>

<pre><code>return (MyInterface) new ClassLoader() {
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>return (MyInterface) new ClassLoader(MyInterface.class.getClassLoader()) {
</code></pre>
