<p>No it doesn't support openGL ES 2.0. My previous phone was a rooted HTC Magic too and I was looking if it's able to support oGL ES 2.0. The the documentation says, that Android 2.2  <strong>supports</strong> it, but this doesn't mean that every device running 2.2 is capable to support it. I'm not completely sure, but I think that it's hardware and/or driver related.</p>

<p>Hope it helps</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Bottom of the page under the Hardware support!
