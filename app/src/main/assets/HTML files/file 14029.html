<p>If you really want to do this without javascript (I don't think there's anything wacky about it nowadays) you could put your "podium components" in invisible <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements and place them inside each item in your left-hand gallery. Kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id="gallery"&gt;
    &lt;li id="item1"&gt;
        Left-hand item 1
        &lt;div class="hidden-data"&gt;
            Your podium component's content here
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="item2"&gt;
        Left-hand item 2
        &lt;div class="hidden-data"&gt;
            Another podium component
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can create a <code>:hover</code> style for the list items to make them visible only when the mouse is over it. You won't need an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> for this solution and I think it would be more optimal, except if you have a huge amount of items in your left-hand gallery.</p>

<p>Placing the podium components to the right where you want them could be done by setting their <code>position</code> as <code>absolute</code>. I'll leave it to you to find out how they work (hint: you'll need to set a parent element as <code>position: relative</code> - but not just any parent element, choose wisely!) :)</p>
