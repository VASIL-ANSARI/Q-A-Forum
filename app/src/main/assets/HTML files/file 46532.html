<p>I was able to solve the problem.
I mostly copied the <a href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/orm/extensions/associationproxy.html" rel="nofollow">association proxy tutorial from the official doc</a>
Here are some pitfalls and tips for other people who struggle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write your association class after the classes you want to join.
(Obvious for most of us, but it doesn't hurt to check)</li>
<li>Add an <code>__init__</code> function to your association class!</li>
<li>Double check your backrefs, class and table names.
I've myself not looked through when to use which keyword, but most of the time there is your mistake.</li>
</ul>
