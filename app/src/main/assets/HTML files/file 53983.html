<p>I suspect your question is "why is chaining <code>.replace</code> acting oddly" and the array is not changing. You can prove that replace does not change the array quite easily:</p>

<pre><code>    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(list));
    encrypt("abc");
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(list));
</code></pre>

<p>So what is going on with your code? Each time you replace a letter you end up with a new string, that again you replace letters on. I don't have your full source code so I'll show with a real simple version:</p>

<pre><code>a = a.replace("a", "b");
a = a.replace("b", "c");
a = a.replace("c", "d");
</code></pre>

<p>For "abc" is.... 'ddd'.</p>

<p>The answer to this is to look at each letter at a time and change it. Loop through the string and create a new one.</p>
