<p>Inside the loop you will need to compute <strong>printingTable</strong> based on matching it from the input you gather.</p>

<p>Something like this might work to compute <strong>printingTable</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>printingTable = inputLine.contains("table");
</code></pre>

<p>That's extremely crude, but may work well enough for this case.</p>

<p>Right now the code is printing lines if <strong>printingTable</strong> is <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong> and doesn't update <strong>printingTable</strong> from it's initial value of <strong>false</strong>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, there are some really good HTML5 parsing libraries for Java like the Validator.nu HTML Parser:
<a href="https://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/" rel="nofollow">https://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/</a></p>

<p>It provides SAX, DOM, and other modes of parsing.  DOM is likely the best as you can likely get the whole subtree of the table easily and pick out elements one by one with it.</p>

<p>I've used this to do web mining of pretty messy data sources at work and it makes it much more manageable.  I'll ask for permission to publish a webmining guide I wrote back in 2011.</p>
