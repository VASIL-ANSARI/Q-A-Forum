<p>If you want to have a <code>VIEW</code> where you can't update/delete data, add a distinct (e.g. on a unique key, where it essentially doesn't have an effect).</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/view-updatability.html" rel="nofollow">MySQL Ref</a> on updatable views:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are also certain other constructs that make a view nonupdatable. To be more specific, a view is not updatable if it contains any of the following:</p>
  
  <p>Aggregate functions (SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), and so forth)</p>
  
  <p>DISTINCT</p>
  
  <p>GROUP BY</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
