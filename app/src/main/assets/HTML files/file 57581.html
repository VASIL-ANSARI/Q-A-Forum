<p>Bad request occurs when the json is invalid, here this error is because you have an Object there called "email", and then on Button1 click you are defining new variable called 'email'. Here instead of referring to the previous email object you are creating new variable and trying to assign values to its members when there is no member for "var email". try doing something like this</p>

<pre><code>Object email = new Object();
email.subject =$("#Text1").val();
email.body = $("#Text1").val();
</code></pre>

<p>And now stringify this 'email' object, but make sure that at server side you receive the same object as email, because if sending and receiving objects doesn't match it throws bad request.</p>
