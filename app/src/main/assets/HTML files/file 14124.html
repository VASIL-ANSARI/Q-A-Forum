<p>like many other things , gps listener can only be listened to by a loopy thread (like the ui thread) . the easiest thing to do would be to it via the ui thread . </p>

<p>also , the gps listener isn't named like this for no reason . only when it gets a location (and that could take time) , it will call the method "onLocationChanged" . 
you don't need to have asyncTask for this , since all of the calls to "requestLocationUpdates" are asynchronous anyway...</p>
