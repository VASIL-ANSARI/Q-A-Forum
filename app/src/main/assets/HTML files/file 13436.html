<p>In Storm Sim I did a folder reference for the audio samples with the files structured inside subfolders so I could keep them organized in a somewhat sane way. </p>

<p>Instead of using the standard get resource calls I just ask for the app's main bundle directory and the referenced folder is inside the main app folder with the appropriate subfolders under it.</p>

<p>Let me know if you need a code sample.</p>
