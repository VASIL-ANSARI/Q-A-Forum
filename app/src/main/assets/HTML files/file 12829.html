<p>If you have a <strong>Mac</strong> you can get <code>jsc</code> a javascript console in OS X (Terminal) by typing</p>

<pre><code>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/jsc
</code></pre>

<p>in <strong>Terminal.app</strong>.</p>

<p>You could also run one of your .js script by adding its name as an argument for jsc, like this:</p>

<pre><code>jsc your_awesome_script_name.js
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Notice</strong>: I use <code>console.log()</code> during development but jsc needs the <code>debug()</code> function instead.</p>

<p>On <strong>Ubuntu</strong> you have some nice <a href="http://discerning.com/burstproject.org/build/doc/shells.html">ECMAScript shells</a> at your disposal. Between them it's worth to mention <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey">SpiderMonkey</a></strong>. You can add It by <code>sudo apt-get install spidermonkey</code></p>

<p>On <strong>Windows</strong> as other people said you can rely on <code>cscript</code> and <code>wscript</code> directly built on the OS.</p>

<p>I would add also another :) <em>way of thinking to the problem</em>, if you have time and like to learn new things i'd like to mention <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffee-script</a> that has its own compiler/console and gives you super-correct Javascript out. You can try it also on your browser (link "try coffeescript").</p>
