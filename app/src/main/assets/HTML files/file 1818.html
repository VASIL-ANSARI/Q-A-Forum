<p>With your specific example you could use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern" rel="nofollow">decorator</a> pattern in conjunction with interfaces to supplement your <code>Word</code> class with additional functionality; e.g.</p>

<pre><code>// *Optional* interface, useful if we wish to reference Words along with
// other classes that support the concept of "length".
public interface Length {
  int getLength();
}

// Decorator class that wraps another Word and provides additional
// functionality.  Could add any additional fields here too.
public class WordExt extends AbstractWord implements Length {
  private final Word word;

  public class(Word word) {
    this.word = word;
  }

  public int getLength() {
    return word.getKind().length();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In addition it's worth noting that the lack of multiple inheritence in Java isn't really the issue here; it's more a case of reworking your design.  In general it's considered bad practice to over-use inheritence as deep inheritence hierarchies are difficult to interpret / maintain.</p>
