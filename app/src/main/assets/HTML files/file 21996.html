<p>Two possible explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Color.FromValues</code> might need to lookup the ICC profile for each call, which is expensive (At least, orders of magnitude more expensive than creating a new simple Color object)</li>
<li>If <code>Color.FromValues</code> caches the profile, there might be a problem with your particular profile, causing the caching to not work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, since <code>FromValues</code> requires disk access, and <code>FromRgb</code> is a very simple arithmetic operation followed by the creation of a single <code>Color</code> object, <code>FromValues</code> IS going to be orders of magnitude slower. I tried a simple benchmark and got:</p>

<pre><code>FromValues 37.6278 ms
FromRgb     0.0029 ms
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems that FromValues is about 10000 times slower than FromRgb, at least on my system.</p>
