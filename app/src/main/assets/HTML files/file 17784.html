<p>I don't think you can do it in a single operation, especially the truncating part. Note that e.g. <code>printf("%2s", "hello");</code> will <em>not</em> truncate, in C. The field width only matters for padding purposes, not truncating.</p>

<p>You will probably need to implement a custom function to do this, something like this in C:</p>

<pre><code>void format_pair(char *out, size_t out_max, const char *s1, const char *s2);
</code></pre>
