<p>If both your client application and WCF service are hosted in same application (actually virtual application in IIS), you can share your session state.</p>

<p>But you need to enable ASP.Net compability mode within your WCF (see this: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752234.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752234.aspx</a>)</p>

<p>If your applications are hosted in different applications, you can still do it, but you must use an external storage for you session, like a Session State server (see more here: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178586%28v=vs.140%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178586%28v=vs.140%29.aspx</a>).</p>

<p>You proceed the same way, but you must set in both web.config files the same session storage.</p>

<p>Hope it helps. </p>
