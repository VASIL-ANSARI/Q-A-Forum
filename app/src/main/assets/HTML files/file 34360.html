<p>The command </p>

<pre><code>thrift -r --gen py tutorial.thrift
</code></pre>

<p>uses the <code>-r[recurse]</code> switch to automatically build a second, included IDL file <code>shared.thrift</code>. This <code>shared.thrift</code> file is located in the same folder as <code>tutorial.thrift</code> is. Because Thrift looks for included files based on the current folder, you have to explicitly call the Thrift compiler from that folder. </p>

<p>Assumed, your Thrift working copy is under C:\Thrift and the <code>thrift.exe</code> is reachable via search path, open a command prompt, navigate to that folder and enter the command again:</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt; cd Thrift\tutorial
C:\Thrift\tutorial&gt; thrift.exe -r --gen py tutorial.thrift
</code></pre>

<p><sub>PS: The 0.9.0 is slightly outdated. The 0.9.1 is fine, the forthcoming release 0.9.2 will have even more improvements.</sub></p>
