<p>I get the following exception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ColumnName is required when it is part of a DataTable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I guess that tells you everything, the ColumnName needs to be something. I was able to get it working providing one space: <code>" "</code></p>

<pre><code>dt.Columns["Sno"].ColumnName = " ";
</code></pre>

<p>Is that an option for you?</p>
