<p><code>NSUndoManager</code> has <code>disableUndoRegistration</code> and <code>enableUndoRegistration</code> methods to allow this. You need to intercept the operations that you don't want to be undoable and disable/enable the undo manager as appropriate. Note that calls to enable and disable must balance (don't call one without also calling (or having called) the other. It is also your responsibility to ensure that undoing any operation doesn't result in invalid state (this is the purpose of <code>beginUndoGrouping</code>).</p>
