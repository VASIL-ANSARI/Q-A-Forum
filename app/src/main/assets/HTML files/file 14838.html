<p>It is called <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html" rel="nofollow">signals and slots</a> is implemented by the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/moc.html" rel="nofollow">Qt meta-object compiler moc</a>. The <code>moc</code> also adds an introspection system to pre-processed classes. There are also exist signal/slot implementations that don't require a special preprocessing step such as <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/signals.html" rel="nofollow">Boost.Signals</a> and <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/signals2.html" rel="nofollow">Boost.Signals2</a>. I wouldn't consider signals and slots more or less OOP than normal message passing through function calls, but that is argumentative and not really relevant.</p>
