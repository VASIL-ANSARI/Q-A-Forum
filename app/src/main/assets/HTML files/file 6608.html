<p>You can generally get better performance for a specific goal by using UDP and handling more of the network issues yourself. TCP and fancier things built on top of it try to give you reliable, ordered communications with a sense of connected sessions, but their means of insuring reliability aren't necessarily going to be the ones that are most optimum for you.  On the other hand, they are easier since they do more of the work for you.</p>
