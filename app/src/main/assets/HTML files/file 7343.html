<p>I have found the problem.  It turns out that if the time stamp on your oAuth call is incorrect, the server returns a 401 status error which on Android devices causes the "Received authentication challenge is null" exception to be thrown.  All of the devices that were having this problem had incorrect times, and fixing the times fixed the problem.</p>
