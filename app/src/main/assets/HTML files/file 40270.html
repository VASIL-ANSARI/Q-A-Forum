<p>This is the same idea, but with a few improvements. Convert your <code>list</code> of stopwords to a <code>set</code> for faster lookups. Then you can iterate over your phrase list in a list comprehension. You can then iterate over the words in the phrase, and keep them if they're not in the stop set, then <code>join</code> the phrase back together.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lis = ['aka', 'this is a good day', 'a pretty dog']
&gt;&gt;&gt; stopwords = ['a', 'dog']
&gt;&gt;&gt; stop = set(stopwords)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [' '.join(j for j in i.split(' ') if j not in stop) for i in lis]
['aka', 'this is good day', 'pretty']
</code></pre>
