<p>This appears to be a very popular topic as there has been a couple of PRs and issues related to this. Here is the latest <a href="https://github.com/abailly/jparsec/pull/16" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/abailly/jparsec/pull/16</a> that made it to release 2.1 (available in maven central). There was a lengthy discussion (<a href="https://github.com/abailly/jparsec/issues/5" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/abailly/jparsec/issues/5</a>) with various solutions envisioned but we decided not to include the <code>Locatable</code> feature (yet?). </p>

<p>So basically, starting from 2.1 you can use <code>withSource()</code> combinator or the "old-fashioned" INDEX parsers that return parsed position in the stream. Here is a proposal from @fluentfuture:</p>

<pre><code>Mapper.curry(LocationAnnotated.class).sequence(Parsers.INDEX, parser, Parsers.INDEX);

public class LocationAnnotated&lt;T&gt; {
   public LocationAnnotated(int begin, T value, int end) {...}
}
</code></pre>
