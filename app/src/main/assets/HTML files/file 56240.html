<p>The 4 <code>#define</code>s in your question are not made available to Swift, see the section titled Complex Macros at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithCAPIs.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithCAPIs.html</a></p>

<p>If you want to have their equivalents available in Swift, you will need to re-implement them in Swift.  A simple approach, assuming the macro parameter is of type <code>UInt32</code> as it is in your example, might be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>func swiftMask8(x:UInt32) -&gt; UInt32
{
    return x &amp; 0xFF
}

func swiftR(x:UInt32)-&gt;UInt32
{
    return swiftMask8(x)
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can drop the <code>swift</code> part and just call the functions <code>Mask8</code>, 'R`, etc., since their Objective-C equivalents are not visible to Swift anyway.</p>
