<p>The source code is pretty trivial and there is no conditional branching (<code>if</code>) around the blog link.</p>

<p>Therefore, the only explanation is that the code running in production is not the one you have in development.</p>

<p>Make sure your deploy was successful. Inspect your server folder to make sure the code is in there. Also make sure the webserver was restarted, otherwise it may still be serving the previously deployed code. For Passenger and Nginx you need (unless it changed) to <code>touch</code> the <code>restart.txt</code> file inside the <code>/tmp/restart.txt</code> project folder in order to perform a Passenger restart (without obviously restarting the entire Nginx process).</p>
