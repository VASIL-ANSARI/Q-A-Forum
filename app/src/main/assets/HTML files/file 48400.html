<p>For Intent of Android, there are only two types like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Explicit Intents have specified a component (via setComponent(ComponentName) or setClass(Context, Class)), which
  provides the exact class to be run. Often these will not include any
  other information, simply being a way for an application to launch
  various internal activities it has as the user interacts with the
  application.</li>
  <li>Implicit Intents have not specified a component; instead, they must include enough information for the system to determine which of the
  available components is best to run for that intent.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, whether you set component or set class, that will be explicit intent.(<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_VIEW" rel="nofollow">read more here</a>)</p>
