<p>You only need to specify the Domain if you want to limit the cookie to a specific section of your website. The cookie will only be included in the request if it is in the correct scope.</p>

<p>By setting the Domain to "domain.com", you are saying that the cookie will only be available to "domain.com", so you won't detect it from localhost (or from any other domain other than domain.com").</p>

<p>You will also notice that if you try and send a browser a cookie from a domain other than your own, the browser will bin it.</p>
