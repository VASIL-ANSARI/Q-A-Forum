<p>In a word, yes.  There isn't any reason for the SD card to be involved at all.  I've used receipt printers that are connected via Bluetooth.  Since yours is built in, it's likely to be USB.  Hopefully the manufacturer publishes a well-documented SDK for the printer, but don't count on it.  I had to write my own frame-based serial protocols and receipt formatters.  There's probably not a printing queue unless you write one.</p>
