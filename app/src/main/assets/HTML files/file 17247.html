<p>You could possibly try subscribing to the <code>GotFocus</code> event on the UserControl.</p>

<p>Caveat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because this event uses bubbling routing, the element that receives focus might be a child element instead of the element where the event handler is actually attached. Check the Source in the event data to determine the actual element that gained focus.</p>
