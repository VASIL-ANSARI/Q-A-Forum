<p>Well generally there shouldnt be a concern, my issue is why are you getting the quantity and then using it to subtract it and update it again, when everything can be done in one step. I am assuming those 2 methods are making some call to a database. In MYsql you can do something like</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE yourtable SET quantity = quantity-1 WHERE id = ....
</code></pre>

<p>That way the deduction happens in your database and you are saving one query...</p>
