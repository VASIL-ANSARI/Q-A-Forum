<p>For every project I start off with one CoreBundle, where I put everything together. Then I just develop features in it and as time goes I reevaluate it - if I might use this feature somewhere else someday (or even release to open source), I move it to a new bundle.</p>

<p>"Size" of the feature worth separate bundle doesn't really matter - I've seen OS bundles as big as a 1 single js file :D</p>

<p>One thing for sure - stuffing everything in a single bundle is bad, it goes against the whole reason why this architecture was implemented in the first place!</p>
