<p>My guess is that this is compiler dependent. However, throwing an exception in the callback would be a very bad idea. Either it will flat-out not work, or the C code in the SQLite library will be unable to handle it. Consider if this is some code in SQLite:</p>

<pre><code>{
  char * p = malloc( 1000 );
  ...
  call_the_callback();  // might throw an exception
  ...
  free( p );
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the exception  "works", the C code has no possible way of catching it, and p will never be freed. The same goes for any other resources the library may have allocated, of course.</p>
