<p>The first error that I see is this</p>

<pre><code>   position[0]+= b.dimension.get("length");
   p2=boxBig.dimension.get("height");

           System.out.println("position 0 " +position[0]);
        //g.getCoordinate(1,position);
   g.getCoordinate(2,position);
</code></pre>

<p>You advance the position but then you reread it which will overwrite.</p>

<p>Then pp (if you are using that to position the second object etc) doesnt seem to be advanced inside the inner loop.</p>

<p>That's it for now.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>After update: I see the lightGray item is hidden so it must be small; and the white one protrudes over two boxes. Maybe the length that you are using to advance the position could be "breadth".</p>
