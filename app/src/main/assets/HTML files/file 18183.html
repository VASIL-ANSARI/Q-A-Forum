<p>We had a similar situation in our project tracking system where the latest state of the project is stored in the <code>projects</code> table <code>(Cols: project_id, description etc.,)</code> and the history of the project is stored in the <code>project_history</code> table <code>(Cols: project_id, update_id, description etc.,)</code>. Whenever there is a new update to the project, we need find out the latest update number and add 1 to it to get the sequence number for the next update. We could have done this by grouping the <code>project_history</code> table on the <code>project_id</code> column and get the <code>MAX(update_id)</code>, but the cost would be high considering the number of the project updates (in a couple of hundreds of thousands) and the frequency of update. So, we decided to store the value in the <code>projects</code> table itself in <code>max_update_id</code> column and keep updating it whenever there is a new update to a given project. HTH.</p>
