<p>Make two (or more) different classes, then use the one that doesn't throw an exception when you deseralize.</p>

<p>It looks like you could deseralize the array data using this class:</p>

<pre><code>public class data
{
    public Dictionary&lt;string, double&gt; tax { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If that class successfully deserializes, you can then copy it over to the tax class, either manually, or by using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173183.aspx" rel="nofollow">Reflection</a>.</p>
