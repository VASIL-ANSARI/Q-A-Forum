<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyld">dyld</a> errors are caused by a missing or a bad library <strong>linking</strong>, not code.</p>

<p><strong>Double check your frameworks links</strong>, do not hesitate to delete/recreate the links, <em>taking care</em> of iOS version you are taking your frameworks from. <em>(usually use the Xcode provided list, do not browse for files)</em></p>

<p>In your case I won't be surprised that linking <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework</code> is an error, since it doesnt look like belonging to iOS SDK, looking at its path...</p>

<p>Which I guess should be instead something like: <code>/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator&lt;Version&gt;.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework</code></p>
