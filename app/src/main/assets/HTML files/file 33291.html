<p>There <em>can</em> be a benefit for classes being templated but not depending on the argument. Most often you see such things to define (empty) tag-structures for template metaprogramming:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;class X&gt;
struct some_tag {};
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>The benefit of classes like yours in general is that while you have the same functionality in each class, they are different classes and you can't copy one into the other, i.e. an object of type <code>ImplClass&lt;int&gt;</code> is not compatible with another object of type <code>ImplCalss&lt;float&gt;</code>.</p>
