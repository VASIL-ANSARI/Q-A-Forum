<p>Berger got it right in the comments, I think.</p>

<p>You cannot reference <code>dateiID</code> in the anonymous inner class you define for <code>listOfFiles</code>, unless you make <code>dateiID</code> <code>final</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you don't need single quotes around the <code>import</code> line.</p>

<p>You could have discovered this for yourself by asking the database what the problem was, like so:</p>

<pre><code>select * 
from dba_errors 
where name = 'MOVEFILE' 
order by sequence;
</code></pre>
