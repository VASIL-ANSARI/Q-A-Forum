<p>The basic idea is to put a (semi)-transparent <code>div</code> over your page with the modal dialog on top. The <a href="http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/#examples" rel="nofollow">jqModal</a> plugin is the simplest script I know of that does this for you.</p>

<p>Anyways, these are called "modal dialogs" and googling will turn up endless resources.</p>
