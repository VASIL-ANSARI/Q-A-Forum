<p>The problem is not with your XML parsing, it's with your $mthType checking, specifically these two lines:</p>

<pre><code>$mthType[] = $xml-&gt;match['type'];
if ( $mthType == "ODI")
</code></pre>

<p>You're setting $mthType up as an array, then only returning it if it matches a string, which will never happen. Remove the empty array-creation brackets from the first assignment, and that should put you on the right track.</p>

<pre><code>$mthType = $xml-&gt;match['type'];
if ( $mthType == "ODI")
</code></pre>
