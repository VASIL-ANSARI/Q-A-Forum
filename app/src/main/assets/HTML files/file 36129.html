<p>In my understanding, the same events are fired as if you would click a button without <code>data-rel="back"</code>.</p>

<p>I assume you are changing a page container. Then it's here:</p>

<p><a href="http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/</a>  </p>

<p>The events are at least:</p>

<ul>
<li>beforechange (old page) </li>
<li>beforehide (old page)</li>
<li>beforetransition (new page)</li>
<li>beforeshow (new page)</li>
<li>change (new page)</li>
</ul>

<p>This skeleton is in the case the new page was already loaded and created. If not, there are even more events.</p>
