<p>There are two aspects to video files: The container and the encoding (or codec). H.264 is an encoding, and Android can deal with it, but Apple uses the QuickTime container format, which is similar to the MP4 container but apparently just different enough that Android can't handle it. Android can play MP4 files, and there are utilities to convert QuickTime to MP4, if that helps.</p>
