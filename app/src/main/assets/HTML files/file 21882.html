<p>The default constructor provided by ActiveModel is pretty good. If you delete the constructor you wrote, you should be able to use the default constructor like this:</p>

<pre><code>@movie = Movie.new(title: 'The Hobbit', director: 'Peter Jackson', studio: 'New Line Cinema')
</code></pre>

<p>When you don't want to provide the three arguments (like in your <code>new</code> action), you can stick with <code>@movie = Movie.new</code></p>
