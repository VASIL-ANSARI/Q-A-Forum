<p>Late to party but still...</p>

<p>...Not as easy as piece of pie, you will need to play around a few days before you succeed.</p>

<p>First of all read <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingWIthAPS/CommunicatingWIthAPS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH101-SW1" rel="nofollow">this thing from Apple</a>, and read it all.</p>

<p>And have a look to one of a good <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/3443/apple-push-notification-services-tutorial-part-12" rel="nofollow">tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>The idea in a few words is - your backend push the notification to Apple Push Notification Service(APNS) over TCP SSLed channel. Then that crazy thing pushes the notification to iOS device itself.</p>

<p>Your app needs to register for the notification, and supply a token to your backend.</p>

<p>Apple dose things in this way because of security concerns, so this is your only option to go with.</p>

<p>Pretty straightforward if you read the docs. Best of luck to you with PNs ;)</p>
