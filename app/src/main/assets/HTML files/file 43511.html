<p>Explanation: </p>

<ol>
<li>Select Many to combine all internal dictionaries into All In One dictionary. </li>
<li>List and SelectMany are IEnumerable. So join is possible between to IEnumerable objects. </li>
<li>However, List contains string value while IEnumerable object returned from SelectMany has integer value. </li>
</ol>

<p>So created inner join query with string and integer value after converting integer to string. Refer screencast that might be required output</p>

<p>This Linq snippet may be helpful:</p>

<pre><code>var allinone = (from l in MyList
                       join d in SomeDictionary.SelectMany(s =&gt; s.Value) on l equals d.Value
                       select d);
</code></pre>
