<p>Problem solved.</p>

<p>All of this was due to the fact that the server is compresses the data when sending it to the application.</p>

<p>The http header that came from server:</p>

<pre><code>Request Version: HTTP/1.1 
Response Code: 200 
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 2010 23:43:53 GMT 
Server: Apache/1.3.37 (Unix) mod_deflate/1.0.21 mod_accel/1.0.34 mod_ssl/2.8.28 OpenSSL/0.9.8e rus/PL30.22
Expires: Mon, 22 Nov 2010 23:44:44 GMT
Content-Encoding: gzip &lt;-- !!!
Connection: close
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
</code></pre>

<p>So, it can be possible to read data if you'll use GZIPInputStream.</p>

<p>May be someone finds all this information helpful for himself.</p>
