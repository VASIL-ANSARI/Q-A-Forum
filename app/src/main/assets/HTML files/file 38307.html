<p>Why are you using <code>valueForKeyPath:</code>? If you use</p>

<pre><code>_artistName = attributes[@"output"][@"contributor"][@"/music/recording/artist"][0][@"name"];
</code></pre>

<p>it should come out correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: For future viewers, one off lines like this will work. However, for a more maintainable and debuggable app, I would recommend splitting up the lines to extract only one object per line. That way, if something breaks, the debugger will be a larger help. </p>

<p>For apps where you deal with more JSON than just a one off, I would recommend creating model objects and pulling your JSON into those. There are libraries on github that could also help you there with model objects.</p>
