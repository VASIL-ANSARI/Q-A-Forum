<p>Python distributions do not include support for MySQL, which is only available by installing a third-party module such as <code>PyMySQL</code> or <code>MySQLdb</code>. The only relational support included in Python is for the SQLite database (in the shape of the <code>sqlite3</code> module).</p>

<p>There is, however, nothing to stop you distributing a third-party module as a part of your application, thereby including the support your project requires. <code>PyMySQL</code> would probably be the best choice because, being pure Python, it will run on any platform and give you best portability.</p>
