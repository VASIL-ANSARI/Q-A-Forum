<p>Normally i would say no , because you can't bough for all events and dependency properties. 
In this case of The SelectedItem DP and the SelectionChanged event the order is as you described .</p>

<p>Firstly by naming convention SelectedItem and Selection**Changed** , Changed meaning after the SelectedItem was changed.</p>

<p>Secondly , learn how to use some sort of reflector , i recommend : <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/download/" rel="nofollow">DotPeak</a></p>

<p>I took a peak in the <strong>Selector</strong> class (ComboBox inherits from Selector) code , there you can see the SelectionChanged event raised from within the callback on the SelectedItem DependencyProperty.</p>
