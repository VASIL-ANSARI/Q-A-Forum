<p>You will have to override the paddings at that size.</p>

<p>The problem is that one column is 8.333% of the total width (<em>when using 12 columns</em>). At 320 pixels that means 26.6 pixels each column. </p>

<p>But your layout has 15pixels of left/right padding per column.</p>

<p>So even if the column should be 26.6 pixels it remains at its minimum of 30 pixels due to the paddings. That means that the rest of the columns cannot fit at the remaining space and the last one breaks..</p>

<hr>

<p>Working backawards from that, having 15 pixel paddings means that the minimum column width is 30 pixels. That means that the minumum width of a 12 column layout is 360pixels.</p>
