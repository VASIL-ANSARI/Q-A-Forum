<p>I <em>think</em> that an unordered_map and hash_map are more or less the same thing. The difference is that the STL doesn't officially have a hash_map (what you're using is probably a compiler specific thing), so unordered_map is the fix for that omission.</p>

<p>unordered_map is just that... unordered. You can't depend on it preserving any ordering on iteration.</p>
