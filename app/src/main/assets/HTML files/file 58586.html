<p>From a personal point of view, I find it cleaner to have separate files. This then allows me to later on extend the system and allow other services to submit requests for validation without being overly cluttered. (For things, such as an application later on).</p>

<p>If you want to have it submitting to itself, you can require the validation script, allowing the two scripts to be clean &amp; separate.</p>

<pre><code>Script Name: script1.php

require 'script2.php';
/* Script 2 performs all validations */

&lt;form action=script1.php&gt;
form fields.....
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
