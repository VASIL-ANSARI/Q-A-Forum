<p>As pointed out by @forsvarir: You should not call <code>Add</code> again when no root node exists. Just remove that call and everything will be fine.</p>

<p>If I were you I would not add Indexer or a <code>GetAt</code> method to a <code>LinkedList</code> implementation. It's quite inefficient to use a linked list of you need to have index access.</p>

<p>Make your list implement <code>IEnumerable</code> instead and let the users use LINQ.</p>
