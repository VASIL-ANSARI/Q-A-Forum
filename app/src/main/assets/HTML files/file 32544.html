<p>You need to use .convert_alpha()</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>pygame.image.load('my_image.gif').convert_alpha()
</code></pre>

<p>See:
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.convert_alpha" rel="nofollow">http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.convert_alpha</a></p>

<p>"Creates a new copy of the surface with the desired pixel format. The new surface will be in a format suited for quick blitting to the given format with per pixel alpha. If no surface is given, the new surface will be optimized for blitting to the current display.</p>

<p>Unlike the Surface.convert() method, the pixel format for the new image will not be exactly the same as the requested source, but it will be optimized for fast alpha blitting to the destination."</p>

<p>In pygame anytime you load and image, or create a surface, with the intent of displaying it you should .convert() it if it has no transparency, or .convert_alpha() it if it has transparency. This yields both a big speedup AND solves the mystery of, 'Why is my transparency doing that?'.</p>
