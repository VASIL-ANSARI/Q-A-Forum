<p>The "raw value" you're seeing isn't actually the original value, it's what was encoded to make the URL safe for the HTTP Protocol.</p>

<p><a href="http://example.com/products/word%2Dword" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/products/word%2Dword</a> for instance started out as <a href="http://example.com/products/word-word" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/products/word-word</a> and is turned back into word-word as it comes out of the HTTP transport layer.</p>

<p>If you pass it through Server.URLEncode you will get back the same encoded value (%2D instead of -) - but if you can't use Server variables, are you going to have access to the Server object?</p>
