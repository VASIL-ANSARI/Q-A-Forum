<p>You can't add arguments to the callback. But I believe you can achieve what you are trying to do without that -- just by referring to a variable that is within scope of the closure.</p>

<p>For example, if you have:</p>

<pre><code>var id = 1001;

consumer.on('message', function(message) {
  if (id == message.id) console.log(message);
});
</code></pre>

<p>I believe this will do what you want.</p>
