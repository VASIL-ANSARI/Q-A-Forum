<p>The best way would be to put some logic on your the server:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application asks the server for updates, sending current database version as a parameters</li>
<li>Server check the application database version against the latest one, and compute the list of changes that occured</li>
<li>Server reply to the application by sending all theses changes, so the application can update its database content (along with its database version)</li>
</ul>
