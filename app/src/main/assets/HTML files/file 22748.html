<p>It'd be impossible to insert such records if you have a 2-way relationship enforced. Chicken-and-egg. Record in table #1 can't be inserted because there's no matching record in table #2, and table #2 cannot be inserted into because there's nothing in table #1 to hook to.</p>

<p>You can disable FK constraints temporarily (<code>set foreign_key_checks = 0</code>), but this should never be done in a "real" system. It's intended more for loading dumps where the table load order cannot be guaranteed.</p>
