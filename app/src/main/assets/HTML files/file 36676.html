<p>If the actual Java files were exported/compiled with the WAR, there is a good chance you can just extract the original WAR to get the base structure for the project. Then you could use that as your "base" for recreation of the actual IDE project (choose your flavor, as it shouldn't really matter). </p>

<p>Once you get it built back up, CHECK IT IN TO SOURCE CONTROL. I've had to do this with legacy applications before. If you are lucky, the source will also be exported. If not, best of luck to you sir.</p>
