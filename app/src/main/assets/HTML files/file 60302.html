<p>I've had the same problem using Laravel with <a href="http://www.maatwebsite.nl/laravel-excel/docs" rel="nofollow">http://www.maatwebsite.nl/laravel-excel/docs</a> and i solve the problem by checking if there was a clean code, i had a apostrophe (') character somewhere in my code and when i detected it i just erased that character and the file was exported with success. Good luck!</p>
