<h2>Input</h2>

<p>If you have properly sanitized or validated things using filtervar then you probably do not have any problems on the database end.  Sometimes it's hard to know if you have covered all your bases.  Your database queries should still probably use parameterized queries to protect you.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>

<p>You should properly escape data for the target content type if any user input can be seen by other users; even things like a username can be malicious.</p>
