<p>I've run into this a few times, the best thing I've found is to force a <strong>Y scroll-bar</strong> on every page, even if it isn't needed using in your style sheet:</p>

<pre><code>html { overflow-y: scroll; }
</code></pre>

<p>This will mean there is always a right scroll bar on the page, but it will be enabled/disabled as needed, and prevent the jump.</p>
