<p>This requires a number of different things to be in place. First of all, you need some way to identify the bounds of your playing area.</p>

<p>After that, you need to use this along with a Random.Next generator on both X and Y coordinates to get a position for the apple. Then do a Console.SetCursorPosition providing X and Y as Left and Top respectively, and then Console.Write the apple's "model" (Not WriteLine. This will completely mess up your playing field, I can assure you). Once you got that settled, you need to move it all into a method you're only going to call once the snake actually encounters the apple.</p>

<p>You might also want to make sure that it does not spawn on top of anywhere the snake is currently at.</p>

<p>And if I understand you correctly, you're making a new Thread/Task per object in your game (Snake head, body, Apple, Bonus objects, etc.). This is a bad idea, considering you want to keep everything synchronized, so that you wont run into situations where one task is moving the console cursor, while another task is writing. (We're only talking fractions of seconds here where such things can happen, but that is the speed at which the computer works. So it can, and will happen).</p>

<p>All in all, never use multiple threads to handle the same parts of your code.</p>

<p>Let me know if this makes sense. I will try to explain deeper, if needed.</p>
