<p>You have 2 places where you write <code>br.readLine()</code>. The first is within the while condition and the second within the body. So the line that is read by the first one never gets used. I suspect this is the line that contains the token you are looking for.</p>

<p>Try changing this:</p>

<pre><code>while(br.readLine()!=null){
    String line=br.readLine();
</code></pre>

<p>Into something like this:</p>

<pre><code>String line = null;
while((line = br.readLine())!=null){
</code></pre>
