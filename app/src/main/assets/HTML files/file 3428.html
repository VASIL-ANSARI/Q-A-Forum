<p>I think I found the problem.</p>

<p>You're calling <code>$('#top_mailing').hoverIntent(...</code> twice. Once at the bottom of the hoverintent_r5.js file, and once in your custom.js file. Apparently IE doesn't like that. Get rid of one or the other, and it should be fine. </p>

<p>Probably better to keep all your code in your own js file. Otherwise it's easy to forget about.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Avoiding the stop() issue.</p>

<p>I prefer animate:</p>

<pre><code>$('#top_mailing').hoverIntent(
  function () {
    $("#top_mailing_hidden").stop().animate({height:150},'slow');
  }, 
  function () {
    $("#top_mailing_hidden").stop().animate({height:0},'slow');
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>This way, when you need to stop and change directions, it will always know where to go. (0 and 150 in the example above.)</p>

<p>Please note that this would require top_mailing_hidden to have <code>clip:auto; overflow:hidden</code> set.</p>

<p>Since you're using hoverIntent, there may be no need for the calls to stop(), since hoverIntent is meant to avoid those unintended mouseover events.</p>

<p><strong>Slightly off topic:</strong> </p>

<p>Keep one thing in mind with your implementation. Since this is a form to fill out, users will likely (without even thinking) move their mouse out of the way when they start typing. That will cause the form to disappear.</p>

<p>With that in mind, you may want to reconsider doing a mouseout event. You could always make it slide back up when the user submits the form, with an optional 'Cancel' or 'Close' button.</p>
