<p>So, here is my solution: i have splitted the whole formula to 3 fieldsets, so if the document gets too long it's still printed in firefox (but on 3 separate fields - so... not so great but acceptable).</p>

<p>Then, i wrote some css to firefox and print, such as disabling some sections, that should not be printed, like:</p>

<pre><code>@media print {
@-moz-document url-prefix() {
    .disableFirefoxPrint {
        display: none;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And i format problematic divs with adding .disableFirefoxPrint class.</p>

<p>So, it's not the best solution - but it works.</p>

<p>Edit: The "onbeforeprint" solution was bad idea - becouse it changed my html and broke it.</p>
