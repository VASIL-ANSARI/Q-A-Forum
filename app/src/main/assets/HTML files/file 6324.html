<p><code>&amp;#8216;</code> is a decimal numbered entity, while I believe <code>\u2018</code> is a hexadecimal representation. HTML also supports hexadecimal numbered entities (e.g., <code>&amp;#x2018;</code>), but once you've found <code>#</code> as the entity prefix you're looking at either decimal or hex. There are also named entities (e.g., <code>&amp;amp;</code>) but it doesn't sound like you need to cover those cases in your code.</p>
