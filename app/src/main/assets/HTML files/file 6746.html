<p>In that code, you're just reassigning the <code>lastAccess</code> pointer, which leaves the <code>alloc</code>ed <code>NSNumber</code> leaked. You need to actually set the value for the <code>NSNumber</code> object pointed to by <code>lastAccess</code>.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I had placed some example code, but I'm taking it out, since I realize now that the code sample above has too many issues. Take a look at the documentation for <code>NSDictionary</code>. With <code>collection</code>, you're creating an object, and then leaking it by reassigning its pointer to something else. Once you get those issues ironed out, I recommend updating the question with the new code.</p>
