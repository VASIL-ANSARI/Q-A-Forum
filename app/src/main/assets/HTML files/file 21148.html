<p>If you want decimal numbers to come out as exactly as you entered them in Java, use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html" rel="nofollow">BigDecimal</a> instead of float.</p>

<p>Floating point numbers are inherently inaccurate for decimals because many numbers that terminate in decimal (e.g. 0.1) are recurring numbers in binary and floating point numbers are stored as a binary representation.</p>
