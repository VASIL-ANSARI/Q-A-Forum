<p>You can use the <code>bool QAbstractItemModel::removeRow(int row, const QModelIndex &amp; parent = QModelIndex())</code> functionality for this.</p>

<p>Here you can find an <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtwidgets/model-view-programming.html#inserting-and-removing-rows">example</a> for all this.</p>

<p>Also, here is an inline quote from that documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>removeRows()</p>
  
  <p>Used to remove rows and the items of data they contain
  from all types of model. Implementations must call beginRemoveRows()
  before inserting new columns into any underlying data structures, and
  call endRemoveRows() immediately afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second part of the task would be to connect the button's clicked signal to the slot executing the removal for you.</p>
