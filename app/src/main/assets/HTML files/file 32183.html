<p>The internal format of a String uses 16 bits per character. When you convert it to a byte array, you use a certain character encoding which is either specified explicitly or the default platform encoding. The encoding may use fewer bits per character.</p>

<p>For example the ASCII encoding will store each character in a byte but it can only represent 128 different characters.</p>

<p>Another often used encoding is UTF-8 which uses a variable number of bytes per character. The first 128 characters (corresponding to the characters available in ASCII) can be stored in one byte each. Characters with order numbers 128 or higher need two or more bytes.</p>
