<p>You can ignore mouse events - but it's upto the OS to decide which application to send the mouse event to and it's unlikely to propogate it to another app that is underneath your app.</p>

<p>Unless your operating system has a specific option to do this then other than some sort of hook in the graphics driver so that the OS doesn't know your window is there I can't see an obvious way</p>
