<p>For the moment I'm doing it brute-force by doing the line segments 1-by-1.</p>

<pre><code>segments = [shapely.geometry.LineString(x) for x in zip(line.coords, line.coords[1:])]

for segment in segments:
    intersected = polygon.intersection(segment)
    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like a problem that should be easy to vectorize!</p>
