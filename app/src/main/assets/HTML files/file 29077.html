<p>Try </p>

<pre><code>$featured = new WP_Query('cat='.$_GET["cat"]);
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter you're passing to WP_Query is a single-quoted string. No variable interpolation is done on single-quoted strings, so you're actually passing the literal string cat=$_GET["cat"], when you want to pass cat=4</p>
