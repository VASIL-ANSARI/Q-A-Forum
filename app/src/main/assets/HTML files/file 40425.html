<p>You have the right idea, <strong>zip</strong> can easily help you here:</p>

<pre><code>#creates generator that holds four values that are yearly revenues for company
revenue = table.tr.td.table.tr.next_sibling.td.next_siblings

revenue = zip(*revenue) # &lt;------ yes, it is that easy

#iterates through generator from above and writes output to CSV file
for value in revenue:
    value = value.get_text(strip=True)
         ...
</code></pre>
