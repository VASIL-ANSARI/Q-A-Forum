<p>After doing some more poking around and researching, I found out the issue.  When running in Debug mode I had "Any CPU" selected instead of x64 bit (Sharepoint 2010 is only compatible with 64-bit machines).  I also was using .NET 4.5 framework, which apparently is not currently supported by Microsoft.SharePoint.   After switching to 64-bit and .NET 3.5 everything works fine.</p>
