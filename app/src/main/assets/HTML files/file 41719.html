<p>Firstly, you shouldn't use the @ if possible.  This suppresses errors, but if you;re getting errors, then you need to know about it as it means something isn't right....</p>

<p>The problem you;re having relates to an option in php.ini.  check out <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php#ini.allow-url-fopen" rel="nofollow">allow_url_fopen</a></p>

<p>PHP seems to disallow opening remote files (URL's) unless you have explicitly enabled that feature, hence you always get a <code>false</code> returned...</p>

<p>I hope that helps!</p>
