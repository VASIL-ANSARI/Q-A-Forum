<p>It is not optimized away from the IL.  I cannot speak for the Just-In-Time-compiled machine code.</p>

<p>I verified this by creating a small class, compiling it, then running ILDasm to look at the IL.</p>

<p>To verify whether it is put in the finalize queue you would need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>class Asdf
{
  ~Asdf (){}
}
static void Main ()
{
  new Asdf ();
  GC.Collect ();
  Console.WriteLine ("Now, use ADPLUS to create a memory dump");
  Console.ReadLine ();
}

// Instantiate and Asdf object with an empty finalizer.
// Force Garbage Collection with GC.Collect (); This moves it to the finalize queue.
// Create a memory dump with adplus.exe
// Open a windbg session and .load sos           (son of strike)
// Use the !Dumpheap -type Asdf
// If there is an entry for Asdf, then it is in the finalize queue.
</code></pre>
