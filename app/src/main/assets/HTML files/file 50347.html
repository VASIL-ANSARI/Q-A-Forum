<p>One method is to calculate a row number and then join on that value:</p>

<pre><code>select rn, max(age) as age, max(plays) as plays
from ((select c.age, NULL as plays, (@rnc := @rnc + 1) as rn
       from cats c cross join (select @rnc := 0) params
      ) union all
      (select NULL as age, g.plays, (@rng := @rng + 1) as rn
       from games g cross join (select @rng := 0) params
      )
     ) cg
group by rn;
</code></pre>
