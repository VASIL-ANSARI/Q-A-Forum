<p>This is actually a very common problem with a common solution across a lot of languages. Most random number generators allow you to pass a seed value on construction, an RNG with the same seed returns the same pattern of results every time a random number is generated.</p>

<p>Most RNGs use some function of the system time as the default seed (no seed passed) to provide a fresh set of numbers every time.</p>

<p>You can use <code>RAND()</code> with a seed <code>RAND(N)</code>, this will return the same set of rows, provided that the underlying table remains the same.. If another row is added, for example, another random number will be generated for that row and it could end up anywhere in the result set.</p>
