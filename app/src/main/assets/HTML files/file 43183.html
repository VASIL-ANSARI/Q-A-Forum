<p>You have a typo in initialise.</p>

<p>You meant to write <em>initialize</em> to provide a constructor for your game and call Gosu::Window constructor (super) with 3 parameters.
But since you haven't really defined <em>initialize</em> (instead you've defined a distinct <em>initialise</em> method) - MyGame.new tries to call Gosu::Window#initialize which accepts 3 arguments, but you provide 0 to MyGame.new - that's what the error message tries to convey.</p>

<p>If you'll fix the typo initialise -> initialize, MyGame.new will call your constructor with no arguments, and it will then provide the needed 3 arguments via super call.</p>
