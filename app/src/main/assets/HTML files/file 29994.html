<p>Maybe <code>lib/${@}/makefile</code> doesn't exist, but <code>lib/${@}/Makefile</code> does? <code>make</code> works fine with either.</p>

<p>In general, you shouldn't test whether the makefile exists; if it doesn't exist that should be an error: Either the directory is not a library directory, or <code>$(LIBS)</code> is being used for several things, which means it should be refactored.</p>
