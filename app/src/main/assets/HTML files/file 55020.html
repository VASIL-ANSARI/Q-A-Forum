<p>Expanding on my comment above, since it got wordy:</p>

<p>Create a new table called something like <code>user_follows</code> with columns like </p>

<pre><code>user_id1 | user_id2 
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>follower_id | follows_id 
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.username as follower_username, t3.username as following_usernae
FROM users t1
    INNER JOIN user_follows t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.follower_id
    INNER JOIN users t3 ON t2.following_id = t3.user_id
WHERE t1.user_id = &lt;your user&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the end, think of your tables as "Objects". Then when you are presented with a problem like "How do I add users that are following other users" you can determine if this relationship is a new object, or an attribute of an existing object. Since a user might follow more than one other user than the relationship is not a good attribute for "Users", so it gets its own table <code>user_follows</code>. </p>

<p>Since <code>user_follows</code> is just one type of relationship that two users may have to one another, it might make sense to increase the scope of that object to <code>relationships</code> and store the relationship type as an attribute of the table:</p>

<pre><code>user_id1 | user_id2 | relationship_type
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>relationships.relationship_type</code> might have values like <code>follows, student of, sister</code> of etc...</p>

<p>So the new query would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t1.username as follower_username, t3.username as following_username
FROM users t1
    INNER JOIN relationships t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id1
    INNER JOIN users t3 ON t2.user_id2 = t3.user_id
WHERE t1.user_id = &lt;your user&gt; AND t2.relationship_type = 'Follows';
</code></pre>
