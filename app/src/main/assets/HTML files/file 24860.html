<p>When you reference the <code>CooSelection</code> service, you are expecting an array, but the factory returns an object. You could do this instead:</p>

<pre><code>myApp.factory('CooSelection', function () {
    return [];    // Return an array instead of an object.
})
</code></pre>

<p>Also, in your <code>DebugCooList</code> controller, your scope property does not match the name of the variable you are checking in the view.  The controller code assigns to <code>coo_selection</code> but the view checks <code>coo_list_selection</code>, so you'll need to change one to match the other.</p>
