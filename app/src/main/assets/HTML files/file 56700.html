<p>The answer turned out to be in a place I didn't expect. The unbotrusive validator puts those params in data attributes of the input.</p>

<pre><code>$('#MyInput').attr('data-val-myvalidator-myparam');
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$('#MyInput').data('val-myvalidator-myparam');
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Edit: As haim770 pointed out, it's not the unobtrusive validator that puts the params in the data attributes. Those are there from the start (my html is generated with those already). So the unobtrusive validator is actually reading those params from the data attributes.</p>
