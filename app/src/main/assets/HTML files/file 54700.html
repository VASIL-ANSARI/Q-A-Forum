<p>Including a file in PHP runs the script.  Since your script defines a class, if you include it more than once you're attempting to re-define the class. To make sure you're script is only executed once:</p>

<pre><code>include_once "../../_plugin/_config/all-function.php";
</code></pre>

<p>But even better, don't include a file in a loop.  It's best practice to include once at the top of your script.</p>
