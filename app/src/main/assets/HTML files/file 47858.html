<p>You are allocating <code>char pass [100]</code> as an automatic local variable. This means that it will be placed in the function's stack frame. Variables allocated this way are not initialized to any particular value, their contents in undefined.</p>

<p>If you type in the password 'test' you will have</p>

<pre><code>pass[0] == 't'
pass[1] == 'e'
pass[2] == 's'
pass[3] == 't'
pass[4] == '\0'
pass[5] == ????
</code></pre>

<p><code>pass[5]</code> can be any value, including an uppercase or digit. Your 'for' loop is reading these uninitialized values and giving the wrong result.</p>

<p>To resolve this, have your for loop stop when it hit's the '\0' or 'null' character.</p>

<pre><code>for(i=0;pass[i]!='\0';i++)
</code></pre>

<p>This code will expose a security vulnerability if the password is too long.</p>
