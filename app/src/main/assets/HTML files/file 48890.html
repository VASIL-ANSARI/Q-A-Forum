<p>Filters created on for a merge article are evaluated only at the publisher.  Changes made at the subscriber will always be propagated back to the subscriber, even if they are outside the filter criteria.  However if the changes from the one subscriber do not meet the filtering criteria, then they will sit on the publisher, but not be replicated to all the other subscribers.</p>

<p>Is this a production scenario, or are you playing around with replication?  If you do static filtering, which is what you have above, it is typically done on read-only type of tables.  For example, a salesperson in the field may only need prices for products in their region.  They are not expected to update this table.  If you do dynamic filtering, for example, filtering based on HOSTNAME(), then you would only get data specific for that user.  For example, a salesperson in the field would receive only their customer information.  Thus, any updates to that information, unless it's shared across multiple salespersons, would propagate back up, and not flow to anyone else.</p>

<p>In your case, i would not recommend updating tables on the subscriber that have static filters, thus i suggest re-evaluating your filtering design to ensure you have the right filtering model for your scenario.</p>
