<p>I have done some research around and figure out using setTimeout is a better way than sleep </p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function(), delay)
</code></pre>

<p>This is my code on fiddle:</p>

<p>I have tried this at first:</p>

<pre><code>setTimeout(function() {
        setStatus("run");
    },3000);
setTimeout(function() {
        setStatus("stop");
    },3000);
</code></pre>

<p>but got the same problem as you have: showing the last one, not the middle).</p>

<p>I have some rough time trying to understand the reason why. Then I change the later one to 6000 and I got the result. I believe both of the setTimeout run async (doesn't wait for the code to complete to do others). Have a look here for more details:</p>
