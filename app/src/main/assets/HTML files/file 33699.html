<p>You are only checking if the returned list is null, but it is probably empty. You can see in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html#getFromLocation%28double,%20double,%20int%29" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> that the returned list can be null or empty, so do a size check as well:</p>

<pre><code>if (addresses != null &amp;&amp; !addresses.isEmpty())
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you shouldn't do this in the main-thread, use e.g. an AsyncTask. Why is explained <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/location/display-address.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method is synchronous, and may take a long time to do its work, so
  you should call the method from the doInBackground() method of an
  AsyncTask.</p>
</blockquote>
