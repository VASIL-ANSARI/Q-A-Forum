<p>The event handler for onclick is assigned to undefined. This is what the handler should look like</p>

<pre><code>fontButtons[i].onclick=function(){resizeText(this);};
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is that this line of code has several issues</p>

<pre><code>fontButtons.elements[i].onclick=resizeText(this);
</code></pre>

<p>First, <code>fontButtons</code> is already a NodeList containing the matched elements on the page, so using <code>.elements</code> will not contain any elements. Second, this is going to assign the onclick handler to the result of the resizeText function call. As the function does not return anything, the assignment gets undefined.</p>

<p>Using an anonymous function as the callback to call <code>resizeText</code> will allow for a new execution context to be created. The context created by the event handler will bind a new value to <code>this</code> allowing the current element that created the event to be sent to the <code>resizeText</code> function.</p>
