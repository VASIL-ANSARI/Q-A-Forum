<p>Change the method signature of printTable to:</p>

<pre><code>public static void printTable(int status)
</code></pre>

<p>Remove the return statement and alter the for loop to:</p>

<pre><code>for (double taxableIncome = 50000; taxableIncome &lt; 60000; taxableIncome += 50)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is the return statement in the printTable method - each time it's reached, the same method is called recursively again, at which point a new local taxableIncome variable is created with a value of 50000 and hence the printing continues indefinitely.</p>
