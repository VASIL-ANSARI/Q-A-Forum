<p>When you install OpenCover it would/should have presented you with a readme.txt that provides a link to the wiki <a href="http://www.github.com/OpenCover/OpenCover/wiki/usage" rel="nofollow">http://www.github.com/OpenCover/OpenCover/wiki/usage</a> - there is also a usage.pdf installed with the tool.</p>

<p>-target means the target application, this can be the app you have just written or a coverage tool such as nunit that would run parts of your application code whilst it is running the supplied tests.</p>
