<p>The above method used to render the Pacman will actually work just fine for rendering the dots to the screen. Simply store an image for the dot in a new texture, create an SDL_Rect to hold this texture, and then use SDL_CreateRenderer to render the dot image to the screen along with the Pacman. You should notice no flashing of the dot between renderings as long as you have not used something like SDL_Delay to slow the framerate.</p>
