<p>There are two principle ways of doing what you want:</p>

<ol>
<li>Give a unique <code>id</code> for each comment and pass it to the url to create a so-called bookmark. You'll get smth like <code>http://the/url/you/want#desired-post-id</code> and so you will automatically jump to the post you want.</li>
<li>Use <code>ajax</code> to refresh only a part of a page that you are really changing. In that case you'll just stay there you are.</li>
</ol>
