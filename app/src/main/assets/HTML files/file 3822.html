<p>IBM's JDK runs on Linux (it's tested on SuSE and Red Hat) on x86 and x86-64 processors. I don't believe it's restricted to IBM hardware; i don't think it has to be a Linux virtualized on a 390.</p>

<p>However, i have absolutely no idea whether support is available for it on non-IBM platforms. If you're planning to use it in production, you will probably need a support agreement of some sort, even if it's just to keep the suits happy.</p>
