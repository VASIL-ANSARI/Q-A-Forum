<p>The browser is looking for the sound file at <a href="http://localhost:40825/EventManagement/Sound/notificationSound.wav" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:40825/EventManagement/Sound/notificationSound.wav</a>. It sounds like the path is just wrong and the way you're referencing it in your JS is looking for a folder named Sound inside the folder the JS file is located (EventManagement).</p>

<p>Where exactly is this Sound folder located on your machine? If it's a sibling of the EventManagement folder, try <code>new Audio("../Sound/notificatonSound.wav");</code>. Otherwise, I'd just move that folder and audio inside the EventManagement folder :)</p>
