<p>You must import your APKlib in your Eclipse workspace and then link it to your main application project (Project properties > Android > Add library and choose your APKLib project)</p>

<p>Sometimes, if you perform a clean or an update of your maven project, Eclipse loses the link of your apklib and you must add it again..</p>
