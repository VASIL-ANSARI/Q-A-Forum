<p>I don't believe there's a function built in to do this, however it's relatively easy code to make!</p>

<pre><code>let query = PFQuery(className: "yourClass")
let cutOffDate = (some type of NSDate)
query.whereKey("updatedAt", greaterThan: cutOffDate)
query.getFirstObjectInBackgroundWithBlock({ (first, error) -&gt; Void in
                if error == nil {
                    //something was updated after date
                } else if error?.code == 101 {
                    //nothing was updated after date
                } else {
                    //something went wrong
                }
        })
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if this works for you!</p>
