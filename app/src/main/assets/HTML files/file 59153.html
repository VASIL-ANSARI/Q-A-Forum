<p>You have to remove that code and replace it with your actual implementation.<br>
The method has not been implemented (i.e. made to actually <em>do</em> something, rather than throwing the <code>NotImplementedException</code>), only called.  </p>

<p>It will not just automatically remove itself because you <em>call</em> the method, you must supply the implementation.  </p>

<p>Place your logic inside of the method and remove the current line to fix your situation:  </p>

<pre><code>internal int getLastIDbyMaxPeg()
{
    //Do some things
    //return some int value
}
</code></pre>
