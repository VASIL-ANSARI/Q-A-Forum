<p>It's been a while for me and I forgot how I exactly did it, but when I was writing my own C/C++ library and interfaced it with swig into python, I was able to debug the C code with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/" rel="nofollow">DDD</a>. It was important to compile with debug options. It wasn't great, but it worked for me. I think you had to run <code>ddd python</code> and within the python terminal run my faulty C code. You would have to make sure all linked libraries including yours is loaded with the source code so that you could set breakpoints. </p>
