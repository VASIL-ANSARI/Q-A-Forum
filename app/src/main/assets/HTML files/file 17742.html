<blockquote>
  <p>There's a discussion of this issue on Apple's paid developer forums. It's a bug in Xcode 4.5. Apple's engineers are looking into the issue, but there's no fix yet.</p>
  
  <p>There are two workarounds. The first workaround is to run your command-line app from the Terminal. In the Xcode project navigator select your executable from the Products folder. Right-click and choose Show in Finder. Double-click the executable in the Finder to launch it in the Terminal.</p>
  
  <p>The second workaround is to install Xcode 4.4. Choose Xcode > Open Developer Tool > More Developer Tools to access Apple's developer downloads site.</p>

  <p>Yes, this is a confirmed regression from 4.4, and we're tracking it internally.  It is really unfortunate that this slipped in, but we'll get it fixed ASAP.</p>
