<p>You are unable to automate C Sharp files using Selenium.  Straight from the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org" rel="nofollow">selenium HQ site</a>...</p>

  <p>Selenium automates browsers. That's it.</p>

<p>What it sounds like you are trying to do, is <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=C#+Reflection" rel="nofollow">C# Reflection</a> or just a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9097044/advice-on-unit-testing-a-windows-forms-application">simple unit test on WinForms</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore - i am looking more into what you would like to do.  You are trying to navigate to a csharp using chrome, then automate it?  This is preposterous.. use unit tests!</p>
