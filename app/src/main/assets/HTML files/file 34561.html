<p>One way to do this is by creating your own ClassLoader that can load classes from a specified location that is not on the system classpath.  (If it is on the system classpath, the system ClassLoader will find the classes first and you won't be able to unload them.)  Creating instances requires a bit of reflection, but once they're created you can treat them just like any other instances.</p>

<p>This works because although only the custom ClassLoader knows about the actual class of those instances, it gets its definition of their superclass (your plugin class or interface) from the system ClassLoader.  Therefore, other classes loaded by the system ClassLoader (i.e., the rest of your program) can reference those dynamically created instances by their superclass.</p>
