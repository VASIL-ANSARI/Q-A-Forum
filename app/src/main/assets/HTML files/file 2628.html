<p>This will work only if the client's browser knows which E-Mail client to open for <code>mailto:</code> links in the first place. If the user uses a web-based client that is not registered with the browser, nothing will happen.</p>

<p>Also, it could be that security settings prevent <code>mailto:</code> links from opening programmatically, or will prevent it in the future. </p>

<p>I wouldn't rely on this to work either way, only as a nice optional convenience function.</p>

<p>Anyway, to answer your question, can you try setting a timeout between the two calls? Maybe the location refresh is just too quick for the browser to catch up.</p>

<pre><code>location.href="mailto:test@test.com&amp;body=Hello!";
setTimeout(function(){ location.href = 'newPage.html' },  500);
</code></pre>
