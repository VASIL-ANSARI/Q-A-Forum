<h1> If there is a crash, there is a backtrace.  Post it.</h1>

<p>Where is the crash happening?  You should be able to get a backtrace from the debugger or there should be a crash report available.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here is a problem:</p>

<pre><code> NSString *qNr = [[NSString alloc] init];
 ... later ....
 qNr = [myArray objectAtIndex:xx];
 ... even later ...
 [qNr release];
</code></pre>

<p>That is a leak (the assignment without releasing the first string) and a crash (releasing an object that was never retained).</p>

<p>And another one:</p>

<pre><code>    NSString *myObject1 = [[NSString alloc] init];
    myObject1 = [myArray objectAtIndex:xx];
    ...
    [myObject1 release];
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, neither the <code>alloc/init</code>, nor the <code>release</code> are necessary.</p>
