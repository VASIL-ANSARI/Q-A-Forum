<p>We have a special google's SDK for YouTube for instance. On the other side AOS does not support Adobe Flash. Maybe its just has an unsupported by AOS video codec used by vimeo service? That could be the reason why you cant watch vimeo videos via WebView/browser.<br>
Did you check for Vimeo official Android SDK if such thing does exist at least?<br>

And a little suggest: try to use SO search and google - it helps in most cases :)</p>
