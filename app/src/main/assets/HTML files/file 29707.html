<p>I addressed this in a previous question of yours.</p>

<p>The 0 is being appended to the Ajax call because you need to <code>die()</code> after the echo.</p>

<pre><code>echo $new_pie;
die();
</code></pre>

<p>This will stop the <code>0</code> from being appended.</p>

<p>As for the return of the data from the AJAX call, you need to do something with it, like append it to an element.</p>

<pre><code>$('#elementID').append(data);
</code></pre>

<p>Which in this case, <code>elementID</code> is the ID of an element such as a DIV or P.</p>

<p><strong>sidenote</strong></p>

<p>There's no reason to use the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var ajaxurl = '&lt;?php echo admin_url('admin-ajax.php'); ?&gt;';
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Wordpress has created the javascript <code>ajaxurl</code> variable for you and has been doing so since WP 2.8. </p>
