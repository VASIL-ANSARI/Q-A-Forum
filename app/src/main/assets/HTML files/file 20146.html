<p>This variable, <code>myContact</code>, is local to <code>BeginContact</code>:</p>

<pre><code>MyContact myContact = { contact-&gt;GetFixtureA(), contact-&gt;GetFixtureB() };
</code></pre>

<p>But here, you're storing a pointer to it for future reference:</p>

<pre><code>bodyHoldUD.climbingHoldContact = &amp;myContact;
</code></pre>

<p>When <code>BeginContact</code> returns, the <code>myContact</code> variable ceases to exist, and when you later attempt to access its <code>fixtureA</code> your computer says <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> because whatever was there has been overwritten with something else.<br>
This is the same problem as returning a pointer to a local variable.</p>

<p>Note that the example you built on stores <code>MyContact</code>s in the vector, not <code>MyContact*</code>s.</p>

<p>You should be able to fix this one by just changing the <code>climbingHoldContact</code> member to not be a pointer.</p>
