<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">AsyncTask</a> should be used only for relatively short background processes (i.e. processes that last a few seconds). From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AsyncTask is designed to be a helper class around Thread and Handler
  and does not constitute a generic threading framework. AsyncTasks
  should ideally be used for short operations (a few seconds at the
  most.) If you need to keep threads running for long periods of time,
  it is highly recommended you use the various APIs provided by the
  java.util.concurrent package such as <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html" rel="nofollow">Executor</a>, <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html" rel="nofollow">ThreadPoolExecutor</a> and
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/FutureTask.html" rel="nofollow">FutureTask</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For long operations you should use a <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html" rel="nofollow">Service</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Service is an application component representing either an
  application's desire to perform a longer-running operation while not
  interacting with the user or to supply functionality for other
  applications to use.</p>
