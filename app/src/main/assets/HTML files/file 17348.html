<p>General convention would suggestion your top level package name should be the reverse of you companies web address (ie <code>com.stackoverflow</code>).  </p>

<p>Now not everybody has a company (or web address), in these cases you want to choice something that will (as well as possible) uniquely identify you package (the purpose of packages is to provide name space, so you can have more the one class with the same name and be able to differentiate between them, amongst other things).</p>

<p>In may case I might choose to use <code>mad.programmer</code> for example...</p>

<p>The next level should identify the application or library (I personally use things like <code>.core</code> and <code>.core.ui</code> for my core libraries, but you can make you own choices)</p>

<p>At this point, you're basically free to group as you see fit.</p>

<p>Now, to the question at hand.</p>

<p>In your case, I would create three projects.  One being for the server code, one being for the client code and one for you common classes (which would be shared between the server and client).</p>

<p>I would link the common project to your server and client projects (right click the <code>Libraries</code> node of the project (client and/or server) and select <code>Add Project</code>).</p>

<p>Personally, I would use the <code>.client</code>, <code>.server</code>, <code>.common</code> suffixes to you package names just to separate the code but the only really requirement is to provide your common library with it's own name space, separate from the server and client.</p>

<p>So long as you haven't changed any code that the sever and client rely-on to communicate (objects that might be passed between them at runtime), you can rebuild either project without affecting the other.</p>

<p>That's my take on it any way.</p>
