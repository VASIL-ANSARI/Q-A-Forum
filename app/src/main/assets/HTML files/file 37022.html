<p>I wish I could comment as I'm not sure about this, but it might be worth mentioning...</p>

<p>This line looks like it's extracting the URLs from the wrong array...did you mean to extract from expimgUrls instead of imgUrls?</p>

<pre><code>instance.extractImageUrlFromSource(imgUrls, html);
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't gotten this far in my Java education so I may be incorrect...I just looked over the code and noticed it. I hope someone else who knows more can actually give you a solid answer!</p>
