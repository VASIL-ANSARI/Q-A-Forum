<p>From your comment it seems your actual problem is "controller.isGrounded" never ticks in, right?<br>
I described the first issue in comment (<code>anim.SetBool("Jump", false);</code>) related to animation.<br>This second problem comes from your <code>PlayerController</code> code.<br><br>
You "reset" your jump with setting <code>vSpeed = -1;</code>, right after the frame you just jumped. So techincally, the engine doesn't even have time to react on the jump as the character the next frame gets pulled back hard to the ground (by the "anti-jump" :) you implemented).<br><br>
What I recommend is, take the sample code from <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CharacterController.Move.html" rel="nofollow">CharacterController.Move</a>, just like you did before you applied your changes, but this time don't alter it!<br>
Just copy-paste the snippet into your app and test. After you made it work "as is", again, without any changes in the code, add the customizations you want, <em>one by one</em> and test every time if the change introduced a defect (bug).<br><br><br>I'd also recommend you to start using <code>Debug.Log()</code> while you are coding so you can filter out issues like what you have now, as you'll see what happens in the code "on the fly", when you play-test (.Log variable values with comments, if "branches" when they tick in, calculated values, calls to important functions -like .Move()- etc).<br><br><br>
I hope this helps! Cheers!</p>
