<p><code>@FormUrlEncoded</code> is used when you want to send form parameters. These parameters are encoded as the body, you can have your own.  It does not look like you are using and form parameters, so remove <code>@FormUrlEncoded</code>.  Also, I recommend using GSON to convert your POJO to JSON for the <code>@Body</code>.  It looks like you are using retrofit 1 and trying to send a raw <code>String</code>.  Retrofit will try to JSON encode that for you, which means you'll end up with the object you send wrapped in "...".  If you want to send a raw string, take a look <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/21423093/1904517">at this answer</a> for your options in retrofit 1.</p>
