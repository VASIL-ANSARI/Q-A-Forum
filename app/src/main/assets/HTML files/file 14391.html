<p>Your file handle writes to the I/O buffer which will not instantly write to disk.  Because io is slow this is efficiency built into file handle objects.  To ensure it writes to disk you must flush the io buffer using synchronizeFile.  You also need to call closeFile when you are done with the file handle (which will also synchronize, so the synchronize is optional).</p>
