<p>If you load and save a XMl file with C#, then the XML should be formatted correctly (an easy way to format strange looking XML files is just to load and save them with some C# code). </p>

<p>If I understand your question correctly, then you are just not happy with the format of the XML file?</p>

<p>Like you want (A):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/intro&gt;&lt;part&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But you get (B):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/intro&gt;
&lt;part&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If that is the question, then, in my eyes, you just want a strange thing. Because...</p>

<p>a) Code doesn't care how the XML file is formatted and
b) The format in (B) is the correct one</p>

<p>If you, for what reason ever, want to change it, then you have to parse through the XML file, opening it as a string and checking manually for closed and opened tags. </p>
