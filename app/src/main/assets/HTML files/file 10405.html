<p>I don't think VS 2008 (or 2010 for that matter) has this functionality, but <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/" rel="nofollow">ReSharper</a> has the "Replace 'var' with explicit type declaration" <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Reference__Options__Languages__CSharp__Context_Actions.html" rel="nofollow">context-action</a> that you can use on a case-by-case basis to type locals explicitly. If you want to go the whole hog, there's a "Code Cleanup" operation that can be used to perform this refactoring for an entire block/file/project/solution.</p>

<p>Do note that this plugin is not free.</p>
