<p>An easy way to solve this is to build a trie with your queries (simply a prefix tree, list of nodes with a single character inside), and when you search through your 10gb file you go through your tree recursively as the text matches. </p>

<p>This way you prune <em>a lot</em> of options really early on in your search for each character position in the big file, while still searching your whole solution space.</p>

<p>Time performance will be very good (as good as a lot of other, more complicated solutions) and you'll only need enough space to store the tree (a lot less than the whole array of strings) and a small buffer into the large file. Definitely a lot better than grepping a db 300k times...</p>
