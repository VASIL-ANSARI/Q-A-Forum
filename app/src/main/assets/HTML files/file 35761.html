<p>Seems that it was the amalgamation of <em>series of unfortunate events</em>. Yonders ago we had to use a specific version of Maven (3.0.5) with a specific version of Java (1.7u45). I cannot exactly remember why, probably something to do with the production system we were working on. However, after updating everything (Maven 3.2.1 and Java 1.8.0) and removing the old paths, everything works as intended.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Actually, it turns out that the issue was that there was a space in the path to the project. Removing it solved everything.</p>
