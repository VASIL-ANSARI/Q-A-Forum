<p>Not certain that this is the problem but it appears that your <code>form_for</code> tag is in the wrong format.  You are closing the parentheses on the <code>form_for</code> tag after specifying your user, and thus it is ignoring the <code>:html</code> part.  I would try this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= form_for([@photos, @user], :html =&gt; {:multipart =&gt; true}) do |f| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>@photos</code> and <code>@user</code> must be passed in as an array.</p>

<p>Also, Not sure why the <code>@photos</code> param would be plural.  Shouldn't it be <code>[@photo, @user]</code>?  I may be wrong on that part though.</p>
