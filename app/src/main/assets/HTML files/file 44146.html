<p>You can create, compile and instantiate a java class in runtime.</p>

<p>See this:

<p><strong>Some libraries:</strong> 
cglib
Codemodel</p>

<p>Or you could use Nashorn. (javascript interpreter) I can imagine a use case where user defines complex validation in javascript and then this would be a good approach.</p>

<p>Although in your case I would not recommend any of the above and just write it in the code. Data types validation sounds like something you want to have hard-coded.</p>
