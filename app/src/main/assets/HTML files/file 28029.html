<p>Profiling memory is tricky. The best instrument to actually use is the Activity Monitor, which will tell you how much live memory is really being used, unlike Allocations which will tell you more than you need to know.</p>

<p>Also, the maximum amount of memory is dependent on each device. If you really want to know if you're using a lot of memory, just test it on a device. You generally have a lot of flexibility, and the internal UIImage class does a lot of fancy caching and clearing of said caching for you.</p>
