<p>The error indicates the problem:</p>

<p>ld: library not found for -lTuneInRadio</p>

<p>this means that your build/make is trying to find a library (called libTuneInRadio) to compile this program you're trying to build but it can't find it in the paths (the default ones + the ones described by the '-L' options on gcc call). </p>

<p>Not knowing any more about what you're compiling/building makes it impossible to say precisely what's happening other than you're missing this library. </p>

<p>Given the name of the library, it sounds like it should be part of the project you're trying to build (or maybe there is a related TuneInRadio-lib project), so I would suggest reading the README or BUILDING or similarly named file that might have come with the project to determine how to successfully compile this program.</p>
