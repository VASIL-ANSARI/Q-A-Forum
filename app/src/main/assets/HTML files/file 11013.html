<p>What are you expecting returning an object to do? Presumably the completion block that you hand to <code>ASIFormDataRequest</code> is declared as <code>void (^)()</code> (or <code>dispatch_block</code> or some other typedef which evaluates to <code>void (^)()</code>). Given this, the code calling the block isn't expecting a return value. It would be like implementing a method declared <code>- (void)foo</code> and trying to return an object from that; it just doesn't make sense.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After re-reading your code, I expect what you're really trying to do is returning a value from <code>-getTodayData:</code>. However you're executing an asynchronous request. The method <code>-getTodayData:</code> has <em>already returned</em> long before your block is executed.</p>
