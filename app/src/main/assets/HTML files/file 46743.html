<p>you should post the error you are getting there, that will help us a lot to understand what is happening. 
However, trying to figure out what are you looking for and in my opinion this isn't the right way to perform that action. You could obtain the order first, and then inject that order to the function, and finally you'll have the total. Maybe this help:</p>

<pre><code>SET SERVEROUTPUT ON
SET VERIFY OFF
ACCEPT total_order_no PROMPT 'Enter order number to calculate total'
DECLARE
total_order_no varchar2(6) := &amp;total_order_no;
total number;
v_order_code  customer_order.order_code%type;

BEGIN
  /*I assumed you are looking for just one value
    and total_order_no is the value to perform the 
    searching of that order number */

  SELECT ORDER_CODE INTO v_order_code
  FROM customer_order
  WHERE order_code = total_order_no;

  total := CALCULATE_BILL_FOR_ORDER(v_order_code);

  EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
      dbms_output.put_line('No such order' || total_order_no || ' - ' || sqlcode);
END;
/
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this help!!.</p>
