<p>1 cm = 47 pixels
and it is easy to find distance between 2 images in pixels..</p>

<p>so you can then convert pixels into centimeter ,like you have 200 pixels of distance then your centimeter will be like ---> (200/ 47) = 4.25 centimeter</p>

<p>int distance =  imageview1.frame.origin.y - imageview2.frame.origin.y;</p>

<p>int pixeltoCentrimeter = distance/47;</p>

<p>Happy Coding!!!</p>
