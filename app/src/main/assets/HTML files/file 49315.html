<p>So, this expression:</p>

<pre><code>params["end_date"].values.join("-")
</code></pre>

<p>Will give you string <code>'8-25-2014'</code>. When parsing date, ruby is trying to guess the format you are using, and in this case it uses <code>dd-mm-yyyy</code>. That means that what you think is 10th of November will be read by Ruby as 11th of October (which is even worse than an exception while getting 25th month).</p>

<p>Best solution - do not use parse. You already know the values, why give a parser opportunity to make a mistake?</p>

<pre><code>Date.new *params[:end_date].values_at(:year, :month, :day).map(&amp;:to_i)
</code></pre>

<p>Note: You will still need to wrap the code above in <code>begin rescue</code> as your users can (and will) pick dates like 31 of Feb.</p>
