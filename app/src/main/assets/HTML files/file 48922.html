<p>This shows the treatment of an IN variable, not an out, as I was a little confused by the OUT part of what you are saying. Meaning, have an IN for an IN. If you need an OUT, give that separately. In my mind.</p>

<p>If you need to use other parameters inside your prepared statement, see the reference <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-syntax-prepared-statements.html" rel="nofollow">SQL Syntax for Prepared Statements</a> halfway down that page around the area <code>EXECUTE stmt2 USING @a, @b;</code>.</p>

<p>So to be clear, parameters like <code>@a</code> above are great for normal parameters one would like plugged into prepared statements (like in PHP or JAVA). The trick with yours is that lists <strong>don't</strong> work well in that fashion, and <strong>require</strong> the prepared statement string to be constructed with <code>concat</code>. One can mix and match the two. Meaning you can put one together that requires a <code>concat</code> in the part that is required, as well as execute it <code>USING</code> ... with the variables that don't require <code>concat</code>.</p>

<p>But here is yours.</p>

<h2>Schema</h2>

<pre><code>create table thingsCoveted
(   id int auto_increment primary key,
    thing varchar(100) not null
);
insert thingsCoveted(thing) values ('Fritos'),('crackers'),('gold');
</code></pre>

<h2>Stored Proc</h2>

<pre><code>drop procedure if exists sp_name1;
DELIMITER $$
CREATE procedure sp_name1 (
IN theList varchar(100) -- comes in like '1,3', need to strip off single quotes
)
BEGIN
    -- declare preparedSql varchar(100);
    declare theSize int;
    set theSize=length(theList);
    set @preparedSql=concat("select * from thingsCoveted where id in (",substring(theList,2,theSize-2),")");
    -- select @preparedSql; -- left here for debug view if you un-rem it
    PREPARE stmt FROM @preparedSql;
    execute stmt;

END $$
DELIMITER ;
</code></pre>

<h2>Test It</h2>

<pre><code>set @var1="'1,3'"; 
call sp_name1(@var1);
+----+--------+
| id | thing  |
+----+--------+
|  1 | Fritos |
|  3 | gold   |
+----+--------+
</code></pre>
