<p>Figured it out.</p>

<p>Basically when creating the annotations, I store them in different arrays (for each type).</p>

<pre><code>//Store Annotation in Array
    [type1Array addObject:annotation];
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when my button is pressed to filter them, I use the following:</p>

<pre><code>    [_mapView removeAnnotations:type1Array];
    [_mapView addAnnotations:type2Array];
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work fine and doesnt cause problems with duplicating annotations. I used an NSLog to output the _mapView.annotations.count to verify that the annotations were duplicating.</p>

<p>Hope this helps others!</p>
