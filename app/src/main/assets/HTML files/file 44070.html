<p>Make sure that you deploy the program correctly copy the needed .dlls from bin folder from Qt Folder and copy all folders with all the files(.dlls) from plugins folder</p>

<p>My paths to folders for example:</p>

<p>C:\Qt\Qt5.4.0\5.4\msvc2012_opengl\bin  (copy needed needed dlls from bin)</p>

<p>C:\Qt\Qt5.4.0\5.4\msvc2012_opengl\plugins (copy everything from plugins)</p>

<p>After you paste the files run you program and try to delete all the files the unnecessary files will be deleted.</p>
