<p>Your code snippet doesn't specify where <code>outputCount</code> comes from, but it looks like that's probably the problem. If your view has, say, 4 subviews and you attempt to reference <code>objectAtIndex:4</code> you will get a null. Perhaps your code should say <code>[view.subviews objectAtIndex:[outputCount - 1]]</code> instead. Again, it's not clear where <code>outputCount</code> comes from in your code.</p>
