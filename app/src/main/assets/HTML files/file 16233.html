<p>In conclusion:  </p>

<p>This particular error means there is something wrong in the xaml and neither Visual Studio nor Expression Blend can/will give the source of the error and debugging won't help. It is very likely to do with a binding issue. Anyone with this same error would do well to thoroughly check the xaml code.</p>

<p>My problem was compounded by the fact that my default browser (SRWare Iron) was caching the 'website' and would only show an initial version of the application so any changes I made were not updating in what I saw (thus the error would continue to show no matter what I changed in the code). As you can imagine <strong>very</strong> frustrating! I didn't realise this until I changed the xaml to show a visual difference and the changes weren't shown. - Interestingly this only happened in VS, Expression Blend would load the newest version correctly.</p>

<p>I made IE the default browser <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/79965/1372191">(link to method)</a> so the second issue is no longer a problem and the error has magically disappeared (because I fixed the code a long time ago).</p>

<p>I hope this helps anyone who may have either the first or second problem. - While scouring the web I did find a few others who had the browser problem and no-one knew anything about it, so I hope this solves it.</p>
