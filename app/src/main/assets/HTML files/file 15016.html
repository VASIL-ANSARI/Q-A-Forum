  <p>Where is the error in my code?</p>

<p>(You are launching the <code>javaw</code> executable, so that is not the problem.  It is also not that your entry point method's signature is incorrect, because that would have given a different diagnostic.)</p>

<p>The problem is either that the class name is incorrect (e.g. if should be "come.pkg.Program"), or the pathname for the JAR file is incorrect.</p>

<hr>

<p>Assuming that you have eliminated the possibility that the class name is incorrect, my guess is that you are trying to use a relative pathname for the JAR file, but there is some confusion over what the current directory is; i.e. the directory in which the pathname needs to be resolved.  Try using an absolute pathname in the classpath parameter.</p>
