<p>I once had a function on a page of mine which would load a specific page using an <code>ajax-request</code> and <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php" rel="nofollow">php-curl</a> functions and then would just dump all the contents in a dynamically created <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (Although I agree that the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is a better choice for this). But at that time I could not really adjust its size which made it kind of clumsy.</p>
