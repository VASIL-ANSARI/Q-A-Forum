<p>I think most of the problem lies in your assumption that if there is a character available in the stream (which you check with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader.readline.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>StreamReader.Peek()</code></a>) then you currently have a full line of content available as well.  There's no guarantee of this (you may have only received "Hello wo" of the data "Hello world\n"), so a call to <code>ReadLine()</code> would block until a <code>'\n'</code> is received.</p>

<p>However, I'm not sure why it's waiting 20 seconds each time before returning.  The default <code>ReadTimeout</code> for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream.aspx" rel="nofollow">NetworkStream</a> is <code>Timeout.Infinite</code>.  Are you sure the connection is not being terminated by the server?  It may be configured to wait for around 20 seconds of "silence" before closing the connection (fairly common).</p>

<p>As an aside, you also may want to change your condition to <code>while (connectionRead.Peek() &gt; -1)</code>. <code>Peek()</code> returns a character integer, and 0 is a valid value (<code>'\0'</code>).</p>
