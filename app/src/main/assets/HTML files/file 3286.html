<p><a href="http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.array-search.php" rel="nofollow"><code>array_search()</code></a> â <em>Searches the array for a given value and returns the corresponding key if successful</em></p>

<p>You have to be a bit more specific about whether you want to search for a substring or an exact value, e.g. you want to search for <em>"Server: Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat)"</em> or just anything with the substring <em>"Server"</em> in it. In the latter case, go with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2236720/php-how-do-i-search-in-an-unindexed-array/2236735#2236735">Gumbo's solution</a>, as <code>array_search</code> cannot be used for substring searches.</p>
