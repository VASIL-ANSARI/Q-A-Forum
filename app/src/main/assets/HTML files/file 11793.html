<p>The  thread will already run after calling <code>CreateThread</code>.</p>

<p><code>WaitForSingleObject</code> is not necessary (unless you really want to wait for the thread to finish); but it will not "force-quit" the thread; in fact, force-quitting - even if it might be possible - is never such a good idea; you might e.g. leave resources opened or otherwise leave your application in a state which is no good.</p>
