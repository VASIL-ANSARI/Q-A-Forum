<p>Two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>did you make pipe[0] non-blocking?  It'll be something like <code>int nbio=1; ioctl(pipe[0], FIONBIO, &nbio);</code>
<li>you're checking for error wrong.
</ol>

<pre><code>if(nbytes &gt; 0) {
    /* you may need to null-terminate the input buffer prior to display */
    buffer[nbytes] = '\0';
    printf("%s", buffer);
}
else if(errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {
    printf("I am not blocked here\n");
    sleep(1);
}
else {
    printf("some other error occurred - if nbytes == 0, then it's EOF.\n");
}
</code></pre>

<p>probably errno is EWOULDBLOCK the first time through, and then doesn't get updated on successful read, so it looks like EWOULDBLOCK again.</p>
